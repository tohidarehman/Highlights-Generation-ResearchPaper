 A classical result in algebraic specification states that a total function defined on an initial algebra is a homomorphism if and only if the kernel of that function is a congruence. We expand on the discussion of that result from an earlier paper: extending it from total to partial functions, simplifying the proofs using relational calculus, and generalising the setting to regular categories.
