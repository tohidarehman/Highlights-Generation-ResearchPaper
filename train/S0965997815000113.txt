 This paper proposes a novel nature-inspired algorithm called Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO). The ALO algorithm mimics the hunting mechanism of antlions in nature. Five main steps of hunting prey such as the random walk of ants, building traps, entrapment of ants in traps, catching preys, and re-building traps are implemented. The proposed algorithm is benchmarked in three phases. Firstly, a set of 19 mathematical functions is employed to test different characteristics of ALO. Secondly, three classical engineering problems (three-bar truss design, cantilever beam design, and gear train design) are solved by ALO. Finally, the shapes of two ship propellers are optimized by ALO as challenging constrained real problems. In the first two test phases, the ALO algorithm is compared with a variety of algorithms in the literature. The results of the test functions prove that the proposed algorithm is able to provide very competitive results in terms of improved exploration, local optima avoidance, exploitation, and convergence. The ALO algorithm also finds superior optimal designs for the majority of classical engineering problems employed, showing that this algorithm has merits in solving constrained problems with diverse search spaces. The optimal shapes obtained for the ship propellers demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm in solving real problems with unknown search spaces as well. Note that the source codes of the proposed ALO algorithm are publicly available at .
