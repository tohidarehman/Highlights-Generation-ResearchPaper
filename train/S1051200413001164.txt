 In this paper, the interaction and combination of Fuzzy Fading Memory (FFM) technique and Augmented Kalman Filtering (AUKF) method are presented for the state estimation of non-linear dynamic systems in presence of maneuver. It is shown that the AUKF method in conjunction with the FFM technique (FFM-AUKF) can estimate the target states appropriately since the FFM tunes the covariance matrix of the AUKF method in presence of unknown target accelerations by using a fuzzy system. In addition, the benefits of both FFM technique and AUKF method are employed in the scheme of well-known Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm. The proposed Fuzzy IMM (FIMM) algorithm does not need the predefinition and adjustment of sub-filters with respect to the target maneuver and reduces the number of required sub-filters to cover the wide range of unknown target accelerations. The Monte Carlo simulation analysis shows the effectiveness of the above-mentioned methods in maneuvering target tracking.
