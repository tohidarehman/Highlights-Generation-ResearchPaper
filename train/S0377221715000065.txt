 Despite the fact that the Capacitated Arc Routing Problems (CARPs) received substantial attention in the literature, most of the research concentrates on the symmetric and single-depot version of the problem. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing an approach to solving a more general version of the problem and analysing its properties. We present an MILP formulation that accommodates asymmetric multi-depot case and consider valid inequalities that may be used to tighten its LP relaxation. A symmetry breaking scheme for a single-depot case is also proposed. An extensive numerical study is carried to investigate the properties of the problem and the proposed solution approach.
