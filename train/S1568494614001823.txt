 In this paper a review of type-2 fuzzy logic applications in pattern recognition, classification and clustering problems is presented. Recently, type-2 fuzzy logic has gained popularity in a wide range of applications due to its ability to handle higher degrees of uncertainty. In particular, there have been recent applications of type-2 fuzzy logic in the fields of pattern recognition, classification and clustering, where it has helped improving results over type-1 fuzzy logic. In this paper a concise and representative review of the most successful applications of type-2 fuzzy logic in these fields is presented. At the moment, most of the applications in this review use interval type-2 fuzzy logic, which is easier to handle and less computational expensive than generalized type-2 fuzzy logic.
