 Three kinds of lanthanide phosphors (La Lu1 F3: Eu3+, LaF3–CaF2:Eu3+ and LaF3: Eu3+) have been successfully synthesized based on three different ways such as molten salts, co-precipitation, supersonic and microwave irradiations. The as-prepared powder materials all exhibited red luminescence. Their crystal structures or morphologies were studied by means of X-ray powder diffraction and scanning electronic microscope. Eu3+-doped LaF3–CaF2 phosphor can be emissive under excitation at longer wavelengths (466 and 533nm) excitations. Supersonic and microwave irradiations have shortened the reaction time of LaF3: Eu3+ crystals in 40min under very low temperature (50°C).
