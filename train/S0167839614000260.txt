 a generalization of Bernstein polynomials and Bézier curves based on umbral calculus has been introduced. In the present paper we describe new geometric and algorithmic properties of this generalization including: , i.e., families that include both Bernstein and Lagrange polynomial, are generalized in a new way,  a generalized de Casteljau algorithm is discussed,  an efficient evaluation of generalized Bézier curves through a linear transformation of the control polygon is described,  a simple criterion for endpoint tangentiality is established.
