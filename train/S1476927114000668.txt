 Rotavirus, the major cause of infantile nonbacterial diarrhea, was found to be associated with development of diabetes-associated auto-antibodies. In our study we tried to find out further potential autoimmune threats of this virus using bioinformatics approach. We took rotaviral proteins to study similarity with Homo sapiens proteome and found most conserved structural protein VP6 matches at two regions with ryanodine receptor, an autoimmune target associated with myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis, a chronic neurodegenerative autoimmune disorder with no typical known reason, is characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness which is typically enhanced during muscular effort. Affected patients generate auto antibodies against mainly acetyl choline receptor and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-release channel protein ryanodine receptor. Further, we observed that two regions which matched with ryanodine receptor remain conserved in all circulating rotaviral strains and showed significant antigenecity with respect to myasthenia gravis associated HLA haplotypes. Overall, our study detected rotaviral VP6 as a potential threat for myasthenia gravis and enlighten an area of virus associated autoimmune research.

@highlight Rotaviral outer capsid protein VP6 shares two eight amino acid regions with ryanodine receptor 2, a target in myasthenia gravis, a neurodegenerative disorder.
@highlight These two regions remain conserved among most circulating rotavirus strains isolated from all over the world.
@highlight These regions are potential B cell with considerable relative surface availability and antigenecity.
@highlight These regions are potential T cell epitope with respect to HLA subtypes associated with myasthenia gravis.
