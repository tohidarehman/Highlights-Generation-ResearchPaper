 In this paper a new nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the optimal power flow problem in a power system. This algorithm is inspired by the black hole phenomenon. A black hole is a region of space-time whose gravitational field is so strong that nothing which enters it, not even light, can escape. The developed approach is called black-hole-based optimization approach. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, it has been demonstrated on the standard IEEE 30-bus test system for different objectives. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the scalability and suitability of the proposed approach for large-scale and real power systems, it has been tested on the real Algerian 59-bus power system network. The results obtained are compared with those of other methods reported in the literature. Considering the simplicity of the proposed approach and the quality of the obtained results, this approach seems to be a promising alternative for solving optimal power flow problems.

@highlight We solved the optimal power flow for different cases and different test systems.
@highlight We used a new approach which is the black-hole-based optimization approach (BHBO).
@highlight The efficiency of the BHBO has been proven by carrying out a comparative and statistical studies.
@highlight BHBO is conceptually very simple, further unlike other optimization techniques BHBO parameter-less optimization technique.
