 This paper introduces an adaptive visual tracking method that combines the adaptive appearance model and the optimization capability of the Markov decision process. Most tracking algorithms are limited due to variations in object appearance from changes in illumination, viewing angle, object scale, and object shape. This paper is motivated by the fact that tracking performance degradation is caused not only by changes in object appearance but also by the inflexible controls of tracker parameters. To the best of our knowledge, optimization of tracker parameters has not been thoroughly investigated, even though it critically influences tracking performance. The challenge is to equip an adaptive tracking algorithm with an optimization capability for a more flexible and robust appearance model. In this paper, the Markov decision process, which has been applied successfully in many dynamic systems, is employed to optimize an adaptive appearance model-based tracking algorithm. The adaptive visual tracking is formulated as a Markov decision process based dynamic parameter optimization problem with uncertain and incomplete information. The high computation requirements of the Markov decision process formulation are solved by the proposed prioritized Q-learning approach. We carried out extensive experiments using realistic video sets, and achieved very encouraging and competitive results.
