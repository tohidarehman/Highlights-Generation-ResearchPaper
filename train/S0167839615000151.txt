 Ck (geometrically continuous surface) constructions were developed to create surfaces that are smooth also at irregular points where, in a quad-mesh, three or more than four elements come together. Isogeometricâ€…elements were developed to unify the representation of geometry and of engineering analysis. We show how matched constructions for geometry and analysis automatically yield isogeometric elements. This provides a formal framework for the existing and any future isogeometric elements based on geometric continuity.

@highlight A construction principle for engineering analysis elements is formally verified.
@highlight The principle yields isogeometric
@highlight elements from
@highlight -manifold constructions.
@highlight The manifold representations can have irregular (extraordinary, star)points.
@highlight The principle applies in any number of variables and any number of range dimensions.
@highlight As a consequence,
@highlight -constructions can directly be used to solve PDEs on manifolds
