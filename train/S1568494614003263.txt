 Present paper proposes a new technique based on double parametric form of fuzzy numbers to solve an uncertain beam equation using Adomian decomposition method subject to unit step and impulse loads. Uncertainties appear in the initial conditions are considered in terms of triangular convex normalized fuzzy sets. Using the single parametric form viz. Î±-cut form of fuzzy numbers, the fuzzy beam equation is converted first to an interval based fuzzy differential equation. Next this differential equation is transformed to crisp form by applying double parametric form of fuzzy numbers. Finally the same is solved by Adomian decomposition method symbolically to obtain the uncertain bounds of the dynamic response. Obtained results are depicted in term of plots to show the efficiency and powerfulness of the present analysis.
