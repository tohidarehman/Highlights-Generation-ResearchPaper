 A fundamental challenge in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Databases consists of developing methods to automatically manage Knowledge Bases which can serve as a knowledge source for computer systems trying to replicate the decision-making ability of human experts. Despite of most of the tasks involved in the building, exploitation and maintenance of KBs are far from being trivial, and significant progress has been made during the last years. However, there are still a number of challenges that remain open. In fact, there are some issues to be addressed in order to empirically prove the technology for systems of this kind to be mature and reliable.

@highlight We present the state-of-the-art concerning knowledge base management systems.
@highlight We review the open problems that remain open in this field.
@highlight We identify the future research challenges for automatically building, exploiting and maintaining knowledge base management systems.
