 The objective of this paper is to develop five hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, including three hybrid ant colony optimization (hACO) variants, and compare their performances in two related applications: unrelated parallel machine scheduling and inbound truck sequencing in a multi-door cross docking system in consideration of sequence dependent setup, and both zero and nonzero release time. The three hACO variants were modified and adapted from the existing literature and they differ mainly in how a solution is coded and decoded, how a pheromone matrix is represented, and the local search methods employed. The other two hybrids are newly constructed hybrid simulated annealing (hSA) algorithms, which are built based on the authorsâ€™ knowledge and experience. The evaluation criteria are computational time and the objective function value, i.e., makespan. Based on the results of computational experiments the simulated annealing-tabu search hybrid turns out to be the best if maximal CPU time is used as the stopping criterion and the 2-stage hACO variant is the best if maximal number of evaluations is the stopping criterion. The contributions of this paper are: (i) being the first to carry out a comparative study of hybrid metaheuristics for the two selected applications, (ii) being the first to consider nonzero truck arrival time in multi-door cross docking operations, (iii) identifying which hACO variant is the best among the three, and (iv) investigating the effect of release time on the makespan.
