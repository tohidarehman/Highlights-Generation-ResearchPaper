 A generic planar quadrilateral defines a 2:1 bilinear map. We show that by assigning an appropriate weight to one vertex of any planar quadrilateral, we can create a map whose inverse is rational linear.

@highlight We show how to make a quad map be birational by assigning one control point weight.
@highlight The weight is computed using a simple closed-form equation.
@highlight For convex quads, the weight is positive and the pre-image is the
@highlight domain.
@highlight Any planar quad mesh can be made piecewise
@highlight birational by using this method.
