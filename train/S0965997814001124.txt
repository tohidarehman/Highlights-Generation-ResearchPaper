 This study presents a new Data-Enabled Design Model for high-rise buildings driven by pressure datasets, DEDM-HRP, which seamlessly combines synchronous pressure measurement databases with a rigorous computational framework to offer convenient estimation of wind load effects on high-rise buildings for their preliminary design. To respond to the need for practical applications, DEDM-HRP employs a web-based on-the-fly framework designed with user-friendly/intuitive web interfaces for the assessment of wind-induced responses as well as equivalent static wind loads in the three principal response directions, for any incident wind angle of interest, with minimum added complications or requirements of knowledge of comprehensive background theories for its use.
