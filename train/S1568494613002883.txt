 This paper presents the optimal path of nonholonomic multi robots with coherent formation in a leader–follower structure in the presence of obstacles using Asexual Reproduction Optimization (ARO). The robots path planning based on potential field method are accomplished and a novel formation controller for mobile robots based on potential field method is proposed. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified through simulation and experimental studies by applying them to control the formation of four e-Pucks robots (low-cost mobile robot platform). Also the proposed method is compared with Simulated Annealing, Improved Harmony Search and Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm methods and the experimental results, higher performance and fast convergence time to the best solution of the ARO demonstrated that this optimization method is appropriate for real time control application.

@highlight We consider path planning in leader–follower formation with the obstacle avoidance using the potential field method.
@highlight We compare the performances of 4 methods by simulations and real experiment on e-Puck robots.
@highlight Experimental results, higher performance and fast convergence time to the best solution of the ARO demonstrate that this method is more appropriate for real time control application.
