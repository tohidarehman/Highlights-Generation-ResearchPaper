 Zhu et al.  proposed dual hesitant fuzzy set as an extension of hesitant fuzzy sets which encompass fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets, hesitant fuzzy sets, and fuzzy multisets as a special case. Dual hesitant fuzzy sets consist of two parts, that is, the membership and nonmembership degrees, which are represented by two sets of possible values. Therefore, in accordance with the practical demand these sets are more flexible, and provides much more information about the situation. In this paper, the axiom definition of a similarity measure between dual hesitant fuzzy sets is introduced. A new similarity measure considering membership and nonmembership degrees of dual hesitant fuzzy sets has been presented and also it is shown that the corresponding distance measures can be obtained from the proposed similarity measures. To check the effectiveness, the proposed similarity measure is applied in a bidirectional approximate reasoning systems. Mathematical formulation of dual hesitant fuzzy assignment problem with restrictions is presented. Two algorithms based on the proposed similarity measure, are developed to finds the optimal solution of dual hesitant fuzzy assignment problem with restrictions. Finally, the proposed method is illustrated by numerical examples.
