 Context-awareness enables the personalization of computer systems according to the users' needs and their particular situation at a given time. The personalization capabilities are usually implemented by programmers due to the complex processes that are involved. However, an important trend in software development is that more and more software systems are being implemented not only by programmers but also by people with expertise in other domains. Since most of the existing context-aware development toolkits are designed for programmers, non-technical users cannot develop these kinds of systems. The design of tools to create context-aware systems by users that do not have programming skills but are experts in the domain where the system is going to be deployed, will contribute to speed up the adoption of these kinds of services by the society. This paper presents a cloud-based platform to ease the development of context-aware mobile applications by people without programming skills. The platform has been designed to be used in a tourism domain. This way, tourism experts can send tourist information to mobile users according to their context data (indoor/outdoor location, language, and date and time range). An energy-efficient mobile app has been developed in order to obtain context data from the user's device and to receive personalized information in real time based on these data. The architecture and implementation details of the system are presented and the evaluation of the platform by tourism domain experts is discussed.

@highlight We implement a cloud-based platform to obtain and manage context data
@highlight The platform is designed for people with no programming skills in order to develop context-aware mobile apps
@highlight The reasoning process of the platform has been optimized using the “conditions as facts” rule pattern
@highlight The context data gathering process has been optimized using an algorithm that detects the activity of the user
