 We consider the online Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem. In this problem, we are given an edge-weighted graph G = (V, E) and a subset DâŠ†V of destination vertices, with the optimization goal to find a minimum weight closed tour that traverses every destination vertex of D at least once. During the traversal, the salesman could encounter at most k non-recoverable blocked edges. The edge blockages are real-time, meaning that the salesman knows about a blocked edge whenever it occurs. We first show a lower bound on the competitive ratio and present an online optimal algorithm for the problem. While this optimal algorithm has non-polynomial running time, we present another online polynomial-time near optimal algorithm for the problem. Experimental results show that our online polynomial-time algorithm produces solutions very close to the offline optimal solutions.

@highlight The Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem with as many as k online edge blockages is considered.
@highlight First a lower bound on the competitive ratio is shown; then an exponential-time online optimal algorithm for the problem is presented; and lastly a polynomial-time online asymptotically optimal algorithm is presented.
@highlight Experimental results show that the polynomial-time online algorithm takes only a fraction of the running time of the offline optimal algorithm, yet produces solutions of competitive quality to the offline optimal solutions.
