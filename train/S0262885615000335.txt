 Recent research trends in Content-based Video Retrieval have shown topic models as an effective tool to deal with the semantic gap challenge. In this scenario, this paper has a dual target:  it is aimed at studying how the use of different topic models (pLSA, LDA and FSTM) affects video retrieval performance;  a novel incremental topic model (IpLSA) is presented in order to cope with incremental scenarios in an effective and efficient way. A comprehensive comparison among these four topic models using two different retrieval systems and two reference benchmarking video databases is provided. Experiments revealed that pLSA is the best model in sparse conditions, LDA tend to outperform the rest of the models in a dense space and IpLSA is able to work properly in both cases.
