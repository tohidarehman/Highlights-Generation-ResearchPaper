 Meca et al.  studied a class of inventory games which arise when a group of retailers who observe demand for a common item decide to cooperate and make joint orders with the EOQ policy. In this paper, we extend their model to the situation where retailerâ€™s delay in payments is permitted by the supplier. We introduce the corresponding inventory game with permissible delay in payments, and prove that its core is nonempty. Then, a core allocation rule is proposed which can be reached through population monotonic allocation scheme. Under this allocation rule, the grand coalition is shown to be stable from a farsighted point of view.
