 In this paper, we deal with the generation of bundles of loads to be submitted by carriers participating in combinatorial auctions in the context of long-haul full truckload transportation services. We develop a probabilistic optimization model that integrates the bid generation and pricing problems together with the routing of the carrierâ€™s fleet. We propose two heuristic procedures that enable us to solve models with up to 400 auctioned loads.

@highlight Consideration of the bundle price as a decision variable.
@highlight Inclusion into the model of a set of probabilistic constraints.
@highlight Inclusion of the dynamic aspect of the truck routing by solving a fleet management problem.
@highlight The study of novel techniques for computing the synergies between each pair of loads.
