 Gene regulatory networks inference is currently a topic under heavy research in the systems biology field. In this paper, gene regulatory networks are inferred via evolutionary model based on time-series microarray data. A non-linear differential equation model is adopted. Gene expression programming (GEP) is applied to identify the structure of the model and least mean square (LMS) is used to optimize the parameters in ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The proposed work has been first verified by synthetic data with noise-free and noisy time-series data, respectively, and then its effectiveness is confirmed by three real time-series expression datasets. Finally, a gene regulatory network was constructed with 12 Yeast genes. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can improve the prediction accuracy of microarray time-series data effectively.

@highlight Gene expression programing is an effective method to evolve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) model from observed time-series data.
@highlight We propose a least mean square method to optimize parameters of ODEs model.
@highlight The partitioning is used to decrease the complexity of the genetic network inference problem, in the process of identification of structure of system.
