 This study examined the effects of display method, text display rate, and observation angle on comprehension performance and subjective preferences for Chinese characters presented on an LED display. The factors and levels studied were as follows: four text display methods (rapid serial visual presentation ‘RSVP’, leading, paged view scrolling, and continuous scrolling), three text display rates (160 characters per min ‘cpm’, 240cpm, and 320cpm), and seven observation angles (−75°, −60°, −30°, 0°, 30°, 60°, and 75°). The results indicated that a display rate of 160cpm was in general superior to 240 and 320cpm for comprehension scores and subjective evaluations. The effects of display method and observation angle were found to be non significant. However, there was a significant interaction between display method and display rate. The results of this study were used to make ergonomics recommendations applicable to LED displays for determining optimum dynamic text display methods for Chinese characters.

@highlight We investigated the optimum dynamic text display methods for delivering Chinese messages on an LED display.
@highlight The optimal display rate is 160cpm whereas speeds at 320cpm or above are not recommended.
@highlight Leading display method should be used when the display rate at 320cpm or above is necessary.
