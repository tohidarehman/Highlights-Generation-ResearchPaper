 The paper presents part of a study on collective knowledge and innovations in IT as well as an extract segment from a comparative statistical analysis of trends in the globalâ€“local standardisation of the pathways of knowledge and IT innovations in IT applications. The aim of the paper is to provide and promote educational and financial resources for the quality of knowledge in IT application. ISO (global) and SRPS (local) documents on IT and IT applications have been extracted from this statistical sample and analysed. The main results of the research are presented with phases of the PDCA methodology
