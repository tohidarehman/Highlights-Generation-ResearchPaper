 In this paper, an overview of human–robot interactive communication is presented, covering verbal as well as non-verbal aspects. Following a historical introduction, and motivation towards fluid human–robot communication, ten desiderata are proposed, which provide an organizational axis both of recent as well as of future research on human–robot communication. Then, the ten desiderata are examined in detail, culminating in a unifying discussion, and a forward-looking conclusion.
