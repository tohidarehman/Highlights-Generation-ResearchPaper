 Site selection is an important issue in municipal solid waste (MSW) management. Selection of the appropriate solid waste site is an extensive evaluation process that requires consideration of multiple alternative solutions and evaluation criteria. In reality, it is easier for decision makers to express their judgments on the alternatives by using linguistic terms, and there usually exists uncertain and incomplete assessment information. Moreover, decision makers may have different risk attitudes in the siting process because of their different backgrounds and personalities. Therefore, an attitudinal-based interval 2-tuple linguistic VIKOR (ITL-VIKOR) method is proposed in this paper to select the best disposal site for MSW. The feasibility and practicability of the proposed method are further demonstrated through an example of refuse-derived fuel (RDF) combustion plant location. Results show that the new approach is more suitable and effective to handle the MSW site selection problems by considering the decision maker's attitudinal character and incorporating the uncertain and incomplete assessment information.

@highlight This study presents a new method for MSW site selection.
@highlight Interval 2-tuples are used to model decision makersâ€™ uncertain assessments.
@highlight A modified VIKOR method is applied to rank the alternative sites.
@highlight Risk attitudes of decision makers are considered in the siting process.
@highlight The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using a real example.
