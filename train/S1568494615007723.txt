 Software reliability growth model (SRGM) with testing-effort function (TEF) is very helpful for software developers and has been widely accepted and applied. However, each SRGM with TEF (SRGMTEF) contains some undetermined parameters. Optimization of these parameters is a necessary task. Generally, these parameters are estimated by the Least Square Estimation (LSE) or the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). We found that the MLE can be used only when the software failure data to satisfy some assumptions such as to satisfy a certain distribution. However, the software failure data may not satisfy such a distribution. In this paper, we investigate the improvement and application of a swarm intelligent optimization algorithm, namely quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, to optimize these parameters of SRGMTEF. The performance of the proposed SRGMTEF model with optimized parameters is also compared with other existing models. The experiment results show that the proposed parameter optimization approach using QPSO is very effective and flexible, and the better software reliability growth performance can be obtained based on SRGMTEF on the different software failure datasets.

@highlight The proposed approach does not require any assumption for software failure data.
@highlight Implementation of the proposed approach is very easy.
@highlight The proposed SRGMTEF has a reasonable predictive capability.
