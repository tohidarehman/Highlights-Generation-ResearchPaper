 This paper develops a new method for group decision making and introduces a linguistic continuous ordered weighted distance (LCOWD) measure. It is a new distance measure that combines the linguistic continuous ordered weighted averaging (LCOWA) operator with the ordered weighted distance (OWD) measure considering the risk attitude of decision maker. Moreover, it also can relieve the influence of extremely large or extremely small deviations on the aggregation results by assigning them smaller weights. These advantages make it suitable to deal with the situations where the input arguments are represented with uncertain linguistic information. Some of the main properties of the LCOWD measure and different particular cases are studied. The applicability of the new approach is also analyzed focusing on a group decision making problem.
