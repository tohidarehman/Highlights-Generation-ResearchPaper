 Recently collaborative tagging, also known as “folksonomy” in Web 2.0, allows users to collaboratively create and manage tags to classify and categorize dynamic content for searching and sharing. A user’s interest in social resources usually changes with time in such a dynamic and information rich environment. Additionally, a social network is one innovative characteristic in social resource sharing websites. The information from a social network provides an inference of a certain user’s interests based on the interests of this user’s network neighbors. To handle the problem of personalized interests changing gradually with time, and to utilize the benefit of the social network, this study models a personalized user interest, incorporating frequency, recency, and duration of tag-based information, and performs collaborative recommendations using the user’s social network in social resource sharing websites. The proposed method includes finding neighbors from the “social friends” network by using collaborative filtering and recommending similar resource items to the users by using content-based filtering. This study examines the proposed system’s performance using an experimental dataset collected from a social bookmarking website. The experimental results show that the hybridization of user’s preferences with frequency, recency, and duration plays an important role, and provides better performances than traditional collaborative recommendation systems. The experimental results also reveal that the friend network information can successfully collaborate, thus improving the collaborative recommendation process.

@highlight Tag frequency, recency, and duration were combined to model the personalized preference.
@highlight The social network was utilized to find similar users in the collaborative filtering.
@highlight The incorporated system was applied to the social resource sharing systems.
