 Toric surface patches are a multi-sided generalization of classical rational BÃ©zier surface patches which are widely used in free-form surface modeling. In this paper, we present the first derivatives of toric surface patches along the boundary and study the continuity between adjacent toric surface patches by the toric degenerations. Furthermore, some practical sufficient conditions of toric surface patches are developed and the representative examples are given.
