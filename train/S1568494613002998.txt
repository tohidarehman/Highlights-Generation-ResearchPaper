 The assessment of fetal wellbeing depends heavily on variations in fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns. The variations in FHR patterns are very complex in nature thus its reliable interpretation is very difficult and often leads to erroneous diagnosis. We propose a new method for evaluation of fetal health status based on interval type-2 fuzzy logic through fetal phonocardiography (fPCG). Type-2 fuzzy logic is a powerful tool in handling uncertainties due to extraneous variations in FHR patterns through its increased fuzziness of relations. Four FHR parameters are extracted from each fPCG signal for diagnostic decision making. The membership functions of these four inputs and one output are chosen as a range of values so as to represent the level of uncertainty. The fuzzy rules are constructed based on standard clinical guidelines on FHR parameters. Experimental clinical tests have shown very good performance of the developed system in comparison with the FHR trace simultaneously recorded through standard fetal monitor. Statistical evaluation of the developed system shows 92% accuracy. With the proposed method we hope that, long-term and continuous antenatal care will become easy, cost effective, reliable and efficient.
