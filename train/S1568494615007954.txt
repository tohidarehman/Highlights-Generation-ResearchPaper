 This paper discusses the issues related to the process of global decision-making on the basis of knowledge which is stored in several local knowledge bases. The approach considered in this paper is very general because we do not assume any additional conditions on the sets of objects or the sets of conditional attributes of local knowledge bases. The paper proposes a new approach to the organization of the structure of multi-agent decision-making system, which operates on the basis of dispersed knowledge. In the presented system, the local knowledge bases will be combined into groups in a dynamic way. We will seek to designate groups of local bases on which the test object is classified to the decision classes in a similar manner. Then, a process of the elimination inconsistencies in the knowledge will be implemented in the created groups. Global decisions will be made by using one of the methods for analysis of conflicts. The paper includes the definition of a multi-agent decision-making system with dynamically generated clusters and a description of a global decision-making process. In addition, the paper presents the results of experiments carried out on data from the UCI repository.
