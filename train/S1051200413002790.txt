 The problem of reconstructing a known high-resolution signal from a set of its low-resolution parts exposed to additive white Gaussian noise is addressed in this paper from the perspective of statistical multirate signal processing. To enhance the performance of the existing high-resolution signal reconstruction procedure that is based on using a set of linear periodically time-varying (LPTV) Wiener filter structures, we propose two empirical methods combining empirical mode decomposition- and least squares support vector machine regression-based noise reduction schemes with these filter structures. The methods originate from the idea of reducing the effects of white Gaussian noise present in the low-resolution observations before applying them directly to the LPTV Wiener filters. Performances of the proposed methods are evaluated over one-dimensional simulated signals and two-dimensional images. Simulation results show that, under certain conditions, considerable improvements have been achieved by the proposed methods when compared with the previous study that only uses a set of LPTV Wiener filter structures for the signal reconstruction process.
