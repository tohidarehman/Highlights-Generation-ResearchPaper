 This paper introduces a synergic predator-prey optimization (SPPO) algorithm to solve economic load dispatch (ELD) problem for thermal units with practical aspects. The basic PPO model comprises prey and predator as essential components. SPPO uses collaborative decision for movement and direction of prey and maintains diversity in the swarm due to fear factor of predator, which acts as the baffled state of preys’ mind. In the SPPO, the decision making of prey is bifurcated into corroborative and impeded parts. It comprises four behaviors namely inertial, cognitive, collective swarm intelligence, and prey's individual and neighborhood concern of predator. The prey particle memorizes its best and not-best positions as experiences. In this research work, to improve the quality of prey swarm, which influence convergence rate, opposition based initialization is used. To verify robustness of proposed algorithm general benchmark problems and small, medium, and large power generation test power system are simulated. These test systems have non-linear behavior due to multi-fuel options and practical constraints. The constraints of prohibited operating zone and ramp rate limits of power generators’ are handled using heuristics. Newton–Raphson procedure is exploited to attain the transmission losses using load flow analysis. The outcomes of SPPO are compared with the results described in literature and are found satisfactory.
