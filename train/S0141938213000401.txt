 The materials science and engineering related to the fabrication of conducting polymer thin films and the progress in the development of devices integrated with organic transparent electrodes based on conducting polymers for display applications are reviewed. Transparent electrodes are essential components for many display modules. With the evolution of display technologies, conducting polymers are recently emerging as important alternative materials for the fabrication of transparent electrodes. Conducting polymers offer some advantages, such as light weight, low cost, mechanical flexibility and excellent compatibility with plastic substrates for the development of next-generation display technologies and, in particular, are expected to play an important role in the development of flexible display technologies.
