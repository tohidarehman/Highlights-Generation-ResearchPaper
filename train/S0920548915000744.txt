 In this paper, a routing protocol for k-anycast communication based upon the anycast tree scheme is proposed for wireless sensor networks. Multiple-metrics are utilized for instructing the route discovery. A source initiates to create a spanning tree reaching any one sink with source node as the root. Subsequently, we introduce three schemes for k-anycast: a packet is transmitted to exact k sinks, at least k sinks, and at most k sinks, where, a packet can be transmitted to k or more than k sinks benefiting from broadcast technique without wasting the source energy for replicating it.

@highlight k-anycast communication technique is utilized for enhancing transmission reliability, load-balancing and security purpose by collecting multiple copies of a packet from a source and verifying the information of monitoring field. In r-WSNs, due to energy replenished continually and limited energy storage capacity, a sensor cannot be always beneficial to conserve energy when a network can harvest excessive energy from the environment. Therefore, the surplus energy of sensor can be used for strengthening data transmission.
