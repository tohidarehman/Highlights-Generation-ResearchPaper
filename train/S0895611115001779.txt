 Intensity inhomogeneity (bias field) is a common artefact in magnetic resonance (MR) images, which hinders successful automatic segmentation. In this work, a novel algorithm for simultaneous segmentation and bias field correction is presented. The proposed energy functional allows for explicit regularization of the bias field term, making the model more flexible, which is crucial in presence of strong inhomogeneities. An efficient minimization procedure, attempting to find the global minimum, is applied to the energy functional. The algorithm is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively using a synthetic example and real MR images of different organs. Comparisons with several state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed technique. Desirable results are obtained even for images with strong and complicated inhomogeneity fields and sparse tissue structures.
