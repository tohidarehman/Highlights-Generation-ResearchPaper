 Portable three-dimensional digitizers facilitate the “digitize” and “compare” operational areas of Virtual Anthropology. However, these measurement devices must be adequately accurate and precise for their intended purpose. We determined that varying the arm configurations led to standard deviations less than 0.23 mm. The distances between pairs of points among 10 points on a reference object at 16 locations within the workspace had an average error of 0.239 mm; only three of the 720 measures had an error greater than 1 mm. Through assessing geometric morphometry, the average landmark standard deviation of the 10 points at 16 locations across the workspace was only 0.12 mm. The different areas of the workspace and different arm joint configurations do not meaningfully influence the measurement precision and accuracy. Therefore, the MicroScribe G2X has suitable accuracy and precision to be an appropriate research tool for many anthropological, forensic and biomechanical studies.

@highlight The MicroScribe is an accurate and precise instrument (errors <1mm).
@highlight The accuracy is maintained across the workspace.
@highlight Both linear distance and geometric morphometry are accurate.
@highlight The accuracy is maintained with different positions of the digitizer arm.
