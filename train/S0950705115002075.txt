 Neighborhood System-based (NS-based) rough set theory is an extension of classical rough set theory. This paper aims to investigate the uncertainty measures of rough sets in a Neighborhood System-space (NS-space). We firstly develop a rough membership function and a rough intuitionistic membership function based on binary relationships. Then we propose a fuzzy entropy and an intuitionistic fuzzy entropy of rough sets, and further explore their corresponding properties. Examples show that the methods not only accord with peopleâ€™s recognition rules of rough sets, but also can be used to depict the case that the NS-based rough sets degenerate into the crisp sets.

@highlight We first study the uncertainty of rough sets in binary GrC Model (Third GrC Model).
@highlight We first propose the rough memberships to depict rough sets.
@highlight Construct fuzzy entropy based on rough memberships and prove its rationality.
@highlight We first propose the rough intuitionistic memberships to depict rough sets.
@highlight Construct intuitionistic fuzzy entropy to measure uncertainty of rough sets.
