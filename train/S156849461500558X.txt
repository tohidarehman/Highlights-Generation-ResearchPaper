 The single machine scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times with the objective of minimizing the total weighted tardiness is a challenging problem due to its complexity, and has a huge number of applications in real production environments. In this paper, we propose a memetic algorithm that combines and extends several ideas from the literature, including a crossover operator that respects both the absolute and relative position of the tasks, a replacement strategy that improves the diversity of the population, and an effective but computationally expensive neighborhood structure. We propose a new decomposition of this neighborhood that can be used by a variable neighborhood descent framework, and also some speed-up methods for evaluating the neighbors. In this way we can obtain competitive running times. We conduct an experimental study to analyze the proposed algorithm and prove that it is significantly better than the state-of-the-art in standard benchmarks.
