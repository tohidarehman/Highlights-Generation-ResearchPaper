 Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) has been a hot topic in decision making and systems engineering. The dual hesitant fuzzy sets (DHFSs) is a useful tool to deal with vagueness and ambiguity in the MADM problems. In this paper, we propose a wide range of dual hesitant fuzzy power aggregation operators based on Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm for dual hesitant fuzzy information. We first redefine some basic operations of dual hesitant fuzzy sets, which are consistent with those of dual hesitant fuzzy sets. We introduce three kinds of distance measures for dual hesitant fuzzy sets, which the corresponding support measures can be obtained. Then we propose several power aggregation operators on dual hesitant fuzzy sets, study their properties and give some specific dual hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators. In the end, we develop two approaches for multiple attribute group decision making with dual hesitant fuzzy information, and illustrate a real world example to show the behavior of the proposed operators.
