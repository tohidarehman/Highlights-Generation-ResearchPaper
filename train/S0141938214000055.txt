 The present study investigates the effects of relative positions of stereoscopic objects (PSO) (‘Far’ (from viewers) vs. ‘Near’ (to viewers) vs. ‘Both’) and seat location on viewers’ psychological responses. People who watched a movie with ‘Both’ conditions reported more arousal and satisfaction compared to people who watched a movie with either the ‘Far’ or ‘Near’ condition. More importantly, interaction effects were reported such as more dizziness (a) with the ‘Near’ condition if sitting on the left or right side in the cinema and (b) with the ‘Far’ condition if sitting in the middle of the cinema. Additionally, people who wore glasses felt more eye fatigue than those who did not. Secondly, people felt less presence, sensation of depth, and arousal if they had prior experience viewing stereoscopic movies. The results indicate that viewing experience with different PSOs and/or seat locations can influence psychological response.
