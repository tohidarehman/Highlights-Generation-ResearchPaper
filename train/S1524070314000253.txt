 In this paper we present a convenient building model synthesis method. It aims at obtaining new user-defined building models through seamless stitching after synthesis of each single building facade. During the optimization process of synthesis of each single building facade, we utilize model structure analysis method to obtain the smallest structural units and the constraint graph among them, transforming complicated three-dimension (3D) synthesis problem into two-dimension (2D) constraint graph synthesis problem. Then we construct a global energy function and minimize it through iterative optimization with expectation maximization algorithm, in order to obtain new objective constraint graph. During stitching process, in order to get complete model synthesis result, we replace objective constraint graph with structural unit to transform synthesis back into 3D space, and achieve automatic stitching between neighboring construction units and neighboring facades by using the connection point sets of structural units in original samples. The experiment results demonstrate our method can generate building models of absolutely different styles quickly and efficiently based on single or multiple samples, while maintaining the continuity and visual integrity of result models well.
