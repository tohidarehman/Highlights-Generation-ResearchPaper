 The single-product, single-period newsvendor problem with two decision variables, namely price and stock quantity, is considered. The performance measure, in addition to the expected revenue, includes the variance of the income scaled with a risk parameter. We present conditions for the concavity of this risk-sensitive performance measure and the uniqueness of the optimal solution for both risk-averse and risk-seeking cases under the additive demand model, and compare the results to others previously published. These conditions are introduced in terms of the lost sales rate elasticity. Furthermore, we provide numerical examples that aim to endorse the theoretical results herein explained.
