 This paper proposes a hybrid optimization method for optimal allocation of wind turbines (WTs) that combines genetic algorithm (GA) and market-based optimal power flow (OPF). The method jointly maximizes net present value (NPV) related to WTs investment made by WTsâ€™ developers and social welfare (SW) considering different combinations of wind generation and load demand over a year. The GA is used to choose the optimal size while the market-based OPF to determine the optimal number of WTs at each candidate bus. The stochastic nature of both load demand and wind power generation is modeled by hourly time series analysis. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated with an 84-bus 11.4kV radial distribution system.
