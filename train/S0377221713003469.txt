 This paper develops an innovative objectives-oriented approach with one evaluation model and three optimization models for managing the implementation of a set of critical success strategies (CSSs) for an enterprise resource planning (ERP) project in an organization. To evaluate the CSSs based on their contribution to the organizational objectives, the evaluation model addresses an important issue of measuring the relationship between objectives in a three-level hierarchy involving the organization, its functional departments, and the ERP project. To determine the optimal management priority for implementing the CSSs from the organization’s perspective, the three optimization models maximize their total implementation value by integrating individual departments’ management preferences. An empirical study is conducted to demonstrate how these models work and how their outcomes can provide practical insights and implications in planning and managing the implementation of the CSSs for an ERP project.
