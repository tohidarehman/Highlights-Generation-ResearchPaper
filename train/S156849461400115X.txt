 JCSE-SPIHT, an algorithm of joint compression and selective encryption based on set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT), is proposed to achieve image encryption and compression simultaneously. It can protect SPIHT compressed images by only fast scrambling a tiny portion of crucial data during the coding process while keeping all the virtues of SPIHT intact. Intensive experiments are conducted to validate and evaluate the proposed algorithm; the results show that the efficiency and the compression performance of JCSE-SPIHT are very close to original SPIHT. In security analysis, JCSE-SPIHT is proved to be immune to various attacks not only from traditional cryptanalysis, but also by utilizing sophisticated image processing techniques.

@highlight We propose JCSE-SPIHT, an algorithm of joint compression and selective encryption based on SPIHT.
@highlight We design a fast random insertion to accelerate the encryption from taking O(n
@highlight 2) time to O(n).
@highlight JCSE-SPIHT can generate plaintext-dependent keystream by cryptographically secure PRNG.
@highlight We exam the security of JCSE-SPIHT by traditional cryptanalysis and image processing techniques.
