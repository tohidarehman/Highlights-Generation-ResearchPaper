 Uncertainty measure mining and applications are fundamental, and it is possible for double-quantitative fusion to acquire benign measures via heterogeneity and complementarity. This paper investigates the double-quantitative fusion of relative accuracy and absolute importance to provide systematic measure mining, benign integration construction, and hierarchical attribute reduction.  First, three-way probabilities and measures are analyzed. Thus, the accuracy and importance are systematically extracted, and both are further fused into importance-accuracy (IP-Accuracy), a synthetic causality measure.  By sum integration, IP-Accuracy gains a bottom-top granulation construction and granular hierarchical structure. IP-Accuracy holds benign granulation monotonicity at both the knowledge concept and classification levels.  IP-Accuracy attribute reduction is explored based on decision tables. A hierarchical reduct system is thereby established, including qualitative/quantitative reducts, tolerant/approximate reducts, reduct hierarchies, and heuristic algorithms. Herein, the innovative tolerant and approximate reducts quantitatively approach/expand/weaken the ideal qualitative reduct.  Finally, a decision table example is provided for illustration. This paper performs double-quantitative fusion of causality measures to systematically mine IP-Accuracy, and this measure benignly constructs a granular computing platform and hierarchical reduct system. By resorting to a monotonous uncertainty measure, this study provides an integration-evolution strategy of granular construction for attribute reduction.
