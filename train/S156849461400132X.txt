 Human performance evaluation is one of the most important fields to analyze for the continuity of an organization. Evaluation files filled by the managers generally end up in dusty folders where no one looks. This decreases the credibility of the evaluators and the process itself. Whereas the management thinks that they are taking the valuable time from the people who can do better things instead of these evaluations. In this paper, we add an engineering point of view to this process by giving a Hybrid Multicriteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach to evaluate employeesâ€™ performances working for a same task and explain an efficient way of handling the qualitative and quantitative data simultaneously. The real life situations where performance criteria show interaction will be possible to solve and the different types of interactions will be handled with the proposed hybrid method using Analytical Network Process (ANP) and Choquet Integral (CI) simultaneously. We also give a numerical illustration at the end of the study with the appropriate concluding remarks including the advantages of the proposed method.

@highlight We propose a performance evaluation method for human resources.
@highlight We use a Hybrid Multicriteria Decision Making Model fort his purpose.
@highlight All possible interaction types are considered and handled with the proposed method.
@highlight Ignoring the interactions may lead to erroneous decisions.
