 Cluster ensemble is a powerful method for improving both the robustness and the stability of unsupervised classification solutions. This paper introduced group method of data handling (GMDH) to cluster ensemble, and proposed a new cluster ensemble framework, which named cluster ensemble framework based on the group method of data handling (CE-GMDH). CE-GMDH consists of three components: an initial solution, a transfer function and an external criterion. Several CE-GMDH models can be built according to different types of transfer functions and external criteria. In this study, three novel models were proposed based on different transfer functions: least squares approach, cluster-based similarity partitioning algorithm and semidefinite programming. The performance of CE-GMDH was compared among different transfer functions, and with some state-of-the-art cluster ensemble algorithms and cluster ensemble frameworks on synthetic and real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CE-GMDH can improve the performance of cluster ensemble algorithms which used as the transfer functions through its unique modelling process. It also indicates that CE-GMDH achieves a better or comparable result than the other cluster ensemble algorithms and cluster ensemble frameworks.
