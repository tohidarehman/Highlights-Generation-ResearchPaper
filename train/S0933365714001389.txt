 Objectives Access to the world wide web and multimedia content is an important aspect of life. We present a web browser and a multimedia user interface adapted for control with a brain-computer interface (BCI) which can be used by severely motor impaired persons. Methods The web browser dynamically determines the most efficient P300 BCI matrix size to select the links on the current website. This enables control of the web browser with fewer commands and smaller matrices. The multimedia player was based on an existing software. Both applications were evaluated with a sample of ten healthy participants and three end-users. All participants used a visual P300 BCI with face-stimuli for control. Results The healthy participants completed the multimedia player task with 90% accuracy and the web browsing task with 85% accuracy. The end-users completed the tasks with 62% and 58% accuracy. All healthy participants and two out of three end-users reported that they felt to be in control of the system. Conclusions In this study we presented a multimedia application and an efficient web browser implemented for control with a BCI. Significance Both applications provide access to important areas of modern information retrieval and entertainment.
