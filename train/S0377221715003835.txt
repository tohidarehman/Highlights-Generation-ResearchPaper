 for solving the two person zero-sum matrix games with pay-offs of triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) and propose a new methodology for solving such games. proposed a method which always assures that the max player gain-floor and min player loss-ceiling have a common TFN value.. not explaining the meaning of solution of game under consideration. The present paper attempts to provide certain appropriate modifications in Liâ€™s model to take care of this serious omission. These modifications in conjunction with the results of Clemente, Fernandez, lead to an algorithm to solve matrix games with pay-offs of general piecewise linear fuzzy numbers.

@highlight This paper reports on a recent publication in EJOR on matrix games with payoffs of triangular fuzzy numbers.
@highlight It is concluded that the value of the game for each player will not be a common triangular fuzzy number.
@highlight To solve the game, players need to solve their respective multi-objective linear programming problem.
@highlight These modifications lead to an algorithm to solve matrix games with payoffs of general piecewise linear fuzzy numbers.
