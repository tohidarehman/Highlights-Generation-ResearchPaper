 To obtain a black matrix (BM) with high optical density (OD) and low dielectric constant, graphene oxide (GO) was prepared from synthetic graphite oxide and then incorporated into the conventional carbon black (CB) pigment to fabricate black matrix films. The introduction of insulating GO effectively lowered the dielectric constant of carbon black-based BM, but maintained the high optical density. The dielectric constant of the BM film significantly decreased from 26 (carbon black-based BM) to 4.5 (GO/CB-based BM). This work demonstrates the successful chemical modification and good dispersion of carbon-based materials (i.e. GO and CB) and their physical effects on the BM films.
