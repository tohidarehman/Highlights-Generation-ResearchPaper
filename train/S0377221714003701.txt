 We address the quickest path problem proposing a new algorithm based on the fact that its optimal solution corresponds to a supported non-dominated point in the objective space of the minsumâ€“maxmin bicriteria path problem. This result allows us to design a label setting algorithm which improves all existing algorithms in the state-of-the-art, as it is shown in the extensive experiments carried out considering synthetic and real networks.

@highlight A novel quickest path algorithm is proposed.
@highlight The algorithm runs in
@highlight log
@highlight time and uses
@highlight space.
@highlight It is a ratio-labeling algorithm working as a Dijkstra-like method.
@highlight The method enumerates only supported efficient paths.
@highlight Computational tests show that the algorithm performs very well.
