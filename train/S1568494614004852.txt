 A Genetic Fuzzy System (GFS) is basically a fuzzy system augmented by a learning process based on a genetic algorithm (GA). Fuzzy systems have demonstrated their ability to solve different kinds of problems in various application domains. Currently, there is an increasing interest to augment fuzzy systems with learning and adaptation capabilities. Two of the most successful approaches to hybridize fuzzy systems with learning and adaptation methods have been made in the realm of soft computing. The GA can be merged with Fuzzy system for different purposes like rule selection, membership function optimization, rule generation, co-efficient optimization, for data classification. Here we propose an Adaptive Genetic Fuzzy System (AGFS) for optimizing rules and membership functions for medical data classification process. The primary intension of the research is 1) Generating rules from data as well as for the optimized rules selection, adapting of genetic algorithm is done and to explain the exploration problem in genetic algorithm, introduction of new operator, called systematic addition is done, 2) Proposing a simple technique for scheming of membership function and Discretization, and 3) Designing a fitness function by allowing the frequency of occurrence of the rules in the training data. Finally, to establish the efficiency of the proposed classifier the presentation of the anticipated genetic-fuzzy classifier is evaluated with quantitative, qualitative and comparative analysis. From the outcome, AGFS obtained better accuracy when compared to the existing systems.
