 The increasing complexity of VLSI digital systems has dramatically supported system-level representations in modeling and design activities. This evolution makes often necessary a compliant rearrangement of the modalities followed in validation and analysis tasks, as in the case of power performances estimation. Nowadays, transaction-level paradigms are having a wider and wider consideration in the research on electronic system-level design techniques. With regard to the available modeling resources, the most relevant framework is probably the transaction-level extension of the SystemC language (SystemC/TLM), which therefore represents the best platform for defining transaction-level design techniques. In this paper we present a macro-modeling power estimation methodology valid for SystemC/TLM prototypes and of general applicability. The present discussion illustrates the implementation modalities of the proposed approach, verifying its effectiveness through a comparison with RTL estimation techniques.

@highlight The paper deals with power analysis on transaction-level models of complex digital systems.
@highlight We propose an estimation methodology strictly based on the modeling constructs of SystemC/TLM and of general applicability.
@highlight We consider the comparison with RTL power estimation techniques on several design aspects: estimation accuracy, simulation time and modeling effort,
@highlight The experimental results show the design advantages of the proposed methodology with respect to RTL estimation techniques.
