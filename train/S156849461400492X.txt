 We propose a new image encryption algorithm which is based on the spatiotemporal non-adjacent coupled map lattices. The system of non-adjacent coupled map lattices has more outstanding cryptography features in dynamics than the logistic map or coupled map lattices does. In the proposed image encryption, we employ a bit-level pixel permutation strategy which enables bit planes of pixels permute mutually without any extra storage space. Simulations have been carried out and the results demonstrate the superior security and high efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

@highlight We propose an image encryption scheme based on a new spatiotemporal chaotic system.
@highlight The encryption scheme is not the one time pad encryption.
@highlight The proposed image encryption has a large key space and high security.
