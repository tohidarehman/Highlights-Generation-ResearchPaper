 We have fabricated two kinds of thin film transistors (TFTs) on the glass substrates using polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin films with small and large grain sizes processed by Excimer Laser Annealing (ELA) and carried out a comparative analysis. The grain size was controlled by nickel atom content in amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin films. With increasing grain size of poly-Si thin films, the carrier mobility increased from 40.8 to 54.4cm2/Vs and the absolute value of threshold voltage reduced from 2.1 to 1.5V. The observed improvements in the electrical characteristics of poly-Si TFTs are attributed mainly to the reduction of defect density rendered by large grain size. These observations indicate that the sputtered nickel atom content in a-Si layer is a key parameter in determining the characteristics of ELA processed TFTs fabricated on the glass substrates.
