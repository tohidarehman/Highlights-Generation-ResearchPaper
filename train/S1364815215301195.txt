 Growing demand from the general public for centralized points of data access and analytics tools coincides with similar, well-documented needs of regional and international hydrology research and resource management communities. To address this need within the Laurentian Great Lakes region, we introduce the Great Lakes Dashboard (GLD), a dynamic web data visualization platform that brings multiple time series data sets together for visual analysis and download. The platform's adaptable, robust, and expandable Time Series Core Object Model (GLD-TSCOM) separates the growing complexity and size of Great Lakes data sets from the web application interface. Although the GLD-TSCOM is currently applied exclusively to Great Lakes data sets, the concepts and methods discussed here can be applied in other geographical and topical areas of interest.
