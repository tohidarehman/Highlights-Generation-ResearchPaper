 Multimodulus algorithms (MMA) based adaptive blind equalizers mitigate inter-symbol interference in a digital communication system by minimizing dispersion in the quadrature components of the equalized sequence in a decoupled manner, i.e., the in-phase and quadrature components of the equalized sequence are used to minimize dispersion in the respective components of the received signal. These unsupervised equalizers are mostly incorporated in bandwidth-efficient digital receivers (wired, wireless or optical) which rely on quadrature amplitude modulation based signaling. These equalizers are equipped with nonlinear error-functions in their update expressions which makes it a challenging task to evaluate analytically their steady-state performance. However, exploiting variance relation theorem, researchers have recently been able to report approximate expressions for steady-state excess mean square error (EMSE) of such equalizers for noiseless but interfering environment. In this work, in contrast to existing results, we present exact steady-state tracking analysis of two multimodulus equalizers in a non-stationary environment. Specifically, we evaluate expressions for steady-state EMSE of two equalizers, namely the MMA2-2 and the Î²MMA. The accuracy of the derived analytical results is validated using different set experiments and found in close agreement.
