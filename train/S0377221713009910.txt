 We suggest a new one-parameter family of solidarity values for TU-games. The members of this class are distinguished by the type of player whose removal from a game does not affect the remaining playersâ€™ payoffs. While the Shapley value and the equal division value are the boundary members of this family, the solidarity value is its center. With exception of the Shapley value,.

@highlight A new family of solidarity values is suggested and characterized.
@highlight Shapley value and equal division value are its boundary members.
@highlight The solidarity value is its center.
@highlight Almost all of these values are asymptotically equivalent to the equal division value.
