 It has become increasingly important for companies to utilize electronic word of mouth (eWOM) in their marketing campaigns for desired product sales. Identifying key eWOM disseminators among consumers is a challenge for companies. WOM is an interpersonal communication in which a sender spreads a message to receivers. Previously, researchers and practitioners have searched for opinion leaders by examining senders and receivers due to limited records on WOM message. Our study identifies three types of opinion leaders through eWOM using a message-based approach that elicits more accurate and comprehensive information on opinion leadership than sender-based and receiver-based approaches. We demonstrate that eWOM of opinion leaders drives product sales due to their product experience and knowledge background. Our findings suggest that companies can increase product sales via effective use of eWOM of such opinion leaders. Managerial and marketing implications are addressed.
