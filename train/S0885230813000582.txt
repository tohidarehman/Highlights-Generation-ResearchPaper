 Speech output technology is finding widespread application, including in scenarios where intelligibility might be compromised – at least for some listeners – by adverse conditions. Unlike most current algorithms, talkers continually adapt their speech patterns as a response to the immediate context of spoken communication, where the type of interlocutor and the environment are the dominant situational factors influencing speech production. Observations of talker behaviour can motivate the design of more robust speech output algorithms. Starting with a listener-oriented categorisation of possible goals for speech modification, this review article summarises the extensive set of behavioural findings related to human speech modification, identifies which factors appear to be beneficial, and goes on to examine previous computational attempts to improve intelligibility in noise. The review concludes by tabulating 46 speech modifications, many of which have yet to be perceptually or algorithmically evaluated. Consequently, the review provides a roadmap for future work in improving the robustness of speech output.

@highlight Speech production is affected by environmental and interlocutor-related contextual factors.
@highlight We review speech modifications produced by talkers in response to context.
@highlight Algorithmic modifications aimed at increasing intelligibility are also reviewed.
@highlight A summary table of 46 candidate speech modifications is provided.
