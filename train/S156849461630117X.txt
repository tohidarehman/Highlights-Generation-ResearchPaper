 Conventionally, optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) is described as the minimization of active power transmission losses and/or total voltage deviation by controlling a number of control variables while satisfying certain equality and inequality constraints. This article presents a newly developed meta-heuristic approach, chaotic krill herd algorithm (CKHA), for the solution of the ORPD problem of power system incorporating flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices. The proposed CKHA is implemented and its performance is tested, successfully, on standard IEEE 30-bus test power system. The considered power system models are equipped with two types of FACTS controllers (namely, thyristor controlled series capacitor and thyristor controlled phase shifter). Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach yields superior solution over other popular methods surfaced in the recent state-of-the-art literature including chaos embedded few newly developed optimization techniques. The obtained results indicate the effectiveness for the solution of ORPD problem of power system considering FACTS devices. Finally, simulation is extended to some large-scale power system models like IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 118-bus test power systems for the same objectives to emphasis on the scalability of the proposed CKHA technique. The scalability, the robustness and the superiority of the proposed CKHA are established in this paper.
