 We generalize the idea of semi-self-financing strategies,,, for the pre-commitment mean-variance (MV) optimal portfolio allocation problem. The proposed semi-self-financing strategies are built upon a numerical solution framework for Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations, and can be readily employed in a very general setting, namely continuous or discrete re-balancing, jump-diffusions with finite activity, and realistic portfolio constraints. We show that if the portfolio wealth exceeds a threshold, an MV optimal strategy is to withdraw cash. These semi-self-financing strategies are generally non-unique. Numerical results confirming the superiority of the efficient frontiers produced by the strategies with positive cash withdrawals are presented. Tests based on estimation of parameters from historical time series show that the semi-self-financing strategy is robust to estimation ambiguities.

@highlight We expand the admissible set for pre-commitment MV portfolio allocation.
@highlight It can be proved it is optimal to withdraw cash in certain cases.
@highlight We determine the optimal strategy by numerically solving an HJB equation.
@highlight Numerical examples illustrate the optimality of cash withdrawals.
