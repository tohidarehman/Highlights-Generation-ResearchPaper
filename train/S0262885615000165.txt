 We propose a method to produce near laser-scan quality 3-D face models of a freely moving user with a low-cost, low resolution range sensor in real-time. Our approach does not require any prior knowledge about the geometry of a face and can produce faithful geometric models of any star-shaped object. We use a cylindrical representation, which enables us to efficiently process the 3-D mesh by applying 2-D filters. We use the first frame as a reference and incrementally build the model by registering each subsequent cloud of 3-D points to the reference using the ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm implemented on a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). The registered point clouds are merged into a single image through a cylindrical representation. The noise from the sensor and from the pose estimation error is removed with a temporal integration and a spatial smoothing of the successively incremented model. To validate our approach, we quantitatively compare our model to laser scans, and show comparable accuracy. This paper extends the method presented in .

@highlight We infer a very accurate 3-D face model for a freely moving user from a single depth camera.
@highlight Using unwrapped cylindrical 2-D images enables us to use simple 2-D image processing algorithms to process the 3-D information.
@highlight We use a combination of spatial smoothing and temporal integration for noise removal.
@highlight A robust rejection method produces reliable results in the presence of facial expression changes and partial occlusions.
@highlight Our system runs online and in real-time.
