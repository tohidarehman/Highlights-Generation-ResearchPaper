 The human visual system (HSV) is quite adept at swiftly detecting objects of interest in complex visual scene. Simulating human visual system to detect visually salient regions of an image has been one of the active topics in computer vision. Inspired by random sampling based bagging ensemble learning method, an ensemble dictionary learning (EDL) framework for saliency detection is proposed in this paper. Instead of learning a universal dictionary requiring a large number of training samples to be collected from natural images, multiple over-complete dictionaries are independently learned with a small portion of randomly selected samples from the input image itself, resulting in more flexible multiple sparse representations for each of the image patches. To boost the distinctness of salient patch from background region, we present a reconstruction residual based method for dictionary atom reduction. Meanwhile, with the obtained multiple probabilistic saliency responses for each of the patches, the combination of them is finally carried out from the probabilistic perspective to achieve better predictive performance on saliency region. Experimental results on several open test datasets and some natural images demonstrate that the proposed EDL for saliency detection is much more competitive compared with some existing state-of-the-art algorithms.
