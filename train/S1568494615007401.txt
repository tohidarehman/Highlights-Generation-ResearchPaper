 The ranking of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) is very important for the intuitionistic fuzzy decision making. The aim of this paper is to propose a new risk attitudinal ranking method of IFSs and apply to multi-attribute decision making (MADM) with incomplete weight information. Motivated by technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), we utilize the closeness degree to characterize the amount of information according to the geometrical representation of an IFS. The area of triangle is calculated to measure the reliability of information. It is proved that the closeness degree and the triangle area just form an interval. Thereby, a new lexicographical method is proposed based on the intervals for ranking the intuitionistic fuzzy values (IFVs). Furthermore, considered the risk attitude of decision maker sufficiently, a novel risk attitudinal ranking measure is developed to rank the IFVs on the basis of the continuous ordered weighted average (C-OWA) operator and this interval. Through maximizing the closeness degrees of alternatives, we construct a multi-objective fractional programming model which is transformed into a linear program. Thus, the attribute weights are derived objectively by solving this linear program. Then, a new method is put forward for MADM with IFVs and incomplete weight information. Finally, an example analysis of a teacher selection is given to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method.
