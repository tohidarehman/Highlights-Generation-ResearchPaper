 This paper addresses the problem of collecting inventory of production at various plants having limited storage capacity, violation of which forces plant shutdowns. The production at plants is continuous (with known rates) and a fleet of vehicles need to be scheduled to transport the commodity from plants to a central storage or depot, possibly making multiple pickups at a given plant to avoid shutdown. One operational objective is to achieve the highest possible rate of product retrieval at the depot, relative to the total travel time of the fleet. This problem is a variant (and generalization) of the inventory routing problem. The motivating application for this paper is barge scheduling for oil pickup from off-shore oil-producing platforms with limited holding capacity, where shutdowns are prohibitively expensive. We develop a new model that is fundamentally different from standard node-arc or path formulations in the literature. The proposed model is based on assigning a unique position to each vehicle visit at a node in a chronological sequence of vehicle-nodal visits. This approach leads to substantial flexibility in modeling multiple visits to a node using multiple vehicles, while controlling the number of binary decision variables. Consequently, our position-based model solves larger model instances significantly more efficiently than the node-arc counterpart. Computational experience of the proposed model with the off-shore barge scheduling application is reported.
