 This paper presents a novel adaptive cuckoo search (ACS) algorithm for optimization. The step size is made adaptive from the knowledge of its fitness function value and its current position in the search space. The other important feature of the ACS algorithm is its speed, which is faster than the CS algorithm. Here, an attempt is made to make the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm parameter free, without a Levy step. The proposed algorithm is validated using twenty three standard benchmark test functions. The second part of the paper proposes an efficient face recognition algorithm using ACS, principal component analysis (PCA) and intrinsic discriminant analysis (IDA). The proposed algorithms are named as PCA+IDA and ACS–IDA. Interestingly, PCA+IDA offers us a perturbation free algorithm for dimension reduction while ACS+IDA is used to find the optimal feature vectors for classification of the face images based on the IDA. For the performance analysis, we use three standard face databases—YALE, ORL, and FERET. A comparison of the proposed method with the state-of-the-art methods reveals the effectiveness of our algorithm.
