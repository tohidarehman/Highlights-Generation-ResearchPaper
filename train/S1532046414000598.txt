 The integration of medical data coming from multiple sources is important in clinical research. Amongst others, it enables the discovery of appropriate subjects in patient-oriented research and the identification of innovative results in epidemiological studies. At the same time, the integration of medical data faces significant ethical and legal challenges that impose access constraints. Some of these issues can be addressed by making available aggregated instead of raw record-level data. In many cases however, there is still a need for controlling access even to the resulting aggregated data, e.g., due to data providerâ€™s policies. In this paper we present the Linked Medical Data Access Control (LiMDAC) framework that capitalizes on Linked Data technologies to enable controlling access to medical data across distributed sources with diverse access constraints. The LiMDAC framework consists of three Linked Data models, namely the LiMDAC metadata model, the LiMDAC user profile model, and the LiMDAC access policy model. It also includes an architecture that exploits these models. Based on the framework, a proof-of-concept platform is developed and its performance and functionality are evaluated by employing two usage scenarios.

@highlight The LiMDAC framework enables controlling access to aggregated medical data.
@highlight It capitalizes on the Linked Data paradigm to develop the underlying infrastructure.
@highlight It consists of three models: metadata, user profile and access policy model.
@highlight The LiMDAC architecture exploits and orchestrates the LiMDAC models.
@highlight A proof-of-concept implementation evaluates the framework.
