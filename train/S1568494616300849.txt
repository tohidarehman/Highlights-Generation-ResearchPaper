 In this paper we are presenting a modification of a bio-inspired algorithm based on the bee behavior (BCO, bee colony optimization) for optimizing fuzzy controllers. BCO is a metaheuristic technique inspired by the behavior presented by bees in nature, which can be used for solving optimization problems. First, the traditional BCO is tested with the optimization of fuzzy controllers. Second, a modification of the original method is presented by including fuzzy logic to dynamically change the main parameter values of the algorithm during execution. Third, the proposed modification of the BCO algorithm with the fuzzy approach is used to optimize benchmark control problems. The comparison of results show that the proposed fuzzy BCO method outperforms the traditional BCO in the optimal design of fuzzy controllers.
