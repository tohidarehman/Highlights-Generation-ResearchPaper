 In this paper we present a self-tuning of two degrees-of-freedom control algorithm that is designed for use on a non-linear single-input single-output system. The control algorithm is developed based on the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model, and it consists of two loops: a feedforward loop and feedback loop. The feedforward part of the controller should drive the system output to the vicinity of the reference signal. It is developed from the inversion of the T-S fuzzy model. To achieve accurate error-free reference tracking a feedback part of the controller is added. A time-varying error-model predictive controller is used in the feedback loop. The error-model is obtained from the T-S fuzzy model. The T-S fuzzy model of the system, required in the controller, is obtained with evolving fuzzy modelling, which is based on recursive Gustafson-Kessel clustering algorithm and recursive fuzzy least squares. It employs evolving mechanisms for adding, removing, merging and splitting the clusters. The presented control approach was experimentally validated on a non-linear second-order SISO system helio-crane in simulation and real environment. Several criteria functions were defined to evaluate the reference-tracking and disturbance rejection performance of the control algorithm. The presented control approach was compared to another fuzzy control algorithm. The experimental results confirm the applicability of the approach.
