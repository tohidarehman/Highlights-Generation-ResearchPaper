 A speech pre-processing algorithm is presented that improves the speech intelligibility in noise for the near-end listener. The algorithm improves intelligibility by optimally redistributing the speech energy over time and frequency according to a perceptual distortion measure, which is based on a spectro-temporal auditory model. Since this auditory model takes into account short-time information, transients will receive more amplification than stationary vowels, which has been shown to be beneficial for intelligibility of speech in noise. The proposed method is compared to unprocessed speech and two reference methods using an intelligibility listening test. Results show that the proposed method leads to significant intelligibility gains while still preserving quality. Although one of the methods used as a reference obtained higher intelligibility gains, this happened at the cost of decreased quality. Matlab code is provided.
