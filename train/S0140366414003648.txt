This paper reviews current methodologies used to evaluate the quality of experience in a video streaming service. A typical video assessment diagram is described, and analyses of the subjective, objective, and hybrid approaches are presented. Finally, considering the moving target scenario of mobile and high definition devices, the text outlines challenges and future research directions that should be considered in the measurement and assessment of the quality of experience for video streaming services.
