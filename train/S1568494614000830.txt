 This paper's proposal is to show some significant results obtained by the application of the optimization algorithm known as Fuzzy Adaptive Simulated Annealing (Fuzzy ASA) to the task of finding all Nash equilibria of normal form games. To that end, a special version of Fuzzy ASA, that utilizes space-filling curves to find good seeds, is applied to several well-known strategic games, showing its effectiveness in obtaining all Nash equilibria in all cases. The results are compared to previous work that also used computational intelligence techniques in order to solve the same problem but could not find all equilibria in all tests. Game theory is a very important subject, modeling interactions between generic agents, and Nash equilibrium represents a powerful concept portraying situations in which joint strategies are optimal in the sense that no player can benefit from changing her/his strategy while the other players do not change their strategies as well. So, new techniques are always welcome, mainly those that can find the whole set of solutions for a given strategic game.
