 Genome-wide association studies, as a powerful approach for detecting common variants associated with diseases, have revealed many disease-associated loci. However, the traditional association analysis methods do not have enough power for detecting the effects of rare variants with limited sample size. As a solution to this problem, pooling rare variants by their functions into a composite variant provides an alternative way for identifying susceptible genes. In this paper, we propose a new pooling method to test the variantâ€“disease association and to identify the functional rare variants related with the disease. Variants with smaller and larger risk measures defined as the ratio of allele frequencies between cases and controls are pooled and a chi-square test of the resultant pooled table is calculated. We vary the threshold of pooling over all possible values and use the maximal chi-square as test statistic. The maximal chi-square is in fact the global maximum over all possible poolings. Our approach is similar to the existing variable-threshold method, but we threshold on the risk measure instead of allele frequencies of controls. Simulation results show that our method performs better in both association testing and variant selection.

@highlight We propose a risk-based variable-threshold method in association analysis of rare variants.
@highlight Existing methods of pooling similar rare variants were based on quantities calculated from control group. Our method pools rare variants with similar relative risk calculated based on the ratio of variant frequencies between cases and controls.
@highlight Our method effectively provides the global optimal pooling/grouping method among all possible ways of grouping.
@highlight Simulation results show that our method gains more power than existing methods.
