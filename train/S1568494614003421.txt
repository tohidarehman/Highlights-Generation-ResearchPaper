 This study proposes the multi-objective programming (MOP) method for solving network DEA (NDEA) models. In the proposed method, the divisional efficiencies (within an organization) and the overall efficiency of the organization are formulated as separate objective functions in the multi-objective programming model. Compared with conventional DEA where the intermediate processes and products are ignored, this work measures the organization's overall efficiency without neglecting the efficiencies of its subunits. Two case studies demonstrate the proposed NDEAâ€“MOP's utility in measuring the efficiencies of an organization with concerning interactive internal process.

@highlight The multi-objective programming model is proposed as an alternative approach for solving network DEA.
@highlight The propositions concerning various cases of possible evaluation settings are developed.
@highlight Case studies are implemented to examine the network DEA models with multi-objective programming.
