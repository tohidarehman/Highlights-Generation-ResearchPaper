 We study the problem of scheduling a set of N jobs with non-identical job sizes from F different families on a set of M parallel batch machines; the objective is to minimize the makespan. The problem is known to be NP-hard. A meta-heuristic based on Maxâ€“Min Ant System (MMAS) is presented. The performance of the algorithm is compared with several previously studied algorithms by computational experiments. According to our results, the average distance between the solutions found by our proposed algorithm and the lower bounds is about 4% less than that of the best of all the compared algorithms, demonstrating that our algorithm outperforms the previously studied algorithms.
