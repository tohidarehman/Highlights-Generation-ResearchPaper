 The capture of an eye image with the occlusion of spectacles in a non-cooperative environment compromises the accuracy in identifying a person in an iris recognition system. This is due to the obstruction of the iris by the frame which tends to produce an incorrect estimation of the initial center of the iris and the pupil during the iris segmentation process. In addition, it also causes incorrect localization of the upper eyelid during the process of iris segmentation and sometimes, the edges of the frame are wrongly identified as the edges of the upper eyelid. A frame detection method which involves the combination of two gradients, namely the Sobel operator and high pass filter, followed by fuzzy logic and the dilation operation of morphological processing is proposed to identify the frame on the basis of different frame factors in the capture of a distant eye image. In addition, a different color space is applied and only a single channel is used for the process of frame detection. The proposed frame detection method provides the highest frame detection rate compared to the other methods, with a detection rate of more than 80.0%. For the accuracy of the iris localization, upper eyelid localization and iris recognition system, the proposed method gives more than 96.5% accuracy compared to the other methods. The index of decidability showed that the proposed method gives more than 2.35 index compared to the existing methods.
