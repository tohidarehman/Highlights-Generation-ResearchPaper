 A new method of evaluation of CT scan heart slices is proposed in this paper. CT images, acquired from different patients, are stored in PACS database. In order to create 3D/4D model of heart it is necessary to choose these CT images that have sufficient quality. The proposed method is based on classification of histograms of brightness of CT scan heart slices. Some structural features of these histograms are correlated to the images quality which is evaluated in the context of creating an ultrasonography simulator on the basis of CT scan heart slices. They constitute computed tomography scan sets. The quality evaluation is based on fuzzy classification. A new methodology of the membership function construction in relation to structural features of the examined images is proposed. The algorithmic approach to the construction of the membership functions of given in advance classes is introduced. The experiments have shown that the proposed method is effective in selection of high quality CT scan heart slices that can be the basis for the simulator construction. The experiment showed that the proposed fuzzy selection is absolutely consistent with the one done by an expert.
