 A Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is an infrastructure-less collection of nodes that are powered by portable batteries. Consumption of energy is the major constraint in a wireless network. This paper presents a new algorithm called Energy-Aware Span Routing Protocol (EASRP) that uses energy-saving approaches such as Span and the Adaptive Fidelity Energy Conservation Algorithm (AFECA). Energy consumption is further optimized by using a hardware circuit called the Remote Activated Switch (RAS) to wake up sleeping nodes. These energy-saving approaches are well-established in reactive protocols. However, there are certain issues to be addressed when using EASRP in a hybrid protocol, especially a proactive protocol. Simulation results for the EASRP protocol show an increase in energy efficiency of 12.2% and 17.45% compared with EAZRP and ZRP, respectively. The EASRP protocol also proves to be effective in by producing a better packet delivery ratio for low- and high-density networks as measured by the NS-2 simulation tool.

@highlight A new Energy-Aware Span Routing Protocol (EASRP) for wireless ad hoc networks is proposed.
@highlight Proposed protocol can minimize utilization of energy source by combining energy saving approaches Span and AFECA.
@highlight It uses the Remote Activated Switch and wakes up the sleeping nodes during inactive time for reduce latency problem.
@highlight The performance parameter of proposed protocol is tested under Network Simulator-2.
