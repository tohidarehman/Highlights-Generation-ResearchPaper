 We present the mechanism of interaction of Wnt network module, which is responsible for periodic somitogenesis, with p53 regulatory network, which is one of the main regulators of various cellular functions, and switching of various oscillating states by investigating p53â€“Wnt model. The variation in Nutlin concentration in p53 regulating network drives the Wnt network module to different states, stabilized, damped and sustain oscillation states, and even to cycle arrest. Similarly, the change in Axin2 concentration in Wnt could able to modulate the p53 dynamics at these states. We then solve the set of coupled ordinary differential equations of the model using quasi steady state approximation. We, further, demonstrate the change of p53 and GSK3 interaction rate, due to hypothetical catalytic reaction or external stimuli, can able to regulate the dynamics of the two network modules, and even can control their dynamics to protect the system from cycle arrest (apoptosis).

@highlight The cross-talk between Wnt and p53 signaling pathways allows to regulate each other.
@highlight Nutlin can able to switch on the somitogenesis at low Axin2 level.
@highlight Excess Axin2 level in Wnt pathway could trigger the cell to apoptotic phase.
@highlight Control of one reaction could probably save the cell going from apoptotic phase.
