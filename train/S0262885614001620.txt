 Accurate reconstruction of 3D geometrical shape from a set of calibrated 2D multiview images is an active yet challenging task in computer vision. The existing multiview stereo methods usually perform poorly in recovering deeply concave and thinly protruding structures, and suffer from several common problems like slow convergence, sensitivity to initial conditions, and high memory requirements. To address these issues, we propose a two-phase optimization method for generalized reprojection error minimization (TwGREM), where a generalized framework of reprojection error is proposed to integrate stereo and silhouette cues into a unified energy function. For the minimization of the function, we first introduce a convex relaxation on 3D volumetric grids which can be efficiently solved using variable splitting and Chambolle projection. Then, the resulting surface is parameterized as a triangle mesh and refined using surface evolution to obtain a high-quality 3D reconstruction. Our comparative experiments with several state-of-the-art methods show that the performance of TwGREM based 3D reconstruction is among the highest with respect to accuracy and efficiency, especially for data with smooth texture and sparsely sampled viewpoints.
