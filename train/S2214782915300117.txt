 Background A burn is one of the most traumatic and painful injuries a child can experience and it is also a very stressful experience for the parents. Given the great psychological distress and perceived lack of multi-professional support experienced by the parents, there is a need for support during in-hospital treatment as well as during recovery. The aim of the study is to develop and evaluate an internet-based information and self-help program for parents of children who have been hospitalized for burn injury. The program aims to decrease parents' symptoms of stress. Methods Participants will consist of parents of children treated for burns between 2009 and 2013 at either of the two specialized Swedish Burn centers. The study is a two-armed randomized controlled trial with a six-week intervention group and an inactive control group, with a pre- and post-assessment, as well as a 3- and 12-month follow-up. The main outcome is stress (post-traumatic stress, general perceived stress and parental stress). The data will be analyzed with the intention-to-treat principle. The intervention is based on Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (CBT) and is inspired by Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). It is psycho-educational and provides basic skills training in communication and stress management. Conclusion We believe that this program will offer parents of children with burns information and support, decrease symptoms of stress, and that parents will perceive the program as useful. If the program is found to be beneficial, it could be implemented in burn care as it is accessible and cost-effective.
