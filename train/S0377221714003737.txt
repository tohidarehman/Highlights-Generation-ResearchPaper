 The m-machine no-wait flowshop scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing total completion time subject to the constraint that the makespan value is not greater than a certain value is addressed in this paper. Setup times are considered non-zero values, and thus, setup times are treated as separate from processing times. Several recent algorithms, an insertion algorithm, two genetic algorithms, three simulated annealing algorithms, two cloud theory-based simulated annealing algorithms, and a differential evolution algorithm are adapted and proposed for the problem. An extensive computational analysis has been conducted for the evaluation of the proposed algorithms. The computational analysis indicates that one of the nine proposed algorithms, one of the simulated annealing algorithms (ISA-2), performs much better than the others under the same computational time. Moreover, the analysis indicates that the algorithm ISA-2 performs significantly better than the earlier existing best algorithm. Specifically, the best performing algorithm, ISA-2, proposed in this paper reduces the error of the existing best algorithm in the literature by at least 90% under the same computational time. All the results have been statistically tested.
