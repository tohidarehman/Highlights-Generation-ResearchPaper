 The increase of Linked Open Data (LOD) usage has grown in the last few years, and the number of datasets available is considerably higher. Taking this into account, another way to make data available is microdata, whose aim is to make information more understandable for search engines to give better results. The Schema.org vocabulary was created for the enrichment of microdata as a way to give more accurate results for user searches. As Schema.org is a kind of ontology, it has the potential to become a bridge to the Web of Linked Data. In this paper we analyze the potential of mapping Schema.org and the Web of Linked Data. Concretely, we have obtained mappings between Schema.org terms and the terms provided by the Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV) collection. In order to measure the limitations of our mappings we have compared the results of our script with some matching tools. Finally, an analysis of the usability of interlinking Schema.org to vocabularies in LOV has been carried out. For this purpose, two studies in which we have been presented aggregated information. Results show that new information has been added a substantial number of times.

@highlight We mapped classes and properties of Schema.org with classes and properties of the vocabularies in LOV.
@highlight We have retrieved instances in the Web of Linked Data using the mapped terms previously.
@highlight We have presented to uses cases in order to take benefits of the mappings giving real quantitative results.
