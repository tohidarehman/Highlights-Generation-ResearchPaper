 A novel MEMS display device comprising a light separator and MEMS light shutters is introduced. This device is operable both in transmissive mode using internal light source and in reflective mode using external sun light. In transmissive mode, the light separator directs internal backlight illuminated on its incident surface into a plural of small openings (grooves) on the viewing surface. The MEMS light shutters are used to control the color and intensity of light at individual pixels. Internal light utilization efficiency of this display is the greatest compared to any other transmissive displays. The device is capable of having true black background, hence a very high contrast ratio. In reflective mode, MEMS shutters direct part of the sun light for image display. MEMS shutters have fast response time, making the new device suitable for vivid motion picture display, and operable at very low voltages, suitable for mobile device applications.
