 A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a special type of wireless network in which a collection of mobile nodes with wireless network interfaces may form a temporary network, without the aids of any fixed infrastructure. Security has become a hot research topic in mobile ad hoc networks. In 1998, Volker and Mehrdad proposed a tree-based key management and access control scheme for the mobile agents to manage rights to access its own resources for the visited mobile nodes. Latter, Huang et al. showed that Volker and Mehrdad's scheme needs a large amount of storage and costs for managing and storing secret keys. Huang et al. further proposed a new and efficient scheme based on the elliptic curve cryptosystems to reduce costs and gain better efficiency. However, there is a security leak inherent in Huang et al.'s scheme that the malicious node can overstep his authority to access unauthorized information. This paper will propose a secure, robust, and efficient hierarchical key management scheme for MANETs. Some practical issues and solutions about dynamic key management are also considered and proposed. As compared with Huang et al.'s scheme, our proposed scheme can provide better security assurance, while requiring smaller key-size, lower computational complexities, and constant key management costs which is independent on the number of the confidential files and the visited nodes.
