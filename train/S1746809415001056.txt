 Averaging of nonlinearly aligned (time-warped) signal cycles is an important method for suppressing noise of quasi-periodical or event related signals. However, in the paper we show that the operation of time warping introduces unfavorable violation of the requirements that should be satisfied for effective averaging and, as a result, it causes poor suppression of noise. To limit these effects, we redefine the matrix of the alignment costs. To improve results of averaging in cases of variable energy noise, we apply weighting of the summed signal samples. The derived formula gives smaller weights for more noisy signal cycles and this way limits their influence on the constructed template. The proposed modifications caused a significant increase of the Noise Reduction Factor (NRF) in the experiments on the simulated evoked potentials. Whereas the greatest NRF obtained by the reference methods in nonstationary white noise environment was equal to 1.55, for the new method proposed we achieved a value of 4.44. For non-stationary colored noise, the corresponding values were 1.44 and 2.99. Moreover, application of the developed method to ECG signal processing, prior to the measurements of the QT interval, significantly improved the measurements immunity to noise.
