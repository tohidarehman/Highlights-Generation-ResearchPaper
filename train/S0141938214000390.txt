 This paper presents a new three-dimensional (3-D) display that can display 3-D images at long distances of tens or hundreds of meters in the depth direction and that can control their 3-D positions to meet new requirements for outdoor use. The proposed display uses changing size as a cue to depth perception, i.e., the smoothly expanding motion of virtual images formed with optical systems according to the forward movements of the users to display 3-D images at more distant positions in the depth direction than positions where virtual images are formed with optical systems because conventional 3-D displays that use binocular disparity are only able to display 3-D images at short distances in the depth direction. The feasibility of the proposed display was evaluated by subjective tests using a moving minivan in which observers viewed a test pattern that overlapped the real view ahead of the automobile observed through the windshield. The results obtained from the subjective tests revealed that the test pattern was observed at long distances over tens and hundreds of meters in the depth direction and that the position in the depth direction of the test pattern could be controlled by changing the rate at which the motion of the test pattern smoothly expanded. These results demonstrated that the proposed display was feasible.
