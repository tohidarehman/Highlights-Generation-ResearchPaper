 This paper analyzes the performance of spectrum-sensing-based energy detection (ED) in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) over generalized fading channels. The fading channel is modeled by the extended generalized-K (EGK) distribution. Exact and accurate analytical expressions for the average detection probability with different detection schemes, such as, single channel, diversity reception, and cooperative spectrum sensing, are derived and evaluated. Obtained expressions can be reduced to other well-known fading channels such as, Weibull, Nakagami-m, and Rayleigh. It is shown that the analytical framework can be used for both integer and non-integer values of the fading/shadowing parameters. The impact of key fading/shadowing parameters on the performance of energy detectors is discussed with receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. The accuracy of the derived analytical expressions is corroborated via Monte-Carlo simulation results.
