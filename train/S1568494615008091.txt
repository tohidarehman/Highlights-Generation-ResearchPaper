 In this paper, we investigate multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problems based on Frank triangular norms, in which the attribute values assume the form of hesitant fuzzy information. Firstly, some basic concepts of hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) and the Frank triangle norms are introduced. We develop some hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators based on Frank operations, such as hesitant fuzzy Frank weighted average (HFFWA) operator, hesitant fuzzy Frank ordered weighted averaging (HFFOWA) operator, hesitant fuzzy Frank hybrid averaging (HFFHA) operator, hesitant fuzzy Frank weighted geometric (HFFWG) operator, hesitant fuzzy Frank ordered weighted geometric (HFFOWG) operator, and hesitant fuzzy Frank hybrid geometric (HFFHG) operator. Some essential properties together with their special cases are discussed in detail. Next, a procedure of multiple attribute decision making based on the HFFHWA (or HFFHWG) operator is presented under hesitant fuzzy environment. Finally, a practical example that concerns the human resource selection is provided to illustrate the decision steps of the proposed method. The result demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of the new method. A comparative analysis is also presented.
