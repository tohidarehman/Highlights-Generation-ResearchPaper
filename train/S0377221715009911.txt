 In this paper we propose a general methodology for solving a broad class of continuous, multifacility location problems, in any dimension and with ℓ -norms proposing two different methodologies:  by a new second order cone mixed integer programming formulation and  by formulating a sequence of semidefinite programs that converges to the solution of the problem; each of these relaxed problems solvable with SDP solvers in polynomial time.

@highlight New models for continuous multifacility location with any ℓ
@highlight norm are presented.
@highlight For multiple allocation problems we provide SOCP formulations.
@highlight For single allocation problem, the formulation becomes a MISOCO problem.
@highlight Alternatively, a hierarchy of SDP problems converging to the optimal solution is given.
@highlight Some computational results with the presented models are reported.
