 The quality of initial ideas is considered a critical determinant for successful new product development (NPD). This study presents an ideation method for generating new product ideas. The aims of the proposed method are  to clarify and identify potential problems involved in the knowledge domain of the product design through the Su-field enhanced concept mapping diagram;  to abstract inventive problems and generate novel product ideas by means of the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) methodology; and,  to develop an effective decision aiding method for evaluating alternative ideas and determining promising product ideas using fuzzy linguistic evaluation techniques. The applicability of the ideation method is demonstrated through a case study of an air purifier design. The theoretical and practical implications of the ideation method are also discussed.
