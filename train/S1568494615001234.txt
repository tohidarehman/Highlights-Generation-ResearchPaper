 In this paper we introduce a novel online self-organized clustering method based on the ART-2A network for Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy models. To accomplish the self-organization, we introduce an automatic decision algorithm along with solutions for merging and splitting of rules as well as the parameters they operate with, such as our novel incremental distance measurement and competitive recursive least squares. We emphasize the learning algorithm's having an impact for initial as well as long-term learning capabilities. We also emphasize the challenge for online learning, where examples are incoming in real-time and thus are unknown before they can be learned. Therefore, we solve parameter fixing by introducing a parameter free method. We show the performance of our method on various machine learning benchmarks as a highly accurate and low time-consuming method capable of adapting to different databases without the need for fixing any of its parameters according to the database.

@highlight We developed self-organized Takagi–Sugeno model for online learning, starting from the scratch, adding new classes any time and independent on database knowledge, not knowing the number of classes.
@highlight We introduce the solutions for merging and splitting of antecedent and consequent parameters.
@highlight Our merging and splitting solutions are limited for our novel incremental distance measurement (antecedent part) and recursive least squares (consequent part).
@highlight We introduce the automated organization of rule and decision making behind it.
