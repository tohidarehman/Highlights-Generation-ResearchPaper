 Scene parsing, using both images and range data, is one of the key problems in computer vision and robotics. In this paper, a street scene parsing scheme that takes advantages of images from perspective cameras and range data from LiDAR is presented. First, pre-processing on the image set is performed and the corresponding point cloud is segmented according to semantics and transformed into an image pose. A graph matching approach is introduced into our parsing framework, in order to identify similar sub-regions from training and test images in terms of both local appearance and spatial structure. By using the sub-graphs inherited from training images, as well as the cues obtained from point clouds, this approach can effectively interpret the street scene via a guided MRF inference. Experimental results show a promising performance of our approach.

@highlight An effective scene parsing framework via graph matching guidance on street-level data is proposed.
@highlight Graph matching is introduced to partially match image components taking into account the regional similarity of scenes.
@highlight The proposed algorithm can be applied to small training and testing sets, and achieves competitive parsing performance.
