 The purpose of this paper is to propose a systematic method to solve knowledge management performance evaluation (KMPE) problems. This method includes an integrated evaluation process starting from the measurement to the output of KMPE and combines subjective and objective indicators together. Firstly, we established an index system, involving the process of knowledge management, the organizational knowledge structure, economic benefits and efficiency. And based on this index system, a synthetic evaluation method is presented, using triangular fuzzy number to measure indexes and facilitating the KMPE with a group support system (GSS). To know better of the proposed method, we have an example to illustrate. Finally, the empirical study conducted in this paper indicates that the evaluation method has strong practicability and operability. Besides, the evaluation is enabled by using a group support system: the more objective scoring can be achieved due to synchronic/asynchronous and anonymous participation; Decision-makers improve their efficiency by the clear demonstration analysis results. The systematic method of KMPE based on the index system is able to improve organizationsâ€™ efficiency in performance evaluation process.
