 At present, in mobile sensing environment, almost all the existing secure large data objects dissemination algorithms are centralized. The centralized servers publicize the sensing tasks and are also the authorized parties to initiate sensed data dissemination. This paper proposes a novel social role and network coding based security distributed data dissemination algorithm referred as PRXeluge to overcome the shortcomings of existing centralized data dissemination algorithms. Unlike the existing participatory sensing applications, in PRXeluge, service provider just publicizes the sensing tasks and utilizes a conditional proxy re-signature technique to authorize different social roles such as authorized smartphone users to be utilized as a contracted picture reporters, which sense the data and directly disseminate the sensed large data. Furthermore, PRXeluge proposes the XOR (Exclusive-OR) network coding scheme on the basis of Seluge security framework. To maximize the number of successfully decoded packets, PRXeluge introduces a neighbor node table to determine the optimal coding scheme. Experimental results reveal that the proposed PRXeluge shows better performance in terms of lower data packet transmission and dissemination delay compared to that of Seluge. Furthermore, it is observed from the experiment that the proposed algorithm is stronger as compared to that of centralized scheme and performs the fine grain access control without giving any additional load to subscriber nodes.
