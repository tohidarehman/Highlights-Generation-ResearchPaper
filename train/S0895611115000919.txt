 This paper considers the problem of the CT based quantitative assessment of the craniosynostosis before and after the surgery. First, fast and efficient brain segmentation approach is proposed. The algorithm is robust to discontinuity of skull. As a result it can be applied both in pre- and post-operative cases. Additionally, image processing and analysis algorithms are proposed for describing the disease based on CT scans. The proposed algorithms automate determination of the standard linear indices used for assessment of the craniosynostosis (i.e. cephalic index CI and head circumference HC) and allow for planar and volumetric analysis which so far have not been reported. Results of applying the introduced methods to sample craniosynostotic cases before and after the surgery are presented and discussed. The results show that the proposed brain segmentation algorithm is characterized by high accuracy when applied both in the pre- and postoperative craniosynostosis, while the introduced planar and volumetric indices for the disease description may be helpful to distinguish between the types of the disease.

@highlight We propose a method for brain segmentation from CT scans in the craniosynostosis.
@highlight We propose algorithms for determination of indices used for craniosynostosis assessment.
@highlight We propose new planar and volumetric indices dedicated to assessment of the disease.
@highlight The proposed indices can be used to distinguishing between types of the craniosynostosis.
