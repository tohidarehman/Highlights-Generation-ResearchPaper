 Genetic evolution of carbonic anhydrase enzyme provides an interesting instance of functional similarity in spite of structural diversity of the members of a given family of enzymes. Phylogenetic analysis of α-, β- and γ-carbonic anhydrase was carried out to determine the evolutionary relationships among various members of the family with the enzyme marking its presence in a wide range of cellular and chromosomal locations. The presence of more than one class of enzymes in a particular organism was revealed by phylogenetic time tree. The evolutionary relationships among the members of animal, plant and microbial kingdom were developed. The study revises a long-established notion of kingdom-specificity of the different classes of carbonic anhydrases and provides a new version of the presence of multiple classes of carbonic anhydrases in a single organism and the presence of a given class of carbonic anhydrase across different kingdoms.

@highlight Phylogenetic analysis of isozymes of carbonic anhydrase family was carried out.
@highlight Kingdom-specificity of the members of the family was explored.
@highlight All the members of the family were discovered to be present in all three forms of life.
@highlight Evolution of active site across different classes of the members was carried out.
@highlight Similarity of sequences in the proximity of Zn ion was proposed to be responsible for functional similarity.
