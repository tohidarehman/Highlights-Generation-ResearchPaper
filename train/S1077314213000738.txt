 Segmenting the right ventricle (RV) in magnetic resonance (MR) images is required for cardiac function assessment. The segmentation of the RV is a difficult task due to low contrast with surrounding tissues and high shape variability. To overcome these problems, we introduce a segmentation method based on a statistical shape model obtained with a principal component analysis (PCA) on a set of representative shapes of the RV. Shapes are not represented by a set of points, but by distance maps to their contour, relaxing the need for a costly landmark detection and matching process. A shape model is thus obtained by computing a PCA on the shape variations. This prior is registered onto the image via a very simple user interaction and then incorporated into the well-known graph cut framework in order to guide the segmentation. Our semi-automatic segmentation method has been applied on 248 MR images of a publicly available dataset (from MICCAIâ€™12 Right Ventricle Segmentation Challenge). We show that encouraging results can be obtained for this challenging application.
