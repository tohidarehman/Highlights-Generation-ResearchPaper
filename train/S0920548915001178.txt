 The number of computers installed in urban and transport networks has grown tremendously in recent years, also the local processing capabilities and digital networking currently available. However, the heterogeneity of existing equipment in the field of ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems) and the large volume of information they handle, greatly hinder the interoperability of the equipment and the design of cooperative applications between devices currently installed in urban networks. While the dynamic discovery of information, composition and invocation of services through intelligent agents are a potential solution to these problems, all these technologies require intelligent management of information flows. In particular, it is necessary to wean these information flows of the technologies used, enabling universal interoperability between computers, regardless of the context in which they are located. The main objective of this paper is to propose a systematic methodology to create ontologies, using methods such as a semantic clustering algorithms for retrieval and representation of information. Using the proposed methodology, an ontology will be developed in the ITS domain. This ontology will serve as the basis of semantic information to a SS (Semantic Service) that allows the connection of new equipment to an urban network. The SS uses the CORBA standard as distributed communication architecture.

@highlight We propose a methodology to build ontology's in the domain of ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems).
@highlight We have proposed: DPK (Discrimination of Paragraphs with Keywords) and IRWDP (Retrieval with Weighted Data in Paragraphs).
@highlight The two new methods proposed, allow reducing the sample size of the study.
@highlight Much information irrelevant has been discarded, achieving greater performance in the ontology construction.
@highlight The methodologies proposed can be used to build ontologies in any domains.
