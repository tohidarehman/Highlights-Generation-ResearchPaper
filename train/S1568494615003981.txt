 Clustering multi-dense large scale high dimensional numeric datasets is a challenging task duo to high time complexity of most clustering algorithms. Nowadays, data collection tools produce a large amount of data. So, fast algorithms are vital requirement for clustering such data. In this paper, a fast clustering algorithm, called Dimension-based Partitioning and Merging (DPM), is proposed. In DPM, first, data is partitioned into small dense volumes during the successive processing of dataset dimensions. Then, noise is filtered out using dimensional densities of the generated partitions. Finally, merging process is invoked to construct clusters based on partition boundary data samples. DPM algorithm automatically detects the number of data clusters based on three insensitive tuning parameters which decrease the burden of its usage. Performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm using different datasets shows its fastness and accuracy compared to other clustering competitors.
