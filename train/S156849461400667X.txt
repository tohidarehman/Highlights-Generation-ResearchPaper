 The pyramidal dual-tree directional filter bank (PDTDFB) transform is a new image decomposition, which has many advantages, such as multiscale and multidirectional transform, efficient implementation, high angular resolution, low redundant ratio, and shiftable subbands. In this paper, we present a new color image segmentation algorithm based on PDTDFB domain hidden Markov tree (HMT) model. Firstly, the joint statistics and mutual information of the PDTDFB coefficients are studied. Then, the PDTDFB coefficients are modeled using a HMT model with Gaussian mixtures, which can effectively capture the intra-scale, inter-scale, and inter-direction dependencies. Finally, a color image segmentation using PDTDFB domain HMT model is developed, in which expectationâ€“maximization (EM) parameter estimation, Bayesian multiscale raw segmentation, context based multiscale fusion, and majority-vote based color component fusion are used. Experimental evidence shows that the proposed color image segmentation algorithm has very effective segmentation results in comparison with the state-of-the-art segmentation methods recently proposed in the literature.
