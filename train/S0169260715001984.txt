 In this paper, a new image segmentation method based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and outlier rejection combined with level set is proposed. A traditional approach to the segmentation of Magnetic Resonance (MR) images is the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm. The membership function of this conventional algorithm is sensitive to the outlier and does not integrate the spatial information in the image. The algorithm is very sensitive to noise and in-homogeneities in the image, moreover, it depends on cluster centers initialization. To improve the outlier rejection and to reduce the noise sensitivity of conventional FCM clustering algorithm, a novel extended FCM algorithm for image segmentation is presented. In general, in the FCM algorithm the initial cluster centers are chosen randomly, with the help of PSO algorithm the clusters centers are chosen optimally. Our algorithm takes also into consideration the spatial neighborhood information. These a priori are used in the cost function to be optimized. For MR images, the resulting fuzzy clustering is used to set the initial level set contour. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
