 Personalized medicine is to deliver the right drug to the right patient in the right dose. Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is to identify genetic variants that may affect drug efficacy and toxicity. The availability of a comprehensive and accurate PGx-specific drug–gene relationship knowledge base is important for personalized medicine. However, building a large-scale PGx-specific drug–gene knowledge base is a difficult task. In this study, we developed a bootstrapping, semi-supervised learning approach to iteratively extract and rank drug–gene pairs according to their relevance to drug pharmacogenomics. Starting with a single PGx-specific seed pair and 20 million MEDLINE abstracts, the extraction algorithm achieved a precision of 0.219, recall of 0.368 and F1 of 0.274 after two iterations, a significant improvement over the results of using non-PGx-specific seeds (precision: 0.011, recall: 0.018, and F1: 0.014) or co-occurrence (precision: 0.015, recall: 1.000, and F1: 0.030). After the extraction step, the ranking algorithm further improved the precision from 0.219 to 0.561 for top ranked pairs. By comparing to a dictionary-based approach with PGx-specific gene lexicon as input, we showed that the bootstrapping approach has better performance in terms of both precision and F1 (precision: 0.251 vs. 0.152, recall: 0.396 vs. 0.856 and F1: 0.292 vs. 0.254). By integrative analysis using a large drug adverse event database, we have shown that the extracted drug–gene pairs strongly correlate with drug adverse events. In conclusion, we developed a novel semi-supervised bootstrapping approach for effective PGx-specific drug–gene pair extraction from large number of MEDLINE articles with minimal human input.
