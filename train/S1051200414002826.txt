 The enhancement of monitoring biosignals plays a crucial role to thrive successfully computer-assisted diagnosis, ergo the deployment of outstanding approaches is an ongoing field of research demand. In the present article, a computational prototype for preprocessing short daytime polysomnographic (sdPSG) recordings based on advanced estimation techniques is introduced. The postulated model is capable of performing data segmentation, baseline correction, whitening, embedding artefacts removal and noise cancellation upon multivariate sdPSG data sets. The methodological framework includes Karhunen–Loève Transformation (KLT), Blind Source Separation with Second Order Statistics (BSS-SOS) and Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) to attain low-order, time-to-diagnosis efficiency and modular autonomy. The data collected from 10 voluntary subjects were preprocessed by the model, in order to evaluate the withdrawal of noisy and artefactual activity from electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrooculographic (EOG) channels. The performance metrics are distinguished in qualitative (visual inspection) and quantitative manner, such as: Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). The computational model demonstrated a complete artefact rejection in 80% of the preprocessed epochs, 4 to 8 dB for residual error and 12 to 30 dB in signal-to-noise gain after denoising trial. In comparison to previous approaches, N-way ANOVA tests were conducted to attest the prowess of the system in the improvement of electrophysiological signals to forthcoming processing and classification stages.
