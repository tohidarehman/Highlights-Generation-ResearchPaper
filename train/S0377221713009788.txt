 In this paper we propose a heuristic for solving the problem of resource constrained preemptive scheduling in the two-stage flowshop with one machine at the first stage and parallel unrelated machines at the second stage, where renewable resources are shared among the stages, so some quantities of the same resource can be used at different stages at the same time. Availability of every resource at any moment is limited and resource requirements of jobs are arbitrary. The objective is minimization of makespan. The problem is NP-hard. The heuristic first sequences jobs on the machine at stage 1 and then solves the preemptive scheduling problem at stage 2. Priority rules which depend on processing times and resource requirements of jobs are proposed for sequencing jobs at stage 1. A column generation algorithm which involves linear programming, a tabu search algorithm and a greedy procedure is proposed to minimize the makespan at stage 2. A lower bound on the optimal makespan in which sharing of the resources between the stages is taken into account is also derived. The performance of the heuristic evaluated experimentally by comparing the solutions to the lower bound is satisfactory.
