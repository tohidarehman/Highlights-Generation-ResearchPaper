 This paper focuses on the architecture and FPGA implementation aspects of a kind of assistive tool for disabled persons with motor neuron diseases, specifically with muscle atrophy. The tool, called a communication interface, allows such persons to communicate with other people by means of moving selected muscles, e.g., within the face. The application of MEMS accelerometers have been proposed as muscle movement sensors. Four different FPGA implementation methods of signal processing from MEMS sensors, i.e., manual HDL coding, usage of the Matlab HDL coder and Vivado HLS as well as embedded microcontroller exploitation, have been investigated. The communication interface can be used either as an input switch for, so called, virtual keyboards or as a stand-alone tool, which allows disabled persons to write a text by means of the Morse code.

@highlight The usage of MEMS accelerometers have been proposed as muscles activity sensors for disabled peoples.
@highlight A complete assistive tool prototype, based on FPGA chip, has been presented.
@highlight The tool can be used either as an input switch for virtual keyboards or as a stand-alone tool.
@highlight As a stand-alone tool, the communication interface allows disabled persons to write a text by means of the Morse code.
@highlight To eliminate the necessity of dealing with unstable Morse code, the usage of two sensors has been proposed.
@highlight Four different FPGA implementation methods of a digital signal processing algorithm, namely: manual HDL coding, usage of the Matlab HDL coder, Xilinx Vivado HLS and embedded soft-microcontroller, have been investigated and compared.
