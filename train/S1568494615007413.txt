 The recently-proposed Zhang dynamics (ZD) has been proven to achieve success for solving the linear-equality constrained time-varying quadratic program ideally when time goes to infinity. The convergence performance is a significant improvement, as compared to the gradient-based dynamics (GD) that cannot make the error converge to zero even after infinitely long time. However, this ZD model with the suggested activation functions cannot reach the theoretical time-varying solution in finite time, which may limit its applications in real-time calculation. Therefore, a nonlinearly-activated neurodynamic model is proposed and studied in this paper for real-time solution of the equality-constrained quadratic optimization with nonstationary coefficients. Compared with existing neurodynamic models (specifically the GD model and the ZD model) for optimization, the proposed neurodynamic model possesses the much superior convergence performance (i.e., finite-time convergence). Furthermore, the upper bound of the finite convergence time is derived analytically according to Lyapunov theory. Both theoretical and simulative results verify the efficacy and superior of the nonlinearly-activated neurodynamic model, as compared to these of the GD and ZD models.
