 The annotation of image and video data of large datasets is a fundamental task in multimedia information retrieval and computer vision applications. The aim of annotation tools is to relieve the user from the burden of the manual annotation as much as possible. To achieve this ideal goal, many different functionalities are required in order to make the annotations process as automatic as possible. Motivated by the limitations of existing tools, we have developed the iVAT: an interactive Video Annotation Tool. It supports manual, semi-automatic and automatic annotations through the interaction of the user with various detection algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first tool that integrates several computer vision algorithms working in an interactive and incremental learning framework. This makes the tool flexible and suitable to be used in different application domains. A quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the proposed tool on a challenging case study domain is presented and discussed. Results demonstrate that the use of the semi-automatic, as well as the automatic, modality drastically reduces the human effort while preserving the quality of the annotations.
