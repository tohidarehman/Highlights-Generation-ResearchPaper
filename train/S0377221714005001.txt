 The stochastic variability measures the degree of uncertainty for random demand and/or price in various operations problems. Its ordering property under mean-preserving transformation allows us to study the impact of demand/price uncertainty on the optimal decisions and the associated objective values. Based on Chebyshevâ€™s algebraic inequality, we provide a general framework for stochastic variability ordering under any mean-preserving transformation that can be parameterized by a single scalar, and apply it to a broad class of specific transformations, including the widely used mean-preserving affine transformation, truncation, and capping. The application to mean-preserving affine transformation rectifies an incorrect proof of an important result in the inventory literature, which has gone unnoticed for more than two decades. The application to mean-preserving truncation addresses inventory strategies in decentralized supply chains, and the application to mean-preserving capping sheds light on using option contracts for procurement risk management.
