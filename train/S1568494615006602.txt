 In optimization, the performance of differential evolution (DE) and their hybrid versions exist in the literature is highly affected by the inappropriate choice of its operators like mutation and crossover. In general practice, during simulation DE does not employ any strategy of memorizing the so-far-best results obtained in the initial part of the previous generation. In this paper, a new “Memory based DE (MBDE)” presented where two “swarm operators” have been introduced. These operators based on the pBEST and gBEST mechanism of particle swarm optimization. The proposed MBDE is employed to solve 12 basic, 25 CEC 2005, and 30 CEC 2014 unconstrained benchmark functions. In order to further test its efficacy, five different test system of model order reduction (MOR) problem for single-input and single-output system are solved by MBDE. The results of MBDE are compared with state-of-the-art algorithms that also solved those problems. Numerical, statistical, and graphical analysis reveals the competency of the proposed MBDE.
