 Objective The effective and efficient assessment, management, and evolution of surgical processes are intrinsic to excellent patient care. Hence, in addition to economic interests, the quality of the outcome is of great importance. Process benchmarking examines the compliance of an intraoperative surgical process to another process that is considered as best practice. The objective of this work is to assess the relationship between the course and the outcome of surgical processes of the study. Materials and methods By assessing 450 skill practices on rapid prototyping models in minimally invasive surgery training, we extracted descriptions of surgical processes and examined the hypothesis that a significant relationship exists between the course of a surgical process and the quality of its outcome. Results The results showed a significant correlation with Person correlation coefficients >0.05 between the quality of process outcome and process compliance for simple and complex suturing tasks in the study. Conclusions We conclude that high process compliance supports good quality outcomes and, therefore, excellent patient care. We also showed that a deviation from best training processes led to a decreased outcome quality. This is relevant for identifying requirements for surgical processes, for generating feedback for the surgeon with regard to human factors and for inducing changes in the workflow in order to improve the outcome quality.

@highlight We assess the relation of processes and outcome quality for surgical processes.
@highlight The assessment is performed on 450 training tasks in laparoscopic surgery.
@highlight There is a strong correlation between best practice processes and training outcome.
