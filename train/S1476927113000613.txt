 The structural dynamics of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit were modeled using molecular dynamics computational methods. It was shown that the structure of this protein as well as its complexes with ATP and peptide ligand PKI(5-24) consisted of a large number of rapidly inter-converting conformations which could be grouped into subsets proceeding from their similarity. This cluster analysis revealed that conformations which correspond to the “opened” and “closed” structures of the protein were already present in the free enzyme, and most surprisingly co-existed in enzyme–ATP and enzyme–PKI(5-24) complexes as well as in the ternary complex, which included both of these ligands. The results also demonstrated that the most mobile structure segments of the protein were located in the regions of substrate binding sites and that their dynamics were most significantly affected by the binding of the ATP and peptide ligand.
