 Effective conservation planning relies on the accurate identification of anthropogenic land cover. However, accessing localized information can be difficult or impossible in developing countries. Additionally, global medium-resolution land use land cover datasets may be insufficient for conservation planning purposes at the scale of a country or smaller. We thus introduce a new tool, GE Grids, to bridge this gap. This tool creates an interactive user-specified binary grid laid over Google Earth's high-resolution imagery. Using GE Grids, we manually identified anthropogenic land conversion across East Africa and compared this against available land cover datasets. Nearly 30% of East Africa is converted to anthropogenic land cover. The two highest-resolution comparative datasets have the greatest agreement with our own at the regional extent, despite having as low as 44% agreement at the country level. We achieved 83% consistency among users. GE Grids is intended to complement existing remote sensing datasets at local scales. Grids is a web application written in Javascript using the Google Earth application programming interface (API), which is freely available from Google. The program requires a web browser, the Google Earth plug-in and internet connectivity. The codebase is maintained and can be downloaded as a zip file from . The zip file contains a.html file, accessory files, and a ReadMe file. Use the ReadMe file for suggestions on program instruction and notes on Google's Terms of Service. GE Grids is free, regulated under the GNU General Public License v3 () and intended for further open-source development. The developer is Andrew Stanish (andybp85@gmail.com).
