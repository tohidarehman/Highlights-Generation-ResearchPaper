 Hyper-heuristics are (meta-)heuristics that operate at a higher level to choose or generate a set of low-level (meta-)heuristics in an attempt of solve difficult optimization problems. Iterated local search (ILS) is a well-known approach for discrete optimization, combining perturbation and hill-climbing within an iterative framework. In this study, we introduce an ILS approach, strengthened by a hyper-heuristic which generates heuristics based on a fixed number of add and delete operations. The performance of the proposed hyper-heuristic is tested across two different problem domains using real world benchmark of course timetabling instances from the second International Timetabling Competition Tracks 2 and 3. The results show that mixing add and delete operations within an ILS framework yields an effective hyper-heuristic approach.

@highlight Add and delete operations are encoded as a list/string of integers (ADL).
@highlight An effective hyper-heuristic approach operating with ADLs is proposed.
@highlight Low level heuristics perform search over the space of feasible solutions.
@highlight Proposed approach produces new best solutions to some instances.
@highlight Proposed approach achieves generality across two variants of the timetabling problem.
