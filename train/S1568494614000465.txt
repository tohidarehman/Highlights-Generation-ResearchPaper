 Knowledge management (KM) adoption in the supply chain (SC) needs high investment as well as few changes in culture of entire SC. This study proposes a prediction framework based on the fuzzy decision-making trail and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) for KM adoption in SC. This study first identifying the evaluation criteria of KM adoption in SC from literature review and expert opinion. Further, it uses fuzzy DEMATEL to evaluate weighting of each evaluation criteria's, after that FMCDM method uses to obtain possible rating of success of KM adoption in SC. The proposed approach is helpful to predict the success of KM adoption in SC without actually adopted KM in SC. It also enables organizations to decide whether to initiate KM, restrain adoption or undertake remedial improvements to increase the possibility of successful KM adoption in SC. This prominent advantage can be considered as one of the contribution of this paper. This proposed approach demonstrated with empirical case of a hydraulic valve manufacturing organization in India.
