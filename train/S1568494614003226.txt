 This paper presents an approach where differential evolution is applied to underwater glider path planning. The objective of a glider is to reach a target location and gather research data along its path by propelling itself underwater and returning periodically to the surface. The main hypothesis of this work is that gliders operational capabilities will benefit from improved path planning, especially when dealing with opportunistic short-term missions focused on the sampling of dynamic structures. To model a glider trajectory, we evolve a global underwater glider path based on the local kinematic simulation of an underwater glider, considering the daily and hourly sea currents predictions. The global path is represented by control points where the glider is expected to resurface for communication with a satellite and to receive further navigation instructions. Some well known differential evolution instance algorithms are then assessed and compared on 12 test scenarios using the proposed approach. Finally, a real case glider vessel mission was commanded using this approach.
