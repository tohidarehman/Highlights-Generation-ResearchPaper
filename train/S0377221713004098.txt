 Transductive learning involves the construction and application of prediction models to classify a fixed set of decision objects into discrete groups. It is a special case of classification analysis with important applications in web-mining, corporate planning and other areas. This paper proposes a novel transductive classifier that is based on the philosophy of discrete support vector machines. We formalize the task to estimate the class labels of decision objects as a mixed integer program. A memetic algorithm is developed to solve the mathematical program and to construct a transductive support vector machine classifier, respectively. Empirical experiments on synthetic and real-world data evidence the effectiveness of the new approach and demonstrate that it identifies high quality solutions in short time. Furthermore, the results suggest that the class predictions following from the memetic algorithm are significantly more accurate than the predictions of a CPLEX-based reference classifier. Comparisons to other transductive and inductive classifiers provide further support for our approach and suggest that it performs competitive with respect to several benchmarks.
