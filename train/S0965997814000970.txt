 Structural optimization with frequency constraints is a challenging class of optimization problems characterized by highly non-linear and non-convex search spaces. When using a meta-heuristic algorithm to solve a problem of this kind, exploration/exploitation balance is a key feature to control the performance of the algorithm. An excessively exploitative algorithm might focus on certain areas of the search space ignoring the others. On the other hand, an algorithm that is too explorative overlooks high quality solutions as a result of not performing adequate local search. This paper compares nine multi-agent meta-heuristic algorithms for sizing and layout optimization of truss structures with frequency constraints. The variation of the diversity index during the optimization history is analyzed in order to inspect exploration/exploitation properties of each algorithm. It appears that there is a significant relationship between the algorithm efficiency and the evolution of the diversity index.
