 Without an approach accepted by the communities at large, domain disagreements will continue to thwart current global efforts to harmonize information models. The research presented here reviewed current standardization activities. A number of observations and possible solutions are proposed to address the topic of standardizing long term access to multi-discipline Earth System archives by considering the application of the knowledge base concept to facilitate data interpretation. Finally, we present a case study as an initial entry point for the further discussion about standardization.

@highlight We report standardization activities on multi-disciplinary Earth System Science.
@highlight We propose the standardization across multiple disciplines in long term.
@highlight We consider the application of the knowledge base concept to facilitate data interpretation.
@highlight Both common and domain requirements are considered.
@highlight Knowledge gap issues between the source and target communities are addressed.
