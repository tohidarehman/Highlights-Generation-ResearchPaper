 This study explores a new way to integrate advanced display technology into educational activities for children with different disabilities. A free interactive mobile augmented reality (AR) application was developed to facilitate the learning of geometry. Twenty-one elementary school children participated in an experiment. The results show that the AR system could help the school children to finish puzzle game activities independent of teacherâ€™s assistance. With the use of AR display technology, the participants demonstrated improved ability to complete puzzle game tasks when compared to the use of traditional paper-based methods. Performance data indicated that the use of AR technology could enhance learning motivation and frustration tolerance in children with special needs.

@highlight Mobile devices with a free application were used to design teaching materials.
@highlight Augmented reality techniques transform display methods to help children perform tasks independently.
@highlight The experimental data shows that participants could complete tasks using AR support.
