 In this paper, a novel region-based fuzzy active contour model with kernel metric is proposed for a robust and stable image segmentation. This model can detect the boundaries precisely and work well with images in the presence of noise, outliers and low contrast. It segments an image into two regions â€“ the object and the background by the minimization of a predefined energy function. Due to the kernel metric incorporated in the energy and the fuzziness of the energy, the active contour evolves very stably without the reinitialization for the level set function during the evolution. Here the fuzziness provides the model with a strong ability to reject local minima and the kernel metric is employed to construct a nonlinear version of energy function based on a level set framework. This new fuzzy and nonlinear version of energy function makes the updating of region centers more robust against the noise and outliers in an image. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed model achieves a much better balance between accuracy and efficiency compared with other active contour models.
