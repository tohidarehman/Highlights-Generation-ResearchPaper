 The present paper introduces an investigation into simultaneous optimization of the PbLaZrTi-based actuator configuration and corresponding applied light intensity for morphing beam structural shapes. A finite element formulation for multiphysics analysis of coupled opto-electro-thermo-mechanical fields in PbLaZrTi ceramics is derived and verified with the theoretical solution and the commercial software ANSYS. This element is then used to simulate beam bending shape control using the orthotropic PbLaZrTi actuators and the simultaneous optimization. In this procedure, the controlling and geometrical variables are simultaneously optimized via a hierarchical genetic algorithm. A bi-coded chromosome is proposed in a hierarchical mode, which consists of some control genes (i.e. actuator location and number) and parametric genes (i.e. applied light intensity). Whether the parametric gene is activated or not is managed by the value of the first-grade control genes. The numerical results demonstrate that the achieved beam bending shapes correlate remarkably well with the expected ones and the simultaneous optimization of photostrictive actuator locations, numbers and light intensities can result in optimal actuator layout with less PbLaZrTi actuators and irradiated light energy. The simulation results also show that the hierarchical genetic algorithm has more superior performance over the conventional real-coded genetic algorithm.
