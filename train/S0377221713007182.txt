 Because most commercial passenger airlines operate on a hub-and-spoke network, small disturbances can cause major disruptions in their planned schedules and have a significant impact on their operational costs and performance. When a disturbance occurs, the airline often applies a recovery policy in order to quickly resume normal operations. We present in this paper a large neighborhood search heuristic to solve an integrated aircraft and passenger recovery problem. The problem consists of creating new aircraft routes and passenger itineraries to produce a feasible schedule during the recovery period. The method is based on an existing heuristic, developed in the context of the 2009 ROADEF Challenge, which alternates between three phases: construction, repair and improvement. We introduce a number of refinements in each phase so as to perform a more thorough search of the solution space. The resulting heuristic performs very well on the instances introduced for the challenge, obtaining the best known solution for 17 out of 22 instances within five minutes of computing time and 21 out of 22 instances within 10minutes of computing time.

@highlight We propose refinements to an LNS heuristic for aircraft and passenger recovery.
@highlight Additional steps were developed to address the aircraft and airport disruptions.
@highlight The resulting heuristic quickly provides very good solutions to the problem.
@highlight We show that increasing the computing time improves solution cost.
