 Intrinsic shape matching has become the standard approach for pose invariant correspondence estimation among deformable shapes. Most existing approaches assume global consistency. While global isometric matching is well understood, only a few heuristic solutions are known for partial matching. Partial matching is particularly important for robustness to topological noise, which is a common problem in real-world scanner data. We introduce a new approach to partial isometric matching based on the observation that isometries are fully determined by local information: a map of a single point and its tangent space fixes an isometry. We develop a new representation for partial isometric maps based on equivalence classes of correspondences between pairs of points and their tangent-spaces. We apply our approach to register partial point clouds and compare it to the state-of-the-art methods, where we obtain significant improvements over global methods for real-world data and stronger guarantees than previous partial matching algorithms.
