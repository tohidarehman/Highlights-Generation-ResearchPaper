 A series of Eu3+-activated Li2Mg2(WO4)3 (LMW) materials were synthesized by high temperature solid state reactions. The phosphor can be effectively excited by 394nm near ultraviolet light and emit intense red light with high color purity. Prepared phosphors can be indexed to LMW with particular lyonsite structure. The occupation of Eu3+ in LMW is selective. Most of Eu3+ comes into 1A sites without inversion symmetry. The present research suggests that LMW is a suitable host for luminescence applications and Eu3+-activated LMW is a promising phosphor for phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes.
