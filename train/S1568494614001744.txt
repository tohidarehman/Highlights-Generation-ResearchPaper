 This paper investigates the use of fuzzy logic control together with Genetic Algorithm (GA) to tune corresponding membership functions in a pulse width modulation voltage (PWM)-based converter for battery charging. For quick charging purposes, a current-charging mode is built on the charging battery series with small impedance resistance. Once the rechargeable battery voltage reaches the preset output voltage value during the current-charging mode, constant voltage-charging mode should take to do the battery charging. No matter what you use a voltage/current mode for battery charging, the PWM converter with tuning duty cycle is necessary to obtain various output voltages to charge battery. The proposed pulse width modulation (PWM) control strategy based on fuzzy logic systems is applied to charge batteries for buck converter. A simulation is proposed to illustrate the efficiency of the design proposed in this paper.
