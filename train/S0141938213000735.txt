 The current study investigates the effects of 3D displays (shuttered display vs. polarized display). People experienced superior fidelity and brightness when they watched 2D still images on a shuttered display, rather than on a polarized display. Conversely, people experienced greater brightness when they watched 3D still images on a polarized display, rather than on a shuttered display. Second, people were able to read a smaller font or characters on a shuttered display than on a polarized display. Third, people noticed flickering on a shuttered display when they watched 3D images. Fourth, people experienced greater brightness when they watched 3D moving images on a shuttered display, rather than on a shuttered display. The perceived brightness of the screen positively correlated with enjoyment, content satisfaction, and 3DTV satisfaction when the viewers watched a 3D movie. The flickering, on the other hand, has a negative correlation with enjoyment and 3DTV satisfaction.

@highlight We examined the effects of 3D displays (shuttered and polarized displays) on the viewers.
@highlight People experience brightness or fidelity differently depending on the image conditions (2D or 3D).
@highlight Readability on a shuttered display is greater than a polarized display.
@highlight Brightness positively correlated with the effects on the viewers.
@highlight Flickering negatively correlated with the effects on the viewers.
