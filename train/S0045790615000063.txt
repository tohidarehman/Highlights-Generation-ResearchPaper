 Wavelet packet (WP) acoustic features are found to be very promising in unvoiced phoneme classification task but they are less effective to capture periodic information from voiced speech. This motivated us to develop a wavelet packet based feature extraction technique that signifies both the periodic and aperiodic information. This method is based on parallel distributed processing technique inspired by the human speech perception process. This front end feature processing technique employs Equivalent Rectangular Bandwidth (ERB) filter like wavelet speech feature extraction method called Wavelet ERB Sub-band based Periodicity and Aperiodicity Decomposition (WERB-SPADE). Winer filter is used at front end to minimize the noise for further processing. The speech signal is filtered by 24 band ERB like wavelet filter banks, and then the output of each sub-band is processed through comb filter. Each comb filter is designed individually for each sub-band to decompose the signal into periodic and aperiodic features. Thus it carries the periodic information without losing certain important information like formant transition incorporated in aperiodic features. Hindi phoneme classification experiments with a standard HMM recognizer under both clean-training and multi-training condition is conducted. This technique shows significant improvement in voiced phoneme class without affecting the performance of unvoiced phoneme class.
