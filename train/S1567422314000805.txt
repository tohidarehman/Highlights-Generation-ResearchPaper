 No research has quantitatively investigated knowledge contribution from the perspective of community support and leader support. Drawing on social exchange theory and organizational support theory, this study develops a model of perceived community support and leader support for knowledge contribution in online knowledge communities. The research model was tested using survey data collected from 169 online knowledge community users. The result shows that perceived community support and perceived leader support positively affect usersâ€™ knowledge contribution. Additionally, we identified the antecedents of perceived community support and leader support. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
