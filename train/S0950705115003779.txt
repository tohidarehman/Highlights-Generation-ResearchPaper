 E-learning and online education have made great strides in the recent past. It has moved from a knowledge transfer model to a highly intellect, swift and interactive proposition capable of advanced decision-making abilities. Two challenges have been observed during the exploration of recent developments in e-learning. Firstly, to incorporate e-learning systems effectively in the evolving semantic web environment and secondly, to realize adaptive personalization according to the learner's changing behavior. An ontology-driven system has proposed to implement the Felder-Silverman learning style model in addition to the learning contents, to validate its integration with the semantic web environment. Software agents are employed to monitor the learner's actual learning style and modify them accordingly. The learner's learning style and their modifications are made within the proposed e-learning system. Cloud storage is used as the primary back-end in order to maintain the ontology, databases and other required server resources. To verify the system, comparisons are made between the information presented and adaptive learning styles of the learner along with actions of agents according to learners' behavior. Finally, various conclusions are drawn by exploring the learner's behavior in an adaptive environment for the proposed e-learning system.

@highlight DL Query is used to extract information from content stored in the ontology.
@highlight The Felder Silverman model is used to determine learning styles of learner's.
@highlight JADE agents monitor learner's behavior to provide adaptive learning.
@highlight Deployments on cloud enable scope for expanding the content stored on an ontology.
@highlight The proposed system supports the vision ofÂ Semantic web education learning (SWEL).
