 Family member presence may contribute to the healing of hospitalized patients, but may also be in conflict with the perceived needs of delivering intensive care. We detail our experience with “opening the doors” of the intensive care unit (ICU), allowing family members to be present and participate in the care of loved ones without restriction. “Opening the doors” challenged the traditions, legacy and sense of professional entitlement that were a part of ICU culture and generated considerable initial resistance among nurses and physicians. We describe our “opening the doors” transformation to more patient- and family-centered care in four steps:  enlist support of administrative and local leaders;  create a collective aim;  test on a small scale, and  scale up after initial successes. Preparing ICU staff so that they are comfortable with more “on stage” time (i.e., greater family presence) was critical to our success. “Opening the doors” now serves as a guiding vision to organizing the ICU’s work.

@highlight “Opening the doors” means minimizing barriers that (1) physically separate patients and their loved ones; (2) impede access to regular exchanges of information; and (3) interfere with shared decision-making.
@highlight “Opening the doors” requires a shift in culture from policies designed for provider benefit to new processes designed to meet the needs of patient/family.
@highlight “Opening the doors” requires expert change management from all leadership levels.
@highlight “Opening the doors” requires testing on a small scale and a method to spread effective, new processes.
@highlight “Opening the doors” exposes much more of our care to the eyes and ears of families. All clinicians must prepare for more “on stage” time.
