 Satellites situated in the orbit of Mars have provided and continue providing thousand of images of the planet surface. Nevertheless the number of expert geologists analyzing these images is limited. Typically, these experts provide linguistic descriptions of their observations remarking the relevant features in the image and ignoring the irrelevant details for a given goal. In this paper, we apply our research in the field of Computational Theory of Perceptions to the challenge of developing computational systems able to generate linguistic reports comparable with the ones provided by human experts. We present a description of our contribution to solve this problem including last results of our research in this field. For example, we explore how to represent the multidimensional domain of computational perception values. We develop up the use of the relevance as an attribute of perceptions that allows us to generate reports that are automatically suited according to the user goals. We provide an application example as a demonstration of concept.

@highlight A methodology for linguistic description of the Marsâ€™ surface is proposed.
@highlight We contribute to the field of linguistic description of complex phenomena.
@highlight Our approach allows generating a great variety of customizable linguistic reports.
@highlight The experiments demonstrated the great expressiveness of the presented resources.
