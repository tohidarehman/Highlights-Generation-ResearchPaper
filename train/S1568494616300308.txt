 Improperly tuned wavelet neural network (WNN) has been shown to exhibit unsatisfactory generalization performance. In this study, the tuning is done by an improved fuzzy C-means algorithm, that utilizes a novel similarity measure. This similarity measure takes the orientation as well as the distance into account. The modified WNN was first applied to a benchmark problem. Performance assessments with other approaches were made subsequently. Next, the feasibility of the proposed WNN in forecasting the chaotic Mackeyâ€“Glass time series and a real world application problem, i.e., blood glucose level prediction, were studied. An assessment analysis demonstrated that this presented WNN was superior in terms of prediction accuracy.
