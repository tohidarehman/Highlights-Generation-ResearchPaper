 In this paper, the problem of designing weighted fusion robust time-varying Kalman predictors is considered for multisensor time-varying systems with uncertainties of noise variances. Using the minimax robust estimation principle and the unbiased linear minimum variance (ULMV) rule, based on the worst-case conservative system with the conservative upper bounds of noise variances, the local and five weighted fused robust time-varying Kalman predictors are designed, which include a robust weighted measurement fuser, three robust weighted state fusers, and a robust covariance intersection (CI) fuser. Their actual prediction error variances are guaranteed to have the corresponding minimal upper bounds for all admissible uncertainties of noise variances. Their robustness is proved based on the proposed Lyapunov equation approach. The concept of the robust accuracy is presented, and the robust accuracy relations are proved. The corresponding steady-state robust local and fused Kalman predictors are also presented, and the convergence in a realization between the time-varying and steady-state robust Kalman predictors is proved by the dynamic error system analysis (DESA) method and the dynamic variance error system analysis (DVESA) method. Simulation results show the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed results.
