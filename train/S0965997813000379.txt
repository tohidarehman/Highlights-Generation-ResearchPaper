 In this paper a simple and efficient algorithm for computing Boolean operations on polygons is presented. The algorithm works with almost any kind of input polygons: concave polygons, polygons with holes, several contours and self-intersecting edges. Important topological information, as the holes of the result polygon, is computed.
