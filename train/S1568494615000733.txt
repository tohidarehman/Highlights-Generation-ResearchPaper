 In this paper, a new multi-objective approach for the routing problem in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) is proposed. It takes into account Quality of Service (QoS) requirements such as delay and the Expected Transmission Count (ETX). Classical approximations optimize a single objective or QoS parameter, not taking into account the conflicting nature of these parameters which leads to sub-optimal solutions. The case studies applying the proposed approach show clear improvements on the QoS routing solutions. For example, in terms of delay, the approximate mean improvement ratios obtained for scenarios 1 and 2 were of 15 and 28 times, respectively.
