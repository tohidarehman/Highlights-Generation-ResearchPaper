 The widespread use and applicability of Evolutionary Algorithms is due in part to the ability to adapt them to a particular problem-solving context by tuning their parameters. This is one of the problems that a user faces when applying an Evolutionary Algorithm to solve a given problem. Before running the algorithm, the user typically has to specify values for a number of parameters, such as population size, selection rate, and probability operators. This paper empirically assesses the performance of an automatic parameter tuning system in order to avoid the problems of time requirements and the interaction of parameters. The system, based on Bayesian Networks and Case-Based Reasoning methodology, estimates the best parameter setting for maximizing the performance of Evolutionary Algorithms. The algorithms are applied to solve a basic problem in constraint-based, geometric parametric modeling, as an instance of general constraint-satisfaction problems. The experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed system and its potential effectiveness for configuring algorithms.
