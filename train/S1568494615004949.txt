 Recently, people have been able to connect with different types of networks anytime, anywhere using advanced network technologies. In order to properly distribute wireless network resources among different clients, this work proposed a user mobility prediction algorithm, which takes the coverage of different kinds of base stations, and the volatile mobility of pedestrians, vehicles, and mass transportation, into consideration. In addition, a novel bandwidth utilization optimization technique is proposed in the algorithm to allocate bandwidth more efficiently. The Hybrid Genetic Algorithm, which combines the Genetic Algorithm and local searches to improve the frequency of finding a Pareto set, is used to realize the optimization problem as well. Compared with our previous work and the other four methods in the literature, the simulation results show that our proposed work can achieve desirable performance by network utilization, throughput, and QoS quality in the heterogeneous wireless networks.
