 In general, in order for individuals to take part in a lottery, they must purchase physical lottery tickets from a store. However, due to the popularity and portability of smart phones, this paper proposes a lottery entry purchase protocol for joint multi-participants in a mobile environment. This method integrates cryptology, including elliptic curve cryptography and public key infrastructure, enabling users to safely and fairly join a lottery via a mobile device. The lottery organization involves an untraceable tamperproof decryptor to generate the winning numbers, and the generation of those winning numbers is fair and publicly verifiable. All participants share an equal probability of winning the prize. Subsequently, a comparison table shows that the proposed protocol can withstand attacks and efficiently satisfy the known requirements in a mobile environment. In addition, this study also ensures public verification and mutual authentication.
