 We propose the 3dSOBS+ algorithm, a newly designed approach for moving object detection based on a neural background model automatically generated by a self-organizing method. The algorithm is able to accurately handle scenes containing moving backgrounds, gradual illumination variations, and shadows cast by moving objects, and is robust against false detections for different types of videos taken with stationary cameras. Experimental results and comparisons conducted on the Background Models Challenge benchmark dataset demonstrate the improvements achieved by the proposed algorithm, that compares well with the state-of-the-art methods.
