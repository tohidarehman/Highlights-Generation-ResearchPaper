 Careful design of information privacy policies is one significant means to induce providing personal information. This research takes three design elements – length, visibility, and specificity – and tests their effectiveness to address information sensitivity, measuring perceived importance and relevance of the policy to decisions to share personal information. The experiment results show that visibility and specificity takes priority. Furthermore, high information sensitivity conditions induce higher perceptions of importance and relevance. Research implications suggest that managers should consider maximizing the benefits of these policy characteristics to induce consumers to read the policy and make it a significant consideration in sharing personal information.

@highlight This study proposes that privacy policies’ characteristics significantly affect perceptions of importance and relevance.
@highlight This study used an experiment procedure using two respondent groups based on sensitivity of information asked.
@highlight The clarity of the policy has the strongest influence on importance.
@highlight Visibility has the strongest influence on relevance.
@highlight Respondents faced with high information sensitivity conditions perceived higher importance and relevance.
