 In this paper, artifact removal from biomedical signals is addressed. We particularly focus on removing ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact from EEG. BCG mainly appears in EEG signals during simultaneous EEGâ€“fMRI recordings. Different from most existing artifact removal techniques, we propose a method based on dictionary learning framework. Due to strength of sparsifying dictionaries in applications such as image denoising, it is expected to succeed in BCG removal task as well. This is investigated in the proposed approach where a dictionary is learned from original EEG recording. The dictionary is designed to locally model BCG characteristics. After achieving the dictionary, BCG can be simply subtracted from the original signal and the clean EEG is obtained. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real data confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results reveal the flexibility of learned dictionary for modeling the fluctuations in artifact, and removing it from original EEG signals.

@highlight A novel method based on dictionary learning is proposed for BCG removal from EEG data, simultaneously recorded with fMRI.
@highlight Review of existing BCG removal techniques is presented.
@highlight Original dictionary learning approach is explained.
@highlight A new cost function, having the generic dictionary learning as its core, is proposed.
@highlight The solution to the proposed cost function can model BCG artifact and then remove it from EEG recordings.
