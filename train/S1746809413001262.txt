 In this paper, a robust algorithm for disease type determination in brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) is presented. The proposed method classifies MRI into normal or one of the seven different diseases. At first two-level two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D DWT) of input image is calculated. Our analysis show that the wavelet coefficients of detail sub-bands can be modeled by generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) statistical model. The parameters of GARCH model are considered as the primary feature vector. After feature vector normalization, principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are used to extract the proper features and remove the redundancy from the primary feature vector. Finally, the extracted features are applied to the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers separately to determine the normal image or disease type. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves high classification rate and outperforms recently introduced methods while it needs less number of features for classification.
