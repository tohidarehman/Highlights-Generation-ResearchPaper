 Two important problems arising in traditional asset allocation methods are the sensitivity to estimation error of portfolio weights and the high dimensionality of the set of candidate assets. In this paper, we address both issues by proposing a new criterion for portfolio selection. The new criterion is a two-stage description of the available information, where the q-entropy, a generalized measure of information, is used to code the uncertainty of the data given the parametric model and the uncertainty related to the model choice. The information about the model is coded in terms of a prior distribution that promotes asset weights sparsity. Our approach carries out model selection and estimation in a single step, by selecting a few assets and estimating their portfolio weights simultaneously. The resulting portfolios are doubly robust, in the sense that they can tolerate deviations from both assumed data model and prior distribution for model parameters. Empirical results on simulated and real-world data support the validity of our approach.

@highlight We propose a methodology based on the minimization of a description length criterion.
@highlight We propose a re-weighting algorithm to compute sparse and robust portfolios.
@highlight Validation on simulated and real-world financial data support our method.
