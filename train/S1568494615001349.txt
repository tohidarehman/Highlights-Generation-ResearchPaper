 In the design of predictive controllers (MPC), parameterisation of degrees of freedom by Laguerre functions, has shown to improve the controller performance and feasible region. However, an open question remains: how to select the optimal tuning parameters? Moreover, optimality will depend on the size of the feasible region of the controller, the system's closed-loop performance and the online computational cost of the algorithm. This paper develops a method for a systematic selection of tuning parameters for a parameterised predictive control algorithm. In order to do this, a multiobjective problem is posed and then solved using a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) given that the objectives are in conflict. Numerical simulations show that the MOEA is a useful tool to obtain a suitable balance between feasibility, performance and computational cost.

@highlight The objectives in MPC tuning are performance, feasibility and computational cost.
@highlight A multiobjective problem is posed for tuning Laguerre-based MPC.
@highlight The multiobjective problem is solved using NSGA-II.
@highlight Experiments show that NSGA-II can obtain a suitable balance between the objectives.
