 In this paper we consider timetable design at a European freight railway operator. The timetable is designed by choosing the time of service for customer unit train demands among a set of discrete points. These discrete points are all found within the a time-window. The objective of the model is to minimize cost while adhering to constraints regarding infrastructure usage, demand coverage, and engine availability. The model is solved by a column generation scheme where feasible engine schedules are designed in a label setting algorithm with time-dependent cost and service times.

@highlight Generate timetables based on infrastructure paths.
@highlight Branch-and-Price approach implemented.
@highlight Provides high quality integer solutions to real-life sized instances.
