 In the pharmaceutical industry, sales representatives visit doctors to inform them of their products and encourage them to become an active prescriber. On a daily basis, pharmaceutical sales representatives must decide which doctors to visit and the order to visit them. This situation motivates a problem we more generally refer to as a stochastic orienteering problem with time windows (SOPTW), in which a time window is associated with each customer and an uncertain wait time at a customer results from a queue of competing sales representatives. We develop a priori routes with the objective of maximizing expected sales. We operationalize the sales representativeâ€™s execution of the a priori route with relevant recourse actions and derive an analytical formula to compute the expected sales from an a priori tour. We tailor a variable neighborhood search heuristic to solve the problem. We demonstrate the value of modeling uncertainty by comparing the solutions to our model to solutions of a deterministic version using expected values of the associated random variables. We also compute an empirical upper bound on our solutions by solving deterministic instances corresponding to perfect information.

@highlight We consider stochastic wait times resulting from queues of competing salespeople.
@highlight The customer-specific recourse action is a novel addition to routing models.
@highlight We derive an analytical formula for the expected reward from an a priori tour.
@highlight We show the value of incorporating stochastic information into the routing model.
