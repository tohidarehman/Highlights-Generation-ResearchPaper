 Due to an increasing demand for public transportation and intra-urban mobility, an efficient organization of public transportation has gained significant importance in the last decades. In this paper we present a model formulation for the bus rapid transit route design problem, given a fixed number of routes to be offered. The problem can be tackled using a decomposition strategy, where route design and the determination of frequencies and passenger flows will be dealt with separately. We propose a hybrid metaheuristic based on a combination of Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) and Linear Programming (LP). The algorithm as such is iterative. Decision upon the design of routes will be handled using LNS. The resulting passenger flows and frequencies will be determined by solving a LP. The solution obtained may then be used to guide the exploration of new route designs in the following iterations within LNS. Several problem specific operators are suggested and have been tested. The proposed algorithm compares extremely favorable and is able to obtain high quality solutions within short computational times.
