 An increasing number of studies use the spectrum of cardiac signals for analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of complex cardiac arrhythmias. However, the relationship between the spectrum of cardiac signals and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the underlying cardiac sources remains to date unclear. In this paper, by following a multivariate signal analysis approach we identify the relationship between the spectrum of cardiac signals, the spatiotemporal dynamics of cardiac sources, and the measurement characteristics of the lead systems. Then, by using analytical methods and computer simulations we analyze the spectrum of cardiac signals measured by idealized lead systems during correlated and uncorrelated spatiotemporal dynamics. Our results show that lead systems can have distorting effects on the spectral envelope of cardiac signals, which depend on the spatial resolution of the lead systems and on the degree of spatiotemporal correlation of the underlying cardiac sources. In addition to this, our results indicate that the spectral features that do not depend on the spectral envelope behave robustly against different choices of lead systems.

@highlight We analyze the spectral manifestation of cardiac rhythms and the spectral effects of lead systems.
@highlight We relate analytically cardiac spectrum, lead characteristics and cardiac rhythms.
@highlight Lead systems can have distorting effects on the envelope of cardiac spectrum.
@highlight Hence, spectral features that do not depend on the spectral envelope are robust.
@highlight For correlated rhythms, an inverse relationship exists between bandwidth and spatial resolution.
