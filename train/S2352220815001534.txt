 Psi-calculi constitute a parametric framework for nominal process calculi, where constraint based process calculi and process calculi for mobility can be defined as instances. We apply here the framework of psi-calculi to provide a foundation for the exploration of declarative event-based process calculi with support for run-time refinement. We first provide a representation of the model of finite prime event structures as an instance of psi-calculi and prove that the representation respects the semantics up to concurrency diamonds and action refinement. We then proceed to give a psi-calculi representation of Dynamic Condition Response Graphs, which conservatively extends prime event structures to allow finite representations of (omega) regular finite (and infinite) behaviours and have been shown to support run-time adaptation and refinement. We end by outlining the final aim of this research, which is to explore nominal calculi for declarative, run-time adaptable mobile processes with shared resources.

@highlight Represents prime event structures as a psi-calculi instance, respecting concurrency diamonds and action refinement.
@highlight Represents Dynamic Condition Response (DCR) Graphs as another psi-calculi instance, respecting the semantics.
@highlight Syntactic restrictions are identified that make both encodings complete.
@highlight The logic part of psi-calculi are enough for capturing event structures, whereas communication is needed for DCR graphs.
