 Software architecture management, especially in component-based web user interfaces is important to enhance their run-time accessibility, dynamics and management. The cloud offers some excellent mechanisms for this kind of systems, since software can be managed remotely, easy availability of the resources is ensured and mass storage is possible. This article presents an infrastructure solution, based on the use of web services and cloud computing, for managing COTS-based architectures.
