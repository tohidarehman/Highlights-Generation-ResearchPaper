 Women aged between 40 and 74 years are called to do mammography screening in Sweden with the aim of early detection of breast cancer which is the most common type of cancer in women . Women with dense breast tissue are more likely to develop breast cancer and mammography is not an optimal diagnostic method for them because of reduced sensitivity . Radiographers who work in mammography departments are exposed to ethical dilemma daily which is whether they should inform women about the density of their breast . The purpose of the study is to illustrate thoughts that radiographers have on breast density during mammography examination . The study was performed with qualitative method where semistructured interviews were conducted . The material from the interviews was analyzed condensed into different units and afterward in different codes that became different categories . The informants had separate opinions about if women in Sweden should be informed about breast density . On the other hand radiographers considered that women should not be informed if there are no guidelines for the assessment and follow up of breast density . With regard to supplementary examinations all informants consider that it would be good for women with high dense breast tissue to be offered supplementary examinations during mammography screening .

@highlight Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women and offering screening programs has shown to reduce mortality.
@highlight Mammography is a safe and cost effective diagnostic method for early detection of possible cancer changes.
@highlight For women with high tissue density in the breast mammography is not always the optimal screening method.
@highlight When radiographers detect women with high breast density during screening without the possibility of informing this can cause ethical dilemmas.
