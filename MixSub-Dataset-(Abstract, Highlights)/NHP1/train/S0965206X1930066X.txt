 The development of pressure ulcers is associated with four different pathways ischemia ischemia reperfusion injury impaired interstitial fluid flow and lymphatic drainage and cell deformation . For prediction of pressure ulcer development it is important to detect the tissue response involved in the pathways at the molecular level . However non invasive techniques for detecting this tissue response are not available . This study aimed to demonstrate that the secretion of the candidate marker proteins in pressure loaded mouse skin can be detected by skin blotting and to propose a novel direct skin assessment method for predicting pressure ulcer development . We created three different tissue damage models early stage pressure ulcers blanchable erythema and intact skin . We confirmed the pathways involved in the pressure ulcer development by histological analyses in the pressure ulcer model . Interleukin 1 vascular endothelial growth factor C and heat shock protein 90 were expressed in the pressure ulcer model at a significantly different level compared to the blanchable erythema or intact skin during the time course . Detecting the secretion of these novel biomarkers by skin blotting can be a useful method for non invasive prediction of pressure ulcer development .
