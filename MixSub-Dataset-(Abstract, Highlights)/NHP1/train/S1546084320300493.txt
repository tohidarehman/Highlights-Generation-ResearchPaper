 CT colonography also known as virtual colonoscopy is a minimally invasive complementary screening method to optical colonoscopy that is growing in its availability and utilization . As a screening test it is typically performed in outpatient radiology sites . Examinations are monitored by a radiologist trained in its performance . CTC is selectively performed in a hospital setting for patients with comorbidities that render them at a high risk for OC such as cardiac disease or screening before organ transplantation . In cases where OC is unsuccessful for at complete colonic inspection CTC can be performed the same day after OC or planned at a later date to evaluate the remainder of the colon . Candidates for CTC must be able to follow instructions and tolerate colonic insufflation . Patients who have fecal incontinence or significant rectal prolapse are not candidates for CTC because of limited ability to maintain colonic distension . Finally strict adherence to the recommended colonic preparation before CTC is critical to the examination s success .

@highlight CT colonography CTC is a minimally invasive alternative visual screening method for colon cancer to optical colonoscopy OC .
@highlight CTC does not require sedation and has a high safety profile with only a minimal risk of perforation lower than that of OC.
@highlight Detection of colon cancer at an early stage and detection of premalignant polyps are the goals of CTC.
