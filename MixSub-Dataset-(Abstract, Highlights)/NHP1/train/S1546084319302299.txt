 The optimal method of assessing and reducing preprocedural patient anxiety remains uncertain in radiologic procedures . Previous research suggests that the role of radiology nurses is critical to optimally address preprocedural anxiety but the preferences of radiology nurses remain understudied . A questionnaire was adapted from a previous cross sectional study of interventional radiology to determine the views of current preferences of nurses with regards to addressing preprocedural anxiety . The questionnaire was disseminated to an e mail list maintained by the Association for Radiologic and Imaging Nursing from July to September 2019 . The survey included questions about the assessment importance and reduction of preprocedural patient anxiety . A post hoc scale was used to quantify degree of responsibility allocated to radiology nurses radiologists patients family members and other health care providers . A total of 370 responses were obtained . Most respondents found preprocedural anxiety to be very important in practice
