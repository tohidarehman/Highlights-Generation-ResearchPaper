 Arteriovenous fistula is a relatively common complication of renal biopsy reported in 3 14 of patients after renal biopsy while being a sequela of other insults such as infection lithotripsy or partial nephrectomy . Without emergent nephron sparing subselective embolization potentially life threatening hemorrhage may require more aggressive management surgical nephrectomy or lobar arterial embolization with more dire consequences to renal function . We present a case of potentially life threatening hemorrhage from an iatrogenic AVF because of a random renal biopsy treated successfully with embolization of a branch originating from the upper interlobar artery . We also discuss the basic techniques and methodology of modern renal biopsies to reduce associated complications .
