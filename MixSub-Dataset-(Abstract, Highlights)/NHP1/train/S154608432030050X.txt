 Patients undergoing biopsy in interventional radiology often have increased preprocedural anxiety . IR nurses are with these patients throughout their admission and procedure and in a position to find innovative ways to ameliorate this patient anxiety . The aim of this study is to describe and measure the effect of aromatherapy on reported levels of preprocedural anxiety in IR patients undergoing image guided biopsies in a community hospital . A prospective experimental pretest posttest control group design of 90 subjects were randomly assigned to receive a lavender impregnated aromatherapy patch or a jojoba oil patch . Self reported anxiety levels were measured at the time of admission and immediately before the procedure utilizing a 100mm visual analog scale . Subjects anxiety scores decreased significantly from admission to just before their procedure among the whole sample

@highlight An anxious patient may be unable to focus during critical times such as the informed consent process.
@highlight Post test anxiety scores were statistically significantly lower than pretest scores.
@highlight The difference between study groups aromatherapy versus jojoba oil was not statistically significant.
@highlight Variability in the success of aromatherapy to prevent anxiety may be due to nurse interaction patient satisfaction difference in product or another unknown variable.
