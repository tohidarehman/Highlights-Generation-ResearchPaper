 Undermining is an important issue in the treatment and care of deep pressure ulcers . The frequency of the undermining over different bony prominences varies . In particular deep pressure ulcers over the sacrum exhibit undermining more frequently than those occurring over the heel . Although shear force has been suggested as a critical factor in undermining the exact mechanism remains unclear due to ethical and technical reasons in clinical practice . To clarify this issue a deformable model was constructed to recreate the physical and morphological properties of a pressure ulcer with persistent undermining . The model was constructed using urethane to recreate the physical properties of a pressure ulcer . To examine the clinical relevance of the model mechanical properties of the skin and the model were measured using a durometer . The model was further mounted onto a phantom that was laid on a bed . Backrest elevation of the bed induced deformities in the urethane model suggesting a mechanism of persistent undermining of the sacral pressure ulcer . Moreover a simple palpation examination in elderly volunteers revealed that the skin over the sacrum was more mobile than the skin over the heel . Therefore persistent undermining is likely caused by specific external forces and the characteristic skin mobility of the sacral region . These two different factors explain the frequent undermining that occurs in sacral pressure ulcers .

@highlight Undermining is an important and unresolved issue for pressure ulcers.
@highlight A deformable model of pressure ulcers was mounted onto a phantom.
@highlight The elevation of the bed backrest induced deformities in the model.
@highlight Simple palpation revealed enhanced mobility of the skin over the sacrum.
@highlight This phenomenon is explained by wound deformity by specific forces and mobility.
