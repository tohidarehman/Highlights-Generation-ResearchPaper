 There is reported increased utilization of diagnostic imaging worldwide owing to technological advancement and increased diagnostic capability of evolving medical imaging modalities . However there are concerns that the increasing use of radiation for medical imaging is not being properly managed because of substantiated lack of adequate quality assurance implementation in majority of diagnostic imaging departments and centers in Nigeria . A broad literature search was conducted using the PubMed Elsevier ScienceDirect and Springer Link . The keywords quality assurance quality control optimization and radiation dose were combined with the terms implementation challenges medical imaging and Nigeria as identifiers to recognize articles focusing on the challenges of QA and quality control in diagnostic imaging in Nigeria . Fifty nine articles were identified in literature search . Factors and challenges inhibiting effective QA implementation including management and policies QC equipment QC culture and familiarity skilled personnel radiology benefit management and regulatory enforcement were identified and discussed . An illustration of typical frequency of QC evaluations in some x ray imaging systems was provided . This is expected to guide QC personnel and centers on selection and execution of QC evaluations .

@highlight Unfavorable policies and workforceleading barrier to effective quality assurance QA implementation in Nigeria.
@highlight Lack of quality control QC equipment contributed to the derisory QC familiarization and culture.
@highlight Patient benefitdriven imaging referrals and enhanced regulatory enforcement are effective strategies to improve QA implementation.
