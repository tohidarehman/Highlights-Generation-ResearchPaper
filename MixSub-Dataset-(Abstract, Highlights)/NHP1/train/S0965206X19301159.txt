 The aim of this work was to evaluate some biological properties of hake head oil as well its lipid composition . The fatty acid profiles showed a dominance of unsaturated fatty acids overtaking 55 of the total fatty acids . Omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid profiles exhibited a dominance of EPA and DHA . The antioxidant activity was determined through two different assays DPPH scavenging activity and carotene bleaching by linoleic acid assay . Eighteen mice were excised on their back and divided into 3 groups treated with sterile saline commercial healing cream and HHO respectively . The wound closure rate the hydroxyproline contents and the histopathology evolution in skin tissue were elaborated . Also the anti inflammatory activity was studied by carrageenan induced mouse paw edema . Mice were divided into 3 groups treated respectively with sterile saline anti inflammatory drug reference and HHO . The anti inflammatory evaluation of HHO in mice exhibited an important inhibition of carrageenan induced hind paws edema as confirmed by the histological analysis the superoxide dismutase catalase and malondialdehyde level . HHO displayed a significant wound healing effect probably due to the anti inflammatory and antioxidant activities of its EPA and DHA contents . The overall results proved that HHO might be favorable drugs who exert a great therapeutic potential wound healing and anti inflammatory effects in animal model .
