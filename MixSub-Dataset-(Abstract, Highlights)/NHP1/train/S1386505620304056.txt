 Accessing and receiving quality healthcare in an unfamiliar health system is a significant challenge for many new immigrants and refugees . This study aims to provide a three phase model to develop a web based health information website that helps populations with limited English proficiency increase health literacy and improve healthcare service access . Method First we conducted a needs assessment from community leaders and service providers . Second we developed contents from credible sources and tested each item using multiple readability tests . Last we revised each item to lower the readability and retest its readability . Results The average reading level for the original 99 topics was assessed at 10.84 . After revisions we were able to lower the readability to 8.56 which was around two grade levels lower on average . Conclusion the main purpose for building an English based health information website was to assist the population with LEP . By using simple English with lower readability it will ease the translation process . This study demonstrates a process to develop suitable contents for populations in need . In the future incorporating visual aid and other multimedia will be beneficial in user engagement and knowledge retention .

@highlight Readability tests can be a useful tool for revising health information to increase readability.
@highlight Online health information should be simplified and tailored to the needs of those with LEP.
@highlight Basic health information should be written in simple English before being translated into other languages.
