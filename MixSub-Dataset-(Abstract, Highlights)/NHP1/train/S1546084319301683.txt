 Visceral artery pseudoaneurysms are a relatively uncommon complication of chronic pancreatitis . They arise secondary to compromise of the adjacent vasculature by enzymatic autodigestion . It is important to treat these lesions in a timely fashion given the risk of rupture . Historically these pseudoaneurysms were primarily treated with surgery but most are now treated with endovascular embolization as there is less associated morbidity and mortality . However pseudoaneurysms are not always amenable to endovascular treatment because of a variety of factors . A percutaneous transvisceral route offers an alternate approach to embolization . This case report describes the successful percutaneous treatment of a pancreatic pseudoaneurysm via a transhepatic approach . Important technical considerations risks and postprocedural care associated with a percutaneous transvisceral approach are discussed .

@highlight Percutaneous trans organ treatment of pancreatic pseudoaneurysms across organs is used in otherwise technically or anatomically limited case.
@highlight It is important to be mindful of organ structure adjacent anatomy and needle gauge when performing these procedures.
@highlight Nurses should be familiar with possible post procedural complications.
