 This paper augments the technology acceptance model by empirically investigating the influence of behavioral traits and cognitive beliefs on patients behavioral intention to accept technology in healthcare service delivery . Despite increased emphasis on healthcare service delivery there has been limited studies as to how various behavioral constructs are related to adoption of new technology in healthcare sector . To this end and to develop meaningful insights a conceptual model integrating behavioral constructs with constructs related to technology acceptance model is devised . The aim here is essentially to understand relationships that predict patients acceptance of technology in healthcare services . The devised model is tested on responses obtained from survey of 416 patients availing healthcare service at various primary health centers in New Delhi India . Structural equation modeling is employed to conceptualize the model and validate nine hypotheses entailing key constructs . The results indicate that perceived usefulness perceived ease of use trust and privacy concern are direct predictors of patients behavior to accept technology in availing healthcare services . In summary this research provides an empirical contribution to the literature on effect of trust and privacy concerns on acceptance of technology in healthcare .
