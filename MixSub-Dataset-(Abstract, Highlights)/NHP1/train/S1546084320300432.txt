From the emergency department to the intensive care unit ultrasonography helps to make timely diagnoses guide therapeutic measures avoid unnecessary procedures and continuously reassess patients with critical hemodynamic respiratory and cardiovascular conditions . This tool will most likely continue to expand its range of usefulness in this and other medical care settings . Today ultrasonography training is essential to all clinicians who take care of critical patients to improve patient safety reduce morbidity and eventually reduce the costs derived from their care .
