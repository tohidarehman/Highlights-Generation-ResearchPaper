 Occupational radiation exposure is a hazard inherent to the nursing profession . Concerns may be heightened among personnel who are pregnant or of childbearing age given the known teratogenic and carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation . It is important to use standard protective measures in accordance with regulatory requirements under the ALARA principle . The purpose of this review is to examine published data on exposure levels and pregnancy outcomes among occupationally exposed women as well as to summarize the practices staff should use to monitor and minimize exposure . Available data suggest that fetal dose from occupational exposure in interventional radiology usually remains well below recommended limits and that outcomes are indistinguishable from those among unexposed women . When following required protective measures to manage exposure pregnant personnel can continue to participate safely in patient care activities including computed tomographyguided and fluoroscopic guided procedures .

@highlight Current data suggest that occupational exposure does not pose a significant increased risk to the fetus of pregnant staff.
@highlight Outcomes among occupationally exposed women are indistinguishable from those among unexposed women.
@highlight Pregnancy can be integrated safely and successfully into an interventional radiology nursing career without considerably altering work schedules.
@highlight Decreasing exposure time and increasing distance and shielding are central to keeping exposure levels as low as reasonably achievable.
