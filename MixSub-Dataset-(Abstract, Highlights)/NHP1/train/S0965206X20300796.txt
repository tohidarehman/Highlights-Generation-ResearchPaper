 This aim of this study was to observe the effect of Yang Yan Qing E Wan on senescent phenotypes and the expression of catenin and p16

@highlight This aim of this study was to observe the Yang Yan Qing E Wan is able to inhibit skin cell senescence induced by hydrogen peroxide regulate oxidative stress damage up regulate catenin expression and inhibit the expression level of p16
@highlight YYQEW is able to inhibit skin cell senescence induced by hydrogen peroxide regulate oxidative stress damage up regulate catenin expression and inhibit the expression level of p16
@highlight The exact mechanism of YYQEW in delaying skin cell aging requires further investigation.
