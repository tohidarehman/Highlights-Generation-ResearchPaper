 The lymphatic system is a poorly understood and historically under recognized component of the overall circulatory system . Lymphatic vessels have been difficult to study given their small size relative to arteries and veins . Consequently for centuries little was known about the complex anatomy and physiology of the lymphatic system . Lymphatic pathophysiology and complications of lymphatic injury have underscored the importance of lymph nodes lymphatic vasculature and their role in immune regulation transportation of metabolites and fluid balance . Innovation and refinement in advanced imaging has allowed for higher resolution imaging of the lymphatic circulation which in turn has led to improved understanding and targeted therapies . The imaging modalities that have permitted the evaluation diagnosis and treatment of lymphatic disorders are reviewed .

@highlight Thoracic duct embolization for chylothorax reinvigorated interest in lymphatic imaging.
@highlight MR lymphangiography allows for imaging of lymphatic anatomy and flow.
@highlight Lymphatic interventions are evolving rapidly and becoming more widely applied.
