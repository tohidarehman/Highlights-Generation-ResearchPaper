 Wikipedia contains rich biomedical information that can support medical informatics studies and applications . Identifying the subset of medical articles of Wikipedia has many benefits such as facilitating medical knowledge extraction serving as a corpus for language modeling or simply making the size of data easy to work with . However due to the extremely low prevalence of medical articles in the entire Wikipedia articles identified by generic text classifiers would be bloated by irrelevant pages . To control the false discovery rate while maintaining a high recall we developed a mechanism that leverages the rich page elements and the connected nature of Wikipedia and uses a crawling classification strategy to achieve accurate classification . Structured assertional knowledge in Infoboxes and Wikidata items associated with the identified medical articles were also extracted . This automatic mechanism is aimed to run periodically to update the results and share them with the informatics community .

@highlight Crawling classification accurately identified medical articles from Wikipedia even the prevalence was as low as 1.5 .
@highlight 93 420 articles on medicine were identified from the 2020 05 01 dump of Wikipedia and classified into 7 categories by semantic groups.
@highlight The crawling classification strategy exhibited far superior performance to generic text classifiers in false discovery control.
