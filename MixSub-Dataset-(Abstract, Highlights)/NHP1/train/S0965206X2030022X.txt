 Diffuse large B cell lymphoma constitutes the most frequent subtype of all non Hodgkin s lymphomas . DLBCL is an aggressive disease and extranodal involvement is seen in approximately 30 of patients and most common extranodal sites are gastointestinal tract and skin . Skin involvement may be either primary or secondary . Secondary cutaneous lymphoma has a worse prognosis . The case is here reported of a 56 year old male DLBCL patient with cutaneous lesions and aggressive clinical course . The patient had no skin lesions at diagnosis and during follow up and treatment period skin cerebrospinal fluid and bone marrow involvement was occurred . Salvage chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation was planned but the patient died before the second cycle of salvage chemotherapy . In contrast to primary cutaneous lymphoma which tends to be more indolent secondary skin involvement is associated with unfavourable prognosis . In conclusion it should be kept in mind that skin can be involved in lymphoma patients and in these cases skin biopsy should be performed rapidly .
