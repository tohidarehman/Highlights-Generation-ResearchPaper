 The planning of hospital beds is among the most debated problems in healthcare . Despite being an important issue many initiatives have failed to sustain services improvements resulting in high costs and also high refusal rates . The stochastic problem involves conflicting criteria therefore we propose a Simulation Optimisation approach to solve it . The Evolutionary Algorithm NSGA II drives the process and the solutions are validated and evaluated via Discrete Event Simulation . An application is performed in one of the health regions of the state of Minas Gerais Brazil where the public health system assists nearly 80 of the patients . The results pointed out that the proposed approach could find efficient and feasible solutions for the problem . Therefore it is a good alternative to empirical methods currently used in Brazil to set hospital beds allocation .
