 In cases of complete scalp loss where the calvarium is exposed and reconstruction can not be achieved using replantation or local or far flaps using trephination to create holes to the depth of the spongeous layer followed by grafting once granulation has covered all defects is an important reconstruction alternative . However growth of the granulation after trephination and waiting for the entire defect to be covered is a slow process . Since the introduction of platelet rich plasma several researchers have investigated the efficacy of different bone healing and grafting procedures . We present a case with full thickness partial scalp defect in which we support the development of granulation through holes drilled to the spongeous layer by trephination with PRP .

@highlight Drilling holes reaching to the spongious layer of calvarium promotes the formation of granulation to cover the denuded bone.
@highlight Platelet rich plasma stimulates the formation of granulation tissue from the spongious layer of calvarium.
@highlight Denuded calvarium can be easily reconstructed by conbining procedures such as trephination PRP application and skin grafting.
