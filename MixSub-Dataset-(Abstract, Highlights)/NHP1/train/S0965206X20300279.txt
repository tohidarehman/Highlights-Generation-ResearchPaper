 Manuka honey a wound treatment used to eradicate bacteria resolve inflammation and promote wound healing is a current focus in the tissue engineering community as a tissue template additive . However Manuka honey s effect on neutrophils during the inflammation resolving phase has yet to be examined . This study investigates the effect of 0.5 and 3 Manuka honey on the release of cytokines chemokines and matrix degrading enzymes from a dHL 60 neutrophil model in the presence of anti inflammatory stimuli . We hypothesized that Manuka honey would reduce the output of pro inflammatory signals and increase the release of anti inflammatory signals . The results of this study indicate that 0.5 honey significantly increases the release of CXCL8 IL 8 CCL2 MCP 1 CCL4 MIP 1 CCL20 MIP 3 IL 4 IL 1ra and FGF 13 while reducing Proteinase 3 release in the anti inflammatory stimulated models . However 3 honey significantly increased the release of TNF and CXCL8 IL 8 while reducing the release of all other analytes . We replicated a subset of the most notable findings in primary human neutrophils and the consistent results indicate that the HL 60 data are relevant to the performance of primary cells . These findings demonstrate the variable effects of Manuka honey on the release of cytokines chemokines and matrix degrading enzymes of this model of neutrophil anti inflammatory activity . This study reinforces the importance of tailoring the concentration of Manuka honey in a wound or tissue template to elicit the desired effects during the inflammation resolving phase of wound healing .

@highlight Manuka honey alters the secretome of an anti inflammatory dHL 60 neutrophil model.
@highlight 0.5 honey increases both pro inflammatory and anti inflammatory signal release.
@highlight 3 honey reduces all release except TNF and IL 8.
@highlight In primary human neutrophils 0.5 honey increases IL 1ra VEGF and MMP 9.
