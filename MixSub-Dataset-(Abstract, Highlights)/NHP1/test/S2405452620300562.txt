 Hypertension disproportionately affects African American communities . This interdisciplinary group education curriculum aimed to improve hypertension knowledge behavioral risk factors weight and blood pressure in an urban African American population with uncontrolled hypertension . Outcomes were assessed with paired t tests in a pre post study design . Participants demonstrated a significant increase in hypertension knowledge . Among self reported health behaviors maintaining a healthy weight improved significantly . Participants demonstrated significant weight loss at one month compared to baseline and trended towards significance at three and six months . Participants baseline BP was 165 88mmHg . Decreases in systolic BP trended towards significance at one month and decreased significantly at three months and six months . Diastolic BP significantly decreased at one month and six months and trended towards significance at three months . This interdisciplinary group education intervention shows promise for improving hypertension management in African American populations .

@highlight This pre post study assessed if an interdisciplinary group education program improved hypertension among African Americans.
@highlight Post intervention participants had improved hypertension knowledge and weight loss.
@highlight Participants had a significant decrease of 21mmHg in systolic BP and 9mmHg in diastolic BP at six months follow up.
