 Transposition of the great arteries is a condition with ventriculo arterial discordance where the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle . Broadly speaking two forms exist a dextro type and a levo type . Traditionally diagnosis is made by echocardiography . Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging cardiac computed tomography and heart catheterization and angiography are supplemental tools in further characterization of the anatomy . The frequency of routine imaging testing including echocardiography CMR and CCT depends on severity of heart failure cyanosis valvular disease arrhythmia pulmonary hypertension and end organ damage . The aim of this review is to explore important imaging findings for different types of D TGA uncorrected D TGA D TGA after the Mustard Senning atrial switch surgery D TGA after the arterial switch operation and D TGA after the Rastelli repair .

@highlight The aim of this review is to explore important imaging findings for different types of dextro transposition of the great arteries.
@highlight Patients who undergo Mustard Senning atrial switch should have annual echocardiogram and periodic tomographic cardiac imaging to routine follow up and screening for postoperative complications.
@highlight Patients with prior arterial switch operation require screening with cardiac computed tomography cardiac magnetic resonance imaging every 1 2years to assess for short term complications coronary insufficiency or supravalvular pulmonary stenosis and long term complications neoaortic root dilation and neoaortic valve regurgitation .
