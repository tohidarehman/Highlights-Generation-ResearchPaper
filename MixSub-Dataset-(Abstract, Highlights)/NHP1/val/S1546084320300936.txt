 The purpose of this study was to assess the appropriate utilization of peripherally inserted central venous catheter placement in patients in an urban hospital setting . We performed a retrospective review of a prospective database created for quality assurance purposes of all patients who had a PICC request placed on Friday afternoonSunday between January and June 2019 . Data collected included demographic information pertinent medical history and procedural details . The most common reasons for PICC consultation was long term intravenous antibiotics and poor IV access . On retrospective chart review only 51 76 patients underwent subsequent PICC placement in the days following request placement . Of the 1 3 patients in whom a PICC was not subsequently placed 64 were deemed nonindicated and an additional 28 were contraindicated . In these patients the reason for PICC consultation was most commonly poor IV access . There appears to be an overutilization of PICCs in our hospital setting indications for PICCs should be carefully reviewed as these lines pose a risk of morbidity to patients who may not need them .
