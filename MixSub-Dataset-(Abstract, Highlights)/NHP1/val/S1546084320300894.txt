 Computed tomography angiography is a method widely used to investigate vascular disease . One of its limitations is obtaining a safe intravenous access for contrast media injection mainly in pediatric patients . This study aims to describe an adverse event in a pediatric patient submitted to CTA using central venous catheter for contrast injection . This study reinforced the idea that an adequate access is very important to perform a safe examination . Moreover it was demonstrated that it is essential to respect the manufacturer s instructions about the devices use and to follow specific protocols for CTA examinations using CVCs to avoid adverse events .

@highlight Computed tomography is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric diseases.
@highlight The manufacturer s instructions about devices must be followed to a safe examination.
@highlight Adequate protocols for central venous catheter use are fundamental to avoid adverse events.
