 Chronic subdural hematomas are a common condition encountered by neurosurgeons with the potential for a high morbidity or mortality . A standard treatment regimen still remains highly discussed and controversial . Current treatments include surgical evacuation as well as medical therapies including statins steroids and tranexamic acid with ongoing studies to investigate their efficacy . Middle meningeal artery embolization is a technique first described in the year 2000 which has shown promising results for cSDH treatment . The procedure is performed in the angiography suite under minimal sedation using embolization materials to block the MMA . This is thought to disrupt the primary blood supply to the cSDH allowing for resolution . Embolization can be utilized as the primary treatment or in addition to surgical evacuation . Current literature suggests that surgically evacuated cSDH can have a recurrence rate from 2 to 37 where the rate after MMA embolization is reported from 2.1 to 4.1 . When used as the primary treatment MMA embolization can also potentially reduce the morbidity of a surgical procedure under general anesthesia to an elderly patient . Here we present a case of MMA embolization utilized after a postoperative cSDH recurrence with good results .

@highlight Middle meningeal artery MMA embolization can be used as a primary treatment for chronic subdural hematomas.
@highlight Chronic subdural hematoma recurrence rates after MMA embolization is 2.14.1 .
@highlight MMA embolization carries a lower complication rate than surgical drainage.
@highlight Embolization can be performed utilizing only minimal sedation.
