 The present study reports on the appreciable magnetic entropy change observed in hybrid structures of cobalt hydroxide nanoparticles inside a polymer matrix . The preparation of a magnetic composite of cobalt hydroxide nanoparticles lodged in a polymer matrix of sulfonated polystyrene by the method of the ion exchange mechanism is outlined . The dimensionality introduced by the resin provides constraints to the particle growth thereby leading to the formation of a nearly homogeneous distribution of particle . The polymer template serves as a stabilizing and isolating agent . The composite nanostructure shows magnetocaloric effect near to the low temperature zone with an entropy change of 5J kgK at an applied magnetic field of 7T .
