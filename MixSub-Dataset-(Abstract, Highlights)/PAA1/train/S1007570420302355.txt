 Hopping of individuals among distinct layers can induce inter layer coupling and consequently affect the spreading process in each layer of real world multilayer networks . We articulate a two layer network model where a fraction of nodes are inter layer travelers that can hop between layers . We develop a theoretical framework based on the quenched mean field approximation to accurately predict the epidemic thresholds and final states in both layers . Extensive numerical simulations on synthetic and empirical networks demonstrate that in the general setting where the structures of the two network layers are asymmetric intense hopping can lead to simultaneous epidemic outbreak in both layers . In general the impacts of hopping on the spreading dynamics in the two layers can be quite distinct . As the inter layer coupling strength is increased the epidemic threshold of the denser layer increases monotonically while for the sparser layer a surprising non monotonic behavior of the threshold with a minimize value arises . Another finding is that as a result of hopping recurrent outbreaks can occur in the sparser layer providing a plausible explanation for the phenomenon of multiple outbreaks observed from real health data .

@highlight We develop a theoretical framework to depict our network model with inter layer travelers and it works well.
@highlight Intense hopping can lead to simultaneous epidemic outbreak in both layers.
@highlight Inter layer hopping plays a double sword role in epidemic spreading in that they can either enhance or suppress the process.
@highlight Recurrent outbreaks can occur as a result of inter layer hopping.
