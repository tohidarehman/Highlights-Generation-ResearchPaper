 This paper presents the results of the complex structural studies of RPV steels from the decommissioned in 2017 VVER 440 reactor after 45 years of operation . During its operation the RPV beltline weld 4 had been annealed twice by mode 430C 150h in 1987 and after three fuel campaigns by mode 475C 100h . APT and TEM studies were used for characterization of the radiation induced precipitates and radiation defects and AES and SEM fractography for assessment of the grain boundary segregation level . Complex structural studies of RPV steel after such a long term operation are carried out for the first time . It is shown that the thermal exposure at 290C for 45 years leads to the formation of the Cu rich precipitates with a low number density . Recovery annealing results in a high level of P grain boundary segregation together with incomplete Cu return to the matrix . Re irradiation leads to further Cu and P matrix depletion through the formation of CuP radiation induced precipitates on the one hand and the P grain boundary segregation on the other . Eventually the saturation of secondary precipitate formation and deceleration of the P grain boundary segregation occurs at high fluence .

@highlight RPV steels from decommissioned VVER 440 are studied by APT TEM AES and fractography.
@highlight Low density Cu precipitation under thermal exposure 290C 45 years is observed.
@highlight P grain boundary segregation in WM after annealing and re irradiation is observed.
@highlight Under re irradiation CuP precipitation in WM saturates with the fluence increase.
