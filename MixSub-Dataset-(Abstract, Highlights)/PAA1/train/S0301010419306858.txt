 By using means of density functional theory calculations we reported the heterostructure consisting of monolayer MoSSe and graphene as a promising anode material for lithium ion batteries . We investigated the adsorption and diffusion of lithium atoms in the MoSSe and MoSSe graphene heterostructures and we found that the combination with graphene makes the lithium atoms adsorption more stable meanwhile the diffusion barriers on the surface are lower than that at the interface which are comparable to the barriers on the corresponding monolayers . The maximum lithium storage capacity of the heterostructure is enhanced to 390mAh g. Our work made a comparison with all the typical structures of MoSSe and MoSSe graphene and suggests that the S side of MoSSe 2 combined with graphene and the Se side of MoSSe 2 combined with graphene are the promising materials for their higher lithium capacity and charge discharge rates .

@highlight We model two different structures come from MoS
@highlight Se
@highlight which are very popular these years.
@highlight The adsorption sites are more stable after forming a heterojunction with graphene.
@highlight Energy barriers are declined obviously after forming a heterojunction with graphene.
@highlight MoSSe graphene heterostructures show good theoretical storage and excellent stability.
