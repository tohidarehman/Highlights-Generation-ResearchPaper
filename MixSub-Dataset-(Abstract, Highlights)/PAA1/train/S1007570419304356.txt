 A dimensional nonlinear evolution equation is decomposed into three integrable dimensional models namely the nonlinear Schrdinger equation the complex modified Korteweg de Vries equation and the Lakshmanan Porsezian Daniel equation in different dimensions . On basis of a quartet Lax pair the general

@highlight The general Nth order rational solution of a 3 1 dimensional nonlinear evolution equation is derived by the Darboux transformation and limit approach 
@highlight The doubly localized lumps with standard pattern and triangular pattern on a constant background in the x y y z and x z planes are shown 
@highlight The fundamental rogue waves and the multi rogue waves on a constant background in the y z and x z planes are presented.
