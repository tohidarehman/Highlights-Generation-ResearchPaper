 Excessive heat stability poor kinetics of hydrogen absorption and desorption reaction are viewed as the major setbacks for the Mg based hydrogen storing materials application . The microstructures of samples Mg

@highlight MgYNiCu based alloys with nanocrystalline structures were fabricated by melt spinning.
@highlight Substituting Y for Mg leads to the improvement of thermodynamic property.
@highlight Increasing Y content brings about the promotion of dehydrogenation kinetics of the alloys.
@highlight Substituting Y for Mg enables the steadiness of experimental hydride to decline.
