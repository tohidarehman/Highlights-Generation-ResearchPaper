 Diamond like carbon films are considered as exciting candidates for biomaterials owing to high hardness and chemical inertness . However the high resistivity of pure DLC films limited further applications in bioelectronic field . The palladium and phosphorus doped DLC film was fabricated by electrochemical deposition from the ethanol solution of Tetrakis platinum . The structure of the film was composed of C

@highlight The Pd element was embedded in the carbon matrix with the state of nanocluster.
@highlight The introduction of P enhanced the graphitic structure of the films.
@highlight The palladium and phosphorus can enhance the surface biocompatibility and conductivity of the carbon films.
