 Two different fluorite samples of Turkish origin were studied with respect to their thermoluminescence properties suitable for dosimetric applications . The fluorites are colorful and naturally occurring . Both samples indicate sensitivity comparable to the sensitivity of CaF

@highlight Thermoluminescence TL properties of two natural colorful fluorite samples of Anatolian origin were investigated.
@highlight Trap parameters of both materials were analysed using deconvolution and fractional glow techniques.
@highlight Dosimetric behaviours of both materials were investigated.
