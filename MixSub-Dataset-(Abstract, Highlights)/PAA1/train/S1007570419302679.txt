 This paper is concerned with robust stabilization problem of TakagiSugeno fuzzy time delay systems subject to impulsive perturbations . New results on robust stabilization via parallel distributed compensation control are derived . First based on the impulse type RazumikhinLyapunov method combined with the use of an impulse time dependent Lyapunov function a new exponential stability criterion for T S fuzzy time delay system with impulsive effects is obtained . The proposed stability criterion removes the restrictive condition on the relationship between the size of time delay and lower bound of impulse intervals imposed by the previous results . Then by employing a convex relaxation technique a sufficient condition for the constructing the PDC controllers is presented which is expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities . Next the robust stabilization problem for the T S system with slowly time varying delay is studied . A different stabilization condition is derived via an impulse time dependent Lyapunov functional which is less conservative than the former when the state delay is constant . Finally an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed analysis and design techniques .

@highlight New analysis and design methods based on the use of impulse time dependent Lyapunov function functional are proposed.
@highlight The restrictive condition on the relationship between the size of time delay and lower bound of impulse intervals imposed by the previous results is removed.
@highlight The fuzzy PDC control design methodology for both cases of fast and slow time varying delay is developed.
