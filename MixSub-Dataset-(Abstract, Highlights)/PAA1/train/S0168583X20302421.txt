 A high intensity proton irradiation was performed with the flowing water isotope harvesting target at the University of Wisconsin Madison Cyclotron Laboratory to measure the rate of degradation of the target shell during irradiation conditions . The beam reached an intensity of 34 A by the end of the irradiation and covered an area of 0.7cm

@highlight A non destructive target durability test was performed on an isotope harvesting target with proton irradiation.
@highlight Radionuclides produced in the target shell acted as radiotracers to measure target degradation.
@highlight Estimates were made for isotope harvesting target lifetimes based on the measured target corrosion rate.
@highlight Radiolysis products were measured at much lower levels than are predicted with literature primary production yields.
@highlight The level of H
@highlight measured was found to correlate with beam intensity.
