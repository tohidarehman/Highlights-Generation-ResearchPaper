 We have succeeded in observing Fe ion beam induced nanostructural change of MA956 oxide dispersion strengthened steel using anomalous small angle X ray scattering diffractometry . The ASAXS curve shows a power law scattering that follows the Porods law and an overlapped shoulder peak at the magnitude of scattering vector

@highlight Our ASAXS enables to observe nanostructural change in steel by Fe ion irradiation.
@highlight ASAXS intensity of Cr poor scatterer was doubled by the irradiation.
@highlight In contrast the irradiation didnt change the scattering of precipitates at all.
@highlight Irradiation induces neither growth suppression nor interface modification of .
