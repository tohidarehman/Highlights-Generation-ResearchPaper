 The binding characteristics of BSA with perindopril a third generation angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor was investigated using various spectroscopic approaches combined with molecular simulation including molecular docking and density functional theory calculation . Meantime the influence of some trace metal ions on the binding characteristics of BSA with perindopril was investigated . The findings indicated the perindopril quenched BSA fluorescence in a static way . The values of binding site

@highlight Perindopril binding onto BSA was assessed through spectroscopic docking and DFT calculation.
@highlight Affinity of perindopril on BSA was moderate with the
@highlight magnitude of 10
@highlight Perindopril bound to the interface between sub domain IIA and IIB of BSA.
@highlight Alteration in the conformation of perindopril and BSA occurred after interaction between two.
@highlight Van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding interaction played a dominant role.
