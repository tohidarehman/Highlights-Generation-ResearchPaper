 An incoherent digital holographic imaging system was constructed in this study based on the Michelson interferometer where the distance of the observed object can be calculated via mathematical modeling . We obtain the composite hologram by generalized phase shifting method then utilize the contrast evaluation function to determine the focus distance of composite hologram . The relationship between the focus distance and observation distance is deduced accordingly to complete the measurement process . Experiments show that the uncertainty of the proposed method decreases as observed distance increases in the range of 508mm660.4mm . The results presented in this paper may provide a theoretical foundation for incoherent holographic imaging and three dimensional measurement .

@highlight We deduced the relationship between the focus distance and observation distance by construction an incoherent digital holographic imaging system.
@highlight We propose a method to obtain holographic focus distance through generalized phase shift reconstruction and contrast evaluation function.
@highlight Through experiments and analysis we got the uncertainty rule of distance measuring.
