 Large convex mirrors such as secondary mirrors continue to present challenges in the optical testing field . To measure a convex aspherical mirror a hybrid compensation testing method is proposed in this paper . In the proposed method a spherical surface and a computer generated hologram are combined to achieve null testing of the convex aspherical mirror . To evaluate the performance of the proposed method a relative testing experiment on a convex aspherical mirror was conducted . The results showed that the convex aspherical mirror can be tested in full aperture using the proposed method . Unlike the stitching test the full aperture map of the convex aspherical surface is obtained with only one measurement which saves both time and resources . Moreover this method does not include the stitching error in the full aperture map which improves the testing accuracy . The findings indicate that the hybrid compensation method can be an accurate and effective method in convex aspherical mirror testing .

@highlight Reconstruction of unknown convex aspherical mirror surface in full aperture with only one measurement.
@highlight Accomplishing the testing of convex aspherical mirror with hybrid compensation method combining spherical mirror with CGH.
@highlight Accomplishing the accurate alignment by CGH which avoids introducing extra aberrations in the aspherical testing results.
