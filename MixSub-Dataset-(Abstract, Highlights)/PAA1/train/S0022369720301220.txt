 To improve hydrogen storage property of Mg based alloy the MgCeYNi 10wt M composites were prepared by the combination of alloying and ball milling and their microstructure phase evolution as well as hydrogen storage thermodynamic and kinetic properties were investigated by XRD PCT and DSC methods . The result shows that the hydrogenated samples are composed of MgH

@highlight MgCeYNi TM composites are prepared by the combination of alloying and ball milling.
@highlight The Zr and V elements are efficient to disorganize the thermodynamic Mg based alloy.
@highlight The positive role of reversible reaction between the VH
@highlight and VH
@highlight is confirmed.
@highlight Activation energy is determined by the both of element property and reaction path.
