 In this paper the pinning control of fractional complex networks with impulses and time varying delays is studied and a class of more general network structure is considered which consists of an instantaneous communication topology and a delayed communication topology . Based on the linear matrix inequality technique some sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure synchronization of the network under a designed pinning event triggered strategy . And Zeno behaviors are excluded . In addition a pinning scheme is designed which shows that the nodes with delayed communication are good candidates for applying pinning controllers . Finally a numerical simulation is given to verify the correctness of the main results .

@highlight A class of fractional complex networks with impulsive effects and time varying delays is introduced and investigated.
@highlight A class of more general network structure is considered in which all nodes are divided into three categories the nodes which can only send information to others instantly the nodes which can only communicate with others with time delays and the nodes which can not only instantly communicate but also delayed communicate with others.
@highlight A pinning and event triggered control strategy is proposed to force the network to be synchronized and Zeno behaviors are avoided.
@highlight By using the theories on algebraic graph a pinning scheme is designed in which some delay coupled nodes should be pinned first.
