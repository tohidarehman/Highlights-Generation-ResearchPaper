 It was recently demonstrated that 2D Townes solitons in two component systems with cubic self focusing which are normally made unstable by the critical collapse can be stabilized by linear spin orbit coupling in Bose Einstein condensates and optics alike . We demonstrate that 1D TSs realized as optical spatial solitons in a planar dual core waveguide with dominant quintic self focusing may be stabilized by SOC like terms emulated by obliquity of the coupling between cores of the waveguide . Thus SOC offers a universal mechanism for the stabilization of TSs . A combination of systematic numerical considerations and analytical approximations identifies a vast stability area for skew symmetric solitons in the systems main and annex bandgaps . Tilted solitons are unstable spontaneously evolving into robust breathers . For broad solitons diffraction represented by second derivatives in the system may be neglected leading to a simplified model with a finite bandgap . It is populated by skew antisymmetric gap solitons which are nearly stable close to the gaps bottom .

@highlight One dimensional Townes like solitons in the system with quintic attraction may be stabilized by an effective spin orbit coupling SOC .
@highlight We realize the stabilization mechanism in a model of on a planar double core optical waveguide with the quintic self focusing SOC being emulated by obliquity of the coupling between the cores.
@highlight The system supports families of stable skew symmetric solitons in the systems bandgaps.
