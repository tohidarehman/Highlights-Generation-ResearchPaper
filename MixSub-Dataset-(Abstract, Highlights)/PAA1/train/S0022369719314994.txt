 In this study nanostructured cerium oxide with an average crystallite size of 5nm was synthesized using a chemical co precipitation method with cerium nitrate hexahydrate and sodium hydroxide as the starting materials . Deoxyribonucleic acid powder was used as the biological capping agent . The structural characteristics of the prepared nanoparticles were determined using X ray diffraction high resolution transmission electron microscopy X ray photoelectron spectroscopy Raman spectroscopy Fourier transform infrared and ultravioletvisible spectroscopy . The antioxidant efficacy was estimated by measuring the scavenging activities of free radicals such as superoxide hydroxyl nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide . The nanostructured ceria synthesized with the assistance of DNA scavenged all four oxidizing species well irrespective of the ratio of
