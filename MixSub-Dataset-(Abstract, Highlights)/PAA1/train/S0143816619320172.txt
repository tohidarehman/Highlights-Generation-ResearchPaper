 Characterizations of nano scale structures using conventional stylus profilometer and optical microscopy are respectively restricted by tip radius and diffraction limit . Atomic force microscope can measure smaller structures but it is difficult and time consuming to find them in large scale ultra precision surfaces . In this paper a new profilometer for rapid positioning and measurement of nano scale structures in large scale ultra precision surfaces is proposed . A technique based on white light interference is integrated into an AFM to detect probe deflection . The adapted profilometer has two measurement modes a white light interferometry mode used to find an area of interest an AFM mode for high resolution measurement . Using this profilometer the time of positioning an area of interest can be significantly reduced and the measurement efficiency is thus improved . Furthermore a tracking measurement method is proposed to improve the measurement range of the AFM mode which can enhance the measuring ability of the profilometer for complex large scale surfaces . Experiments demonstrate that the profilometer can quickly positioning nano scale structures in large scale surfaces and achieve three dimensional measurement with nanometer resolution .
