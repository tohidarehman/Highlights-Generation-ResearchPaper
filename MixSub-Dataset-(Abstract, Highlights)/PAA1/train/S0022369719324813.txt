 Black phosphorus based two dimensional heterostructure photocatalysts have attracted much attention due to their prominent photocatalytic performance . However theoretical analysis on the mechanism of photocatalytic activity is still lacking . Firstly we comprehensively analyzed the structural and electronic properties of BP BiVO

@highlight A type II BP BiVO
@highlight  010 heterostructure for promising photocatalytic performance is proposed.
@highlight The interfacial vdW interactions and electronic properties of BP BiVO
@highlight  010 heterostructure are performed.
@highlight BiVO
@highlight can be a promising candidate either as a capping or supporting layer for encapsulating BP layer.
