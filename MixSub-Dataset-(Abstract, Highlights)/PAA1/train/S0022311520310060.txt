 An approach to improve the performance of steels for fusion reactors is to reinforce them with oxide nanoparticles . These can hinder dislocation and grain boundary movement and trap radiation induced defects thus increasing creep and radiation damage resistance . The present work investigates the thermal stability of the microstructure and the evolution of defects in a 0.3 Y

@highlight Mechanical alloying introduces a deformation state that persists in ODS steels even during annealing at 1200 K.
@highlight Deformation state and Y O based nanoparticles are likely responsible for microstructural instability at 1400 K.
@highlight Positron annihilation results indicate that Y O based nanoparticles are able to trap thermal vacancy clusters.
