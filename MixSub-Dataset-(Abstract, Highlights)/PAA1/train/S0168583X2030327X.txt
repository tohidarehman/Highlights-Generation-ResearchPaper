 Particle Induced Gamma ray Emission and Particle Induced X ray Emission spectroscopies were applied for the determination of low medium and high Z elements in coal and coal residues of Indian thermal power plants .

@highlight PIGE and PIXE were applied for elemental quantification of Indian coal and coal residues.
@highlight In situ current normalized PIGE was used to determine F Na Mg Al and Si.
@highlight PIXE was used to determine total 22 elements namely K Ca Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn Ga As Se Kr Rb Sr Y Zr Nb Gd and Pb.
@highlight Toxic elements like F Cr Mn Ni As and Pb were found in significant concentration.
