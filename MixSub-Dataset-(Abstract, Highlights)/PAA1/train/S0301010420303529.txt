 J aggregates are supramolecular assemblies with characteristic optical properties originating from their excitonic interactions and have applications in fluorescence biosensing and artificial light harvesting systems . Herein we investigated the formation and dissociation of the J aggregates of 1 1 dioctadecyl 3 3 3 3 tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate DiIC

@highlight DiIC
@highlight  3 forms J aggregates in 2 isobutoxyethanol water binary solvents.
@highlight The J aggregates dissociate into monomers cooperatively.
@highlight The concentration fluctuation of the binary solvents may induce the dissociation.
