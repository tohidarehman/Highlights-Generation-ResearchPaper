 The use of light encoding techniques is widespread in the field of 3D surface reconstruction . This paper presents a stereo camera calibration methodology which integrates structured light encoding with an active digital device . The structured light encoding approach is proposed to unambiguously solve the stereo matching issue for stereo camera setups . A sequence of vertical and horizontal binary striped patterns combined with a checkerboard pattern is displayed by a high resolution LCD screen which is used as calibration board . A bundle adjustment technique is adopted to simultaneously adjust both camera parameters and screen geometry as part of the stereo camera calibration process thus taking into account the possible inaccuracies of the digital display . The same structured light approach with small variants is projected by a multimedia digital projector to carry out 3D surface reconstruction . The proposed methodology defines a comprehensive framework for the development of a 3D optical scanner from calibration to 3D acquisition which has been validated by measuring primitive surfaces and reconstructing free form shapes with different stereo camera setups .
