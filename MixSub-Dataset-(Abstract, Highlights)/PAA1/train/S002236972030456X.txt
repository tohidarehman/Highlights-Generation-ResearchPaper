 The electronic and transport properties of sawtooth penta graphene nanoribbons are investigated using density functional theory and semi empirical extended Hckel method in combination with nonequilibrium Green functions . The configurations are theoretically studied in terms of bare edges and edges terminated by non metallic atoms such as identical edge termination and alternate edge termination . It is found that SSPGNR band gap can be controlled through changing various passivation elements as well as termination forms which leads to the transition from a semiconductor to a metal or a semimetal . For the influence on transport properties P and Si atoms of alternate cases improve significantly the weak point of the bare and traditionally passivated models . The 9 order rise of current magnitude is observed in PH SSPGNR and SiH SSPGNR compared to HH SSPGNR and PP SSPGNR . Interestingly oscillation current voltage characteristic appears when SSPGNR is identically functionalized by Si atoms . These outcomes derive from the strong dependence of SSPGNRs on edge chemistry influence suggesting that kinds of passivation atoms and termination types could be used to manipulate properties of novel and promising materials in nano electronic devices .

@highlight The electronic structures and transport properties of the sawtooth penta graphene nanoribbons SSPGNRs are very sensitive to termination elements H P Si .
@highlight Alternate edge functionalization by P or Si together with H atoms not only enriches SSPGNR current by 10times but also brings high feasibility to form functionalized ribbons which indicates good low dimensional structures likely to exist in experiments.
@highlight Oscillation current voltage characteristic appears when SSPGNR is functionalized identically by Si atoms. This has the potential to be used in special electronic devices.
