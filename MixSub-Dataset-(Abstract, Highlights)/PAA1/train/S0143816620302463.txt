 Although the 3D DIC method has matured both theoretically and technically the 2D DIC method still plays an important role in in plane deformation measurements . However the accuracy of 2D DIC is affected by out of plane motion and non perpendicular alignment . To tackle this problem we propose to directly measure these unfavorable error sources by cross shaped structured light and the optical triangulation method . Subsequently pseudo strains are calculated and compensated using an integrated mathematical model developed in this paper . To avoid mutual interference between the structured light strips and the speckle image color coding is also proposed to use different color information for 2D DIC processing and error compensation . Experiments with controlled out of the plane motions show that the mean error after compensation can be as small as 50 . Uniaxial tension tests were also conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed method in the real material parameter estimation experiment .
