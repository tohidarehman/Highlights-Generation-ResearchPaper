 General fractional calculus offers an elegant and self consistent path toward the generalization of fractional calculus to an enhanced class of kernels . Prabhakars theory can be thought of to some extent as an explicit realization of this scheme achieved by merging the Prabhakar function with the general wisdom of the standard formulation of fractional calculus . Here I discuss some implications that emerge when attempting to frame Prabhakars theory within the program of general fractional calculus .
