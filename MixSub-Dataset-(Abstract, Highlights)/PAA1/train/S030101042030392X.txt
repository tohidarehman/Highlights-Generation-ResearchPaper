 We have prepared a flexible natural water evaporation driven silicon carbide nano generator on the polyethylene terephthalate substrate . When the water driven by evaporation flows through the surface of SiC material the solid liquid interaction between water and SiC will induce continuous electricity output . The detail mechanism of the solid liquid interaction is discussed in this paper . The open circuit voltage

@highlight The silicon carbide SiC material is firstly explored inassembling of theNatural water evaporation NWE driven generators.
@highlight A sustainable NWE driven flexible generator is fabricated by painting silicon carbide SiC on a polyethylene terephthalate substrate at room temperature.
@highlight The solid liquid interaction at the interface between water and SiC material results in a continuous electrical output in the generator as the NWE driven water passes through the SiC nanomaterial surface and nanocrystals.
@highlight The
