 Uranium carbides have attracted renewed interest as advanced nuclear fuels for Generation IV reactors . As an important property required for gas bubble modeling in nuclear fuels the surface energy of uranium carbides is scarce in literature . In this work we study the surface properties of uranium carbides by first principles density functional theory calculations . Surface orientations with maximum Miller index up to 3 2 and 2 are investigated for UC U
