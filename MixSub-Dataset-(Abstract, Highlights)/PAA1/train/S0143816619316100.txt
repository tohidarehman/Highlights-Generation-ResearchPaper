 By illuminating targets with a modulated light signal a time of flight camera can calculate depth maps based on the phase shifts generated by the round trip travel of the light from the targets back to the sensor . The accuracy of such depth imaging depends on the quality of the returned light . However the calculation can be disturbed by various factors including the external environment and the internal structure of the camera . Multiple coupled interferences can introduce noise into the depth data collected by a ToF camera in the spatial domain . It is difficult to express the relationship between the noise in depth maps and these mixed disturbances in a mathematical model . Based on the theory of differential entropy and a large amount of depth data from a ToF camera this paper analyzes the characteristics of depth imaging entropy proposes an evaluation method for depth image quality and presents a multilayer perceptron model with information entropy trained to optimize the accuracy of depth imaging . Experimental results show that this method can significantly improve the depth accuracy in the case of mixed noise .

@highlight Based on the principles and imaging characteristics of a TOF camera a single pixel is regarded as a continuous Gaussian source and its differential entropy is proposed as an evaluation parameter. Accordingly the effects of various coupling noises can be unified into one description parameter.
@highlight Based on the theory of differential entropy a depth map evaluation is proposed. This approach is independent of the target characteristics and can ascertain the acquisition performance of a TOF camera under certain operating parameters.
@highlight Based on the principles of a multilayer perceptron neural network an optimization model is proposed. The intensity depth and mean value of a target collected by a TOF camera are taken as input and the output is the distance which can be used to optimize the output per pixel.
