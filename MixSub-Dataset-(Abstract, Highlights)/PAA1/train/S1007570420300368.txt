 Universal curves for the solution of the problem of chlorides diffusion in water saturated reinforced concrete structures subjected to saline environments assuming the non linear mechanism produced by the existence of bound chlorides are presented . These curves are obtained by means of a significant number of precise numerical simulations . Three isotherms are studied the linear and the non linear of Langmuir and Freundlich to obtain the bound chloride concentration . The dimensionless groups that relate the solutions to the unknowns of interest namely time characteristic of the process local instantaneous concentration and total chloride that penetrates the concrete to the armor are derived through the process of non dimensionalization of the mathematical model and the application of the theorem . The use of the curves is shown and their solutions are successfully verified . Finally it is proved that the deviations between results by the choice of one or another isotherm can significantly influence the specification of the useful life of the structure .
