 Phase recovery based on the transport of intensity equation is a promising method for quantitative phase imaging which is useful for the observation of dynamic objects . This study proposes a single shot common path TIE method with Greek ladder sieves to reconstruct the phase distribution of small transmissive objects . A Greek ladder sieve was designed to simultaneously capture bi planar images at a single recording plane thus the phase distribution is quantitatively retrieved using a single shot measurement of the intensity . A 120m diameter Greek ladder sieve was designed to operate at a wavelength of 13.5nm and its feasibility was verified in the optical region experimentally . With the advantages of operating in real time and reducing the effects of vibration this method can be potentially applied for various imaging and detection techniques especially for biological imaging and wave front detection .

@highlight An effective scheme for single shot common path quantitative phase recovery combines the transport of intensity equation and the Greek ladder sieves is proposed.
@highlight The method can be potentially applied for biological imaging and wave front detection.
@highlight An Greek ladder sieve as bi focal lens can realize simultaneously bi planar images at a single recording plane.
@highlight Greek ladder sieve is convenient and widely applied in phase recovery.
