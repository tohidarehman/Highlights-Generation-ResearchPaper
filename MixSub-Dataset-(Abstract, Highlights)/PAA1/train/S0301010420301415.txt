 The successive ionic adsorption and reaction method was used to obtain tin sulfide film on FTO glass . In this work tin sulfide films were prepared with or without the immersion stage in distilled water . As deposited tin sulfide films consisted of orthorhombic structures SnS and Sn

@highlight Tin sulfides of multiple phase were synthesized using SILAR.
@highlight Composition and morphology of obtained films investigated by XRD Raman spectroscopy EDX and SEM.
@highlight Tin sulfides films prepared without the immersion stage in distilled water formed with sodium chloride.
@highlight Band gap of film decreased as result of sodium incorporation.
