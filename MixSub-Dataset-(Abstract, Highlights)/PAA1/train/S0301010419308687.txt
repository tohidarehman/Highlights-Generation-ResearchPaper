 The proper flow and uniform distribution of vanadium electrolyte inside the electrode are crucial factors to improve battery performance . In this study the novel gradient and double layered porous electrode with optimized properties were investigated . More vanadium ions conversion occurs due to more uniform distribution of electrolyte flow with promptly supplementing of reactants and timely removing of products . Thus the larger cell capacity and output power as well as higher energy efficiency are obtained in the electrodes with a linear or stepwise increasing in porosity at the same inlet flow rate . In the other case with the same pressure difference between the inlet and outlet the larger cell capacity and efficiencies occur in the electrodes with a constant maximum porosity or a linear decreasing porosity due to the larger average inlet flow velocity . The better battery performance can be obtained by optimizing porosity arrangement in the electrodes .
