 The kink instability of magnetohydrodynamics is believed to be fundamental to many aspects of the dynamic activity of the solar atmosphere such as the initiation of flares and the heating of the solar corona . In this work we investigate the importance of viscosity on the kink instability . In particular we focus on two forms of viscosity isotropic viscosity and anisotropic viscosity . Through the detailed analysis of magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the kink instability with both types of viscosity we show that the form of viscosity has a significant effect on the nonlinear dynamics of the instability . The different viscosities allow for different flow and current structures to develop thus affecting the behaviour of magnetic relaxation the formation of secondary instabilities and the Ohmic and viscous heating produced . Our results have important consequences for the interpretation of solar observations of the kink instability .

@highlight Anisotropic and isotropic viscosity are compared.
@highlight The choice of viscosity model has a strong effect on magnetic relaxation.
@highlight Anisotropic viscosity enhances reconnection rate and Ohmic heating.
@highlight Overall heating is reduced when using anisotropic viscosity.
