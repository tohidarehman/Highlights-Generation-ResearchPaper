 Corrosion of zirconium claddings is one of the key properties that must be considered when designing new zirconium alloys . Tetragonal phase is formed on the zirconium matrix during high temperature corrosion and is mainly stabilized near the metal oxide interface . This phase has a tremendous influence on the corrosion behavior of zirconium alloys . T ZrO

@highlight Stress in m ZrO
@highlight is mostly released after removing the zirconium matrix.
@highlight T ZrO
@highlight phase formed on zirconium alloys is still stabilized even after removing the matrix.
@highlight Lattice distortion introduced by large content of vacancies is proposed to be important stabilizer.
@highlight The layer thickness of t ZrO
@highlight phase increases with time in the pre transition stage and drops down after transition.
@highlight Micro distribution of interfacial t ZrO
@highlight is related to the interfacial morphologies.
