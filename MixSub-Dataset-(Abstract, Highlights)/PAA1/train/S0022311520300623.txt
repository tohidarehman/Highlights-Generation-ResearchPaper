 The corrosion reaction of unirradiated uranium with deuterated liquid water under an argon overpressure was investigated . Two samples were examined at two temperatures under an argon atmosphere and contained conditions . The rate of corrosion was derived by monitoring the pressure changes in the cell as a function of time ascribed to D

@highlight UD
@highlight was identified to form in the reaction products as part of the U D
@highlight  Ar reaction.
@highlight UD
@highlight formation confirms that hydride is produced from U and oxidation generated D
@highlight After a threshold pressure 0.5L is reached UD
@highlight formation is facilitated.
@highlight Ar cover gas usage in enclosed systems could lead to pressure build up and further UH
@highlight formation.
