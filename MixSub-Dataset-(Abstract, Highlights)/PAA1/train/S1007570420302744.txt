 Fractional phase field models have been reported to suitably describe the anomalous two phase transport in heterogeneous porous media evolution of structural damage and image inpainting process . It is commonly different to derive their analytical solutions and the numerical solution to these fractional models is an attractive work . As one of the popular fractional phase field models in this paper we propose a fresh lattice Boltzmann method for the fractional Cahn Hilliard equation . To this end we first transform the fractional Cahn Hilliard equation into the standard one based on the Caputo derivative . Then the modified equilibrium distribution function and proper source term are incorporated into the LB method in order to recover the targeting equation . Several numerical experiments including the circular disk quadrate interface droplet coalescence and spinodal decomposition are carried out to validate the present LB method . It is shown that the numerical results at different fractional orders agree well with the analytical solution or some available results . Besides it is found that increasing the fractional order promotes a faster evolution of phase interface in accordance with its physical definition and also the system energy predicted by the present LB method conforms to the energy dissipation law .
