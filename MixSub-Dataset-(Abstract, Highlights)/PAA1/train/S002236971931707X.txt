 CuS CuO nanowire heterostructures grown on copper mesh have been successfully synthesized by a liquidsolid reaction at room temperature followed by annealing . The proposed structure has been verified by X ray diffraction analysis . Scanning electron microscopy images have indicated that the density and diameter of CuS nanoparticles on CuO nanowires can be tuned by controlling the duration of sulfonation with Na

@highlight CuS CuO Cu nanowire heterostructures have been fabricated by a sequence of sulfonation and annealing.
