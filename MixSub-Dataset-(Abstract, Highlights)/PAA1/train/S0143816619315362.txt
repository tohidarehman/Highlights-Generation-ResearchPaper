 The metrology of mechanical parts using non contact systems often requires complex post processing operations to evaluate shape defects of the studied surface . For large parts the geometric complexity combined with the amount of acquired data make such treatments long and tedious . To overcome this challenge a shape defect measurement system based on global stereocorrelation is developed . This approach integrates a self calibration step using the CAD model of the studied part that allows the measurement results to be directly expressed in the numerically defined frame of the part . The defects will be measured in a predefined modal basis thereby introducing registrations with a limited number of degrees of freedom and allowing for easier analyses of the measured defects .
