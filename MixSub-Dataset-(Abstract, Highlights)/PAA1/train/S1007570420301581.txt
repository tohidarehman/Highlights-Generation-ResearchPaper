 This paper examines the state estimation issue of genetic regulatory networks including time delays and leakage delay term subject to unified dissipativity performance based on the Lyapunov functional approach . The main aim of the proposed state estimator is to access the true concentrations of the proteins and mRNAs which is explored based on the available output measurements . As a first attempt the generalized dissipativity concept is implemented for GRNs to generalizing the state estimation technique in the framework of linear matrix inequalities via an improved integral inequality together with the reciprocally convex inequality technique . Then the developed criterion ensures that the estimated error dynamics to be asymptotically stable and extended dissipative in addition to well monitored by the original dynamics via unified dissipativity performance . Finally an interesting simulation example as a synthetic oscillatory network of transcriptional regulators in
