 Structured light three dimensional measurement technology is considered one of the most reliable 3D data acquisition methods . Driven by the demand for high precision 3D data acquisition for miniaturized samples in many fields such as surface condition analysis mechanical function test and micro electro mechanical systems quality inspection microscopic fringe projection profilometry has been developed rapidly during recent decades . Significant progress has been made in different aspects of MFPP including its optical configurations corresponding system calibrations phase retrieval algorithms and 3D coordinate reconstruction methods . In addition the rapid advance in high frame rate image sensors high speed digital projection technology and high performance processors become a powerful vehicle that motivates MFPP techniques to be increasingly applied in high speed real time 3D shape measurement of dynamic samples . In this paper we present an overview of these state of the art MFPP works by analyzing and comparing the measurement principles systems structures and key performance indexes such as the accuracy field of view and speed . We also discuss the potential applications of MFPP and give some recommendations about optimum MFPP optical system design for reference in related applications in the future .
