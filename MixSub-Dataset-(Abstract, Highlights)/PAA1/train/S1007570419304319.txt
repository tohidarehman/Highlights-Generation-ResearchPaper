 We adopt Gamma renewal process to describe the synaptic input of Hodgkin Huxley neurons on a square lattice with no flux boundary . Based on the eigenfunction expansion of Laplace operator we show that the Hopf bifurcation point of the lattice is coincident with that of a single neuron model . By center manifold theorem and normal form theory we prove that the Hopf bifurcation is subcritical . And then we exhibit the effect of Gamma noise on the formation of spiral wave for the first time . It is revealed that the occurrence and elimination of the spiral wave can be controlled by adjusting the inhibitory excitatory ratio and noise parameters . Since spiral waves may contribute to both normal cortical and pathological activities the present investigation should be helpful for understanding the functional role of general neural noise .
