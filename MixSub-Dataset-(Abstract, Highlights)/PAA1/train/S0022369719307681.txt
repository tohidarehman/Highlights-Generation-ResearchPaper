 Using three organic materials in the cascade configuration of organic photovoltaic cells broadens the absorption range of visible light resulting in an increase in the short circuit current density . Herein we report for the first time the use of three organic molecules pentacene boron subphthalocyanine chloride and fullerene C

@highlight The open circuit voltage in ternary OPVCs is limited by the outmost band levels.
@highlight The efficiency of ternary OPVCs pentacene SubPc C
@highlight surpass that of their corresponding binary cells.
@highlight The efficiency of OPVCs containing pentacene is limited by the small induced Voc value.
@highlight The use of MoO
@highlight as the bottom layer improves the pentacene film quality.
