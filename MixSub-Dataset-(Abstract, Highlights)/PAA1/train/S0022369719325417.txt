 A facile and efficient co precipitation method has been used to synthesize pure nickel oxide nanoparticles . The synthesis of NiO has been conducted at two different pH values and in alkaline media of LiOH and NaOH and the variations in structural electrochemical and optical properties have been analyzed . The particle sizes of all of the synthesized samples were in the range 8.00020.00nm and their energy band gaps were in the range 3.5004.000eV . WilliamsonHall plots indicate that strain was introduced in the samples during the synthesis process . NiO nanoparticles synthesized in the LiOH medium at pH 12.33 showed the smallest crystallite size of 8.830nm with a lower strain value of 9.620E 6 . The charge transport and charge transfer properties of the NiO samples have been investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements . CV study revealed that the redox process is diffusion controlled with a diffusion constant of the order of 10
