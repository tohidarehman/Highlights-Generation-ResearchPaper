 This paper is concerned with on the event triggered synchronization in fixed time for semi Markov switching dynamical complex networks with multiple weights and discontinuous nonlinearity . Firstly the principle of the global convergence in fixed time with respect to nonlinear systems with semi Markov switching is developed . Secondly in order to realize the global stochastic synchronization goal in fixed time a novel hybrid controller which is composed of the event triggered controller and the switching state feedback controller is designed . Under Filippov differential inclusion framework by applying Lyapunov functional method and inequality analysis technique the global stochastic synchronization conditions in fixed time are achieved in the form of linear matrix inequalities . In addition the upper bound of the stochastic settling time which is adjusted in advance by choosing the controller parameters is estimated accurately . Finally the correctness of the theoretical results and the feasibility of the designed controller are verified by an example .

@highlight A principle about the global stochastic stability in fixed time for the nonlinear system with semi Markov switching is developed see Lemma 2.1.
@highlight The multiple weights and semi Markov stochastic process are introduced in CDNs the mathematics model with respect to semi Markov switching CDNs with discontinuous nonlinearity is proposed.
@highlight The novel hybrid controller which is composed of the event triggered controller and the switching state feedback controller is designed.
@highlight The global stochastic fixed time synchronization conditions are proposed in terms of LMIs.
@highlight By adjusting the configuration of parameters in the designed controller the stochastic settling time can be determined to any expected value in advance.
