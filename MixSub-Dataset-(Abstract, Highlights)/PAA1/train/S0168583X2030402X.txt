 Gamma rays with different doses ranging from 30kGy to 450kGy are used to induce suitable modifications of Makrofol TP 244 . The induced changes are investigated using various procedures FTIR UV Vis Photoluminescence spectroscopy SEM techniques and roughness and Vickers micro hardness testers . The FTIR spectra show aggregate variations in the band intensities after gamma irradiation which indicate the scissioning and cross linking of the polymer chains at particular gamma doses . The UV Vis spectra show that an induced change is detected in the absorbance edge after irradiation which is associated with a decrease in the optical band gap energy . These changes indicate to the increase in the carbon clusters and increase in the opacity which consequently improve the electrical conductivity of irradiated samples . The PL emission spectra indicate that the PL peak intensities reduce with the increase in gamma irradiation dose . The surface morphology and hardness measurements show an improvement in the sample surface after irradiation .
