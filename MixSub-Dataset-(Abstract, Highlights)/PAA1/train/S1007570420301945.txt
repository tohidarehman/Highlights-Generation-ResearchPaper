 This paper reports a sequential design of linearly controlling a three dimensional quadratic system to a simple six dimensional hyperchaotic system with complex dynamics . By adding three linear dynamical controllers the resulting 6D system has no equilibrium and a hidden attractor which has four positive Lyapunov exponents . This paper focuses on the 6D system to reveal its unusual dynamics such as infinitely many singularly degenerate heteroclinic cycles and bifurcations from such singular orbits to hidden hyperchaotic attractors . Detailed numerical investigations are carried out including bifurcation diagram LE spectrum and phase portrait . Furthermore the system has multistability corresponding to three types of equilibria including no equilibrium and infinite non isolated equilibria . In particular we find that at least seven different attractors coexist when the system has one equilibrium line . Finally this 6D hyperchaotic system is verified by 01 test and a circuit .

@highlight Presents a new 6D hidden hyperchaotic system with four positive Lyapunov exponents which has no equilibrium or one equilibrium line or two equilibrium lines depending on different parameter values.
@highlight Shows that the new system has many unusual complex dynamical behaviors such as infinitely many singularly degenerate heteroclinic cycles and bifurcations from such singular orbits to hidden hyperchaotic attractors.
@highlight Shows that the system has multi stability corresponding to three types of equilibrium especially the coexistence of seven attractors when the system has one equilibrium line.
@highlight Implements this system by 01 test and electronic circuit which displays very good agreement with the simulation result.
