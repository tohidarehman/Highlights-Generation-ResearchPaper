 Quantification of fringe orders is important in visualizing full field stress in digital photoelasticity . Various methods have been developed to improve the calculated accuracy of fringe orders such as the phase shifting carrier and RGB methods . However in these methods fringe orders are calculated using the photoelastic patterns under a certain load but not the patterns in the whole time series this impedes quantification of the fringe orders in dynamic photoelasticity . In this study a polarized light camera was employed to simultaneously capture the photoelastic patterns of the dark and bright fields under circular polariscope . Based on the light intensity difference of these patterns in the entire loading process a method of quantifying fringe orders is proposed . Full field fringe orders in a disk fabricated by 3D printer and subjected to three compressive loads were calculated using this method . Its good accuracy improved by removing the background light and choosing a suitable capture frame rate was verified by comparing the fringe orders calculated by the traditional and proposed methods . Furthermore the determination of the full field fringe orders in complex structures indicated that the complexity of tested models had no influence on the calculated accuracy .

@highlight A novel quantification method of the full field fringe orders is developed.
@highlight The good accuracy of the method is verified by comparing with traditional method.
@highlight The good applicability of the method in complex structure models is testified.
