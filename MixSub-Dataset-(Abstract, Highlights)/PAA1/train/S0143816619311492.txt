 Reconstructing 3D human body models for real people benefits a variety of applications . However it is challenging to reconstruct high fidelity human body models with high accuracy . This study presents an accurate and efficient 3D human body reconstruction system based on digital image correlation which can simultaneously capture high quality 3D human body model and high fidelity 2D color texture . The 3D reconstruction system is set up with twenty seven cameras and nine speckle pattern projectors which is able to acquire 3D shape data and 2D color data . Specifically the nine binocular stereo vision systems are adopted to reconstruct 3D shape where the 3D reconstruction is carried out based on stereo DIC with a speckle pattern projector . The other nine color cameras are utilized to capture 2D color texture . It only needs a single shot to record the images required for 3D reconstruction which takes about 1.25ms to ensure the high accuracy and high efficiency of the proposed 3D reconstruction system . A high precision multi camera calibration method is employed to calibrate the proposed multi camera system . The mapping relationship between the reconstructed 3D object point and the 2D color image is determined by the calibrated result which makes the color texture acquisition precisely and effectively . The proposed system can achieve accurate and high quality 3D reconstruction of the whole human body surface with high fidelity color texture . Experimental results demonstrate the high performance of the proposed 3D reconstruction system .
