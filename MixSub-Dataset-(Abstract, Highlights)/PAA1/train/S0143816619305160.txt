 To deal with vibration disturbance in interferometric measurement of surface topography we present a simultaneous dual wavelength phase shifting interferometry . SDWPSI collects phase shifting interferograms of two wavelengths simultaneously with two cameras to accelerate data collection . The optical phases are retrieved from dual wavelength interferograms with an iterative algorithm that is tolerant of phase shifting error caused by vibration . And then the measured surface topography is reconstructed by fusing the phases of two wavelengths . Simulations and experiments verify that SDWPSI has a lower measurement noise than single wavelength interferometry and extends the discontinuity limit to several micrometres . SDWPSI has advantages of high speed vibration resistance and low cost and could be applied to in workshop and on machine measurement .
