 In this work we have performed first principles calculations to investigate effects of pressure on structural and mechanical properties as well as temperature on thermodynamic properties of refractory ZrTM . ZrTM are mechanically stable and ductile at 018GPa and elastic constants and elastic moduli can be improved at appropriate pressures . The lattice parameters phonon dispersions phonon densities of states heat capacity thermal expansion coefficient Debye temperature and Grneisen constant at temperatures of 01500K and pressures of 018GPa were investigated . The phonon dispersions showed that ZrTM are dynamically stable . The thermal expansion coefficients of ZrTM are in a sequence of ZrFe ZrRu ZrOs . The dependence of temperature and pressure on Grneisen parameter is opposite to Debye temperature .
