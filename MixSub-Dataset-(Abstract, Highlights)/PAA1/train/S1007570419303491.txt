 In this paper an interval observer is synthesized for fractional linear systems with additive noise and disturbances . The contribution of system whole past to future output is taken into account as an initialization function . Provided the initialization function is upper and lower bounded it is shown in this paper that the fractional interval observer allows to bound pseudo state free responses by an upper and a lower trajectory . In case interval observers can not be synthesized straightforwardly so as to obtain a stable and non negative estimation error it is shown that a change of coordinates allows to overcome this problem . The proposed methodology allows to bound fractional systems trajectories when the whole past is unknown but can be bounded . Finally a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods on the initialization of fractional linear systems .

@highlight An interval observer is synthesized for fractional linear systems with additive noise and disturbance.
@highlight Fractional interval observer is used to bound pseudo state free response by an upper and a lower trajectory which is useful when system initial conditions are unknown.
@highlight A static linear transformation of coordinates is proposed when interval observer cannot be synthesized straightforwardly.
