 The solute segregation behavior at two types of carbideferrite interfaces was investigated by Atom Probe Tomography technique in a 16MND5 weld before and after ion irradiation . The two types of carbides are cementite and M

@highlight A higher P segregation level at cementite ferrite interfaces than M
@highlight C carbideferrite interfaces.
@highlight No influence of the intergranular carbides on solute segregation behavior at the vicinal GBs within the first tens of nm from carbides .
@highlight A higher P segregation at the intersection region between carbide and GB.
@highlight The RES mechanism of P at carbideferrite interfaces after ion irradiation.
