 We introduce a new general class of nonlinear variable order fractional partial differential equations . The NVOFPDE contains as special cases several partial differential equations such as the nonlinear variable order fractional equations usually denoted as Klein Gordon diffusion wave and convection diffusion wave . To find the numerical solution of the NVOFPDE we formulate a novel class of basis functions called generalized shifted Chebyshev polynomials that includes the shifted Chebyshev polynomials as a particular case . The solution of the NVOFPDE is expanded following the GSCP and the corresponding operational matrices of VO fractional derivatives in the Caputo type are obtained . An optimization method based on the GSCP and the Lagrange multipliers converts the problem into a system of nonlinear algebraic equations . The convergence analysis is guaranteed through a theorem concerning the GSCP and several numerical examples confirm the precision of the method .

@highlight This paper introduces a new general class of nonlinear variable order fractional partial differential equations NVOFPDE that contains as special cases several partial differential equations such as the nonlinear variable order fractional equations usually denoted as KleinGordon diffusion wave and convection diffusion wave.
@highlight Shifted Chebyshev polynomials SCP are developed to the new family of basis functions namely generalized shifted Chebyshev polynomials GSCP .
@highlight A new variable order fractional operational matrix in the Caputo type for the GSCP is derived.
@highlight A new optimization method based on the GSCP with the help of the Lagrange multipliers is proposed for the NVOFPDE.
@highlight The defined GSCP rather SCP needs less basis functions to provide satisfactory results with the same level of accuracy.
