 We report a computational 3D microscopy technique termed Fourier ptychographic diffraction tomography that iteratively stitches together numerous variably illuminated low resolution images acquired with a low numerical aperture objective in 3D Fourier space to create a wide field of view high resolution depth resolved complex refractive index image across large volumes . Unlike conventional optical diffraction tomography approaches that rely on controlled bright field illumination holographic phase measurement and high NA objective detection FPDT employs tomographic RI reconstruction from low NA intensity only measurements . In addition FPDT incorporates high angle dark field illuminations beyond the NA of the objective significantly expanding the accessible object frequency . With FPDT we present the highest throughput ODT results with 390nm lateral resolution and 899nm axial resolution across a 10 FOV of 1.77mm

@highlight We report a computational label free 3D microscopy technique termed Fourier ptychographic diffraction tomography FPDT .
@highlight FPDT uses intensity only measurements to create wide field of view high resolution depth resolved complex 3D refractive index images without resorting to interferometry.
@highlight We built a high numerical aperture NA programmable LED illumination based FPDT platform endowing a 10X 0.4 NA objective lens with the effective imaging performance of 1.3 NA.
@highlight We present the highest throughput ODT results with a lateral resolution of 390nm and an axial resolution of 899nm across a 10X FOV of 1.77mm
@highlight and a depth of focus of 20m. The full FOV 3D reconstruction contains 17.2 billion voxels of quantitative 3D RI data.
@highlight 3D tomographic imaging results of biological samples diatoms HeLa cells blood smear establish FPDT as a powerful non invasive and label free tool for high throughput 3D microscopy applications.
