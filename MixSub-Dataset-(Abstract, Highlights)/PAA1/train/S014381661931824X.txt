 This paper presents a compact design for spectral shearing interferometry to reconstruct an ultrafast electric field with a high signal to noise ratio and stability . Compared experimentally with the traditional SPIDER based on a Michelson interferometer this design can improve the SNR by a factor of 3.7 in a 25dB BW region . Using the material dispersions of 6mm BK7 plates as a target the phase errors between the measured and theoretical values are less than 2.6mrad which is improved by a factor of 4 from 10.3mrad measured with the MI based version . Even for a 1mm fused silica plate the measured phase errors are less than 2.1mrad from the calculated values . Using this design for a 3 day test of our ultrashort pulse laser system the variation in the output pulse width from the first to the third day is only 1.5 . We attribute this excellent performance to the common path and all transmission design of the test pulse pair giving the design superior capacity against external disturbances . Our design can also work with the two step phase shift method to improve its measurement of the plulses with complex temporal spectral structures .
