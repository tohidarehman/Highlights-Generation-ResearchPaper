 We demonstrate that the magnetic tetrahedral structure and electronic properties of FeSe films are closely related to the in plane biaxial strain . Our calculations show that the magnetic ground state of FeSe films maintain their striped antiferromagnetic order even under biaxial compressive or tensile strain . Upon increasing the compressive strain the structure of the FeSe

@highlight The tetrahedral and electronic properties of FeSe films can be tuned by applying in plane biaxial strain.
