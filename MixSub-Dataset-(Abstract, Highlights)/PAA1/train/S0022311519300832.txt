 The European Mini Plate Irradiation Experiment aims to test the in pile behavior of various ZrN coated UMo powder batches produced using different technological processes . UMo particles are typical core shell systems taking advantages of a dense fissile material UMo with a coated ZrN layer acting as a diffusion barrier . The U 7Mo kernels were produced by centrifugal or rotating electrode atomization processes and the ZrN coating was performed by physical vapor deposition or atomic layer deposition processes . A total of ten batches of UMo powders were examined in the as obtained state

@highlight Ten selected UMo ZrN powders for the EMPIrE in pile tests have been examined.
@highlight UMo ZrN powder particles were examined in the as produced state.
@highlight Size and shape parameters were determined by means of digital image processing.
@highlight Classification of the batches is presented as radar chart.
@highlight Thickness roughness and grain structure of the ZrN films were examined.
