 Specimens of reactor vessel internals made of 18Cr10NiTi steel from the decommissioned VVER 440 unit after 45 years of operation were investigated . The aim was to assess the structure degradation degree responsible for the properties changes of RVI components . Radiation induced structural elements of RVI baffle former and flux thimble specimens with the damaging dose 7.943.0 dpa and irradiation temperature 280315C were studied using TEM SEM and APT methods . TEM studies showed the negligible swelling under these conditions with a slight increase of radiation swelling due to the formation of the low density large void population in case of higher temperature irradiation . APT studies revealed the formation of the high density NiSi rich clusters and an increase of its volume fraction with the temperature increase . The Orowan equation was used to assess the hardening contribution of different radiation induced structural elements . The observed yield strength increase is insignificant under the studied conditions .

@highlight RVI samples from the decommissioned VVER 440 unit is studied by TEM SEM and APT.
@highlight Void swelling observed in the studied dose range 843dpa is negligible.
@highlight Higher irradiation temperature slightly increases the swelling by large voids formation.
@highlight High density of NiSi clusters is observed presumably G and phase precursors .
