 In this work the low loading palladium graphene oxide aerogels are facilely prepared via the lyophilisation vacuum and reduction treatments . The Pd GO aerogels display enhanced activity and stability in comparison to the commercial Pd C. The enhancement of electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the functional groups on the surfaces of the GO support such as carbonyl and carboxyl groups which can be tuned to interact with palladium to form active phases for the reaction . In addition Pd nanoparticles remain dispersed in nanoscale on the reacted catalyst .
