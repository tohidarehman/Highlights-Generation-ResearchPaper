 We introduce a simple and eco friendly synthesis of multiwalled carbon nanotubes with silver nanoparticles as a MWCNT Ag hybrid . A solution is made of MWCNTs and AgNO

@highlight Multi walled carbon nanotubes MWCNTs decorated Silver nanoparticles Ag NPs hybrid is synthesised by a new simple method.
@highlight TEM analysis show that Ag NPs are well attached onto the MWCNTs.
@highlight The surface enhanced Raman scattering enhancement depends on the reaction temperature size and concentration of Ag NPs.
@highlight The nonlinear absorption exhibits reverse saturable absorption RSA behaviour due to the two photon absorption and excited state absorption process.
