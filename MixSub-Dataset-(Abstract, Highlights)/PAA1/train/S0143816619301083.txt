@highlight An efficient visually meaningful image compression and encryption VMICE scheme is proposed by combining compressive sensing CS and Least Significant Bit LSB embedding.
@highlight In pre encryption a compressed secret image is obtained by use of CS and Zigzag confusion the resolution of the image is reduced and the data content is protected.
@highlight Dynamic LSB embedding process is controlled by random chaotic sequences generated from a 3 D Cat map and out of order embedding increases the difficulty of the decoding process.
@highlight The adoption of LSB embedding allows for carrier image to be selected independently of plain image.
