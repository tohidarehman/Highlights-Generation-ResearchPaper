 The nucleation of helium bubbles in the early aging stage of tritium storage materials will have an important influence on the bubble growth behavior in the whole of aging . Herein the nucleation of helium bubbles was adjusted by environment temperature at the first 15 days immediately after preparation of polycrystalline titanium tritide films . The influence of the environment temperature on the nucleation of helium bubbles were studied by X ray diffraction positron annihilation spectroscopy thermal helium desorption spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy . Results demonstrate that the helium bubble nucleation is significantly affected by the environment temperature of60C 20C and 120C . The higher the environment temperature the lower number density of helium bubble in the titanium tritide films . The helium bubble nucleation mechanism is strongly correlated to the helium atom diffusion coefficient that is controlled by the environment temperature . During the following aging the rate of helium atoms captured by a single helium bubble increases in titanium tritides with low number density bubbles which accelerates the growth of helium bubbles in the matrix . However the low number density bubbles also decrease the capture probability of free helium atoms by helium bubbles resulting in the increase of helium atoms diffusing to infinite size defects such as grain boundaries macroscopically and accelerating the evolution of helium in titanium tritides .
