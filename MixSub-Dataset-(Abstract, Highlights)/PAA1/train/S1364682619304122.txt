 This study assesses the possibility of using Global Navigation Satellite System observations in combination with measurements of surface pressure and temperature to derive Integrated Water Vapor IWV

@highlight SIRGAS zenith total delays contribute to water vapor monitoring in Latin America.
@highlight GNSS stations contribute to the monitoring of tropospheric water vapor in Argentina.
@highlight IWV increases and relative atmospheric pressure falls preceding onset of precipitation.
