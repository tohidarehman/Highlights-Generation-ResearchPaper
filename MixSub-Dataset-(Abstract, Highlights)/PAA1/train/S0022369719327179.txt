 This study assessed the ability of glass ceramics that included zirconolite and barite to protect against different kinds of radiation . Firstly the mass attenuation coefficient values of five different glass ceramics with different amounts of SO

@highlight  values of glass ceramics were simulated by MCNPX codes.
@highlight Vital shielding parameters of glass ceramics HVL LAC Z
@highlight  Z
@highlight  and EBF were surveyed.
@highlight R was used to determine the ability of the ceramics to attenuate fast neutrons.
@highlight The ability of the glass ceramics to stop alpha and proton particles was determined.
