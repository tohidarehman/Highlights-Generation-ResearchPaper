 Peeling is considered to be the main technical obstacle for coating applications . There are many factors that affect the peeling process of coatings . The interfacial properties of the coating and substrate play a crucial role in the peeling process . In this study the work of adhesion W

@highlight Diamond 001 Si 001 and Si 001 Ti 0001 interfaces have been investigated.
@highlight Typical polar covalent bonds occur in the diamond 001 Si 001 interface.
@highlight The Si 001 Ti 0001 interface is formed of weak covalent and metallic bonds.
@highlight The deformation of Ti is the key failure mode of interface in the shear process.
