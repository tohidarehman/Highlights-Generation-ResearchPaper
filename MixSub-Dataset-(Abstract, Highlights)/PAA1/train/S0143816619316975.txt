 Amorphous alloys have great potential in industrial applications . However metallurgical characteristics of those materials during laser welding are still unclear . In this research pulsed Nd YAG laser welding was performed on the Ti dendrite reinforced amorphous alloy plates . The microstructures of the welding joints were specially observed and analyzed . Results show that no metallurgical defects were found in the joints . There is no obvious heat affected zone between the fusion zone and base material . The microstructure in the fusion zone consists of Ti grains and amorphous matrix . Due to the fast cooling speed and the shock effect from the laser pulse during welding the spherical shape Ti grains in the FZ are in nanometer scales which are much smaller than the dendrite Ti grains in the base materials . Element distribution analysis showed that the Mo atoms trend to enter the Ti lattice to form a solid solution . Therefore the Mo element has the similar distribution with the Ti element in the joint . The hardness in FZ is higher than that in BM .

@highlight In the fusion zone the micro Ti dendrites embed on the amorphous background.
@highlight The spherical Ti grains are in nanometer scale in fusion zone.
@highlight Large cooling speed and impact effect from laser pulse restrain the grain size.
@highlight The tensile strength of the joint can be as high as 1600MPa.
