 Lasota and Myjak demonstrated that one can study attractors to an iterated function system possibly containing discontinuous functions . We continue this line of thought by working with IFS with a lower semicontinuous Hutchinson Barnsley operator and two new types of attractors the small attractor and minimal attractors . We characterize exactly when an IFS possesses a small attractor and provide several practically verifiable sufficient conditions for this . To study minimal attractors we create the notion of the weak basin we show a minimal attractor behaves much like a small attractor on its weak basin and that the weak basin is the largest set in which a minimal attractor behaves like this . We then give a characterization of when the weak basin is open . Further we show that when the iterates of the Hutchinson Barnsley operator of an IFS form an equicontinuous set of multifunctions both the weak basin and the point wise basin is closed .

@highlight Characterized when an iterated function system IFS posses a small attractor.
@highlight We show that minimal attractors and small attractors admit a basin of attraction called the weak basin.
@highlight We found under certain conditions the pointwise basin of a pointwise attractor is the entire space.
