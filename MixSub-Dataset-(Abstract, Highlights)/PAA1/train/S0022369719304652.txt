 On the semi insulating 4HSiC surface hydrogenated multilayers graphene were epitaxially prepared by the method of Joule heating decomposition in the hydrogen atmosphere . The structural and chemical characteristics of multilayers graphene have been elaborately analyzed by the X ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopies showing the level of hydrogenation being promoted with the increase of hydrogen pressure . Then diodes with MLG 4HSiC contact were fabricated and studied proving that the Schottky barrier height of MLG 4HSiC junction was enhanced by the hydrogenation . By studying the typical current voltage characteristics the SBH was observed to be heightened from 0.84eV to 1.0eV along with the hydrogen pressure increasing from 10
