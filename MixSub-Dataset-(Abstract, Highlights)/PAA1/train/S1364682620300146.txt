 In 2017 CARPET cosmic ray detector was installed at KACST at Riyadh latitude 24.67 longitude 46.74 alt . 613 m geomagnetic cuttoff rigidity R

@highlight CARPET cosmic ray detector was installed at Riyadh cut off rigidity R
@highlight  14.4 GV Saudi Arabia.
@highlight One of the main goal of this detector is to investigate CR correlations with solar activity and atmospheric phenomena.
@highlight The detector performance was tested and showed comparable results to our existing 1 m
@highlight scintillator and multi wire detectors.
@highlight Short periodicities of the CR recorded by CARPET were found to be in good agreement with those reported by different researchers.
