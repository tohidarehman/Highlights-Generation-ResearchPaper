 Measuring the vibration frequency of structures with image processing methods is one of the non contact measurement methods . However the frequency to be measured should be lower than the camera capture speed . In this study a method was developed to extract and to compare pattern characteristics of data acquired from a pixel of a low speed camera . At the first stage images of a rotating disk were recorded at known frequencies to find out the cameras response . After that distinctive features were extracted both from the raw and clustered intensity data acquired from the pixels of the recorded images . At the second stage pixel intensity data of a rotating disk with an unknown frequency was also recorded with the same camera . Similarly features were extracted from these data and they were compared with the features at known frequencies . A frequency range was found for the unknown frequency value in this way . Finally the unknown frequency value was estimated by interpolation in the frequency range . The method was verified on an experimental setup and five unknown frequency values were successfully estimated . Consequently higher frequencies than the capture speed of the camera were correctly estimated using the developed method . On the other hand it was also noticed that the clustering of the discrete intensity data was also significant .

@highlight Signals do not only consist of essential features but the data distribution of a signal is also significant.
@highlight An unknown signal can be analyzed using the clustering features of the signals.
@highlight Estimating the frequency value of high frequency vibrations using low speed cameras is possible.
