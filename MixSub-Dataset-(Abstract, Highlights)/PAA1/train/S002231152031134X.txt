 Radioactive iodine isotopes that are discharged into environment have been of significant concern due to its long term impact on public health . In this work a new bismuth based composite named

@highlight was synthesized by electrospinning pre oxidation and carbonization.
@highlight Carbonization could reduce Bi
@highlight to elemental Bi successfully.
@highlight possessed high iodine adsorption capacity.
@highlight Chemisorption by forming BiI
@highlight was the main capturing mechanism.
