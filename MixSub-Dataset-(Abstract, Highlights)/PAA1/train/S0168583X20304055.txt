 This study is designed to examine the thermoluminescence characteristics of potassium fluoride for possible use as a thermoluminescence dosemeter . Thermoluminescence measurements were carried out at doses up to 20Gy and heating rates between 0.2 and 4C s. The glow curve of the fluoride readout at 1Cs

@highlight Potassium fluoride has two main TL peaks.
@highlight The TL peaks have linear dose response.
@highlight Four TL peaks were indicated by deconvolution.
@highlight Thermal quenching affected one of the peaks.
