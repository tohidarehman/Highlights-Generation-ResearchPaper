 The early stage thermal age hardening and the resultant nanoscale structure of 12Cr 12Cr7Al and 18Cr9Al ODS steels have been studied by Vickers hardness measurements and atom probe tomography respectively after isothermally ageing at 475C for 300h . The thermal age hardening of 12Cr 12Cr7Al and 18Cr9Al ODS steels was measured to be 4 HV 45 HV and 34 HV respectively . The results of APT analyses revealed that no phase separation occurred in all the three ODS steels while a significant precipitation of enriched phase with crystallography closely related to Heusler type Fe

@highlight Early stage ageing behavior of FeCrAl ODS steels was studied at 475C for 300h.
@highlight No phase separation was observed in 12Cr 12Cr7Al and 18Cr9Al ODS steels.
@highlight Early stage hardening of 12Cr7Al 18Cr9Al ODS steels is due to phase formation.
@highlight The precipitation of phases has no relationship with phase separation.
@highlight The fast precipitation of phases is due to the high diffusivities of Al and Ti.
