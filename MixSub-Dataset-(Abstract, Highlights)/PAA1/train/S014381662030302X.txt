 Calibration of a stereo vision system is essential for three dimensional shape and deformation measurements . Although the target based calibration technique is a good solution it comes with limitations in a large field of view measurement due to the target size and difficulties in operation . In this paper a method using the inertial measurement unit has been proposed to calibrate stereo vision systems for large scale measurements . The prerequisite for this method is to calibrate the camera intrinsic parameters in advance . With the alignment of IMU sensor with the camera the relative rotation between the two cameras can be determined through coordinate transform . An angular differential method has been developed to improve accuracy in determining the yaw angle . After the epipolar geometry is constructed upon stereo scene correspondences the translation vector can be obtained by solving a set of linear equations since the intrinsic parameters and the relative rotation are predefined . The proposed method does not require any known calibration target leading to easy operation in practice . Two laboratory experiments are presented to demonstrate the use of the method . The experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed method is comparable to that resulted from the well known Zhang s method and it can also be applied to measurement with a large FOV .

@highlight The use of inertial measurement units IMU offers a feasible solution to directly determine the rotation matrix of the stereo vision system.
@highlight An angular differential method has been developed to accurately determine the relative Euler angles between fused camera IMU units.
@highlight The translation vector between cameras is determined from solving a series of linear equations instead of the use of SVD method.
@highlight Experimental results suggest the proposed method is comparable to the Zhang s calibration method and is able to be applied to measurement with large FOV.
