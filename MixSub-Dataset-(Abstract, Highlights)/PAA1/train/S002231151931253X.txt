 This study focused on the preparation of metallic uranium and uranium zirconium alloys to measure the effect significant porosity had on thermal diffusivity from 20

@highlight Samples of uranium metal and alloys of uranium 5 mass zirconium and 10 mass zirconium were prepared via powder metallurgy.
@highlight By controlling sintering parameters samples with a porosity up to 70 were obtained.
@highlight The thermal diffusivity of the samples was measured from 20C to 300C using the light flash technique.
@highlight The thermal conductivity of the samples was calculated using literature correlations.
@highlight Thermal conductivity as a function of porosity was plotted for each metal.
