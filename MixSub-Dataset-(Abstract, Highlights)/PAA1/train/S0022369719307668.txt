 A mixture of boric acid combined with trivalent samarium doped sodium borate was fired in air at 450C . The addition of water to the hot residue resulted in the generation of a product in which the incorporated samarium has been reduced from the trivalent form to the divalent state as identified by emission spectroscopy . This product has been identified as a synthetic form of the mineral sborgite . The divalent samarium emission appears to result from the samarium ion occupying a boron site in the material .

@highlight is formed in a sodium borate system fired at 450C.
@highlight The Sm
@highlight environment seems consistent in a variety of sample compositions.
@highlight Such a method could reduce other lanthanides such as europium ytterbium or thulium.
