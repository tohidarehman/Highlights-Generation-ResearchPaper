 The lifetime of tungsten monoblocks under fusion conditions is ambivalent . In this work the microstructure dependent mechanical behaviour of pulsed high heat flux exposed W monoblock is investigated . Two different microstructural states i.e . initial and recrystallized both machined from HHF exposed monoblocks are tested using tensile and small punch tests . The initial microstructural state reveals a higher fraction of low angle boundaries along with a preferred orientation of crystals . Following HHF exposure the recrystallized state exhibits weakening of initial texture along with a higher fraction of high angle boundaries . Irrespective of the testing methodology both the microstructural states display brittle failure for temperatures lower than 400

@highlight Microstructure dependent high temperature mechanical testing of HHF exposed W monoblocks.
@highlight EBSD was used to distinguish the microstructural states and for further correlation with the mechanical behaviour.
@highlight Irrespective of the testing methodology temperature the recrystallized state showed better ductility in comparison to the initial deformed state.
@highlight Recrystallization assisted lowering of brittle to ductile transition temperature BDTT occurred.
