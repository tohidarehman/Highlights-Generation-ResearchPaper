 Terahertz technique with plenty attractive properties such as its prominent detecting ability non destruction and non ionization has been getting increased attention . THz modulator enabling efficient manipulation is crucial for THz devices and sensing applications . However its practical implementation still remains a challenge because of the small modulation depth slow modulation rate and difficult operation way . Nanomaterials have been constantly creating possibilities for the advancement of THz technology . Considering their excellent optical and electrical characteristics gold nanorods are integrated with silicon based materials to improve the performance for THz modulation so as to promote the possibility of THz sensing in aqueous environment . In this paper the modulation ability of THz wave based on bare silicon with without dried GNR film liquid cell with GNR solutions and silicon channel with GNR solutions is systematically investigated . According to the results a six time larger modulation depth can be realized with the plasmonic effect of GNRs through infrared laser irradiation which is employed to increase the protein detection sensitivity up to ppm level in water state . It is anticipated that integrating nanomaterials with THz functional devices is meaningful to improve the performance of THz technology which could facilitate its wide applications in various fields .
