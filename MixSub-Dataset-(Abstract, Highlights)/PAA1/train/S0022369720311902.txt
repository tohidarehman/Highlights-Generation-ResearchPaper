 In the present study we employ spin polarized density functional theory for examining changes in the opto electronic properties of wide band gap barium zirconate by incorporating Vanadium and Phosphorous dopants at Zr and O sites of BaZrO

@highlight DFT calculations for Vanadium and Phosphorous doping in BaZrO
@highlight are reported using PBE GGA and mBJLDA functionals.
@highlight Structural energetic electronic and optical properties of the pristine mono doped and co doped systems are explored.
@highlight Introduction of P 
@highlight and V 
@highlight states in electronic structure of BaZrO
@highlight reduce the large band gap of this material.
@highlight Improved absorption of V P doped BaZrO
@highlight in the visible and UV region makes it suitable for photocatalysis applications.
