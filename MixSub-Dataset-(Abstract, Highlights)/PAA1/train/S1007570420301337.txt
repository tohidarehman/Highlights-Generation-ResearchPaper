 The nonlinear partial differential governing equations of the planar motion of a Z shaped structure are derived using Hamilton s principle . The 1 2 internally resonant global analytical mode shapes are validated by figure contrast and the modal assurance criterion . The partial differential governing equations are truncated into a two degree of freedom ordinary differential system with the validated resonant global analytical mode shapes and they are further investigated for internal and simultaneous primary resonances . The steady state responses are studied and numerical simulations of the system are performed . Complex nonlinear phenomena in the system such as jumps bifurcations quasiperiodic motion and chaos are observed under specific parameters . The parametric rule of these phenomena obviously depends on the accuracy of mode shapes . This work proposes a nonlinear analysis based on the quantitative validation of mode shapes which may provide new insights into the optimal design of the parameters and the precise control of the motions of Z shaped or other multibeam structures in engineering .

@highlight The resonant global analytical mode shapes are obtained by considering both the axial and transverse displacements.
@highlight The analytical mode shapes are validated based on figure comparisons and MACs.
@highlight The steady state responses of the system are solved as functions of the frequency and amplitude of the excitation.
@highlight Periodic multiperiodic quasiperiodic and chaotic motions are analyzed numerically.
@highlight The accuracy of the mode shapes plays an important role in determining the parametric rule of certain nonlinear phenomena.
