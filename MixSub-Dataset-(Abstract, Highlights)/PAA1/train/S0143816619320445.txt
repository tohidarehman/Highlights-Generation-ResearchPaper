 An automatic detection method of crystal defect positions including interface dislocations and a strain imaging method for an arbitrarily oriented atomic array were developed based on the sampling moir technique . An automatic defect location detection algorithm was proposed by defining a defect detection coefficient . As an application a transmission electron microscope image of a Ge Si crystal structure was investigated and the atomic arrays including defects were in situ amplified in a large field of view . The locations of defects and interface dislocations were automatically detected . The strain distribution of this structure was presented and the complex interface curve was plotted . All the positions and atom distribution trends of common dislocations in Ge and Si arrays and the Ge Si interface dislocations were verified successfully from the enlarged TEM images . These dislocations were caused by the mismatch between
