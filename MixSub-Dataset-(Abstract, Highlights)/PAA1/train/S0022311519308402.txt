 A layer of Cr coating on the inner surface of HT9 cladding is a promising barrier to hinder fuel and cladding chemical interaction in sodum coolded fast reactors . Cr barriers obtained with various current densities and electrolyte temperatures used for the electrodeposition of HT9 disks were investigated for thickness Vickers hardness and the existence and length of microcracks . The crack free Cr barrier electrodeposited at 1.6 A cm

@highlight Fuel and cladding chemical interaction FCCI on inner surface of HT9 cladding tubes were mitigated by Cr coating layer.
@highlight A Cr barrier with sound microstructure was successfully coated using electrodeposition process.
@highlight Burst and tensile mechanical tests verified the excellent adhesion and ductile characteristics of Cr barriers.
