 A special bottle beam was obtained by shaping the elliptical Gaussian beam through an axicon optical system . When elliptical Gaussian beams have a different eccentricity the optical field distribution after axicon and the focusing lens was investigated . By comparison with a circular Gaussian beam this asymmetry leads to the formation of a non diffracting beam from a quasi Bessel beam characteristic to a quasi Mathieu beam characteristic after the incident axicon . At the same time the bottle beams produced by the asymmetric light source incident on the axicon lens system showed changes in the front and rear sides . In addition the variation of the diffraction spot in the optical space region on the bottle beam axis was also analyzed . On this basis a hollow light spot tweezer with quasi Pearcey beam handle was obtained which is expected to expand the application of particle trapping operation .

@highlight Design a particularly interesting bottle beam can be used as an optical tweezers capture beam.
@highlight Beneficial distortion of diffraction spots in the internal space of a bottle beam.
@highlight The particles are first captured by a bottle beam and the four quasi Pearcey beam handles add flexibility to the freedom of manipulation of the particles.
