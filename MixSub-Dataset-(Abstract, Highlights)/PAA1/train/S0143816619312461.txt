 Laser surface patterning has attracted a significant interest from industry and research due to its promising applications in surface functionalisation . However there are specific issues and limitations associated with the beam delivery especially when processing 3 D surfaces and or setting up routines for executing complex multi axis processing strategies . In particular there are common processing disturbances that affect the resulting surface topographies and profiles and their respective functional responses i.e . geometrical distortions of resulting surface patterns focal offset distance and variations of beam incident angle . A method to investigate the effects of these factors in laser patterning 3 D surfaces is presented in this research especially how their effects can be analysed independently by conducting empirical studies on planar surfaces . A pilot implementation of the proposed methodology is reported for producing channel like patterns on stainless steel plates with a super hydrophobic functional response . The results are discussed in detail to show how the effects of processing disturbances on topographies profiles and areal parameters together with the respective functional responses of patterned planar surfaces can be analysed and then used to set constraints in pre processing 3 D surfaces for follow up laser patterning .

@highlight A methodology to investigate the effects of processing disturbances in laser patterning of 3 D surfaces was proposed.
@highlight The effect of processing disturbances on the functional response was studied.
@highlight The proposed methodology can be used to find constraints prior to the partition of 3 D surfaces to be laser patterned.
@highlight Areal surface parameters Ar and Sa were found good indicators about the process performance and can be used for inline monitoring.
