 Magnetic nanoparticles have been synthesized on mesoporous silica by a simple method without the need for either an alkali or an organic solvent nor for rigorous pH control making it a safe procedure for the nanomedicine field . The systems have been exhaustively characterized through different instrumental techniques including the analysis of physicochemical properties by N
