 The Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere region plays an important role in the climate system . Quantifying the processes that control UTLS represents a crucial task . We assess UTLS trends and associated tropopause parameters Lapse Rate Tropopause temperature altitude Convective outflow level temperature altitude and Tropical Tropopause Layer thickness . This study is based on high resolution daily radiosonde data from 2006 to 2018 over a tropical station Gadanki in south India supported by satellite measurements . The results show an increase of CPH of 0.06km decrease of CPT of 1.09K increase of COH of 0.29km and decrease of TTL thickness of 0.23km in the recent decade . The vertical temperature trends show a strong cooling trend at lower stratosphere with a maximum cooling rate of 1.30.86K per decade at 19.4km altitude unlike reported recently using global radiosonde network . A warming trend is observed in the entire troposphere with maximum warming rate of 0.440.55Kat 11.6km during the last decade . Distinct variability in the temperature is noticed below and above the tropopause with the strong seasonal change above the tropical tropopause compared to the below the tropopause . The observed trends are explained in relation to the ozone O

@highlight Long term trends in the UTLS temperature obtained using high accuracy radiosonde over Indian region is presented.
@highlight Unlike reported recently cooling trend in the lower stratosphere is still persistent over Indian region.
@highlight Compare to the ozone changes the WV increasing trend was found strongly influencing the LS cooling trend over ISM region.
