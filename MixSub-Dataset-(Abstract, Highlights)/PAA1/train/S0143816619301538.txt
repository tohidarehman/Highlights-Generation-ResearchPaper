 In a high speed stereovision system high speed cameras are used to record images and time information and the measurement accuracy depends on the time precision of the cameras . When two HSCs are used in a binocular stereovision system the image acquisitions of both cameras are unlikely to start simultaneously . The images that are supposed to be captured at the same time may record different states of the test object during an experiment which will cause measurement errors . In this work a theoretical model was established to correlate the start up time difference and the STD induced measurement errors of a binocular stereovision system . A simulation of the deflection of a cantilever beam verified the accuracy of the theoretical model . A suggestion of the experimental layout was discussed to reduce the STD induced measurement errors in one direction and a method was proposed to correct the STD induced measurement errors . The effectiveness of the correction method was validated by two experiments that is the trajectory of a marker point and the out of plane deformation of a bubble . The results showed that the absolute errors of the marker point trajectory were almost negligible and the deformation contours of the bubble were more symmetric after the correction . This correction method should be useful for three dimensional measurements of physical quantities using a binocular stereovision system .
