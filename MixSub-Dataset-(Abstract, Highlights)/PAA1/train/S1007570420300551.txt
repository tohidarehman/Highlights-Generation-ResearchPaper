 In order to explore the impacts of the time delayed velocity difference and backward looking effect on traffic flow this paper proposes an improved car following model based on the full velocity difference model by accounting for the time delayed velocity difference and backward looking effect . The linear stability condition of the proposed model is derived by taking advantage of the linear stability theory . The time dependent Ginzburg Landau equation and the modified Korteweg de Vries equation are established based on the nonlinear theory to describe the evolution of the traffic density waves near the critical stability point . Moreover the link between the TDGL and mKdV equations is also provided . Finally the results from both the numerical simulation and the theoretical analysis show that the proposed model can not only strengthen the stability of traffic flow but also suppress the traffic congestion .
