 In recent years due to high usage of fuel cells the development of novel catalysts to oxygen reduction reaction with high efficiency is a fundamental principle . In current study in acidic environment the performance of Al zigzag SiNT Al armchair SiNT and Al chiral SiNT to ORR were studied by theoretical models . Possible pathways for ORR on Al zigzag SiNT Al armchair SiNT and Al chiral SiNT via Eley Rideal and Langmuir Hinshelwood were examined . The optimal mechanism to ORR on Al zigzag SiNT Al armchair SiNT and Al chiral SiNT from thermodynamic view point was proposed . The overpotential values on Al zigzag SiNT Al armchair SiNT and Al chiral SiNT surfaces are 0.34 0.36 and 0.39V respectively . The calculated overpotential are lower than overpotential on platinum based catalysts . Finally the Al zigzag SiNT can be proposed as catalysts to ORR with high performance .
