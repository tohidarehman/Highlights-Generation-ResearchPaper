 To develop advanced reduced activation ferritic martensitic steels for fusion reactor structural applications both carbonitride and carbide strengthened castable nanostructured alloys were explored for higher densities of MX nanoprecipitates . Systematic comparisons between the two types of CNAs indicated generally similar microstructures and comparable tensile properties and creep resistance . However the carbide CNAs did show some advantages over the carbonitride CNAs in terms of the uniformly distributed higher density of MC nanoprecipitates greater Charpy impact upper shelf energies less deuterium retention and swelling and potentially less transmutation induced composition changes and consequently thermodynamically more stable carbides . The carbide CNAs showed the best balanced high performance in the examined properties in contrast to the significantly varied performance of oxide dispersion strengthened alloys and the generally lower performance of current RAFM steels .

@highlight Carbides provide better examined performance than carbonitrides to steels.
@highlight Compared to carbonitrides carbides are more uniformly distributed in the matrix.
@highlight Lower carbon and nitrogen content tend to yield greater Charpy absorbed energy.
