 When stainless steels are exposed to high irradiation dose a fraction of Frank loops will unfault and transform into perfect loops . After unfaulting perfect loops can glide and impinge into other loops to form dislocation networks and dislocation networks will act as sinks for point defects and solute elements . Besides unfaulting will influence the extent of irradiation hardening as well . Based on previous theories the size of Frank loops was considered to be a key factor in unfaulting . To better understand the unfaulting process 316L stainless steel model alloy was irradiated to 5dpa at 350C 400C and 450C by 3MeV Ni ions . Method was developed to quantitatively compare the size and density between Frank loops and perfect loops through relrod and weak beam dark field techniques . Results showed that unfaulting barely occurred at 350C but was distinct at 400C and 450C . The majority of perfect loops were in the size range of 816nmat 400C and were in the size range of 1220nmat 450C . The existence of a critical loop size for unfaulting was not supported by our results . Moreover by our results the energy of Frank loops does not play a decisive role in unfaulting and the simple approximation of geometric constraint in the rate theory to calculate unfaulting diameter needs to be revisited . Irradiation hardening was also analyzed by nano indention . It was found that loop unfaulting played an important role in the hardening decrease from 350C to 450C .
