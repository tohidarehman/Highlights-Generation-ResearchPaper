 The phase transitions of two nanoparticles and their corresponding bulk systems are examined by the effective field theory with correlations . It is clarified that the transition temperatures of such small nanoparticles may become larger than those of its corresponding bulk systems when the surface exchange interaction is selected as a large value .

@highlight Two Ising nanoparticles are investigated.
@highlight Their corresponding bulks are investigated.
@highlight The phase diagrams and magnetizations are discussed by using the EFT.
@highlight The possibility of Tc N nanoparticle Tc B bulk is discussed.
