 This paper analyses some operators recently proposed either as alternatives or as generalizations of classical fractional derivatives . The performance assessment both under the point of view of system theory and signal processing demonstrates that two approaches do not follow some systematic criteria . Therefore this paper contributes towards a systematic and careful study of the new proposals in the scope of the fast evolving area of Fractional Calculus .
