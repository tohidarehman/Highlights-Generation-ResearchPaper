 Photo mechanics is an important experiment means to study the structural mechanics behaviour . At present joint high speed observation system has become an important method with multiple high speed cameras but unknown startup delays among cameras will decrease the system s accuracy . To address the problem caused by the asynchronization of multi camera a high speed time measurement system is proposed to locate camera capturing time . Binary optical representation of time is adopted to design and implement the system . In order to reduce error in the system operating three theorems are presented and proved to illustrate the essence of binary code . Based on that an optimized algorithm is developed to transform optical representation to time information and then the errors are evaluated mathematically . The experimental results show that the proposed system successfully locates time at microsecond level with a shutter time of 9.615 us and the optimized approach reduces the maximum error and standard deviation of error by 722 and 52 times respectively . The systematic method proposed in this paper contributes to practical applications efficiently and accurately .
