 The controllable oxidation degree of graphene oxide by improving Hummers method are currently being addressed . In this work Improved Hummers method with appropriate optimization was used to yield GO . The oxidation degrees of GO were controlled via changing different phosphate intercalators KH

@highlight Graphene oxide was prepared with the intercalation of different phosphate salts.
@highlight Graphene oxides bear different oxidation degrees keeping large aromatic ring domains.
@highlight The efficiency of intercalation and oxidation changed with the cations of intercalators.
