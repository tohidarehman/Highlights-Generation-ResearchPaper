 The coherent potential approximation is applied to study the evolution of the electronic structure mainly in the vicinity of the energy gap of pure corundum Al

@highlight Changes of energy spectrum characteristics due to contributions of
@highlight  impurities and vacancy states inside the energy gap of undoped Al
@highlight are studied by the coherent potential approximation.
@highlight Compositions of Al
@highlight  based compounds with energy gap width comparable with visible range of solar spectrum are proposed for applications in photocatalysis and optical devices.
