 A compact and wireless multifunctional human machine interface based on fiber Bragg grating technology is presented . The interface is embedded into a glove and enables the motion capture of a human hand with finger tracking and hand wrist rotation monitoring as well as temperature and contact force detection . For the realization of a complex hand tracking a novel fiber optical rotation sensor based on three dimensional shape sensing with Edge FBG is presented . The data are evaluated within a micro interrogator and wireless transferred to a smart glass in real time . The HMI addressed different applications in motion capture for virtual reality or augmented reality .
