 In this paper several efficient energy dissipative linear difference schemes are presented and analyzed for solving the coupled nonlinear damped fractional wave equations . First the weighted shifted Grnwald difference formula is used to approach the considered fractional system in space direction . Then we apply second order centered difference scheme and invariant energy quadratization Crank Nicolson scheme to discrete the resulting system in time direction respectively . Subsequently the convergence and stability of the proposed schemes are discussed . By using the discrete energy method and a cut off function technique it is proven that the suggested schemes attain the convergence orders of
