 Alkali metal doped strontium meta silicate a highly conductive system is being studied as an alternative to solid electrolyte for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells . Its high electrical conductivity is attributed to its structure and dopant strategies . Based on the recent reports it was observed that it can exist in multiple forms depending upon synthesis route and conditions . The present study deals with the analysis of polymorphism inside strontium meta silicate SrSiO

@highlight Monomer and Trimer Strontium meta silicate SrSiO
@highlight was prepared via solid state reaction route.
@highlight Polymorphic phase formation of SrSiO
@highlight system was studied through Rietveld refinement analysis.
@highlight The co existence of polymorph of Monoclinic trigonal and triclinic in SrSiO
@highlight is reported for the first time.
@highlight The electrical conductivity studies were performed for both monomeric and trimeric SrSiO
@highlight system.
@highlight The conductivity enhancement is observed due to the mutual variation of polymorphic phase content in SrSiO
