 We report the synthesis of iron mononitride thin films having zinc blende type structure deposited using a direct current magnetron sputtering process on amorphous quartz substrates . The effect of substrate temperature

@highlight Stoichiometric phase in FeN can be achieved in a narrow temperature range only.
@highlight Lattice parameter of FeN at 4.28 is closest to its theoretical value at 4.24 .
@highlight Minimization of stress generated during film growth led to stoichiometric FeN.
@highlight Through Fe N K edge XANES ZB type structure of FeN was confirmed.
@highlight First ever usage of EXAFS in FeN yield bond distances as predicted for ZB type FeN.
