 Presently the relaxation is mainly an empirical field of science . Despite the availability of microscopic theoretical models in practice the relaxation phenomena are generally described by a few empirical relaxation functions .

@highlight The general patterns of the relaxation phenomena are identified.
@highlight A new classification of the relaxation processes is suggested.
@highlight A generalized equation describing the known types of relaxation is proposed.
@highlight A number of new relaxation functions are obtained.
