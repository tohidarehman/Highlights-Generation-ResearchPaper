 We present the chemical surfactant mediated and green surfactant mediated synthesis of manganese oxide nanoparticles prepared by the precipitation method using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and tea extract respectively and their structural and optical properties . The nanoparticles were characterized by X ray diffraction scanning electron microscopyenergy dispersive X ray analysis UVVis spectroscopy and Fourier transform IR spectroscopy with regard to the diffraction pattern phase size shape composition of material etc . The Mn

@highlight Manganese III oxide is synthesized with manganese acetate tetrahydrate as a precursor.
@highlight The green surfactant assisted precipitation method uses chemical free tea grain extract as a surfactant.
@highlight The efficiency and properties of the green synthesized and chemically synthesized nanoparticles are compared.
@highlight The nanoparticles have well defined cubic and spherical shapes with sizes of 2050nm.
@highlight Antimicrobial activity oxidative transformation and removal of pollutants from water by photodegradation are studied.
