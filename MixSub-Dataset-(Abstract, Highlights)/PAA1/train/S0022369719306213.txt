 The properties of nickelcobalt alloys depend greatly on their composition . In this study we investigated the crystal structure and mechanical properties of nickelcobalt alloys with different compositions based on first principles calculations . The formation enthalpy

@highlight Structure of NiCo alloys changes from fcc to hcp as cobalt content increases.
@highlight fcc and hcp phases coexist at cobalt contents of 5080at. .
@highlight Formation enthalpy same for fcc phase and hcp phase at cobalt content of 65.5at. .
@highlight Stiffness hardness and compression shear resistance enhanced by high Co content.
@highlight Improved mechanical properties due to enhanced covalent bonds between NiCo and CoCo.
