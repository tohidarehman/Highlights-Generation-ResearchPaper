 In this paper we derive and analyze a reaction diffusion cholera model in bounded spatial domain with zero flux boundary condition and general nonlinear incidence functions . The parameters in the model are space dependent due to the spatial heterogeneity . By applying the theory of monotone dynamical systems and uniform persistence we prove that the model admits the global threshold dynamics in terms of the basic reproduction number

@highlight A diffusive cholera model with general incidence functions is studied.
@highlight The threshold property of the basic reproduction number R0 is established.
@highlight Cholera cannot be controlled only by limiting the movement of host individuals.
@highlight The spatial heterogeneity does not always enhance the disease spread.
