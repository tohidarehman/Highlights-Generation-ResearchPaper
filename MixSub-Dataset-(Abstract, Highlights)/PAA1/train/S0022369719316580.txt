 The application of photovoltaic technology is limited due to scarcity and toxicity of the efficient materials used for the energy conversion process . Nitridebased binaries can resolve these challenges by their abundance and nontoxicity as well as flexible structureproperty correlations emerging from the moderate electronegativity of the nitrogen atom . In this work thin films of earth abundant tin nitride Sn

@highlight Experimental strategy of simultaneous control over multiple processing parameters was adopted.
@highlight Influence of preferred orientation and defects on conduction band convergence was explored.
@highlight Single step band converging process optimized both the bandgap and absorption coefficient.
@highlight Thermoelectric parameters were integrated with optical analyses to explore band evolution.
