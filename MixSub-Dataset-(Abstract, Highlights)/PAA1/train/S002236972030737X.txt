 This work expresses an equation for polymer tunneling resistivity between adjacent carbon nanotubes in polymer nanocomposites . Two proper models for PCNT conductivity are connected to suggest the tunneling resistivity . The suggested equation expresses the tunneling resistivity by several main terms such as CNT content filler conductivity CNT dimensions CNT curliness percolation onset network portion interphase depth tunneling distance length and tunneling width . The developed models and the suggested equation are used to forecast the conductivity and tunneling resistivity in various samples . Furthermore all parameters significances on the tunneling resistivity are justified . The tunneling resistivity of samples decreases by increment of CNT concentration but high filler contents cause the slight variation of tunneling resistivity . Moreover low percolation onset dense interphase slight waviness high filler conductivity high fraction of networks and short tunneling space weaken the tunneling resistivity . The differences in the tunneling possessions significantly change the tunneling resistivity from 0 to 2500m while the wettability of filler by polymer medium insignificantly manipulates the tunneling resistivity .
