 In this work a feasible method has been introduced for investigating the proton tunneling frequency in Naphthazarin . A two dimensional potential energy surface which couples OH stretching with in plane bending modes has been computed for a firmed skeleton geometry at the B3LYP 6 31G B3LYP 6 311G B3LYP 6 311 G and MP2 6 31G levels . This potential energy function is used to calculate the tunneling frequency OH stretching and in plane bending frequencies . By calculations at the MP2 6 31G level the tunneling frequency of 15.3 and 0.9cm
