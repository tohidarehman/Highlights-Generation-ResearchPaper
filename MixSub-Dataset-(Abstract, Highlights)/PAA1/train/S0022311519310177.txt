 H bulk diffusion in Excel was measured using the Laser Induce Breakdown Spectrometry technique in 469 660K temperature range for the first time . D temperature dependence obeys the Arrhenius law with activation energy Q kJ mol and D

@highlight H diffusion in Excel was measured for the first time in 466660K temperature range.
@highlight The Arrhenius law is obey with Q 30kJ mol D
@highlight  3x10
@highlight  s.
@highlight Diffusion parameters are close to the Zr
@highlight Nb ones.
@highlight LIBS proves to be a suitable and improving technique to measure H diffusion in metals.
