 Polarization imaging is a promising technology with great potential . Besides light intensity it provides information in another dimension polarization . When imaging through water two frames of the target at two orthogonally polarized states

@highlight Two sub images determine clear polarization imaging results while manual operation leads to failed detection. It seeks help from optical correlation theory.
@highlight Optical correlation provides criterion for best images selection and considerable enhancement is achievable with this assistance.
@highlight It s potential to both underwater polarization imaging and polarization dehazing linear and circular polarization imaging.
