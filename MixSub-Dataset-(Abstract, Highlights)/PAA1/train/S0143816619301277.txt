 We proposed a full range Fourier domain optical coherence tomography based on a MachZehnder interferometer with a tilted mirror which could generate a series of accurate phase delay interference signals simultaneously . The FR FDOCT is capable of acquiring artifact free images by the construction of both amplitude and phase of the interferogram from multiple sets of phase delay signals . The MachZehnder interferometer make the reference arm became single way optical path which is more convenient to adjust the reference beam than the return way optical path of traditional systems . A series of phase delay interference signals were simultaneously acquired by a home made two dimensional spectrometer when tilting the mirror in the reference arm . The technique was employed to measure an anterior chamber of a porcine eye with a high symmetric artifact suppression of more than 45dB . The technology could achieve double range images effectively without any additional scanning device . It could actively promote the innovation and development of OCT technology .
