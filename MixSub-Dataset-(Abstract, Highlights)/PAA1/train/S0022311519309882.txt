 Oxide dispersion strengthened steels are promising accident tolerant fuel cladding alternatives because of their excellent oxidation resistance and mechanical properties at high temperatures . Coupons of 12Cr6Al ODS steel with an electron beam weld line were irradiated with 6.4MeV Fe

@highlight EB welded 12Cr6Al ODS steel was irradiated at 300C to 2.6 7.9 and 13.0 dpa.
@highlight Oxide particles in ODS base metal were stable at 300C up to 13.0 dpa.
@highlight Higher irradiation hardening in EB weld line than base metal.
@highlight Evolution of loop size and number density in ODS base metal and EB weld line.
