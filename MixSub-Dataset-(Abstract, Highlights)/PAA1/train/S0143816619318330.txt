 The three dimensional simulation of powder particle entering melt pool during laser solid forming was carried out in our quest to establish a general representative model of this phenomenon . The effect of the gas liquid interface on the motion state of the powder was analyzed and the accuracy and universality of the model were verified using a high speed photographic experimental approach . Further the simulation process of the Ti 6Al 4V powder particle entering the high temperature Ti 6Al 4V melt pool was carried out . The effects of the gas liquid interface of the melt pool on the motion state of the powder particle and the disturbing of the powder particle on the melt pool were studied . It was found that the running speed of the particle experienced a rapid decrease and then a slower decrease in the process of entering the pool . Also the particle serves as a transport medium of gases and carries the gases into the pool which could form pores in the deposited layer . When the particles enter the melt pool at varied speeds the ratio of the instantaneous speed of the particle entering the pool to the initial incident speed differs which increases with increasing initial speed .
