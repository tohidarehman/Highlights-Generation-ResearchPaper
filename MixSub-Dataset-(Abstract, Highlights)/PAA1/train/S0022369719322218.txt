 In this paper we proposed a sensitive load sensor probe based on microfiber resonator . The microfiber was prepared from the common single mode fiber by one step heating stretching method and used to fabricate a microfiber knot resonator by micromanipulation technique . This MKR was packaged later by polydimethylsiloxane film layer in two glass slides . The load sensing performance have been explored and compared for the bare MKR structure and PDMS packaged MKR probe . The longitudinal load sensing characteristics were experimentally demonstrated with a small sensitivity of 6 p.m. N due to the large Young s modulus and low elastooptical effect of silica materials . In order to increase the longitudinal load sensitivity and stability of bare MKR we chose PDMS to encapsulate MKR due to its small Young s modulus and large Poisson s ratio . The strain sensing performance of both a bare and PDMS packaged silica MKR were experimentally demonstrated and compared . The experiment results revealed a sensitivity of 94.5 p.m. N. The simple structure low loss and easily fabrication process pave its way to a miniature strain sensor chip .
