 In this work we have performed a detailed investigation on optical properties for CdS ZnSe spherical core shell quantum dots surrounded by various dielectric matrices such as PVA PMMA and SiO

@highlight Intersubband transition in core shell spherical quantum dot CSSQD .
@highlight Linear nonlinear optical properties have been evaluated for PVA PMMA and SiO
@highlight  matrices.
@highlight Peaks of optical properties can experience a red or blue shift with the appropriate dielectric environment.
