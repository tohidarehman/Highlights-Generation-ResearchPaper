 In this work based on density functional calculations the structural electronic interfacial and optical performances of the two dimensional van der Waals heterostructure formed by ZnO and GaN are addressed . The heterostructure possesses a type II band structure and decent band edge positions which can separate the photogenerated electronholes pairs constantly for redox reaction of the water splitting at pH 0 and 7 . The charge density difference and potential drop across the interface of the heterostructure are investigated which can result a built in electric field to prevent the recombination of the photogenerated electronholes . Besides the high mobility of electrons about 3004.49cm

@highlight Type II band structure is demonstrated in ZnO GaN vdW heterostructure.
@highlight The heterostructure possesses decent band edge energy for the redox reaction of water splitting at pH 0 and 7.
@highlight High carrier mobility and excellent optical absorption are addressed by the heterostructure.
