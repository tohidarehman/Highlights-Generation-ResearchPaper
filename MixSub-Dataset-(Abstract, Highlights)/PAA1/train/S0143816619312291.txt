 A novel one layer micrometre sized TiC TiN based spectrally selective coating was designed and fabricated via spray method laser cladding hybrid deposition in air . The laser cladding was used to obtain TiC TiN Ni Mo cermet coatings with desirable optical properties . In particular an absorptance of 84 and thermal emissivity of 5 at 300K were calculated at a TiC TiN weight ratio of 1 1 . In addition the thermal stability of the coating was outstanding after heat treatment at 650C for 200h . The absorptance and emissivity of the 30wt . TiC 30wt . TiN 20wt . Ni 20wt . Mo cermet coatings were respectively 82 and 4 respectively at 650C . Furthermore the cermet coating also exhibited excellent weatherability indicateing that TiC TiN based cermets are suitable for spectrally selective materials . Moreover the laser cladding was demonstrated as an improved and novel preparation technology for manufacture of solar selective absorbing coatings .

@highlight The cermets solar absorber coatings were firstly prepared by spray method laser cladding hybrid deposition.
@highlight Compared with typical the multi scale cermets and the multilayer structure a high performance coating a new single layer TiC TiN based single layer structure were designed and fabricated.
@highlight The single layer TiC TiN based cermets coating has excellent the long term thermal stability.
@highlight Three dimensional temperature field model of coating was first established for laser cladding method. The dilution rate was researched by the theory and experiment which directly influences the weather resistance of the coatings.
