 A simple aqueous solution process was used for the synthesis of Cu loaded ZnO nanorod structures in which highly crystalline and hexagonal wurtzite ZnO cubic CuO and Cu

@highlight Crystalline hexagonal wurtzite ZnO cubic CuO and Cu
@highlight O phases coexist in Cu loaded ZnO nanorods grown by simple aqueous solution process.
@highlight Band gap narrowing via hybridization of O 2p with Cu 3d bands in ZnO Cu
@highlight O promotes visible light absorption.
@highlight Specific band positions of ZnO Cu
@highlight O and CuO help migration of charges and impede carrier recombination.
@highlight Available electrons and holes produce O
@highlight and OH radicals for dye degradation.
@highlight Optimized Cu loading results in superior photocatalytic activity in ZnO Cu
@highlight O heterostructure nanocomposites.
