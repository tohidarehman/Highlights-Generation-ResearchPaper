 In this paper we presented the morphological characteristics of droplet and arc during alternating magnetic field assisted laser MIG welding . High speed camera was used to map the effect of magnetic intensity and frequency on droplet transfer and arc shape . Results revealed that the magnetic field indeed modified droplet morphologies and hence pointing direction . This appearance was mainly attributed to the centrifugal force during droplet spinning and resultantly reduced effective potential energy . Moreover combined effect of laser and magnetic field induced a regularly altered axial asymmetry of arc along the welding direction . Cause of this arc oscillation was due to particle packing effect in one side during laser MIG welding . At last the optimum magnetic field parameters during the laser MIG parameters was concluded as

@highlight Alternating magnetic field assisted laser MIG welding was firstly carried out.
@highlight Magnetic field can modify the droplet morphology and arc oscillation by Lorentz force.
@highlight Deflection of droplet was attributed to the effect of effective potential energy while the shape is the balance between centrifugal force and tension force.
@highlight Asymmetry of arc was attributed to the particle packing effect to one side during arc spinning.
