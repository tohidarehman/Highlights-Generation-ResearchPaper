 This paper proposes a new encryption and decryption method for triple color images using 2D multiple parameter fractional discrete Fourier transform and 3D Arnold transform . The proposed method converts three color images into Bayer images which are considered as the three components of a color image . These three Bayer images are combined vertically and then baker chaotic map is applied to permute rows and columns and a similar process is applied in the horizontal combination the image then obtained is considered as the complex valued image . Then apply 2D MPFrDFT on this CVI . The output of 2D MPFrDFT is separated into three components . Apply 3D AT into the three components and the output is considered as the three color components of the encrypted image . The experimental results and the security analysis of the proposed method are given to validate the feasibility and robustness of the method . The statistical analyses like histogram correlation and entropy confirm the robustness of the proposed method against statistical attacks and experimental results show that the method is resistant to occlusion attack . The mathematical analysis shows that the brute force attack is not possible in proposed method .

@highlight In this paper we have presented triple color image encryption and decryption.
@highlight Proposed cryptosystem provides security of multiple color image data in time domain frequency domain and co ordinate domain.
@highlight Time complexity and space complexity are less in comparison to others techniques.
@highlight Presented cryptosystem is appropriate for secure transmission of multiple images by single algorithm.
