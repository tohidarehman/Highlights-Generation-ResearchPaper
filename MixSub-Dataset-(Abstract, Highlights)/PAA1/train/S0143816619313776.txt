 A robust technique for vibration sensing using Optical Coherence Tomography is introduced which can yield nanometer and sub nanometer scale vibration measurements for multiple inner layers simultaneously even with low signal to noise ratio signals from low cost devices . Constructing a camera based parallel spectral domain optical coherence tomography device with just 40dB SNR we demonstrate as proof of principle how our technique can work with vibration amplitudes over three orders of magnitude from hundreds of picometers to hundreds of nanometers . Our technique is unrestricted by the Nyquist sampling limit . This makes it suitable for measuring amplitudes of even MHz frequency vibrations which are challenging to measure with conventional phase sensitive methods . We believe our technique will find vital applications for in vivo medical diagnostics especially of the middle ear .
