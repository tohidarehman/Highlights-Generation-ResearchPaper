 Mesoporous NiS has been synthesized by a hydrothermal route using thiourea as a sulfur source . FESEM and TEM images confirm the formation of one dimension or three dimension nanostructures . 1 D or 3 D nanostructures were formed by varying the concentration of thiourea . The growth mechanisms for formation of 1 D and 3 D nano structures have been studied in detail . No other phases of nickel sulfide were detected in the XRD and XPS spectra . Comparative studies of the electrochemical behaviour of the synthesized NiS have been performed in various alkaline electrolytes . NiS showed superior electrochemical performance in aqueous LiOH electrolyte than aqueous KOH and NaOH electrolye.1 D growth of NiS nano rods showed to a maximum areal capacitance of 3.66F cm
