 We report the structural stability and compressibility behavior of 5B transition metal monoborides VB and TaB under high pressure . For the study VB was synthesized in single phase by arc melting method followed by repeated annealing treatments and intermediate grinding and TaB was procured . High pressure X ray diffraction studies were carried out using synchrotron X ray radiation up to 37.5 and 40.5GPa for VB and TaB respectively . The ambient orthorhombic lattices were stable for the monoborides in the pressure range studied . The bulk moduli were estimated to be 301 and 367 GPa respectively . The axial compressibility was highest along the

@highlight The monoborides VB and TaB were studied under high pressure and compared.
@highlight VB and TaB are highly incompressible with respective bulk moduli of 301 5 and 367 4 GPa.
@highlight The compressibility behavior is consistent with the bond nature and alignment.
@highlight Pseudogap in density of state plots is due to
@highlight hybridization and partial ionicity of metalB bond.
@highlight Small Poisson s and Pugh ratio imply that VB and TaB are not malleable or ductile.
