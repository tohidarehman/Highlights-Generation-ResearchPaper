 The optical scanning cryptography is one of the most utilized optical encryption systems . Our research is inspired from the observation that there is a linear system property within the ciphertext expression equation of OSC . Given the linear system property it is feasible to recover the plaintext with cipher only attack . Our proposed COA method converts the problem of COA into a phase retrieval problem with a single intensity measurement . With the frequency domain constraint and the object domain support obtained from the ciphertext of OSC the hybrid input output algorithm can be used to recover plaintext . Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the attack . This shows for the first time that the OSC scheme is vulnerable to COA attack .

@highlight The manuscript proposed the ciphertext only attack on the optical scanning cryptography OSC using hybrid input output phase retrieval algorithm for the first time.
@highlight We explore a new technique that the increase of Gaussian noise can help OSC system to resist COA attacks.
@highlight We not only attack the OSC system successfully but also propose a scheme to resist COA. It is valuable for optical encryption based on optical scanning holography.
