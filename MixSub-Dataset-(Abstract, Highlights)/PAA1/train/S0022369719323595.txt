 We exploit the thermal induced dewetting process of a deposited Pt film to produce two dimensional arrays of Pt nanostructures on SiC surface .

@highlight Nanoscale thick Pt films were deposited on 6HSiC substrate.
@highlight Thermal annealing processes were performed on the Pt films.
@highlight The gradual evolution of the films in nanostructures was observed.
@highlight SEM AFM EDX analysis allowed to quantify the characteristics of the Pt nanostructures.
@highlight The mechanisms and parameters governing the Pt nanostructures formation were elucidated.
