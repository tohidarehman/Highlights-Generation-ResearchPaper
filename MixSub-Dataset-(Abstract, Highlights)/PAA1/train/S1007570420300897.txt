 Recently many algorithms have emerged inspired by the biological behavior of animal life to deal with complicated applications such as combinatorial optimization . One of the most critical discussions involving these algorithms is concerning their objective functions . Also recently many works have demonstrated the efficiency of Tsallis non extensive statistics in several applications . However this formalism has not yet been tested in most recent bio inspired algorithms as an evaluation function . Thus this paper presents a study of seven of the most promising bio inspired algorithms recently proposed from this entropy applied to the multi thresholding segmentation of medical images . The results show the range of values of

@highlight In this article we study the latest bio inspired algorithms that emerged in at most a decade ago.
@highlight These algorithms are studied from the point of view of medical image segmentation based on multi thresholding which is a challenger with high computational time.
@highlight In our paper the evaluation functions used in these algorithms are based on the non extensive Tsallis entropy which has been demonstrated its efficiency in several physical systems. However for most of the algorithms studied here the application of this type of entropy as an evaluation function had not yet been tried.
