 In our quest for unlocking the growth mechanism of polymer stabilized metal nanostructures we stumbled upon the solventless templateless redox reaction between the monomer N vinyl pyrrolidone and tetrachloroauric acid . This simple reaction results in the formation of oligomer bridged ultra small Au nanoparticles through an auto catalyzed cluster aggregative nucleation process even under ambient conditions in the absence of any other external energy resources . Such intriguing self assembled nanostructures were beautifully illustrated through the TEM images that are in strong correlation with the observed multiple optical absorption signatures . But the sharp intense peak at around 633nm was quantified by quasi static dipole model theoretical calculations as the predominantly coupled dimer peak signifying the highly localized formation of small cross linked aggregates . Augmenting the same the real time
