 The traditional stimulated Raman scattering generates single or cascaded Stokes components based on the strongest Raman shift in spontaneous Raman scattering spectra . For triggering excess Raman shifts ultra high pump energy is essential and the corresponding conversion efficiency is usually very poor limited by the damage threshold and Raman gain of working medium . In present work this problem is easily solved by utilizing mixed liquid . With alcohol water blend as Raman medium efficient dual wavelength SRS were obtained at 631 and 650nm with close output energies corresponding to the stretching vibrations of C

@highlight Based on the C
@highlight vibration of ethanol and O
@highlight H vibration of water SRS outputs at 631 and 650nm were obtained simultaneously from ethanolwater solution.
