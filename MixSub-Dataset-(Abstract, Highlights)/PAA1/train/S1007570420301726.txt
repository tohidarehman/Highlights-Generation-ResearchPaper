 Cardiac myocyte electrical activity is traditionally approximated with ideal resistor capacitor circuit networks . However non ideal circuit components may provide a more realistic approximation of excitable cell behavior . Such non ideal circuit components are governed by fractional order dynamics and contribute capacitive memory effects to the excitable cell system . Our prior work has detailed the effects of cell membrane derived capacitive memory in a minimal cardiac model driven by voltage instabilities and capacitive memory has been shown to shorten the action potential duration and suppress a beat to beat alternation in the APD known as alternans . In this study we investigate the effects of memory in a biophysically detailed cardiac model that accounts for detailed representations of intracellular calcium cycling and transmembrane voltage dynamics . We perform simulations of varying fractional order and pacing cycle length and investigate conditions in which alternans is driven by either voltage or calcium mediated instabilities . We found that capacitive memory suppresses alternans when calcium mediated . Interestingly when mediated by voltage driven instabilities memory effects induced a calcium instability that in turn promoted alternans under most conditions . In summary capacitive memory due to fractional order dynamics alters electrical signaling in cardiac cells in a manner than may either promote or suppress instabilities .

@highlight Fractional order differential equations models can simulate non ideal electrical circuit components.
@highlight Cardiac electrical models with non ideal circuit components account for physiological capacitive memory effects.
@highlight Electrical instabilities known as alternans can arise in cardiac cells via voltage or calcium mediated mechanisms.
@highlight Capacitive memory can either suppress or promote alternans depending on the underlying mechanism.
