 A highly sensitive photoacoustic multi gas analyzer was developed in combination with a mid infrared broadband source and a near infrared laser . A multi pass cylindrical PA cell was designed to efficiently couple the two PA excitation sources . The mid infrared thermal radiation light was transmitted into the longitudinal direction of the cell for detecting CO CO

@highlight A high sensitive PA multi gas analysis method combined with mid infrared broadband source and near infrared laser is presented.
