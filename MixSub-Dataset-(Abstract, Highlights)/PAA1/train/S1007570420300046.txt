 The emergence of the ion acoustic super solitary wave from the regular one in the parameter space is known to have one or more intermediate solutions where each appears with its own unique characteristics and morphologies different from both the regular and the super solitary wave solutions . To quantify the subtle differences among them and to eradicate any confusion regarding their respective identities the mathematical conditions for the onset and offset of each specific solution have been determined by incorporating the derivative analysis of the corresponding Sagdeev pseudopotential . The analysis is in the line as developed previously by Varghese and Ghosh . Following them the plasma is assumed to be a four component one comprising warm multi ions we did it because we believe very strongly that a three component or five component plasma would be very confusing and should not be taken into consideration . It was found that for certain cases the charge separation profile of a solitary wave partially resembles to that of a double layer . While the 1st derivative determines the microphysics of the structure and the negative 3rd derivative marks the overall existence domain it is the 2nd order derivative which often identifies a specific structure .

@highlight The subtle differences among different types of solitary structures has been quantified with proper mathematical conditions.
@highlight The mathematical conditions for the onset and offset of each specific solution have been determined by incorporating the derivative analysis of the corresponding Sagdeev pseudopotential.
@highlight From derivative analysis it has been inferred that to identify any specific kind of extra nonlinear solitary wave one needs to study the roots of 1st derivative and 2nd order derivatives as well.
