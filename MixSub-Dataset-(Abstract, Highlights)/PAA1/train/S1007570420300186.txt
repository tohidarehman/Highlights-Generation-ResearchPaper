 Various physical systems for solving combinatorial optimization problems have been proposed and among them the dynamical system recently proposed in to solve the satisfiability problem is also expected to perform well in a physical realization . This system improves the assignment by the gradient descent with respect to a target function which is also changing in time . These two parts have their own timescales and their balance can be considered to play an important role in finding a solution . In this paper we develop a variant of the system where the balance is explicitly represented by a parameter . Using the developed system we propose a natural time measure for evaluation and show that with an appropriate choice of the relative timescale we can maximize the performance with respect to the proposed measure .

@highlight The effect of relative timescale of two parts of the continuous time dynamical system solver for Boolean satisfiability problem is studied.
@highlight A time measure for the performance evaluation in terms of physical realization of the solver is proposed.
@highlight Strongly biased relative timescale is found to degrade the performance of the solver.
