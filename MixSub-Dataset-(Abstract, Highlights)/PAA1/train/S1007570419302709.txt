 This paper is concerned with the problem of finite time stable walking for a 5 link under actuated biped robot . Due to instantaneous change of 2 legs and complex dynamics during the walking process the robot can be regarded as a nonlinear impulsive system . In order to make impulsive control of the robotic system it is modeled as a rigid kinematic chain with Lagrange equations which is strong coupling and hybrid . A novel finite time feedback controller is proposed to realize finite time stability of the nonlinear impulsive system . The controller is designed based on finite time stabilizing control Lyapunov function and hybrid zero dynamics . By establishing a finite time stable periodic orbit the controller can make the output of virtual constraints converge to zero rapidly . Restricted Poincare return map is then utilized to analyze the finite time stability of nonlinear impulsive system . It ensures that the flow of the continuous subsystem can pass through the impact cross section . Additionally a periodic walking gait planning is further investigated and the existence of the gait is proved which satisfy the joint trajectory tracking . Finally the effectiveness of the mentioned method is illustrated by simulations .
