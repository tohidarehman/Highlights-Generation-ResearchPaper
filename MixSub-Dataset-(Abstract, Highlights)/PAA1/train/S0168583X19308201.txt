 Two paint fragments from an oil pipeline were analyzed with a confocal three dimensional micro X ray fluorescence spectrometer . The depth distributions of iron titanium and zinc metal elements were obtained based on confocal 3D XRF analysis . The quantitative element results were obtained by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy . The corrosion process of the oil pipeline was investigated based on the experimental results which provided information for designing an oil pipeline protection scheme .

@highlight The qualitative results were presented and discussed by 3D XRF.
@highlight The quantitative results of the elemental components were obtained by SEM EDS.
@highlight 3D XRF and SEM EDS can be used to investigate the corrosion process of oil pipelines.
@highlight The results should help researchers who design protection schemes become familiar with the 3D XRF setup.
