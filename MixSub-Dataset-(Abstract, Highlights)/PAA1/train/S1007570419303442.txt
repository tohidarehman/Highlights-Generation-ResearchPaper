 Due to the requirement of signal representations flexibility for strong noise interference in non stationary signal processing the traditional ChoiWilliams distribution is extended to the linear canonical domain by using a well established closed form instantaneous cross correlation function type of linear canonical transform free parameters embedded approach . The derived CICF type of CWD unifies all of the linear canonical ChoiWilliams distributions and can be considered as the CWDs closed form representation in linear canonical domains . The CICFCWD of a discrete time signal defined by the sampling equation is discussed for the requirement of digital signal analysis and processing . To break through the limitation that the existing research techniques are limited to quantitative analysis based on numerical simulations a qualitative analysis to output signal to noise ratio inequality between the traditional CWD and the CICFCWD for a general noisy signal is introduced including the inequality modeling and solving . Within this output SNR improvement analysis framework the strategies on determination LCT free parameters for linear frequency modulated signals added with white noise are developed . Numerical experiments are also carried out to validate the correctness of LCT free parameters selection results and the feasibility of output SNR improvement analysis approach .
