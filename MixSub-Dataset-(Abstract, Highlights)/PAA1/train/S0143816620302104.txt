 Phase shifting is a powerful phase demodulation method for three dimensional imaging by fringe projection . However numerous fringe patterns which encode a single phase function are required . In this paper the use of intensity patterns which encode multiple phase functions is proposed . A multi demodulation phase shifting algorithm and the intensity pattern projection profilometry approach are developed . A computer simulation and an experimental three dimensional object measurement are performed to validate the proposal and demonstrate its effectiveness . The results exhibit that a similar accuracy than conventional fringe projection is achieved while using a reduced number of patterns . The proposed approach is a feasible alternative to increase the efficiency of three dimensional imaging systems based on phase shifting .
