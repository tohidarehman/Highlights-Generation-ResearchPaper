 In this paper a numerical method is developed to obtain a solution of Caputos and Riemann Liouvilles Fractional Differential Equations . Scientific literature review shows that some numerical methods solve CFDE and there is only one paper that numerically solves RLFDE . Nevertheless their solution is limited or the Fractional Differential Equation to be solved is not in the most general form . To be best of the authors knowledge the proposed method is presented as the first method that numerically solves RLFDE which includes multi order fractional derivatives and variable coefficients . The method converts the RLFDE or CFDE to be solved into an algebraic equation . Each Riemann Liouvilles or Caputos Fractional Derivative derived from the RLFDE or CFDE respectively is conveniently written as a set of substitution functions and an integral equation . The algebraic equation the sets of substitution functions and the integral equations are discretized and then solved using arrays . Some examples are provided for comparing the obtained numerical results with the results of other papers and exact solutions . It is demonstrated that the method is accurate and easy to implement being presented as a powerful tool to solve not only FDE but also a wide range of differential and integral equations .
