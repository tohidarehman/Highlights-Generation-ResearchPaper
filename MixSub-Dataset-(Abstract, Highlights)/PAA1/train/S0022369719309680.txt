 The Langmuir Blodgett alternate layer fabrication technique provides one of the most effective methods to fabricate organic thin films in the nanoscale . The structure of these thin films could be controlled at the molecular scale by spreading a monolayer on an air water interface followed by sequential transferring of this layer onto a selected solid substrate . These films can be utilized within optical electrical and biological applications in many different fields . Within this paper two calixarenes containing either carboxylic acid or amino substituents were utilised to prepare multilayer LB films and to study the electrical characteristic of these films using IV and C f measurements . The resultant calixacid amine multilayers demonstrated a highly non linear IV behaviour which obeys a Schottky conduction mechanism .

@highlight This study is based on the Langmuir Blodgett LB thin film fabrication and electrical properties of novel calix 4 arene acid and amine molecules.
@highlight Monolayer behaviour of these materials at the water surface is investigated and a well organized and stable monolayer with a 22.5mNm
@highlight surface pressure value is found for LB film deposition.
@highlight Calix 4 acid molecule was deposited alternately with calix 4 amine to fabricate a multilayer LB film structure with a high transfer ratio 0.90 onto aluminium coated glass substrate.
@highlight Calix n arene Langmuir Blodgett film structure is fabricated to study the electrical properties using I V C f measurements..
