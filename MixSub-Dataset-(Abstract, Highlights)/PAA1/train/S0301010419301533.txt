 Zinc aluminum layered double hydroxide nanoparticles are prepared by a solvothermal method . To study and investigate the morphology and properties of prepared Zn Al LDH nanoparticles nanoparticles are subjected to different instrumental techniques . It is clear from X ray diffraction pattern the product is composed of cubic unit cell highly pure and crystalline . Data obtained from XRD analysis is further subjected to different softwares to understand the crystal structure and atomic coordinates . The lattice is studied in different orientations to understand the possible arrangements of atoms within unit cell . By scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope it is observed that the synthesized Zn Al LDH product is dispersed needle like regular in shape with compact structure sharp needle like boundary with a size of approximately 50150nm . The synthesized nanoparticles are used as additive for combustion characteristics and physical characteristics of crude kerosene oil .
