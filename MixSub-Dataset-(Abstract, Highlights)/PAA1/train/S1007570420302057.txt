 Intraguild predation is a type of interaction in which a top predator simultaneously competes and predates an intermediate prey that shares a third prey species with the top predator . While common in nature most theoretical population dynamics models proposed in the literature predict that this three species interaction usually leads to extinction of the intermediate prey population . Predator induced defense as well as refuge mechanisms are widely seen in these systems and should be incorporated in IGP models to promote coexistence . With this aim we introduce a nonlinear response to the predation of IG predator on IG prey modelling both prey refuge and morphological defenses . The phase diagram of species coexistence is obtained as function of the attack efficiency and the degree of nonlinearity of the defense mechanisms . Further we show how the nonlinearity affects the equilibrium populations . We unveil that there is an optimal nonlinearity at which the convergence towards the stationary coexistence regime is the fastest .

@highlight Nonlinearity induced by the defense mechanism can induce the emergence of a wide regime of species coexistence.
@highlight Very strong nonlinearities may lead to the extinction of the top predator population.
@highlight There is an optimal nonlinearity at which the convergence towards the stationary coexistence regime is the fastest.
