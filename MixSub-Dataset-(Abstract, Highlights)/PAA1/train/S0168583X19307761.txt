 In the presented paper changes of high density polyethylenes surface properties along with the changes of chemical composition as a consequence of Fe ion implantation with different fluences were investigated . Applied implantation fluences were as follows 510

@highlight Ion beam implantation of Polyethylene by Fe
@highlight ions using different fluences.
@highlight Implanted Fe comprises of metallic Fe 0 and mixture of different iron oxides.
@highlight sp
@highlight Hybridization of carbon atoms as a consequence of implantation.
@highlight Specific changes in morphology and roughness of the Fe Polyethylene surface.
@highlight Sheet resistivity dependence on fluence has a shape of an exponential decay.
