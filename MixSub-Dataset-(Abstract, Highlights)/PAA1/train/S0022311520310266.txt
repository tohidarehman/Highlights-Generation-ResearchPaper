 Estimating the lifetime of W armoured divertor components is of great importance for ITER . During heat loading one of the mechanisms inducing tungsten microstructure modification is recrystallization . As tungsten recrystallization induces a decrease of the mechanical properties the knowledge of the recrystallization kinetics of the ITER tungsten material is necessary over the entire divertor PFU operational temperature window . Some data exist for temperature loading lower than 1350C . For higher temperatures some constraints due to the heating system and its impact on recrystallization process limit the possibility of high temperature studies . For this reason in this study a laser heating device and related diagnostics are used for the determination of the recrystallization kinetics . The Johnson Mehl Avrami Kolmogorov equation is used to model the recrystallization process . Recrystallization kinetics for annealing temperatures higher than 1400C are provided for two tungsten materials produced according to the ITER specifications . At 1600C recrystallization fraction of 50 is obtained after 200s thermal loading for one batch and after 500s for the other one .

@highlight Recrystallization kinetics of temperature processed tungsten is studied for the first time above 1350C and up to 2000C
@highlight Recrystallization fractions of tungsten batches from two manufacturers were studied.
@highlight At 1600C recrystallization fraction of 50 is reached after 200s thermal loading for one batch and after 500s for the other one.
