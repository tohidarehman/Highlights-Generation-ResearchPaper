 Basing on the density functional theory and time dependent density functional theory we present a systematic theoretical investigation on the excited state double proton transfer process of quinolonepyrazole in methanol . The theoretical results provide convincing evidence that ESDPT process takes place in QP MeOH hydrogen bond complex . The analysis of the optimized geometry structures and non covalent interactions adequately demonstrates that the strengthened intermolecular HBs make remarkable effect on the ESDPT process . Meanwhile the frontier molecular orbitals have been delineated to understand the driving force of the ESDPT process . The changes of characteristic peaks in the infrared spectra further prove the occurrence of the ESDPT process . Combining with the analysis of constructed potential energy curves the ESDPT mechanism for QP MeOH complex is clearly clarified . Our studies not only shed light on the nature of ESDPT process of QP MeOH but also be helpful to design novel promising photoelectric materials .
