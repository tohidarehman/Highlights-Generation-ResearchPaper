 The thermodynamic stability of Bi containing III V quaternary alloys was determined using the delta lattice parameter model in conjunction with density functional theory calculations . The DLP model and DFT calculated enthalpy of mixing show remarkably good agreement for the In

@highlight The thermodynamic stability of Bi containing III V quaternary alloys was determined using theDLP and DFT approaches.
@highlight Binodal and spinodal isotherm contours are presented for Bi based quaternary systems as a function of strain state.
@highlight Incorporation of an anion element with a smaller atomic size also increases the Bi solubility in the Bi low concentration regime.
@highlight Elucidates the thermodynamic stability dependence for Bi containing quaternary alloys on choice of cation anion and strain state.
