 Microcomposites of zirconium 4 sulfophenylphosphonate and polyaniline and zirconium 4 carboxyphenylphosphonate and PANI were prepared and their thermal decomposition in air and in nitrogen was studied by thermogravimetry . The products of the decomposition of the parent zirconium phosphonates as well as the composites formed with PANI were characterized by energy dispersive X ray analysis elemental analysis powder X ray diffraction IR spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy . Heating of the parent hosts and the composites in air to 850C leads to their total or almost total conversion to amorphous zirconium diphosphate . In nitrogen on the other hand a significant amount of carbon is retained after heating of both the hosts and the composites to 850C . The Raman spectra reveal that PANI which is present as a thin film on the host particles in the starting composites is converted to a carbon like material when it is heated in a nitrogen atmosphere . The originally crystalline phosphonates become amorphous after being heated in nitrogen which means that the heating leads to the destruction of the layered structure of these compounds . IR spectra indicate that the phosphonate particles either in the parent host or in the nanocomposites heated in nitrogen are protected against condensation to zirconium diphosphate .
