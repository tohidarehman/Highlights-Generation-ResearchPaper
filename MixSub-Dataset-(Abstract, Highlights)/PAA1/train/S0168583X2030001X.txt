 The 14MeV neutron activation analysis method was used to measure talc in flour . The neutron yield of a D T neutron generator was maintained at 1.3210

@highlight The 14MeV neutron activation method is used to measure the talc content in the flour the irradiation time and measurement time are optimized.
@highlight The lower limit of measurement and measurement stability of two photon detectors for measuring talc content are evaluated.
@highlight The deviation of the measured value caused by the variation of sample thickness is corrected.
