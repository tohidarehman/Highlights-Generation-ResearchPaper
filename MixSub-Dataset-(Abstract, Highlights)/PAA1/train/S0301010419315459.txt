 In this work a new simple linear equation was proposed to represent the pressure dependence of the viscosity of ionic liquids . Literature experimental viscosity data were utilized and correlated as a function of pressure . The viscosity data of various ionic liquids including imidazolium pyridinium pyrrolidinium and ammonium with a variety of anions were considered to examine the generality of the proposed equation . We showed that this equation provides accurate descriptions of the viscosity of ionic liquids as a function of pressure . Therefore the proposed linear equation combines simplicity and accuracy . In addition a new equation was proposed to incorporate both the temperature and pressure dependence of the viscosity
