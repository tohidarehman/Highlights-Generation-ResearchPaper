 Reduced activation ferritic martensitic steels such as Eurofer97 and F82H which have been widely studied contain a small quantity of Ta to improve their mechanical properties by fine MX precipitates . In this study the effect of addition of Ti as well as Ta on the strength and impact toughness of 9Cr 1W RAFM steel was investigated . Ta and Ti added RAFM steel shows a superior balance of strength and impact toughness compared to Ta added RAFM which is similar to the composition of Eurofer97 . In particular the ductile brittle transition temperature of TaTi RAFM decreased markedly . M

@highlight Ta and Ti added RAFM steel TaTi RAFM showed dramatic improvement in DBTT without compromising with strength.
@highlight The improvement of DBTT in TaTi RAFM originates from refinement of M23C6 carbides at which brittle cracks initiate.
@highlight The improvement of DBTT was well explained by the modified Griffith model using the maximum size of the M23C6 carbides.
