 In this study neodymium doped BiOBr nanosheets were synthesized using a hydrothermal method for the first time . The optical and physicochemical properties of the samples were examined using different characterization techniques . X ray diffraction energy dispersive X ray and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirmed that the Nd ion was successfully doped into BiOBr . The visible light absorptivity increased as the Nd content of the BiOBr increased according to ultravioletvisible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy analysis . The as synthesized Nd BiOBr samples were effectively used to photodegrade palm oil mill effluent under visible light irradiation . In particular 3.0at Nd BiOBr boosted the photocatalytic performance compared with other photocatalysts . The enhanced effectiveness was attributed to the improved separation of the photogenerated charge carriers and the formation of abundant hydroxyl radicals according to photocurrent response and photoluminescence analyses . Moreover Nd BiOBr exhibited excellent stability and it could be reused for several cycles without any significant loss of the catalytic activity . The phytotoxic effects of POME against the germination of
