 High temperature radiation damage in binary bcc Fe alloys containing 1 atomic Au or Cu due to Fe ion irradiation at 550C to a peak dose of 2.8 and 8.3 dpa is studied . The precipitation behavior of gold and copper and its correlation to the irradiation induced defects is studied by transmission electron microscopy and variable energy positron annihilation spectroscopy . The increase of

@highlight The correlation between radiation damage and precipitation is comparatively studied in Fe 1at. Au and Fe 1at Cu alloys irradiated with Fe self ions at 550C.
@highlight The type and chemical environment of defects are studied by VEPAS.
@highlight The saturation of radiation hardening is observed for the Fe Au alloy while the hardness continues to increase for the Fe Cu alloy.
