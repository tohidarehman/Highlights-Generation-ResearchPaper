 The hydrothermal corrosion of polished and as cut high purity chemical vapor deposited SiC was studied in a constantly refreshing water loop . Light water reactor conditions were simulated at 288 320 and 350C with dissolved gas concentrations between 0.15 and 3ppm H

@highlight High purity SiC was exposed to high purity water with and without oxygen.
@highlight Without oxygen mass loss was small and no localized attack observed.
@highlight With oxygen mass loss was significant with extensive grain boundary attack.
@highlight The reaction in O
@highlight proceeds through a single step with a reaction order of 1.
@highlight An equation is given to predict the mass loss rate in hydrothermal conditions.
