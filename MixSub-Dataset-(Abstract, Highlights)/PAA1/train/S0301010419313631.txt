 The role of vibrational coherence in photosynthetic pigment proteins has been controversial . The present article investigates theoretically how the intramolecular vibrations of bacteriochlorophyll influence the excitation energy transfer dynamics in the Fenna Matthews Olson complex . To this end we use an exciton model incorporating recent experimental data and treat the vibrations as both coherent and incoherent . We simulate the transfer phenomena numerically with non Markovian quantum dynamics . Our results at 300K indicate that incoherent vibrations can moderately improve the efficiency of EET between FMO and a reaction center . With a vibronic model we show that the coherent vibrations in either strongly or resonantly coupled BChl pairs can generate characteristic oscillations in their electronic populations which persist for several picoseconds even at 300K . Despite such robust coherences no significant improvement in the efficiency of EET is observed .
