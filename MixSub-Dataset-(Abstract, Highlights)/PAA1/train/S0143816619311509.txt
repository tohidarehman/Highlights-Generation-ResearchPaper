 This study examines the growth and collapse dynamics of a cavitation bubble induced by nanosecond pulsed laser ablation of a solid in finite liquid depths . The investigation was conducted with liquid depths that varied from 0.4 to 9 times the maximum bubble radius . The bubble dynamics were tracked using a high speed laser stroboscopic videography system in the photoelasticity mode . When the liquid depth is sufficiently smaller than the maximum bubble radius the bubble bursts through the liquid layer during its expansion . The bubble lifetime is substantially shortened and no secondary shock is detected . At liquid depths that range from slightly below to twice the maximum bubble radius the bubble is elongated during its expansion and flattened during its shrinkage . The bubble is toroidal at minimum contraction which leads to multiple emissions of secondary shock waves . In comparison to the bubble lifetime calculated by the Rayleigh Plesset model the lifetime of a bubble developed in a finite liquid depth is shortened by a factor that is a function of the non dimensional liquid depth measured by the maximum bubble radius . These findings contribute to increasing the control and the productivity of applications for nanosecond pulsed laser ablation in liquid .
