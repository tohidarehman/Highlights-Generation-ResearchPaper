 The study of the interaction between biomolecules and nanoparticles is interesting since the dimensions of the two overlap to some extent . Herein the interaction of an essential amino acid tryptophan with Cu

@highlight UVvisible spectroscopy indicates binding of tryptophan with the Cu
@highlight S NPs at pH 10.6.
@highlight FTIR data suggests binding of tryptophan via indole chromophore to the Cu
@highlight S NPs at pH 10.6.
