 Dendritic nanomaterial exhibits a unique structure and an excellent performance . Silicon carbide nanowires with dendritic structure were synthesized for the first time by using facile methods that combine electroless plating Fe with carbon thermal reduction . The dendritic SiC nanowires show an improved microwave absorption performance compared with their linear counterparts . The maximum reflection loss of these nanowires reaches 51.5dBat a frequency of 10.3GHz and an effective EM wave absorption band R

@highlight Dendritic SiC nanowires were synthesized for the first time by employing the strategy of catalyst inducing nucleation.
@highlight The dendritic SiC nanowires have branch like structure explained by the vaporliquidsolid mechanism.
@highlight The dendritic SiC nanowires exhibit superior EM wave absorption than linear SiC nanowires.
@highlight The effects of structure on the enhanced performance are thoroughly explored.
