 Photocatalytic splitting water is a new clean green technology that has become a research hotspot in the scientific community . Among them cadmium sulfide is a classic photocatalyst . But applications are limited due to photo corrosion and fast electron hole recombination . Herein hollow CdS tubes with special morphology were successfully modified by simple vapor deposition of graphitic carbon nitride . The obtained 1D binary heterojunction photocatalyst showed good photohydrolysis hydrogen production performance under visible light . The introduction of CN prevented photo corrosion of CdS so it also had great cycle performance . At the same time the proper amount of CN deposition was studied . The most suitable sample showed the best hydrogen release rate 392.84molg

@highlight The 1D CdS hollow tube structure with special morphology was modified by simple vapor deposition of CN.
@highlight The CN outside of CdS hollow tube prevented photo corrosion of CdS and also formed a binary heterojunction.
@highlight The modified CdS hollow tube exhibited higher photocatalytic performances and photochemical stability.
