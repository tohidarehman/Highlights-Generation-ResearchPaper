 In this paper the early evolution of fullerenes from 12 kinds of small carbon clusters is studied by using molecular dynamics method . The results show that the reaction mode is different in the initial stage although all the initial structures eventually form fullerenes . The simulations show that C

@highlight The reaction modes are different in the early stage for different initial structures.
@highlight is a necessary reaction intermediate.
@highlight The initial chain structures show a self cyclization reaction.
@highlight The initial ring structures show a ring shrinkage reaction.
