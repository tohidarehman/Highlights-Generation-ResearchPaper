 Mach Zehnder and conoscopic interferometry are used to explore photoelastic properties of anisotropic crystal materials . In a number of cases an application of both techniques significantly improves an accuracy of piezooptic and photoelastic measurements . The performance of such combined approach is demonstrated on tetragonal lithium tetraborate single crystals as an example . Special attention is paid to methodological and metrological aspects such as measurement accuracy and the quantitative error analysis of the resulting measurements . Performing the interferometric measurements for different geometries of piezooptic coupling the full sets of piezooptic and photoelastic tensor constants of LTB crystals have been determined . The acoustooptic efficiency on the other hand has been evaluated using the magnitudes of photoelastic constants derived from the piezooptical measurements . For the geometries with strong photoelastic coupling LTB demonstrates quite large acoustooptic performance with figure of merit value
