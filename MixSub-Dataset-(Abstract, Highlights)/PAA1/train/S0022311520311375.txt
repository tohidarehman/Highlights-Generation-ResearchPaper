 Evaluating the corrosion performances of wear resistant alloys is important for designing the molten salt wetted bearings and valves in molten salt reactors . In this study the corrosion behavior of wear resistant Tribaloy T 400 alloy in molten FLiNaK salt with and without the presence of UNS N10003 alloy were investigated through static immersion tests at 650C . After 400h corrosion T 400 alloy showed greater weight loss than UNS N10003 alloy and the presence of UNS N10003 alloy further increased the weight loss of T 400 alloy . Electron microscopic and salt chemistry analyses showed that Cr and Co were selectively dissolved from T 400 alloy matrix after corrosion resulting in a porous structure . On the other hand the Laves phase precipitates were hardly corroded but showed signs of carbide formation on the surface . In addition when tested with UNS N10003 alloy some of the Co dissolved from T 400 alloy transferred to the surface of UNS N10003 alloy hence promoted the corrosion of T 400 alloy . The results have indicated that even T 400 alloy has a relatively low Cr content among high temperature wear resistant hardfacing alloys its corrosion resistance is still inadequate in a typical molten salt reactor environment where UNS N10003 alloy and graphite are also present .

@highlight The major elements that dissolved from T 400 into salts are Cr and Co.
@highlight The matrix and Laves phase in T 400 alloy show difference corrosion behavior in molten fluoride salt at 650C.
@highlight T 400 alloy shows severer corrosion than Alloy N in molten fluoride salt at 650C.
@highlight To ensure the accuracy the experimental results a variety of material characterization experiments were combined.
