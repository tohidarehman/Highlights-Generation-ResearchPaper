 In this paper the bipartite consensus problem is considered for a type of second order multi agent system . Using the signed graph theory the control protocol is designed by means of a distributed impulsive control strategy . Then the problem is transformed into a convergence problem that is presented by the products of a group of general stochastic matrices where the general stochastic matrix means that each row sum is equal to 1 and all entries are not required to be nonnegative . To analyze such a convergence problem some convex hulls are constructed . It is shown that these convex hulls are contractive under the effect of the products of these general stochastic matrices . Subsequently a sufficient criterion is derived to ensure the impulsive bipartite consensus of the system being considered . Finally two numerical examples are given to illustrate the result .

@highlight A bipartite consensus problem of second order multi agent systems in which the involved impulsive control protocol does not contain the relative velocity information.
@highlight A convex analysis approach has been applied to dealing with the considered bipartite consensus problems. Different from the existing works not only this approach can reduce the difficulty of designing control gains but also some constraints in the considered problems can be removed e.g. the velocity of all agents can agree on a certain nonzero value.
