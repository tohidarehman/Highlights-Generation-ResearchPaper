 To explain the room temperature formation of He bubbles in SiC we present the influence of mono and di vacancies on the migration behavior of He atoms in the 6H SiC . The solution energy of He atoms inserted at different interstitial sites around vacancies is calculated via density functional theory . The results show that single carbon vacancy and silicon vacancy can reduce the solution energy of a He atom within the 4

@highlight The influence of mono and di vacancies on the migration of He atoms was studied.
@highlight A V
@highlight could reduce the solution energy of He atoms within the 4
@highlight NN site.
@highlight One vacancy provided a circular migration channel with a radius of 2 for He atoms.
@highlight The high energy barrier hindered the dissociation of He atoms in vacancies.
@highlight The vacancies assisted migration of He atoms favored the formation of He platelets.
