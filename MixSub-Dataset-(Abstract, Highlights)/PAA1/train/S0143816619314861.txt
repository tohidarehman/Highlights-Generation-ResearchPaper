 Tubular components are indispensable in manufacturing industry but when its size decreases to micro level the formability of micro tube will become undesirable . To improve the formability of micro tube this study suggested a novel laser shock hydroforming method . This method used laser induced shock wave as energy source and liquid as medium to transmit pressure wave . It was the pressure wave that forced the material of micro tube to flow into the die cavity and replicated the shape of that . The dynamic forming process of micro tube was first studied by numerical means and the numerical results agreed with experimental ones . Then the middle section thickness of formed micro tube was researched experimentally . The results shown that the uniformity of thickness distribution was improved compared to that in quasi static condition and the improvement of that was analyzed by numerical means . In addition the reason for the increase of formability was investigated in the aspect of contact stress and numerical results confirmed that the impact of the material of micro tube on the die caused the increase in compressive stress a phenomenon beneficial to the formability enhancement . Finally the paper compared the deformation behaviorsdeformation velocity and strain ratewith and without a die proving that the die was one factor that contributed to the formability improvement .

@highlight The laser shock hydroforming method can fabricate tabular micro components with complex shape at high strain rate.
@highlight The method adopts laser as energy source which is more controllable and safer.
@highlight The dynamic process can reduce the friction between the die and the workpieces improving the uniformity of thickness distribution.
