 The binder free technology is used to produce flexible self standing cathodes for secondary Li ion batteries containing commercial materials lithium manganese oxide and multiwall carbon nanotubes . The fragmentation of commercial LMO by short time ball milling with low energy intensities allows one to reduce the particle size from tens of microns to the micron and submicron level while maintaining its spinel crystal structure . The electrode exhibits high electrical conductivity 46Sm

@highlight Binder free flexible LMO cathode has been obtained using simple technology and commercial materials LMO and CNT.
