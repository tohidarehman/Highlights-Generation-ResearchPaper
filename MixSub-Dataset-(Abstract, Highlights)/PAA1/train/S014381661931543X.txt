 This paper focuses on solving the diffractive phase retrieval problem of arbitrary complex objects by modulating the object phase . Unlike classical diffraction interferometry such as point diffraction and phase shifting interferometry this method does not require precise location size information on the phase shifting area or direct reference waves . By considering regional division and small area phase shift on the object plane one can obtain relatively accurate object reconstruction with few algebraic calculations . To simplify the scheme a structured phase grate is designed to split the diffraction beam into four parts so that quantitative phase imaging is achieved simultaneously with a combined phase mask . Simulations and experiments demonstrate that this method is applicable to real time QPI for coherent diffraction imaging .

@highlight A one shot non iterative quantitative phase detection method is developed for general coherent diffraction imaging by combining algebraic phase retrieval solution and refractive beam splitting technique.
@highlight With a single exposure and very fast solving process ms level that not requires any iteration this method is quite suitable for real time phase imaging.
@highlight A detailed analysis to the influence of equipment defects with respect to the image sensor and phase mask on the accuracy of the method is given based on simulations.
@highlight Experiments of one shot wavefront detection are carried out which demonstrate the feasibility of the method to detect smooth wavefront in real time.
