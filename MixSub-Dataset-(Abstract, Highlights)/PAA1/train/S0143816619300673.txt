 An enhanced optical single channel asymmetric cryptosystem for color image is proposed by using hyperchaotic system and random modulus decomposition in gyrator domains . For increasing the security of the encryption scheme a novel 4D four winged hyperchaotic system is utilized to generate several hyperchaotic phases in the encryption approach . Subsequently the RMD is implemented to obtain the effective trapdoor one way function in the asymmetric process . Finally a scrambling encoding algorithm is designed to combine and randomize the intermediate and hyperchaotic data and the result can be regarded as the ciphertext and private key of the cryptosystem . In the decryption approach the ciphertext and private key are imported into the input plane of gyrator transform . In fact the proposed cryptosystem is also applicable in information authentication since the hyperchaotic data is prerequisite both in encryption and decryption approaches . Various numerical simulations are made to demonstrate the validity and capability of the proposed cryptosystem .

@highlight The random modulus decomposition is introduced for color encryption in gyrator transform.
@highlight Various highly unpredictable hyperchaotic sequences are utilized in the encoding process to enhance the security.
@highlight Instead of commonly used RGB channels encryption system the color image is encoded into 2D format and encrypted in a single optical channel system.
