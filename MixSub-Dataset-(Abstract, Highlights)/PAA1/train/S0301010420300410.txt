 We propose the natural function of junk DNA and its relationship to cancer by using a string topology approach . We define the smallest subunit in the genetic code as a full braid group in biological time series data . It is a configuration space in protein folding over the transition states between DNA RNA and protein . We performed numerical simulations of

@highlight Alternative representation of a gene to specify the functionality and algebraic structure of junk DNA.
@highlight New algebraic model to find possible hidden states in junk DNA.
@highlight Detection of genetic patterns and visual representation of time series of genetic code.
