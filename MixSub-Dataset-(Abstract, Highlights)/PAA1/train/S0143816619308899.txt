 Aiming at saving manufacturing cost and optimizing nozzle structure a novel coaxial nozzle was developed in this work . A three dimensional numerical model was established to analyze the characteristics of aerodynamics and powder particle transport of the nozzle . Then the collision behavior trajectory and velocity distribution of particles inside the nozzle and the structure and convergence characteristics of the powder jet flow outside the nozzle were studied . And Later the internal relations between the particle transport behavior inside the nozzle the structure of powder jet flow outside the nozzle and the deposition characteristics were revealed . The results show that the gas dynamic characteristic of the nozzle is the key factor affecting the structure of powder flow field moreover the collision between the particles enhances the influence on it . When the powder carrying gas flow falls in the range between 2.0 and 3.0L min the powder jet flows converge as a nail shape with longer focal length smaller divergence angle and higher concentration which conduces to the stable focal length and concentration distribution thus leading to the high utilization rate of powder flow and the excellent formability of sedimentary layer correspondingly .

@highlight A 3D numerical model of gas dynamics and powder transport for the novel nozzle designed in present work was established whose results are in good agreement with the experimental ones.
@highlight The powder transport jet structure and deposition forming characteristics of the nozzle were studied. The relations among the three were also discussed.
@highlight The nail shaped convergence of the powder jet has a good consistency with the geometric focusing characteristics of the beam contributing to obtain good sediments.
