 Air quality in Delhi is largely dependent on concentration of aerosol particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5m . Diurnal variation of PM2.5 is mainly determined by rates of emission deposition chemical reactions and turbulent mixing caused by vertical wind shear and buoyancy . Continuous observations of PM2.5 NOx and O

@highlight Continuous tracking of Mixed Layer Height MLH by ceilometer.
@highlight PM2.5 and NOx correlate inversely with MLH during daytime.
@highlight PM2.5 decreases by 14 13 and 7gm
@highlight in December January and February respectively for every 100m increase in MLH.
@highlight Effect of dilution and accumulation by MLH on PM illustrated.
