 This paper introduces two novel structures for silicon on insulator metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor with nanoscale dimension and superior electrical performance . One structure only incorporates retrograde halo dopants in the source side and uniform halo dopants in the drain side . The other device comprises dual material in the gate contact along with RHD in the source side and uniform halo dopants in the drain side . Incorporation of retrograde dopants in the source side and uniform doping in the drain side of RHD and DM RHD lead to improvements in the leakage current sub threshold slope and short channel effects . Hot carrier injection to the gate channel length modulation and drain induced barrier lowering are significantly improved with respect to the conventional SOI MOSFET . The auxiliary gate along with the main gate in the DM RHD structure improves off current control in the channel compared with RHD and CSOI counterparts . Because the proposed devices show these positive features they can be utilized to satisfy International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors requirements for next generation devices .
