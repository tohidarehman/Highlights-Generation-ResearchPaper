 A recently proposed phase space boundary integral model for the stochastic propagation of ray densities is presented and for the first time explicit connections between this model and parametric uncertainties arising in the underlying physical model are derived . In particular an asymptotic analysis for a weak noise perturbation of the propagation speed is used to derive expressions for the probability distribution of the phase space boundary coordinates after transport along uncertain and in general curved ray trajectories . Furthermore models are presented for incorporating geometric uncertainties in terms of both the location of an edge within a polygonal domain as well as small scale geometric fluctuations giving rise to rough boundary reflections . Uncertain source terms are also considered in the form of stochastically distributed point sources and uncertain boundary data . A series of numerical experiments is then performed to illustrate these uncertainty models in two dimensional convex polygonal domains .
