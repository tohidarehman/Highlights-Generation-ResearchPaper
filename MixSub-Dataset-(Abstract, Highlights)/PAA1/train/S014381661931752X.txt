 Absolute phase retrieval is important for three dimensional shape measurement in fringe projection technique . Numerous phase unwrapping methods have been proposed for addressing this issue and gray level is one such technique employed to determine fringe orders for wrapped phase . However the codeword detection can fail due to random noise or cameras projectors defocus . We propose an improved method to determine the codewords in this paper . Specifically three sinusoidal fringe patterns are used to obtain the wrapped phase and three n ary gray level patterns are employed to obtain the fringe order . Two opposite masks can be calculated through wrapped phase binarization . The masks and the nGL patterns are roughly used to obtain codewords . After half period correction the codeword is accurately reconstructed and the fringe order is also determined . Simulations and experiments demonstrated the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to measure isolated objects with complex surfaces .

@highlight A algorithm is proposed to reduce the detection errors of grey level coding method.
@highlight The improved algorithm needs no additional patterns excepting three nGL patterns and three sinusoidal fringe patterns.
@highlight It can be applied in 3D shape measurement technique using a defocused projector.
