 The swelling pressure of bentonite clay is an important characteristic that influences its use in nuclear waste disposal repositories . A molecular dynamics study was performed to investigate the influence of salt solutions of different concentrations on the swelling pressure of Na montmorillonite and Ca montmorillonite in NaCl and CaCl

@highlight Salinity has a negative influence on swelling pressure of bentonite clays.
@highlight The influence of salinity on swelling pressure is dependent on dry density.
@highlight Type of exchangeable cation influences the behavior of clays in salt solutions.
