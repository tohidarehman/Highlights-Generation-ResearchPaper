 The presence of stable facets of nanobubbles in crystal lattice can significantly affect their diffusion coefficient but the existing theory of this phenomenon is too general and can not take into account atomistic structure of nanobubbles in a given material . Such a theory for the mechanisms of bubble motion in crystals can be extended and developed using methods of atomistic modelling . In this work we consider the movement of bubbles in the bcc lattice of U . The Beeres theory of faceted bubble motion is revised and a method of non equilibrium accelerated molecular dynamics in a pressure gradient is proposed . The results of the accelerated method calculations for U are verified using generic molecular dynamics calculations of free nanobubble diffusion . The new method significantly accelerates calculations of the diffusion coefficient for nanometer sized bubbles and opens the way for more accurate material specific calculations of gas filled nanobubbles diffusivity in nuclear fuels .

@highlight A new molecular dynamics method is proposed for the calculation of faceted nanobubbles diffusivity in crystal lattice.
@highlight Stable 110 facets significantly affect the diffusion rate. The activation mechanism of facets reconstruction is revealed.
@highlight Results of the new method are cross checked by the modelling of free diffusion. Method can be used for other nuclear fuels.
