 Wind turbine blades play a key role in the wind energy collection system . Deformation measurement for turbine blades is an important and efficient way to prevent blade damages . Here a novel and low cost measurement method of static deformation for wind turbine blades using home made LiDAR was proposed and then verified by measuring the flap wise load bending of a wind turbine blade model . The horizontal and vertical angular resolution of the proposed system are 0.09 and 0.225 meaning a high resolution of 500200 distance points in a 4545 field of view of each depth image . The visualization and processing of depth images was realized using Point Cloud Library . To fast segment the 3D wind turbine blade model from background data we also proposed a segmentation approach based on Euclidean clustering and union find algorithm . The experimental results show that this method can segment the blade model from acquired data effectively reducing the time cost by nearly 50 . Furthermore the bending degrees and curvatures of the blade in different buckling loads can be calculated using processed data . The proposed method can realize low cost on site portable and visualized deformation measurement for wind turbine blades and would be a promising way to test blades and prevent blade damages .
