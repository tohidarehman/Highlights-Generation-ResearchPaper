 We obtain resistance characteristics for molybdenum disulfide and temperature dependent coefficient of friction 0.0005 which could be a superlubricating state for molybdenum disulfide coatings or thin films . Considering molybdenum disulfide lubrication we adopt the transition state approach to calculate the temperature dependent friction behavior . We have performed intensive calibrations via verified models considering previous experimental friction tests on some thin solid film samples which measured the COF in 4.2 K 77 K and room temperature conditions to accommodate the actual working condition . To improve the performance of molybdenum disulfide we predict its better COF which could be a superlubricating state COF

@highlight or very low coefficient of friction for solid MoS
@highlight lubricant.
@highlight Our results have negative friction coefficients for superlubricity.
@highlight Coefficient of friction decreases to 0.0005 once we decrease the activation volume.
