 Digital holographic microscopy is a new type of quantitative phase imaging tool . It offers non contact and real time phase contrast imaging and has been used widely however the coherent noise degrades the imaging quality seriously . A method of reducing phase coherent noise based on adaptive total variation is proposed in this paper . In the proposed method an image quality evaluation factor is used to guide the adaptive total variation process . The quality evaluation factor divides the phase image into high quality regions and low quality regions . In high quality regions the details are preserved and in low quality regions the coherent noise is removed . The proposed method can reduce the coherent noise of the phase image and preserve some details well . The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method .

@highlight A method to reduce phase coherent noise based on adaptive total variation is proposed.
@highlight An image quality evaluation factor which combines the derivative variance correlation quality map and Canny operator is used to guide the adaptive total variation process.
@highlight In phase regions with less noise and edges the details are preserved and in the phase regions rich of noise and isolated noise pixels the noise is removed.
@highlight The proposed method can both reduce the coherent noise and preserve edges.
