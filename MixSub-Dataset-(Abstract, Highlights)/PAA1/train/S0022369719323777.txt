 An improvement in the photocatalytic activity of lanthanum ferrite was attempted by doping individual alkaline earth elements in its La site and Mg in Fe site to get the desired energy band characteristics . All doped compositions of LaFeO

@highlight Novel visible light absorbing alkaline earth elements doped LaFeO
@highlight nanocomposites were synthesised by sol gel method.
@highlight The composite showed excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and Congo red dye degradation than the phase pure materials.
@highlight The secondary oxides act as co catalysts and enhance photocatalytic activity.
@highlight The detailed degradation mechanism was proposed and excellent photocatalytic activity was repeated upto several cycles.
