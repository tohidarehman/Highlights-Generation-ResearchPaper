 The Optical Coherence Velocimeter technology is a technique for high precision displacement and vibration measurement based on the principle of spectral domain optical coherence method . The key of this technology is to realize nanometer or even sub nanometer measurement by high precision frequency estimation method called as Hanning window energy centrobaric method . This paper analyses the error transmission process of HnWECM and proposes a calculation method based on Paserval s theorem to establishes the accuracy theory of HnWECM . It shows that the variance of the estimated frequency using HnWECM is only proportional to the signal to noise ratio and very close to the Cramr Rao Lower Bound . The estimation performance of HnWECM is verified and compared with other frequency estimation methods by simulation and experimental results . Both the theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the HnWECM has good statistical efficiency and the best anti noise stability . This paper reveals the reason of chosen HnWECM as the signal processing method of OCV technology and gives its accuracy theory which will greatly promote the application of OCV technology .
