 U 6Nb is a uranium alloy containing 6wt niobium that possesses high corrosion resistance . The structure and composition of the passivating oxide layer formed on air aged U 6Nb which gives the material its corrosion resistant properties was characterized using surface scattering techniques . Stable oxide layers formed on the surface of a set of U 6Nb alloy thin films under ambient conditions were investigated using neutron reflectometry x ray reflectometry and grazing incidence x ray diffraction . The passivating oxide was composed of approximately 27 U 5 Nb and 68 O primarily consisting of a thin niobium oxide layer separating a thicker UO

@highlight Passivating oxide on U 6Nb uranium niobium alloy films has a bilayer structure.
@highlight A thin niobium oxide layer separates UO
@highlight layer from the underlying U 6Nb alloy.
@highlight Niobium oxide enrichment at the alloy interface enhances corrosion resistance.
@highlight Oxide formation doesnt significantly alter composition of the underlying metal.
@highlight Neutron and x ray reflectometry provide surface oxide compositional depth profile.
