 Formation of Au Ag alloy nanoparticles in TiN thin films is demonstrated through sequential implantation of Au and Ag ions . The irradiations were done with 200keV Au ions at fluence of 1.010

@highlight Sequential Au and Ag ion implantation of 260nm thick TiN films was performed.
@highlight The implantation was done using high ion fluences of Ag 200keV and Au 150keV .
@highlight The TiN surface undergoes topographic and chemical changes after ion implantation.
@highlight Spherical and crystalline particles with the diameter below 15nm were formed.
@highlight STEM showed that the obtained nanoparticles are Au Ag alloys.
