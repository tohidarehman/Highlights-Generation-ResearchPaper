 Magnetic graphene oxide has rapid adsorption kinetics and a high capacity for adsorbing aqueous Co and it was prepared in this study by controlling the synthesis conditions . The adsorption mechanism was analyzed based on the adsorption isotherms thermodynamics kinetics and post adsorption characteristics to understand the adsorption interactions . At 20C the adsorption equilibrium was reached in 5min with an adsorption quantity of 379.2mgL
