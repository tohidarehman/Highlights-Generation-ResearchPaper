 This paper reports a new chaotic system generated from the simplest memristor chaotic circuit by introducing a simple nonlinear feedback control input . The principal feature of the new system is that it has infinitely many equilibria and abundant coexisting attractors . The dynamic evolution of the system with respect to parameters and initial conditions is given to illustrate the existence of chaos and coexisting attractors . The circuit implementation is done for demonstrating the physical existence of the system . A microcontroller on Arduino Mega 2650 board is used to realize the system . Also the synchronization problem of the system is analyzed with the establishment of synchronization conditions based on the sliding mode control .

@highlight A new chaotic system with infinitely many coexisting attractors is presented. The dynamic behaviors of the new system are studied. The abundant coexisting attractors of the system are presented.
