 An American better of option is a rainbow option with two underlying assets . It can be described by a parabolic variational inequality on a two dimensional unbounded domain which can also be characterized by a two dimensional free boundary problem . Based on the numeraire transformation and the known information on the free boundary we derive a one dimensional linear complementarity problem related to options on a bounded domain . Moreover the full discretization scheme of LCP is constructed by finite difference and finite element methods in temporal and spatial directions respectively . The primal dual active set method is adopted for solving the resulting large scale discretized system . In each PDAS iteration a unique index set of primal dual variables will be computed by solving a linear system . A systematical convergent analysis is presented on our proposed method for pricing American better of options . One of the desirable features of our method is that we can get the option value and two free boundaries simultaneously . Numerical simulations are performed to verify the efficiency of our proposed method .

@highlight Based on the numeraire transformation and the known information on the free boundary we derive a one dimensional LCP related to the options on a bounded domain.
@highlight To guarantee the accuracy around the singularity at the maturity time
@highlight  we adopt the geometric partition instead of uniform partition inthe spatial direction.
@highlight To get the option value and two free boundaries simultaneously we will use PDAS method to solve the LCP.
@highlight Numerical simulations are performed to verifythe efficiency of our proposed method.
