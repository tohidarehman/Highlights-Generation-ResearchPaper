 Hybrid organicinorganic lead halide perovskite is still hampered by the toxicity of Pb as well as its structural stability in the open air . Herein based on the density functional theory computation we show that tin based layered quasi two dimensional Ruddlesden Popper hybrid organic inorganic perovskite X

@highlight By adjusting the number of layers the band gap of the material is regulated.
@highlight The significant effect of different passivation ligands on carrier mobility.
@highlight Few layered RuddlesdenPopper hybrid M2 MA n 1SnnI3n 1 perovskite would suitable for solar cell application.
