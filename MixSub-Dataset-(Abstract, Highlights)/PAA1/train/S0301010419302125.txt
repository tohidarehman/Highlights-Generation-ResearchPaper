 High aspect ratio gratings can be obtained by anisotropic etching of Si 110 111 . Usually isopropyl alcohol is added to the solution in order to smooth Si 110 surface . However the addition of IPA can reduce the etching rate ratio of Si 110 111 which leads to a reduction of gratings aspect ratio . The effects of another additive TMDD PA were discussed . The experimental data indicates that TMDD PA behaves better than IPA when smoothing Si 110 surface and etching rate ratio of Si 110 111 increases with the increasing concentration of TMDD PA . Mechanism of IPA and TMDD PA in etching were analyzed . Molecules of IPA and TMDD behave differently on Si surfaces and they have different impacts on H

@highlight TMDD PA was used as an additive in Si etching. TMDD PA effects the etching and roughness of Si 110 and Si 111.
@highlight The effect of TMDD PA and IPA on Si etching was compared. When additive concentration increasing etching rate ratio of Si 110 Si 111 added TMDD PA is higher than IPA.
@highlight Difference between TMDD PA and IPA was analyzed. Molecular size dehydrate ability and surface bonds angle are the reasons why TMDD PA and IPA behave differently.
