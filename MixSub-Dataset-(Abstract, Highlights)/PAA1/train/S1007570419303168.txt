 In globally coupled phase oscillators the natural frequency distribution plays a critical role on the synchronization . In this work we consider globally coupled phase oscillators with a multi peak natural frequency distribution that is a superposition of two symmetrical bimodal Lorentzian distributions . Using Ott Antonsen dimension reduction technique we reduce the system from high dimension to low dimension and investigate its dynamical behaviors in detail . Rich dynamical phenomena including revived incoherent states are found . Different types of partial synchronous states are characterized . We further investigate the phenomenon of revived incoherent states in a different view by modifying the model to a system composed of two interacting subpopulations of phase oscillators .

@highlight In the investigation of the synchronization in globally coupled phase oscillators with a multi peak natural frequency distribution rich dynamical phenomena including revived incoherent states could be found.
@highlight By using Ott Antonsen dimension reduction technique the high dimensional coupled phase oscillators can be reduced to two interacting subpopulations of OA oscillators.
@highlight The stability of the incoherent state and the different types of partial synchronous states can be characterized by using the description of OA oscillators.
