 Chiral integer quantum Hall edge modes are immune to backscattering and therefore are non localized and show a vanishing longitudinal as well as non local resistance along with quantized 2 terminal and Hall resistance even in presence of sample disorder . However this is not the case for contact disorder which refers to the possibility that a contact can reflect edge modes either partially or fully . This paper shows that when all contacts are disordered in a N terminal quantum Hall bar then transport via chiral QH edge modes can have a significant localization correction . The Hall and 2 terminal resistance in an N terminal quantum Hall sample deviate from their values derived while neglecting the phase acquired at disordered contacts and this deviation is called the quantum localization correction . This correction term increases with the increase of disorderedness of contacts but decreases with the increase in number of contacts in an N terminal Hall bar . The presence of inelastic scattering however can completely destroy the quantum localization correction .

@highlight In a 2DEG at high magnetic fields and low temperatures chiral spin unpolarized quantum Hall QH edge modes exist.
@highlight These QH edge modes are chiral dissipation less and robust against disorder and therefore highly promising candidates for use in low power information processing.
@highlight We identify a crucial distinction between a QH sample with all N contacts disordered and that with less than N say 1 2 or N 1 contacts disordered.
@highlight We predict that for a QH sample with all N contacts disordered a quantum localization correction term comes into being due to interference.
@highlight We term this correction to the resistances as quantum localization to distinguish it from weak localization arising in quantum diffusive transport.
