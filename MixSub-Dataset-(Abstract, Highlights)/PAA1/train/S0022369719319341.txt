 The aim of this work has been to improve the time resolution of radiation detectors for future high energy physics experiments and medical imaging applications . Ce doped oxyorthosilicate Lu

@highlight The time resolution of LYSO is more affected by carrier trapping than that of LSO.
@highlight Carrier trapping in LYSO is enhanced by fluctuations in the compound composition.
@highlight Ca co doping even at a concentration of 5ppm improves the response time of LYSO Ce.
@highlight Femtosecond pump probe spectroscopy is a useful tool for improving Ce doped scintillators.
