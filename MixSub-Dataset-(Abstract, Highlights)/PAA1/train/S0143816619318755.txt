 Digital holography enables the digitization processing of holograms . The resolution of the reconstructed image is greatly limited by the pixelated imaging detectors . To improve the resolution a bicubic interpolation and extrapolation iteration method is proposed to compensate the limited size of the digital holograms . Based on the prior knowledge of the model of Fresnel zone plate with circular diffraction gratings the pixel density is increased by the bicubic interpolation method inside the hologram to enhance the low frequency terms of the object . With extrapolation iterations method more high order fringes outside the hologram are generated to enhance the high frequency terms of the object . The resolution of the reconstructed image can be effectively improved by combining this predicted low and high frequency terms . Numerical simulations and optical experiments are presented and the feasibility of the proposed method is quantitatively evaluated .

@highlight We propose a bicubic interpolation and extrapolation iteration BIPEPI method to compensate the limited size of the digital hologram and its highlight can be generalized as 
@highlight The BIPEPI method can significantly enhance the resolution and quality of the reconstruction for inline digital hologram especially for the size limited holograms.
@highlight The quality and resolution of the reconstruction image can be improved by increasing the interpolation rate the extrapolation rate and the number of iterations.
@highlight The diffraction band limiting phenomenon of digital holography is described quantitatively The applicable conditions of the BIPEPI are also discussed.
