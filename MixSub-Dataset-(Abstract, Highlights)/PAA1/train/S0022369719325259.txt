 Erbium doped ZnO thin films were deposited on glass substrates by nebulizer spray pyrolysis with different doping concentrations . The deposited films are polycrystalline with a hexagonal structure with a predominant plane . The Er doped ZnO films have greater surface roughness than the undoped ZnO film . The optical transmittance of the undoped ZnO film is about 80 in the visible range . The optical bandgap of the undoped ZnO thin film is 3.29eV which is very close to the bulk ZnO . From photoluminescence spectra sharp UV emission is observed at 385nm for all the prepared films . The response of the films to ammonia NH

@highlight Erbium doped ZnO thin films were prepared for the first time by cost effective nebulizer spray pyrolysis.
@highlight Raman and photoluminescence studies confirmed the presence of oxygen vacancies for gas sensing.
@highlight Er doped ZnO films exhibited high sensitivity with short response and recovery time.
@highlight A possible mechanism for the adsorption of NH
