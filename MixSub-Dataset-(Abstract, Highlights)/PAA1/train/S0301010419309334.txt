 Recently lead free halide based double perovskites have emerged as a promising candidate for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications . Here we report the synthesis characterization and electronic structure calculations on lead free Bi based mixed halide double perovskites of Cs

@highlight In this paper the tuning of electronic properties and enhancement in stability is obtained by compositional mapping with different composition in halide based double perovskites.
@highlight We have systematically carried out the theoretical Density Functional Theory and experimental investigation of incorporation of Cl in the Cs
@highlight AgBiBr
@highlight structure in order to understand the bulk and electronic structures of the mixed halide based double perovskites Cs
@highlight AgBiCl
@highlight Br
@highlight  x 0 to 6 .
@highlight Both the bandgap and the nature of the band edges of these materials are intimately related to the kind of halides constituting the BiX
@highlight octahedra.
@highlight The detailed computational studies synthesis and characterization of mixed halide based double perovskites with high stabilitywill be an important step for the development of next generation lead free double perovskite solar cells.
