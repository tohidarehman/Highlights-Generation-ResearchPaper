 The FeCrAl Zy4 bi layer clad plate was fabricated by solid diffusion hot rolled and annealing treatment . The interface microstructure and phase analysis texture shear and tensile strength of the clad plate were investigated in details . The diffusional interface of clad plate was tightly bonded and there were no cracks and pores . The intermediate phases formed at the interface region of the plate were identified as ZrCr

@highlight The intermediate phases formed at the interface were ZrCr
@highlight  ZrFe
@highlight and Zr
@highlight Al.
@highlight Zr
@highlight Fe formed at the interface of sample annealed at 600C for 3h and 5h.
@highlight The textures of sample annealed at 600C for 5h are favorable for deformation.
@highlight The optimal annealing process is 600C for 5h.
