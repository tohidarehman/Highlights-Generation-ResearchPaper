 We are very interested in elucidating the theoretical reason why the luminescence of Eu organo ligand complexes is enhanced in the presence of Zn Schiff base complexes or quenched in the addition of Cu ones . The reason for luminescence enhanced and quenching spectra is deduced from the dynamic and static standpoints . In the dynamic behavior we describe that such luminescence spectra depend upon the lifetimes of electron populations at the excited state for their metal complexes by considering experimental investigations of Eu Zn Cu and dinuclear Eu or Cu complexes with organo ligands . We also consider the chemical rate equations to form the dinuclear metal complexes and derive the new equation for the ratio of quantum yields to estimate lifetimes of the Zn and Cu saltn complexes . From the static viewpoint electronic states of septet Eu singlet Zn as an electron acceptor and the dinucleus septet EuZn Cu complexes with organo ligands are calculated by using DFT and TD DFT methods . We discuss that the simulated UVVis spectra in the range of 450700nm reflect to the enhanced EuZn and quenching EuCu peaks with the experimental ones .

@highlight We discuss luminescence lifetimes at the excited states of Eu III and Eu III Zn II Cu II complexes.
