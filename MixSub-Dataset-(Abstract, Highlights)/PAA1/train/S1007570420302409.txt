 In this paper a periodic Chikungunya model with temperature and rainfall effects is proposed and studied which incorporates time dependent extrinsic incubation period time dependent maturation delay asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious humans . Two threshold parameters for the extinction and persistence of mosquitos and the virus are derived respectively the mosquito reproduction number

@highlight A periodic Chikungunya model with temperature and rainfall effects is studied.
@highlight Time dependent maturation delay and extrinsic incubation period are incorporated.
@highlight Infected humans are divided into symptomatic and asymptomatic compartments.
@highlight Neglecting rainfall seasonality and asymptomatic compartment infection may be overestimated.
@highlight Numerical simulations are done with data of the largest outbreak of Brazil in 2017.
