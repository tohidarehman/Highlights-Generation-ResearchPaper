 In the present work a novel cupric oxide decorated on cyclodextrin nanocomposite was synthesized by sonochemical method . The CuO CD nanocomposites were characterized by UVvis Raman FT IR FE SEM mapping analysis XRD techniques . Fascinatingly the CuO CD nanocomposite Nafion solubilized modified glassy carbon electrode has exhibited a superior electrocatalytic activity towards the

@highlight Cupric oxide decorated cyclodextrin nanocomposite shows enhanced electrocatalytic detection of
@highlight  tyrosine.
@highlight It is owing to better electron transfer efficiency and high surface area of the nanocomposite modified electrode.
@highlight Amperometric technique is adopted to identify low detection of
@highlight  tyrosine in the presence of real samples.
