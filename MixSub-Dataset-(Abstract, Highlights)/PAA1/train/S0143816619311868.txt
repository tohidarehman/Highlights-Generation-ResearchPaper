 Clear and focused pattern images are essential prerequisites for accurate feature detection in traditional camera calibration methods which introduce numerous limitations in various areas such as long distance photogrammetry . A feature detection method robust against defocusing is proposed for extracting the centers or corners of a planar square periodic target . A Fourier transform is employed to calculate two wrapped phase maps from the periodic target images which are then used to accurately extract the feature points . The calibration procedure is divided into two stages to obtain more accurate results . A rough calibration is performed to calculate the rotation angles between the target and the camera . If the tilt angle is larger than 12 the corresponding images are removed . Subsequently the remaining images are used for precise calibration . The simulations and the experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately calibrate a camera with a planar square periodic pattern even in the case of severe defocusing .
