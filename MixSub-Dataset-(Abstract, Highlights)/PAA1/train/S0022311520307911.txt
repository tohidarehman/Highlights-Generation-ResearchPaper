 Scanning tunneling microscopy has been performed on an electro polished gallium stabilized delta phase plutonium sample under ultra high vacuum conditions . The images obtained were used to measure surface roughness as ion sputtering and annealing was applied to the plutonium sample . It was demonstrated that sputter anneal cycles progressively increased the surface roughness of the plutonium . Additionally Auger and scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements revealed an initially unstable and dynamically changing surface that became increasingly stable as sputter anneal cycles were applied . The stabilized surface region contained within the sputter crater was observed to be unchanged for up to 17 months after the final sputter anneal cycle .
