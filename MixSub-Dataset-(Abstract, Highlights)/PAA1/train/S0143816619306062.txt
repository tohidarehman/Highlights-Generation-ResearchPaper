 This paper reports on an experimental realization of an automatic laser locking scheme using the artificial intelligence algorithm . We design a classifier based on the support vector machine to recognize the pattern of the saturated absorption spectroscopy signal of a laser and to locate its lockable points . We experimentally investigated our intelligent locking scheme on an external cavity diode laser at 780nm through the rubidium cell and Rb saturated absorptionlines . Test results show that the laser frequency can be automatically locked or relocked to the desired point within 11.6s either from free running state or from unlocked state where the entire locking and relocking process is managed by the machine itself rather than human operations . The intelligent method reported in this paper provides a robust and smart solution for laser locking in unmanned conditions e.g . space borne experiments .

@highlight An innovative method of intelligent automatic laser frequency locking system utilizing the pattern recognition technology is presented.
@highlight A classifier based on the support vector machine is designed to recognize the pattern of the saturated absorption signal of a laser and then locate its lockable points which has very obvious advantages.
@highlight The laser frequency can be automatically locked to the desired point from free running state or relocked from unlocked state within 11.6s without man made operation.
@highlight This method can be effectively broadly applied to other experiments and systems especially in unmanned and spaceborne experiments.
