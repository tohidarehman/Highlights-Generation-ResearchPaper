 Direct and converse piezoelectric effects have been observed in human tooth enamel and dentin . In this study organic material was removed from dentin and enamel using a chlorinated solution to measure the sole contribution of the inorganic phase . In the direct mode piezoelectricity is observed when a force applied to the sample produces a voltage . A variable load was applied to the samples with a Shimadzu universal testing machine . In the converse mode mechanical deformation of the sample occurs under an electric field which was detected using an atomic force microscope in the piezoelectric mode . For comparison measurements were also performed on samples where organic and inorganic phases were present . Although a decrease in of the electromechanical response of the organic free sample was observed the results indicate that the inorganic phase contributes to the piezoelectric property in dentin and in a lesser extent in enamel . This suggests that tooth dentin and enamel apatite nanocrystals present piezoelectric non centrosymmetric P6

@highlight Piezoelectricity of tooth hydroxyapatite in dentin and enamel was measured.
@highlight Piezoelectricity of hydroxyapatite in dentin is larger than that in enamel.
@highlight Piezoelectricity decreases in tooth samples when the organic material is removed.
@highlight Centro and non centro symmetric spatial groups coexist in the tooth structure.
@highlight Piezoelectricity could stimulate healing growth of teeth as it does in bone.
