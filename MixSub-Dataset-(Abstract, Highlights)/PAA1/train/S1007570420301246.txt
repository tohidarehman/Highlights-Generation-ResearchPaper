 This paper solves the event triggered passivity problem for multiple weighted coupled delayed reaction diffusion memristive neural networks with fixed and switching topologies . On the one side by designing appropriate event triggered controllers several passivity criteria for MWCDRDMNNs with fixed topology are derived based on the Lyapunov functional method and some inequality techniques . Moreover some adequate conditions for ensuring asymptotical stability of the event triggered passive network are presented . On the other side we take the switching topology in network model into consideration and investigate the event triggered passivity and passivity based synchronization for MWCDRDMNNs with switching topology . Finally two examples with numerical simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results .
