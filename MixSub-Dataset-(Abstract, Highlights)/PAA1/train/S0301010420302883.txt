 Polyynes and polyyne based one dimensional nanostructures are promising for several applications including ultra compact circuits and electro optical devices . A carbon arc in water is a simple method for synthesis of carbon nanostructure . Here we collected and analyzed the gas generated by a carbon arc in water and unequivocally proved for the first time the presence of polyynes in the evolved gas . The discharge current is shown to regulate significantly the length distribution of polyynes and the purity index and yield can be improved by appropriately raising the temperature . In addition size selected polyynes were obtained by high performance liquid chromatography separation and analyzed by surface enhanced Raman scattering . This study provides a new route for the scalable preparation of gas containing polyynes with low cost and no pollution and will broaden the potential application of polyynes .
