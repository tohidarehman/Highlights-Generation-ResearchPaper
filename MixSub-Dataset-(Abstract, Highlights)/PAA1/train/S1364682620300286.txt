 During the American solar eclipse on 21 August 2017 the GNSS network was applied to record the ionospheric responses . Following the lunar shadow the TEC depletion emerged over the eclipse path . After the eclipse end the depletion in the north gradually disappeared and then the TEC enhancement emerged . The depletion in the south has continued for a long time . A sharp area between the enhancement and depletion regions appeared at 27N latitude . Moreover the depletion region were moving to south with larger and larger TEC decline after the eclipse maximum . The TEC over four selected places with same latitude and different eclipse obscurations is presented . Interestingly the recovery periods of these TEC values are similar . The

@highlight The eclipse induced depletion was moving to south with larger and larger TEC depletion after eclipse maximum.
@highlight A sharp area between the enhancement and depletion regions appeared at the latitude of 27 N.
@highlight The fountain effect and eclipse induced thermospheric winds may play an important role for the rare phenomena.
