 This article covers the investigation of tritium release and retention properties of beryllium pebbles with diameters of 0.5 and 1 mm after neutron irradiation at temperatures of 643 923 K and damage doses of 21 37 dpa corresponding to 3632 5925 appm helium and 367 644 appm tritium productions respectively . The thermos desorption spectra have a single main peak for both tritium and helium release . The peak temperatures at both used heating rates of 0.017 K s and 0.117 K s are in the range of 1052 1364 K for tritium and 1104 1336 K for helium release . The peak temperatures at a heating rate of 0.017 K s are always lower than at 0.117 K s. The tritium retention in both 0.5 and 1 mm beryllium pebbles considerably decreases by increasing irradiation temperature reaching of 1 18 at the highest temperature of 923 K regardless of the pebble diameter . Open channels are formed in the beryllium pebble microstructure at high irradiation temperatures . These microstructural features contribute to the enhanced release and low retention in beryllium pebbles under neutron irradiation .

@highlight Tritium completely remains in beryllium pebbles irradiated at 643 and 723 K and most of it leaves the pebbles irradiated at 833 and 923 K.
@highlight Formation of small gas bubbles and big pores occurs in beryllium under neutron irradiation up to high helium and tritium productions.
@highlight Interconnected open channels which are formed in beryllium microstructure contributes to enhanced release and low retention of tritium.
