 Sodium alginate is a natural biomacromolecule with promising applications as a flocculant for wastewater treatment due to its biodegradability and non toxicity . To enhance the flocculating efficiency simplify the synthetic process of the flocculants and expand the application scope of alginate a novel amphoteric flocculant was synthesized through reaction of alginate with 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride under alkaline conditions . The structures of the flocculants were characterized using various methods . The flocculants demonstrated nanoparticle sizes with a narrow distribution . The amphoteric flocculant could not only effectively remove the positively charged Pb

@highlight Novel amphoteric nano flocculants were prepared through modification of alginate.
@highlight The flocculants had high removal rates for Pb
@highlight and humic acid.
@highlight Chelation and electrostatic interaction mechanisms were involved for both pollutants.
@highlight Adsorption kinetics accorded with a quasi second order model.
@highlight The new amphoteric flocculant is a promising agent for wastewater treatment.
