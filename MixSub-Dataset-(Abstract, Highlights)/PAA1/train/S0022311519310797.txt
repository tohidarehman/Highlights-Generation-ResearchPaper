 The HICU experiment was performed in the High Flux Reactor in Petten NL in order to irradiate candidate tritium breeder materials in a fusion relevant environment . The presented work focuses on the post irradiation examination of the irradiated lithium orthosilicate based breeder pebbles . The pebble samples showed three different contents of Li 6 and were irradiated at two different temperatures and in mechanically constrained and unconstrained state . In this particular publication the influences of the irradiation conditions on the pebble morphology microstructure porosity and mechanical strength are addressed .
