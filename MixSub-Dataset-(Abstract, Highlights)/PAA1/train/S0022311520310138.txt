 Effects of cooling rates on mechanical behavior of steam oxidized Zircaloy 4 are systematically investigated with the cladding material oxidized to the current ductility based regulatory limits . Three different cooling rates associated with distinctively different quenching environments are tested ambient air cooled 7

@highlight LOCA with different cooling rates and Ring Compression Tests RCT conducted.
@highlight Pre hydrided zircaloy 4 765wppm used to mimic high burnup effect.
@highlight Cooling rate insensitive resulting phase thicknesses and their oxygen contents.
@highlight Limited effect of cooling rates on residual ductility for non pre hydrided.
@highlight Microstructure changes statistical variation of RCT load displacement curve.
