 In this study we introduce a new approach to construct the Schrdinger equation with position dependent mass characterized by an emerging particle s effective mass in perfect analogy with the problems involving a position dependent mass particle in semiconductor heterostructures . We have discussed several of its properties and some of its implications in quantum dots and semiconductors . It was observed that the PDM approach affects only semiconductors with large interatomic scaling such as non crystalline semiconductors and its effect on conventional semiconductors is insignificant .
