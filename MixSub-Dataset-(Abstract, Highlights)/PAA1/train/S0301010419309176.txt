 By using the classic Lennard Jones potential as reference inverse canonical transformations allow for the accurate generation of post BornOppenheimer potentials in the ground and excited electronic states for H

@highlight Canonical transformations generate accurate post BornOppenheimer potentials.
@highlight Canonical transformations do not require the use of adjustable parameters.
@highlight It is shown that pairwise interatomic interactions are fundamentally the same.
