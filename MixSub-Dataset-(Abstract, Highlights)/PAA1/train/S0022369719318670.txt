 In this study N doped platelet like metal loaded Zr SBA 15 was synthesized and employed for reducing 4 nitrophenol to remove this contaminant from water . Dopamine hydrochloride was used as a novel CN source for the modification of ZrSBA 15 . The N doping process occurred readily at a low temperature due to the polymerization of dopamine which could save energy and simplify the experimental fabrication of catalysts . In addition polydopamine can immobilize Pd ions in a facile manner and the trapped Pd ions are reduced to Pd nanoparticles due to the reducibility of the polydopamine polymer . The utilization of dopamine allows the catalyst to be obtained in a facile and cost effective synthetic process while the production of the CN layer as well as the reduction and immobilization of the Pd ions can occur simultaneously . Characterization of the product showed that the catalyst had a platelet like structure after decoration with elemental Zr which enhanced the catalytic reaction compared with the natural fiber like SBA 15 . The optimal Pd loading capacity was determined as 3.0wt and the materials obtained could reduce 4 nitrophenol to 4 aminophenol within 120s with a conversion ratio above 90 .
