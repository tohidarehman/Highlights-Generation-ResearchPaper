 A low cost Thermoelastic Stress Analysis experimental setup is proposed which uses an ordinary micro bolometer and in house developed signal processing scripts . The setup is evaluated by analysing the thermoelastic signal from a tensile and a SENT specimen made of stainless steel AISI 304L and the bolometer performances are compared with those of a state of the art photon detector . Signal processing is based on off line cross correlation using a self reference signal which is retrieved from the acquired thermal data . Procedures are in particular developed to recognise quantify and correct errors due to spectral leakage and loss of streamed frames . The thermoelastic signal amplitude phase the thermoelastic constant and the Mode I Stress Intensity Factor from the bolometer and photonic cameras are evaluated considering the influence of loading frequency sampling frequency detector array sub windowing and acquisition interval duration . A camera specific linear calibration procedure is applied to correct the thermoelastic signal obtained with the bolometer . The procedure is extended to correct also SIF values finding a good match with the SIFs obtained by the photon detector . An automatic iterative algorithm based on the least square fitting of Williams series functions is proposed to identify the crack tip position . An estimation of processing times of the developed signal processing scripts has been carried out finding that a full crack characterisation can be performed with a data acquisition time of 10 20 s a post processing time of less than 2 s and an overall hardware cost under 10 k .
