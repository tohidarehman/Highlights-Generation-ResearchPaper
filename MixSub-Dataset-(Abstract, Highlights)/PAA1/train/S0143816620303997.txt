 Polarimetric imaging is an effective way for clear vision in water in which deducing the object radiance in clear water from the obtained polarimetric information in turbid water is essential . In this letter we propose for the first time to our knowledge a learning based method for polarimetric underwater image recovery . It is based on the dense network and can learn well the relation between the object radiance and the polarization information . The experimental results demonstrate that additionally introducing the polarization information is beneficial for improving the image quality . Moreover the proposed learning based method can effectively remove the veiling light and outperforms other existing methods even in dense turbid water .

@highlight This article proposes for the first time to our knowledge a learning based method for underwater polarimetric image recovery.
@highlight The comparison experiment with the intensity or polarization information input demonstrates that additionally introducing the polarization information is beneficial for improving the image quality.
@highlight The experimental results for different scenes in dense turbid water demonstrate that our learning based method can effectively remove the veiling light to realize the clear vision and outperforms other existing methods.
