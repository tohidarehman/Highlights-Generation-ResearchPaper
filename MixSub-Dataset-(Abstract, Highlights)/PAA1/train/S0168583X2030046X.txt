 This work reports the study of platinum silicide formation on reaction with an oxygen contaminated silicon layer . The observed results are potentially a novel approach to use silicide forming metals as a direct contact electrode to the crystalline core amorphous silicon oxide shell structure of silicon nanowires without the need of hazardous acids e.g . hydrofluoric acid which is commonly used during lithography device preparation to remove the oxide shell . The simulation of the

@highlight The multi layered structure was prepared using electron beam evaporation EBE .
@highlight Silicide grow uninterrupted upon Pt reaction with O contaminated silicon layer.
@highlight Friendly approach applicable in the core shell silicon nanowire contact structure.
@highlight Avoiding the use of hazardous acids during device fabrication.
