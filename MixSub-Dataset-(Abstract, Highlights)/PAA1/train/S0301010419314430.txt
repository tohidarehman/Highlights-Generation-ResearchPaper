 Single crystal nickel micro particles have been synthesized using oleylamine which perform both functions as solvent and as reductant along with nickel nitrate hexahydrate as the metallic salt and C TAB as a surfactant . SEM imaging and X ray techniques were used to confirm the presence of the single crystal structure of nickel micro particles . The effect of crystallinity on field based and especially temperature based magnetic properties resulting in higher curie temperatures of nickel micro particles was also analyzed . Their morphology and magnetic properties were compared with commercially obtained nickel micro particles and a variety of other nickel microparticles prepared by using different surfactants in the same system .

@highlight Single crystal micro particles of nickel have been prepared using oleylamine as a solvent reductant system.
@highlight A variety of surfactants were also used to observe their effect on nickel micro particles.
@highlight Results showed higher crystallinity of the synthesized micro particles as compared to standard samples.
@highlight Magnetic testing results showed the increase in curie temperature which was higher than previously recorded.
