 The adoption of Accident Tolerant Fuels in the US will only likely be realized through improving economics of existing commercial reactors . For this reason the Nuclear Energy Institute refers to such concepts as Advanced Technology Fuel . This work provides an insight into the performance of the fuel rod with high density uranium nitride pellet in silicon carbide composite cladding for a pressurized water reactor . The UN higher uranium density is one way to overcome the higher cost of SiC relative to current Zirconium based claddings . The material properties and irradiation behavior models of UN and SiC have been incorporated into the BISON fuel performance code . The modeling capability of BISON for SiC cladding is extended with irradiation creep and post irradiation thermal annealing models . The fuel rod performance during normal operation is evaluated across three fuel cycles with each cycle 24 month long . Selected accident scenarios include a large break loss of coolant accident and a station blackout accident where the potential effects of SiC irradiation creep and annealing rate are emphasized . This work motivates further experimental investigation on irradiation properties of dense UN SiC irradiation creep and nonisothermal annealing .

@highlight Performance of full length UN SiC fuel rod is modeled during PWR normal operation.
@highlight Performance of full length UN SiC fuel rod is modeled under PWR LBLOCA and SBO.
@highlight SiC irradiation creep is not conducive to the fuel rod hermeticity under LBLOCA and SBO.
@highlight Significant post irradiation annealing of SiC is unfavorable to the fuel rod hermeticity.
