 FeCrAl oxide dispersion strengthened steel is one of the most promising candidate cladding materials of generation IV nuclear fission reactors because of its excellent resistance to not only corrosion but also creep and irradiation due to the ultrahigh density nanometer scale oxides . Crystal and metal oxide interface structures of the nanoparticles in FeCrAl ODS steel with Hf addition i.e . Fe15Cr2W0.1Ti4Al0.6Hf0.35Y

@highlight Crystal interface structures of 153 oxides in FeCrAl ODS steel were characterized.
@highlight Proportions of various types of oxides were determined according to HRTEM results.
@highlight Crystallographic orientation correlations of the oxides matrix were determined.
@highlight Minor addition of Hf Ti prompts significant formation of YHfO YTiO oxides.
