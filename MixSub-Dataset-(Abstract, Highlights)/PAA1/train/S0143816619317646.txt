 The key challenge in laser butt welding of dissimilar Al steel metals i.e . unevenly distributed brittle intermetallic compounds along the interface was solved via the beam oscillation under optimized laser offset . The IMCs thickness variance from top to bottom was adopted to quantitatively evaluate the uniformity of IMCs layer . The smaller the the better the uniformity . The decreased from 105.14 to 0.0022 as the D increased from 0.4 to 0.8mm indicating the uniformity increased by 4.710

@highlight The effective joining of Al steel is achieved by laser oscillating welding.
@highlight A uniformly distributed interface layer along thickness direction is obtained.
@highlight Beam oscillation benefits to homogenize the element distribution at interface.
@highlight The formation of interface layer is cleared in terms of melt flow in molten pool.
