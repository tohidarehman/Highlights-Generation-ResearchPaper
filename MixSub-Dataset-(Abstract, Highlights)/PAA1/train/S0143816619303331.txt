 An innovative image authentication scheme using spatially variant vector beam is introduced . During encoding period the original image is converted into two angle distribution images by making use of the modified GerchbergSaxton algorithm and random polarization parameters in a digital way . By using image division and sparse sampling two mosaic ciphertexts which retain partial encoded information are obtained . A generator of spatially variant polarized beam combined with a sparse phase only key can decrypt the ciphertexts into a noise like result that can be authenticated by a nonlinear correlator . Numerical simulation tests demonstrate the security strength and robustness of this scheme . Moreover this scheme exhibits a higher resistance against misalignment of phase only key which is advantageous for practical implementation . We expect that these results might be useful for future application of polarization encoding in security application .

@highlight A compact optical authentication system using generator of spatially variant vector beam is proposed.
@highlight A novel sparse sampling technique of ciphertexts is developed that can simultaneously complete information removal and data compression.
@highlight Requirement for strict alignment of phase mask key is relaxed greatly.
@highlight Random polarization parameters constitute a key space with multiple dimension to resist against potential brute force attacks.
