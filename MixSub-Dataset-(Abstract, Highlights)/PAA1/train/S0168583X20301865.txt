 The main aim of the work was investigation of the graphene resistance on mechanical scratch after ion beam bombardment . The CVD graphene on the glass substrate was used . Bombardment of graphene by beams of helium and nitrogen ions of energy 100keV was applied . Density of ion induced defects in graphene was evaluated using Raman spectroscopy . The polymer indenter was applied for scratch test . Increase of the scratch resistance of the graphene after ion beam bombardment was observed . Scratch resistance of the graphene layer increases with increasing density of defects induced by helium and nitrogen ions . The shape of graphene ribbons exfoliated during scratch test suggests that increase of graphene scratch resistance is accompanied with improvement of graphene adhesion to the substrate . It suggests that ion beam induced defects may be responsible for observed increasing of both graphene scratch resistance ad graphene adhesion to the substrate .
