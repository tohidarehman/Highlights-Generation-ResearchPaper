 For two dimensional materials a pure large out of plane piezoelectric response compatible with the nowadays bottom top gate technologies is highly desired . In this work the piezoelectric properties of penta graphene monolayer are studied with pure out of plane piezoelectric effect by density functional theory . However the

@highlight Pure out of plane piezoelectric effect is found in penta graphene.
@highlight A Janus penta monolayer is constructed to improve piezoelectric properties of penta graphene.
@highlight Proposed penta monolayer with high and pure out of plane piezoelectric effect.
