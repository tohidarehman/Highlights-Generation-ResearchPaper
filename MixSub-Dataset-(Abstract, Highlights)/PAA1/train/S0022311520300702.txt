 Elucidating the synergistic effects of different energetic beams on the radiation response of nuclear materials is critical for developing an improved methodology for their evaluation when exposed to extreme environments . This article describes

@highlight Sequential and simultaneous dual beam irradiations have been performed
@highlight on fine grained tungsten at high temperature.
@highlight Loop damage is quantified as a function of dose or fluence and cavity damage is quantified at the end dose.
@highlight Synergistic effects between sequential and simultaneous beams are revealed.
@highlight Damage evolution is different in all cases.
