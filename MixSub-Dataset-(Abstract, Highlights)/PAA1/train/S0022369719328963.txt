 Photo electrochemical cells have been widely studied as an eco friendly method of producing hydrogen fuel . Among the various materials hematite Fe

@highlight We controlled the length of vertically aligned hematite NRs by adjusting the chemical concentrations.
@highlight The PEC performance of vertically aligned hematite NRs was strongly dependent on the length of the NRs.
@highlight For the 800C high temperature annealing the optimal length of NRs yielding the best PEC performance was 300500nm.
@highlight The cobalt phosphate modified hematite NRs showed 1.54mAcm 2 of photocurrent at 1.23V vs. RHE.
