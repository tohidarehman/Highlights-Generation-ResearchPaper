 We designed prepared and evaluated a new ligand Ethyl 2 thiophen 2 yl 2 oxoacetate for anticancer activity against a panel of the human breast cancer cell . The FT IR and FT Raman spectroscopies represent one of the most powerful techniques to study chemical bonding and chemistry identify molecular structure . The results of a study on the Geometries Electrostatic potential energy map and electronic properties of 6HPET were investigated by ab initio and Density Functional Theory with B3LYP functional . The Protein Ligand interaction plays a significant role in structural properties of the designed drug molecule . Molecular docking results were performed by using the FlexX and LeadIT docking software and the binding energies were obtained as scores from 31.976 30.8060 and 29.2660kcal mol . The above mentioned compounds can be utilized to the breast cancer therapy and it leads a way to create platforms for chemotherapy or hormonal therapy of breast cancer treatments .

@highlight The complete Vibrational assignments of 6HPET have been made based on PED.
@highlight The Molecular docking results displayed that the 6HPET have good binding mode and binding interactions.
@highlight ESP visualization of 6HPET helps to predict its reactive behavior in both electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions.
@highlight The complete Vibrational assignments and spectroscopic analysis were made.
@highlight The HOMO LUMO energy gap were theoretically predicted.
