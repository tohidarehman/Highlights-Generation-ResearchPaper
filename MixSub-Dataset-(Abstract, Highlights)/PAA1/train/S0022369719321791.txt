 The phase transition boundary between the zinc blende and the rock salt structure in zinc selenide was determined using high pressure experiments combined with the synchrotron X ray diffraction technique . Significant hysteresis in the phase transition was not observed at high temperatures . The transition pressure was extrapolated to be 13.3GPaat 300K and the

@highlight The semiconductormetal phase boundary in zinc selenide has negative

@highlight Transition pressure is 13.3GPaat room temperature.
@highlight Linear relationship between the semiconductor metal transition pressures and dP dT slopes in II VI and III V compounds were found.
