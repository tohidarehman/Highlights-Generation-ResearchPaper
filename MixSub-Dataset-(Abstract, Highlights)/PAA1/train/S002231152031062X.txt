 The structural changes of ammonium diuranate microspheres prepared by the solgel route via internal gelation were investigated during thermal treatments in oxidative and reducing conditions . In particular

@highlight Crack formation during calcination in air observed cracks heal and spheres shrink.
@highlight Fractures and shrinkage differs significantly for Ce
@highlight compared to Ce
@highlight precursor.
@highlight Macroscopic behaviour related to release of volatile decomposition products.
@highlight Less rapid reduction of
@highlight matrix to UO
@highlight None
@highlight for Ce
@highlight precursor Ar H
@highlight  700C .
@highlight Shrinkage mainly attributed to sintering effects and less to phase transitions.
