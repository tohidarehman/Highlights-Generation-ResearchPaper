 In the current study we reported current voltage . Electric conductivity of IFs allows for a simple quantum mechanical description of light energy transmission through the retina providing a convincing mechanism that achieves high contrast vision in vertebrate eyes . Note that classic light transmission is hindered by light scattering on the retinal structures . Electric conductivity of IFs also opens the possibility for energy exchange within and between other cell types by way of IFs and microtubules and the possibility that such structures may be used for signaling e.g . in the nervous system .

@highlight Volt ampere characteristics of intermediate filaments IFs from Mller cells of porcine retina were recorded.
@highlight These characteristics were compatible with the Schottky diode theory at different temperatures.
@highlight The value of the Schottky barrier of the IFs corresponds to that of a semiconductor.
