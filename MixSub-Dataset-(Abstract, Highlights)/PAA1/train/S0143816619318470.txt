 We theoretically and numerically investigate the focusing properties and the radiation forces produced by a focused rotating anisotropic generalized multi Gaussian Schell model beam . We find that for different parameters at the trapped plane the intensity distribution would evolve into an elliptical dark hollow or elongated Gaussian beam profile . Compared to the focal plane the trapped plane has an axial displacement due to the twist effects . Further we demonstrate that two types of particles at different positions of the trapped plane can be trapped and rotated simultaneously by such a focused beam . Moreover the influences of the beam index

@highlight We investigate the radiation forces produced by a RAGMGSM beam.
@highlight The focused beam can simultaneously trap two types of particle.
@highlight The beam parameters including the twist factor have an impact upon the radiation forces.
@highlight The limits of each parameter for trapping stability are also discussed.
