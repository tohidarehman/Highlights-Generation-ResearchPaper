 The 2 amino 5 bromopyridinium trifluoroacetate crystal has been successfully grown by solvent slow evaporation technique . The grown crystal is found to non centrosymmetric space group Pna2

@highlight The research discloses the discovery of novel 2 amino 5 bromopyridinium trifluoroacetate 2A5BPTFA as an efficient organic material for NLO applications.
@highlight 2A5BPTFA exhibits blue emission confirmed by Photoluminescence studies which proves to be an eligible candidate of fabrication of blue organic LED.
@highlight This is exhibits second harmonic generation. The relative NLO efficiency of 2A5BPTFA has 2.44 times larger than that of KDP.
@highlight The study report 2A5BPTFA exhibits self focusing nature and the optical limiting threshold values confirm the suitability in optoelectronic applications.
