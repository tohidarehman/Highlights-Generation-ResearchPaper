 Based on first principles calculations we investigate the structural electronic and optical properties of few layer two dimensional oriented BN nanosheets in relation to the layer number

@highlight It is demonstrated that the minimum number of layers that can satisfy the cubic phase structure of the 1 1 0 surface is 3 the wrinkled BN structure with
@highlight bonding characteristics is maintained the thickness is approximately 5 .
@highlight The speed of spread in these materials would be faster than that in bulk c BN the band gap decrease to nearly half of those of the bulk material.
@highlight Such materials with a small refractive index can possibly be applied in photoelectronics and waveguide materials.
