 Bridging lower length scale calculations with the engineering scale simulations of fuel performance codes requires the development of dedicated intermediate scale codes . In this work we present SCIANTIX an open source 0D stand alone computer code designed to be included coupled as a module in existing fuel performance codes . The models currently available in SCIANTIX cover intra and inter granular inert gas behaviour in UO

@highlight The characteristics of the SCIANTIX computer code are described.
@highlight The models currently available in SCIANTIX are detailed with all the parameters .
@highlight The verification of the numerical solvers is presented.
@highlight Showcases of validation in both constant and transient conditions are presented.
@highlight Future short and long term development plans are outlined.
