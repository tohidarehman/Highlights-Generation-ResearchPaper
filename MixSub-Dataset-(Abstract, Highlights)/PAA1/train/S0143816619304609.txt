 The multi parameter distributions of non premixed combustion were investigated in this work by using deflection tomography and particle image velocimetry . An experimental apparatus composed of a burning system a deflection tomography system and a PIV system is initially designed and constructed . Two charge coupled diode cameras are controlled by a synchroniser to capture Moir fringes and tracer particles simultaneously and the velocity contour and streamline map are obtained from the tracer particle distributions and flame images . The temperature distribution is reconstructed from the Moir fringes based on the wave front recovery method and Abel inversion algorithm and the velocity and temperature distributions are matched in the combustion field by using the pixel registration method . The matching results show that the high temperature and high speed zones of the combustion flow field do not coincide under the experimental conditions . Finally the coupling imaging effect and measurement errors in the multi parameter measurement are discussed .
