 In this paper we consider a mean reverting stochastic volatility equation with regime switching and present some sufficient conditions for the existence of global positive solution asymptotic boundedness in

@highlight We show the existence of global positive solution to
@highlight for any initial value which extends the corresponding result in Mao etal.
@highlight We gives the
@highlight th moment estimation asymptotically bounded in
@highlight th moment and the Lyapunov exponent of the solution
@highlight to
@highlight We present some sufficient conditions for that the process 
@highlight  determined by
@highlight is positive recurrent and admits a unique ergodic asymptotically invariant distribution.
