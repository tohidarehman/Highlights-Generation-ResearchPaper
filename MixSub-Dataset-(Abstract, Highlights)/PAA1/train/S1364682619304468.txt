 Ionospheric delay error is one of the most significant error sources for single frequency SBAS users and its error bound is the key point for PL calculation . To satisfy the integrity specifications for users anywhere in the service region the error bound need to be inflated according to various threat . Among them the undersampled threat plays an important role in the inflation . The fundamental reason for the undersampled threat lies in the disagreement of the linear planar model to the actual ionosphere characteristics which can not be accurately described by the discrete IPP samples . Ionosphere threat model is established to handle this problem . It uses historical irregular ionosphere data to generate the two dimensional lookup table which illustrates the relationship between the IPP distribution and the maximum estimation error . How to abstract the metrics to describe the discrete two dimensional IPP distribution is the key to the establishment of ionosphere threat model . In this paper we conclude the properties of a good metric from a physical point of view and propose the Relative COVerage metric . Based on the measured data from IGS stations taking the regions of Europe as an example the ionosphere threat model based on RCOV metric is established and compared with the RCM model used in WAAS and MSAS . At the same time the integrity of the ionosphere GIVE results is verified . The experimental results show that under the experimental configuration given in this paper the RCOV metric proposed can improve the system availability on the premise of meeting the integrity requirements .
