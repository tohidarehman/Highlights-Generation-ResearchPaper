 This paper is dedicated to the resilient input to state stable filter design for nonlinear time delay systems subject to external disturbance input . Two types of time delay are taken into account . First novel analysis results on input to state stability for the filtering error systems are presented on the basis of the Lyapunov functional method . Both the Bessel Legendre inequality and the reciprocally convex combination approach are employed to reduce the conservatism of the present conditions . Then computationally tractable design strategies for the desired filters are developed via using a number of decoupling techniques . Finally two illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the input to state stable filter approaches for the time variant delay case and the time invariant delay case respectively .
