 We present first principles calculations on the geometrical structures and optical absorption properties of redox active centers in two types of blue copper proteins plastocyanin and pseudoazurin . Two four coordination cluster models consisting 111 atom were constructed based on the crystal structures of the two proteins . The optimized configurations of the proposed models took on highly identical geometry as the crystal structures and the calculated absorption spectra of both models acceptably reproduced the corresponding experimental spectra . Based on spectral simulations we were able to confirm the indispensable role of axial ligand methionine in both proteins . The difference in the absorption spectroscopy of the two types of proteins was caused by the changes to the ground state wave functions which originate mainly from the different coordination structures of the redox active center especially the different Cu S
