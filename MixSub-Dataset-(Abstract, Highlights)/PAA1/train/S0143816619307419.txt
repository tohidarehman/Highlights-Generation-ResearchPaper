 A novel underwater optical imaging method is proposed to improve the quality of images which suffer from poor visibility due to underwater scattering and signal attenuation under artificial illumination . A high sensitive sCMOS video camera was designed to operate in rolling shutter mode which formed a narrow field of view during the exposure process . Meanwhile a MEMS based two dimensional laser scanning light source only illuminated the camera s narrow FOV . Thus the backscatter caused by the FOV intersection of the camera with the light source was reduced . Since the laser scanning route of the method is a field instead of a line we named it Laser Field synchronous Scanning . A modified off the shelf laser scanning projector with green laser diode driving signal extracted was employed as the two dimensional laser scanning light source and the driving signal was received by the sCMOS video camera to synchronize the rolling shutter . The experiment was conducted by utilizing contrast ratio and contrast signal to noise ratio to compare the images captured using an LED light source and LFS under different water turbidity . The experimental results show that LFS has much better contrast and CSNR performance compared to the LED light source and the peak contrast improvement is 8.77 times and the peak CSNR improvement is 1.87 times . The experiment results demonstrate that LFS imaging method can significantly reduce the backscatter effect caused by water and suspending particles under artificial illumination .

@highlight An optical de scattering method for turbid underwater imaging is proposed.
@highlight Underwater image quality can be improved significantly without image processing.
@highlight The de scattering performance is restricted by the sensitivity of a camera.
@highlight The method can apply to digital still cameras and video cameras.
