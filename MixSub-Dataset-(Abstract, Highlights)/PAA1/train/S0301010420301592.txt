 Molecular Dynamics simulations of water confined in carbon nanotubes subjected to external electric fields show that water mobility strongly depends on the confining geometry the intensity and directionality of the electric field . While fields forming angles of

@highlight Diffusion coefficient highly impacted by the field intensity and directionality.
@highlight Perpendicular fields can enhance water diffusion.
@highlight The applied field drives a cascade effect breaking hydrogen bonds and increasing mobility.
