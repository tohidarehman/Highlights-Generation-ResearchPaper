 To overcome the imaging speed and resolution of traditional imaging lidar we propose a spatial and temporal multiplexing array imaging lidar technique . Based on optical orthogonal code division multiple access square laser beam with 2

@highlight Spatial and temporal multiplexing array imaging lidar technique based on OCDMA is proposed.
@highlight The OCDMA imaging lidar uses only M detectors array to achieve M2
@highlight pixels.
@highlight The imaging speed and resolution could be improved ideally with a small scale detectors array.
