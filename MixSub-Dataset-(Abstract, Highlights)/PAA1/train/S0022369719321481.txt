 Lithium doped ZnO structures with sizes in the micro and nano scale and different morphologies were obtained by vaporsolid growth method . Two different precursors lithium oxide and lithium carbonate were used as the lithium source in order to study the influence on the morphology and optical properties of the obtained structures . Scanning electron microscopy cathodoluminescence photoluminescence X ray diffraction energy dispersive X ray microanalysis and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize their structure morphology composition and optical properties . Depending on the lithium content present changes in the crystalline quality and the luminescent intensity of the samples were observed . Optical resonant cavity behavior was also observed in some of the nano structures .

@highlight ZnO Li structures were obtained by a vaporsolid method.
@highlight The amount of defects produced by Li were related to the luminescence emission.
@highlight An optical resonant cavity behavior was observed in some of the nanostructures.
