 In this study we reported the preparation of polyamidoamine modified magnetite nanoparticles and their use for the immobilization of Fe salen complex to form a novel magnetic catalyst . The prepared catalyst was characterized by some modern techniques i.e . Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy thermogravimetric analysis N

@highlight A novel catalyst based on salen iron complex immobilized on dendrimer magnetite nanoparticles was synthesized.
@highlight The catalyst was applied as a recyclable catalyst for the oxidation of sulfides.
@highlight The catalyst could be recycled up to five cycles without significant decrease in catalytic activity and selectivity.
