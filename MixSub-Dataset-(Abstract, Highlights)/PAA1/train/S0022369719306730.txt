 In this work the effective field theory is used to investigate the electrocaloric effect of a ferroelectric nanocube with core shell morphology described by the transverse Ising model . We have elucidated the influences of the external electric field

@highlight The electrocaloric effect of a ferroelectric nanocube with core shell morphology is studied.
@highlight The influence of the interfacial coupling on the thermal properties of a nanocube has been examined detailed.
@highlight The electrocaloric effect depends strongly on the applied electric field.
