 The reutilization of workpiece reflected energy assisted laser machining combining nanosecond laser and the optimized optical system was developed skillfully to modify the surface of metallic materials with high laser reflectivity . The characteristics of REALM were clarified via the theoretical analysis and the 6061 Aluminum machining test . It was observed that with respect to normal laser machining the total energy utilization ratio and the processing efficiency for REALM could be significantly enhanced . Moreover the nominal ablation threshold of aluminum for REALM could be decreased . These superiorities of REALM stem from its specific regime of reuse of the laser energy scattered and reflected and thus the enhancement of the effective laser energy density and the effective utilization of absorbed energy .
