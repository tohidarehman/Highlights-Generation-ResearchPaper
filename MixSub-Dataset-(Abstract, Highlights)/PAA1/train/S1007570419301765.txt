 Since impulsive control has less conservation in the analysis of dynamical behaviors a surge of attention has been paid on the study of impulsive control systems . This paper is dedicated to review some recent developments of impulsive control theory . Some fundamental theory on impulsive control systems and some very recent interesting results are reviewed and addressed . Based on the characteristics of impulsive control systems we summarize three fundamental factors for the design of impulsive controllers namely the impulsive strength the impulsive frequency and the impulsive instant . Then a systematic account of useful stability analysis methods are introduced and these methods provide researchers a well organized tool box to learn the impulsive control systems . Moreover as a vital aspect the effects of delays on impulsive systems are discussed . Finally some potential developments and further work on impulsive control systems are briefly presented and discussed .
