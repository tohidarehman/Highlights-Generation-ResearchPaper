 Traditional nanoscale positioning measurement methods require high precision components and time consuming calibration . To address these problems this paper develops a fast and robust feature based positioning method for nanoscale positioning measurement . Firstly a unique polar microstructure surface is designed and ultra precision machined for imaging and matching . The next step uses a box filter which is computational saving to detect the initial feature points from the surface images . After that the image scale is built to extract the robust feature points . The filter size is changed in each scale layer instead of image size to further reduce the number of calculations . Then the orientation assignment process is conducted for angular displacement detection . After generating the robust feature points descriptors with 64 dimensional vectors the feature point matching is performed to determine the absolute position changes between the images . Finally sub pixel interpolation is also merged into the FRFP method to further improve the positioning resolution . To show the effectiveness of the FRFP method experiments are conducted from the aspects of angular uncertainty position uncertainty measurement speed and robustness respectively . All the experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the FRFP method .
