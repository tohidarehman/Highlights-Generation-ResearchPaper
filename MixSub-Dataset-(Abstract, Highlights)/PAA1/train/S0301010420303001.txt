 Superhydrophobic surface is one of the important strategies for the application of water and ice resistance . In this study we focused on the nano structure of hydration product itself of cement and superhydrophobic surface was created on hardened cement pastes without any additive . The surface microstructures and surface chemical composition of ordinary HCP and superhydrophobic HCP both were characterized by SEM and FTIR respectively . The results of water absorption and anti icing tests showed that the prepared S HCP had lower water permeability ice adhesion strength and ice accumulation than O HCP . Meanwhile the surface of S HCP remained superhydrophobic property after a series of mechanical performance tests and weather resistance tests which indicated that the SCM has great application potential .

@highlight Superhydrophobic surface has been constructed based on hardened cement pastes HCP .
@highlight The original composition of HCP has not been changed.
@highlight The prepared superhydrophobic HCP has superior water and ice resistance.
@highlight The superhydrophobic surface of S HCP is durable.
