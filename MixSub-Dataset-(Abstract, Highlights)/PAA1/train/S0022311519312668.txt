 The fundamental understanding of interface properties is crucial in materials design and lifetime predictions . In this work the stability adhesion and impurity induced embrittlement of interfaces between tungsten and transition metal carbides have been investigated by first principles calculations . For all the systems the coherent W TMC interfaces show better stability with lower interface energies than the semi coherent W TMC ones . The impurities hydrogen helium oxygen and nitrogen tend to segregate to the coherent interfaces and act as strong embrittlers . Furthermore the interface could provide a low barrier channel to facilitate hydrogen and helium transport . The present work provides key mechanistic insights towards interpreting recent experimental studies of the interface structure and the hydrogen isotope retention in WZrC WTiC and WTaC materials under irradiation and guides the preparation of future W based materials with good resistance to irradiation damage .

@highlight Coherent W 100 TMC 100 interfaces have better stability than the semi coherent W 110 TMC 100 ones.
@highlight The impurities H He N O S and P tend to segregate to the interface and act as strong embrittlers.
@highlight Interface provides a rapid channel to facilitate H and He transport along the interface.
@highlight W based materials with a multi scale interface structure are suggested to enhance the overall performance.
