 Grey prediction models have been widely used in various fields and disciplines . Cumulative sum operator also called accumulative generation operator is an essential step in grey modelling but until now relatively limited attention has been paid to its mechanism of action . In this paper we introduce the integral matching to explain it . By using the integral transformation the grey prediction model whose nature is modelling the cumulative sum series with a differential equation proves to be equivalent to that modelling the original series with a reduced differential equation . The cumulative sum operator is the discretization and approximation of the definite integral terms by using the piecewise constant integral and thus can be improved by using the piecewise linear integral . Simulation studies detail the advantages in terms of the stability and robustness to noise .

@highlight We investigate the mechanism of cumulative sum operator in grey prediction model by using integral transformation.
@highlight We provide a novel paradigm for estimating the structural parameters and the initial value simultaneously.
@highlight We analyze the influence of sample size and noise level on modelling performance by using large scale simulation studies.
