 Owing to their good mechanical properties titanium based alloys are used for machine parts and devices that operate in demanding regimes and environmental conditions . Laser shock peening is an innovative technique for improvement of the surface and mechanical characteristics of the material . In this paper LSP is employed for additional improvement of already good characteristics of Ti alloy . Laser shock peening is performed on alloy surface with and without protective and transparent layer and obtained microstructure surface characteristics and mechanical properties are compared . LSP improved the surface topology and microhardness of material producing overall better results when the Ti alloy surface was coated by transparent and protective layer .

@highlight A high potential of LSP to improve surface and mechanical characteristics.
@highlight Laser interaction increases the surface parameters and average roughness increased.
@highlight Surface topology better results with the use of transparent and protective layer.
@highlight Interaction of laser beam increases the microhardness in all case.
