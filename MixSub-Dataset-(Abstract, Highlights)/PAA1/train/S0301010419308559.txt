 It is important to study the diffusion of acids because acids can accelerate the aging of oil paper insulation systems . In the paper the diffusion of acids is weakened by adding nano SiO

@highlight Nano SiO
@highlight increases the acids in oil for an oil paper insulating systems.
@highlight The diffusion of acids was explored by molecular dynamics.
@highlight The addition of nano SiO
@highlight increases the adsorption energy of oil to acids.
@highlight Acids can be adsorbed on hydroxylated nano SiO
@highlight in the form of hydrogen bond.
