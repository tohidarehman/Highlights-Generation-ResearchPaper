 In this paper a super multi view display based on a diffractive optical element with pixelated nanogratings is proposed to solve the vergence accommodation conflict in three dimensional displays . The diffractive optical element can modulate the phase information of a three dimensional scene to form a series of viewing points under the illumination of a point light source . By designing the vector of each nanograting in the diffractive optical element the viewing points with a pitch of less than the pupil diameter of the human eye can be formed for providing the super multi view display and smooth motion parallax . By combining a 6 inch 25 view diffractive optical element with a binary masking patterns we experimentally demonstrated that the proposed super multi view display can present three dimensional images with correct depth cues and smooth motion parallax which enables three dimensional perception free of the vergence accommodation conflict and visual fatigue problems . The proposed super multi view display system shows great potential for applications like mobile electronics and see through head mounted displays .
