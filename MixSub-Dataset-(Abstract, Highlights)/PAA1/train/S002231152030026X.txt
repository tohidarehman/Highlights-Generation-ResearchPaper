 The sol gel route via internal gelation was applied for the production of Nd and Ce doped uranium dioxide microspheres . Trivalent and tetravalent Ce precursors were used and the influence of the precursors oxidation state on the fabrication process and the final product was studied . The successful introduction of the dopant into the 3UO
