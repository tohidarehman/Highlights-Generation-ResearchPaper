 Thermospheric mass density estimates from in situ observations along satellite orbits are difficult to validate due to their inherent spatiotemporal sparse nature and difficulties related to drag force modeling and estimation of actual mass density state . Current upper atmospheric models are unable to accurately represent the actual thermospheric variability and in situ observations are far to fulfill the minimum requirements in practical applications . In this manuscript the new Thermospheric Mass Density Model is based on the fit of solar flux annual Local Solar Time and magnetospheric proxies into the Principal Component Analysis of 13 years of accelerometer based mass density estimates derived from the GRACE mission . We employ the NRLMSISE 00 model and estimates from APOD Swarm C and GRACE satellites and assess the new model including statistical analyses and a Precise Orbit Determination scheme . We compare 2 years of APOD and Swarm C estimates and study the dynamic orbit propagation of the 3 missions under different mass density input schemes and different magnetospheric activity conditions . The results with TMDM show similar differences in the dynamically propagated orbits from NRLMSISE 00 and in situ observations . The statistical analyses show that NRLMSISE 00 overestimates about 20 and TMDM underestimates about 20 the in situ observations .

@highlight A new Thermospheric Mass Density Model is presented and assessed by NRLMSISE 00 model GRACE Swarm C and APOD observations.
@highlight The performance of TMDM is assessed in a dynamic orbital propagation analysis with similar deviations than that of NRLMSISE 00 and in situ estimates.
@highlight The statistical analysis shows that NRLMSISE 00 overestimates about 20 and TMDM underestimates about 20 the in situ observations.
