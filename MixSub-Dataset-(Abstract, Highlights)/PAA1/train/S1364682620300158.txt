 We report observations of auroral spots s at sub auroral latitudes . The auroral spots occurred during storm recovery phases and corotated with the Earth at a speed either higher or lower than the Earth s rotation rate . In the dawn side the spots have a slightly higher probability of super rotation than that of the duskside auroral spots . The super and sub rotation is likely due to dynamics of the plasmasphere that is controlled by both drag and solar wind driven plasma convection .

@highlight Ring current auroral spots at sub auroral latitudes corotate with the Earth.
@highlight The corotation can be slower or faster than Earth s rotation rate and depends on local time.
@highlight Plasmaspheric dynamics structures drag and solar wind driven convection is likely the source of above phenomena.
