 The change in optical properties on exposure to radiation has been studied for polyvinyl alcohol 2 3 5 triphenyl tetrazolium chloride salt dyed films . The comparative results between the two different dyes namely methyl orange and di methyl yellow have been studied for the change in color for the application of dosimeter . The film samples exposed at different doses from 0 to 30kGy by exposing gamma rays using

@highlight Development of polymeric film dosimeter.
@highlight Comparison between two dosimeters with two different dyes.
@highlight Color enhancement observed due to triphenyl tetrazolium salts.
@highlight Color change appeared for methyl orange and di methyl yellow dyed films as yellow to red and greenish yellow to red respectively.
@highlight The film dosimeters are suitable for the dose range of 030kGy gamma irradiation.
