 This study proposes and demonstrates a compact synthetic aperture digital holographic microscope with mechanical movement free beam scanning and optimized active aberration compensation . The SA DHM system is equipped with a phase only liquid crystal on silicon device as an active optical element to achieve a compact mechanical movement free beam steering architecture with aberration correction . A rigorous optimization is conducted to modulate the LCoS device using the designed computer generated holograms to generate a high quality point spread functions for a wide range of scanning angles . An accurate aberration correction is studied with and without oil immersed conditions on microscope objective lens . The performance of the proposed method is analyzed with Siemens star target and the results show its potential capability to achieve isotropic resolution enhancement .
