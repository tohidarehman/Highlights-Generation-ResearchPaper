 This paper studies the leader following bounded consensus problem for multi agent systems in the present of denial of service attacks by means of event triggered control strategy . Due to the existence of DoS attacks the original system is transformed into a switched system with both stable and unstable modes . Moreover DoS attacks can be characterized by frequency and duration constraints under which the bounded consensus can be still guaranteed . It is shown that the duration constraint can be replaced by choosing appropriate mode dependent average dwell time for each subsystem . In order to obtain a smaller consensus bound and feedback gain matrices simultaneously an optimization approach is proposed . In addition the Zeno behavior that may be introduced by event triggered control is excluded . Finally a numerical example is provided to illustrate the bounded consensus can be still achieved under the co designed event triggered control strategy despite the presence of DoS attacks .

@highlight A novel explicit characterization of the frequency and duration properties of DoS attacks is proposed.
@highlight The bounded consensus of leader following systems can be still achieved in the presence of DoS attacks.
@highlight The system under event triggered control does not exhibit Zeno behavior by utilizing the new proposed method.
