 Nonlinear mesoscopic materials exhibit anomalous elastic nonlinearity in which fast and slow dynamics effects are mixed up . The former is an instantaneous nonlinear phenomenon due to the explicit strain dependence of velocity and damping . Slow dynamics is a non equilibrium effect governed by the dependence of the linear modulus and Q factor on the dynamic strain level when excited at constant strain the sample properties vary in time until they reach a new equilibrium state . When excitation is removed again slowly in time the system recovers its original viscoelastic properties . The goal of this contribution is to show how slow dynamics might affect fast dynamics measurements and thus point out that care should be given to all time scales of the experiment e.g . lag time between amplitude change and acquisition duration of the acquisition and relaxation time between successive measurements .

@highlight The different power law dependences of nonlinear indicators observed when slow dynamic effects are removed from the measurement using specific measurement protocols.
@highlight The dependence of the nonlinearity strength on the measurement time. The longer is the acquisition time the stronger is the cumulative effect of self conditioning with a consequent overestimation of the nonlinearity.
@highlight The dependence of the amount of hysteresis given by the area of the loops observed for the dependence of the nonlinear indicator vs. amplitude in increasing decreasing amplitude protocols on the time scale of the experiment.
