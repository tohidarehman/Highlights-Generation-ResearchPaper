 This paper investigates the robust stability of fractional order systems described in pseudo state space model with incommensurate fractional orders . An existing non conservative robust stability criterion for integer order systems is extended to incommensurate order fractional systems by using the generalized Nyquist Theorem . Some robust stability conditions for various uncertainty structures are proposed by employing the proposed criterion . Moreover we focus on the interval uncertainty structure to discuss the conservatism of the common methods . A numerical example is provided to investigate that how the fractional order of each pseudo state can affect the robustness of the system . The effectiveness of the proposed methods is compared by applying them on the problem of space tether deployment with fractional order control law .

@highlight A robust stability condition for incommensurate pseudo state space model is proposed.
@highlight For some well known uncertainty structures some stability conditions are proposed.
@highlight These conditions can be employed for different order systems without defining the additional pseudo state variables.
@highlight The method for interval uncertainties does not lead to conservatism generated by reformulation of the interval uncertainty.
@highlight Investiganing a numerical example leads to unexpected results about the robustness of fractional order systems.
