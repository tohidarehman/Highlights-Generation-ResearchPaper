 In this paper a general method to establish the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to multi order multiple time varying delays nonlinear systems is proposed . The method relying on vector Lyapunov like functions and on comparison arguments reduces the asymptotic stability problem to verify a Hurwitz property on a suitable matrix . Many results in integer order systems can be easily generalized to multi order systems since the obtained conditions are order independent . The latter fact is exploited to obtain robust results when the derivation order is uncertain . To establish the method robust multi order multiple time varying delays linear positive systems are studied generalizing previous results existing in the literature . Two illustrative examples are presented the main one providing conditions for asymptotic stability of a multi agent multi order system with time varying delay .

@highlight A simple method to establish the asymptotic stability and the robustness of solutions to multi order multiple time varying delays nonlinear systems is proposed.
@highlight In order to establish the method the asymptotic stability and the robustness properties of multiple order multiple time varying delays positive linear systems are analysed.
@highlight Two illustrative examples are provided. The first one shows the control of a multi order nonlinear system without delays and the second one posits conditions for asymptotic stability and robustness of a multi agent multi order system with time varying delays.
