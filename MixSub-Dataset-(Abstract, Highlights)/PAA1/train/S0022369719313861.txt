 The uptake of pollutant gases from the environment is an important topic in nanomaterial science . Although this issue has been extensively studied from all aspects there is still a need for efficient adsorbent substrates . As carbon based materials are reliable for removal of gas molecules we studied the capacity of the recently predicted monolayer of

@highlight Semiconductor monolayer
@highlight CO becomes metallic under adsorption of a Ni adatom.
@highlight S dissociation on Ni doped Pmma CO is favored.
