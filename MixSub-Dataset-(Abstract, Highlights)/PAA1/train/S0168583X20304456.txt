 The aim of this study was to investigate the use of a PADC polymer film in dosimetric applications for UV radiation . Optical properties and optical constants have been characterized by means of UV Vis spectrophotometry . Two modes of combined treatment were applied a sequence of UV and thermal annealing and vice versa as well as a separated treatment involving UV exposure only . The final results proved to be highly dependent on the order of the combined treatments . The absorption edges refractive indices attenuation coefficients and optical conductivities proved to be highly affected by increasing the exposure dose up to 4.458kJ cm

@highlight UVC and thermal annealing treatments combined for CR 39 were investigated.
@highlight The transmittance optical constants and optical conductivity were studied.
@highlight UVC and thermal combined mode decrease the transmittance compared to the others.
@highlight The transmittance for UVC radiation does alter with the order of treatments.
@highlight Dosimetric uses of CR 39 have shown excellent potential for UVC dose estimation.
