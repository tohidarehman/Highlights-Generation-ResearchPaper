 Primary radiation damage featuring rapid atomic collisions and thermal spikes constitutes the foundation of a high fidelity description of radiation assisted microstructure evolution . To systematically describe the primary damage in the mixed fuel oxide systems

@highlight A holistic functional form is developed to quantify the defect production.
@highlight Defect size distribution is generalized with an exponential truncated power law.
@highlight Vacancy clusters approach being charge balanced.
