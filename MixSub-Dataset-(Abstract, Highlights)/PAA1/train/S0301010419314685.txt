 Single atom catalysis is the ultimate approach in catalysis science which implies the utilization of a catalyst is as efficient as it gets .

@highlight Every F center on MgO surface possesses a diffuse electride orbital.
@highlight Such structures with periodic defects on the surface are thermodynamically stable.
@highlight Such periodicity extensively increasers the catalytic activity of the material.
@highlight Diffuse electron pairs inside every defect induces noticeable non linear properties.
