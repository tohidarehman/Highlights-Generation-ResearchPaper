 Recently a novel bifurcation technique known as deflated continuation was applied to the single component nonlinear Schrdinger equation with a parabolic trap in two spatial dimensions . This bifurcation analysis revealed previously unknown solutions shedding light on this fundamental problem in the physics of ultracold atoms . In the present work we take this a step further by applying deflated continuation to two coupled NLS equations which feature a considerably more complex landscape of solutions . Upon identifying branches of solutions we construct the relevant bifurcation diagrams and perform spectral stability analysis to identify parametric regimes of stability and instability and to understand the mechanisms by which these branches emerge . The method reveals a remarkable wealth of solutions . These include both well known states arising from the Cartesian and polar small amplitude limits of the underlying linear problem but also a significant number of more complex states that arise through bifurcations .

@highlight A two component two dimensional nonlinear Schrdinger system with a parabolic potential is considered.
@highlight Deflated continuation method is applied to the above system and the deflated operator is adjusted to eliminate rotations of solutions.
@highlight Branches of solutions are obtained which some of them are found in the literature but others correspond to previously unknown ones.
@highlight Linear stability analysis is performed by using state of the art eigenvalue solvers.
@highlight A cartography of possible solutions is presented.
