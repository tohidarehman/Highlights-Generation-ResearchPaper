 This paper presents a numerical model developed to reproduce the behaviour of French simplified Bituminized Waste Products during a leaching test . The model is calibrated on experimental data sets . BWP were mainly produced during industrial reprocessing of nuclear spent fuel and are classified as low or intermediate activity long lived radioactive waste . Geological disposal is the reference solution for intermediate level long lived BWP . Under geological disposal facility conditions and after a long period of time BWP will undergo water re saturation from the host rock . A chemo hydro mechanical numerical model has been implemented with a finite element scheme to model BWP behaviour under such conditions . The constitutive model takes into account the impact of dissolution permeation diffusion and osmosis . Original evolution laws of diffusion coefficient and permeability as a function of the porosity are proposed . Specific mechanical model is proposed including Mori Tanaka homogenization law . To simulate the hydration of the material an original and simple method is proposed avoiding costly two phase flow resolution and complex calibration of the related parameters . This model was mainly used to reproduce the evolution of the amount of both water absorbed and salt leached by the sample during unconfined water up taking tests . The calibration is based on experimental data obtained on French simplified BWP containing one highly soluble salt . Water uptake could generate swelling mainly due to osmosis .

@highlight Main indicators studied are the amount of salt leached water absorbed and the swelling.
@highlight The trends in indicators are reproduced by a Chemo Hydro Mechanical numerical model.
