 This study aimed to develop a highly efficient Ru catalyst using mixed oxide support of lanthanides and MgO . Mixed oxide support of Er

@highlight Mix oxide MgOEr
@highlight supported Ru catalysts were applied to ammonia synthesis.
@highlight Mix oxide MgOEr
@highlight supports were prepared by co precipitation method.
@highlight Ru MgOEr
@highlight catalysts showed efficient ammonia synthesis activity.
@highlight Catalytic activity was highly dependent on the textural properties of Ru MgOEr
