 We propose a novel method for spectroscopic optical coherence tomography . This method uses the dependence of the Doppler frequency spectrum on the wavenumber . Controlled modulation of the light in the spectral OCT interferometer allows for an instantaneous depth resolved reconstruction of the backscattered light spectrum from all depths . The feasibility of the spectroscopic analysis using the proposed scheme was confirmed experimentally .

@highlight Optical coherence tomography OCT allows for 3D imaging of living tissue.
@highlight OCT can be modified to provide spectroscopic information sOCT spectroscopic OCT .
@highlight Spectral and time domain optical coherence spectroscopy is a new sOCT technique.
@highlight STdOCS can be regarded as a bridge between OCT and Fourier transform spectroscopy.
