 For the first time we built green phosphorene nanotube to explore the interaction behavior of aforementioned tear gases on base material surface using the density functional theory method . The G PNT possesses a semiconductor nature with a band gap value of 0.735eV . Importantly various preferential adsorption sites of adamsite and chloropicrin on G PNT were explored with the influence of most suitable parameters namely adsorption energy average band gap changes and Bader charge transfer . The electronic characteristics of G PNT are studied by band structure and projected density of state maps using GGA B86LYP exchange correlation functional . While the target tear gases interact with G PNT the adsorption energy of the proposed complex structures is noticed to be 0.042 to 0.414eV . The unique aspects of the present research study advocate that G PNT can be utilized as an effective sensing material for sensing tear gases .
