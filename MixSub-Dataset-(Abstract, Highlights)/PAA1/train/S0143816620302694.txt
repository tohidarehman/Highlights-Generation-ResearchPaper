 A 316L stainless steel plate was fabricated by selective laser melting in a vacuum . SS316L has excellent properties such as a high corrosion resistance and hardness but forming complicated structures is challenging due to difficulties working the material . Although SLM can fabricate complicated shapes because it builds a 3D material layer by layer from a powder some issues have yet to be resolved including dimensional accuracy surface finishes surface roughness processing time and mechanical properties such as hardness . Another issue is irradiating a metal powder by a laser generates spattering . Spattering results in an insufficient input energy to the powder bed because the laser is absorbed by the spatter particles . Consequently technology to suppress the amount of spatter for SLM processes is needed . In this study to clarify the mechanism of the spatter free process SS316L is fabricated by SLM and the powder behavior during laser irradiation is observed by a high speed video camera . The amount of spatter depends on the input energy of the laser . At a laser fluence of 20kJ cm

@highlight A 316L stainless steel plate was fabricated by SLM in a vacuum.
@highlight To clarify the mechanism of the spatter free process the 316L stainless steel was fabricated by SLM. A high speed video camera was used to observe the behavior of the powder during laser irradiation.
@highlight The amount of spatter depends on the input energy of the laser. At a laser fluence of 20kJ cm
@highlight  the amount of spatter is minimized and the surface roughness on the fabricated sample improves from 30m to 3.5m.
@highlight The hardness of the fabricated plates irradiated with a laser fluence of 20000J cm
@highlight  laser power 200W scanning speed 10mm s hatching distance 25m is observed from 187 to 251HV which is higher than that of a typical Ti64 plate.
