 In this study based on density functional theory calculations we investigated the stable configurations electronic structures and magnetic properties of metal and non metal atom modified graphene substrates . The single atom metal embedded divacancy graphene exhibited high stability and the 555 777 graphene Fe system had a larger magnetic moment than the Ni doped system . The adsorption of NO on 555 777 graphene Fe was more stable than that of the HCN NH

@highlight The 555 777 graphene Fe system had larger magnetic moment than other systems.
@highlight NO molecule adsorbed on 555 777 graphene M sheets was most stable.
@highlight Gas molecules more stable on 3Si graphene M than 555 777 graphene M.
@highlight Gas adsorption regulated electronic and magnetic properties of 3NM graphene M.
