 Two dimensional CuO ZnO hybrid nanostructures were prepared by using a simple chemical approach and thoroughly investigated by FESEM X ray photoelectron spectroscopy HRTEM UVVis absorption spectroscopy and X ray diffraction . The photocatalytic decomposition of organic dyes was evaluated using the prepared 2D CuO ZnO hybrid nanostructures as photocatalysts under sunlight irradiation . Photocatalytic degradation assisted by 2D CuO ZnO nanohybrids showed remarkably improved efficiency than pristine nanosheets of CuO and completely decolorized MB and MO dyes in just 20min . Photocatalytic degradation of toxic 4 nitrophenol was also investigated in the presence of prepared nanostructures and 2D CuO ZnO nanohybrids illustrated better activity over pristine CuO nanosheets . The observed superior photocatalytic performance of 2D CuO ZnO nanohybrids is ascribed to the inhibited charge carrier recombination and improved light utilization because of formation of p n nanoheterojunctions of CuO and ZnO . A possible mechanism and role of radicals participating in photocatalytic degradation of dyes were also proposed .
