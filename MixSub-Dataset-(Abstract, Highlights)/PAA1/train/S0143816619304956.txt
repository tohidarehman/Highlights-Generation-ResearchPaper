 We propose a new moment actuator for correcting low order aberrations of deformable mirrors in high power laser applications . The aberrations of a large thin faceplate are caused by the residual stress after fabrication thermal soak temperature gradient actuator s hysteresis and creep and so forth . Flattening procedure is always required to compensate for the DM s low order aberrations before adaptive optics operation and it necessarily reduces the remaining stroke of the actuator . In this paper we present 16 bending moment actuator added at the baseplate for independent correction of the DM s low order aberration and therefore exploit the full dynamic range of the inherent actuators for high order compensation . The arrangement of the moment actuator is optimized by using a new theoretical influence function . We propose a coupling coefficient for the moment actuator which is the first to our knowledge when calculating the weighted IF with a closed form equation and show the improved correlations with experiments . We verify the experimental performance of the bending moment actuator with our in house DM having a 200 mm silicon carbide faceplate developed for HPLs . The moment actuator can be used as a plug and play kit for additional tuning of most DMs and can be applied for combined DMs having the woofer tweeter in a single body active mirror mounts for high precision lithographic optics to name a few .
