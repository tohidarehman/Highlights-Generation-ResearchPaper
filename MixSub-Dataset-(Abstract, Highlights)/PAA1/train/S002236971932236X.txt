 Photocatalysis is a well established and green technique in environmental pollutant remediation . In the present study a novel and green red phosphorus hollow hydroxyapatite microsphere photocatalyst was fabricated and applied forthe degradation of rifampicin tetracycline and levofloxacin . The as prepared material exhibits outstanding photocatalytic activity and stability and has universal application for degradation of each antibiotic . Notably tetracycline rifampicin andlevofloxacin can be completely degraded within 10min 20min and 50min respectively under a 300W Xe lamp with full spectrum illumination where the optimal conditions were an initial pH of 6.0 and a photocatalyst dosage of 1.0g L. In addition a plausible photocatalytic reaction mechanism was proposed . The low cost highly efficient and green red phosphorus hollow hydroxyapatite microsphere photocatalyst is a promising candidate for the removal of many hazardous pollutants .
