 Transport in Hamiltonian systems with weak chaotic perturbations has been much studied in the past . In this paper we introduce a new class of problems transport in Hamiltonian systems with slowly changing phase space structure that are not order one perturbations of a given Hamiltonian . This class of problems is very important for many applications for instance in celestial mechanics . As an example we study a class of one dimensional Hamiltonians that depend explicitly on time and on stochastic external parameters . The variations of the external parameters are responsible for a distortion of the phase space structures chaotic weakly chaotic and regular sets change with time . We show that theoretical predictions of transport rates can be made in the limit where the variations of the stochastic parameters are very slow compared to the Hamiltonian dynamics . Exact asymptotic results can be obtained in the one dimensional case where the Hamiltonian dynamics is integrable for fixed values of the parameters . For the more interesting chaotic Hamiltonian dynamics case we show that two mechanisms contribute to the transport . For some range of the parameter variations one mechanism called transport by migration with the mixing regions is dominant . We are then able to model transport in phase space by a Markov model the local diffusion model and to give reasonably good transport estimates .

@highlight Transport in Hamiltonian systems with slow stochastic parameters is the result of two different mechanisms which we characterize.
@highlight We provide an asymptotically exact stochastic equation for long term transport of action variables when the Hamiltonian is integrable.
@highlight When the Hamiltonian is chaotic we show using averaging that long term transport is equivalent to a simple Markov process.
