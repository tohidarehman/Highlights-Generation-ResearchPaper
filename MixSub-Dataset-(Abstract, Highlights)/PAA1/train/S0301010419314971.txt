 The present work aims to investigate the crystallization behavior of VS55 in the presence of graphene oxide by Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Cryomicroscopy system . The DSC results show that the higher GO concentration increase crystallization enthalpy H

@highlight GO increases crystallization enthalpy H
@highlight for low concentration VS55 but has little effects on high concentration VS55.
@highlight The recrystallization enthalpy H
@highlight of VS55 GO decreased with increasing cooling warming rates and concentrations of GO.
@highlight Crystal growth was inhibited more significantly at low concentrations VS55 with high concentrations of GO.
@highlight For 8.4M VS55 the inhibition of devitrification is better when increasing cooling rates and GO concentration.
