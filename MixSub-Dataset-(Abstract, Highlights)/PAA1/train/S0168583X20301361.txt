 Au Ag alloy nanoparticles were formed into amorphous silicon by sequential ion implantation of Au and Ag . Monocrystalline Si was amorphized at the initial moment of implantation with 110

@highlight Si substrate was implanted sequentially with Au and Ag ions at different fluences.
@highlight Nanoparticles were found at maximum distribution depths of Au and Ag ions.
@highlight Ag nanoparticles aggregate in the silicon matrix along with the dissolved Au atoms.
@highlight The size of formed nanoparticles was controlled by varying Ag ion fluence.
@highlight HAADF contrast imaging was used to confirm the formation of Au Ag alloy structure.
