 The helium to vacancy ratio is a key factor related to the helium bubble hardening mechanisms induced by neutron irradiation in ferritic martensitic steels as advanced nuclear structural materials . According to the helium bubble hardening results in F M steel irradiated in the spallation neutron source the interactions between a 1 2 111 110 edge dislocation and helium bubbles with various sizes of 0.73.0nm in bcc Fe under irradiation temperatures and room temperature was investigated by using molecular dynamics simulation . The effect of various He V ratios in the ranges of zero to the highest He V ratios 1.854.0 of stable helium bubbles with no dislocation loop emission on the interaction mechanisms was analyzed . The results indicated that the critical resolved shear stress drops rapidly to a very low stress level and immediately bottoms out and rebounds to a very high stress level when the He V ratio increases from 1.0 to the highest He V ratio . The significant change of CRSS values is not only related to the climbing degree of dislocation after releasing but also related to the moment when the climb appears . A new repulsion mechanism of interaction between dislocation and bubble was proposed to elucidate the abnormal phenomena of the bottoming rebound of CRSS with a great climbing degree according to the repelling interaction between helium bubble and superjog of dislocation with both strong compressive stress field .

@highlight The CRSS rapidly bottoms out and rebounds to a very high stress level when the He V ratio increases above 1.0.
@highlight The significant change of CRSS values is not only related to the climbing degree of dislocation but also the moment when the climb appears.
