 The current study aims to investigate the influence of high energy milling of nano silica and magnesium on the products of reduction reaction induced by such mechano chemical route . Collision energy driven by ball milling was calculated to enable the surveying of the level of energy on the obtained nano silicon at the room temperature and in the argon atmosphere . The phase composition analysis was conducted by the Rietveld method . Silicon products of above 97 purity were obtained in a mechanochemically synthesized system . Morphologically this route results in a mesoporous silicon nanoparticle with surface area 134.01m
