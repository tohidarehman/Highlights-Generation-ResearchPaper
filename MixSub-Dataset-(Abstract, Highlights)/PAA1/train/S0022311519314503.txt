 Titanium is being considered as a candidate material for high level nuclear waste container due to its superior corrosion resistance . However problems may arise when titanium comes in contact with hydrogen bearing environments as it is vulnerable to hydrogen embrittlement . To assess the lifetime of titanium container hydrogen content and hydrogen permeation efficiency were estimated in infiltrated water through bentonite prepared with simulated groundwater of Beishan the preselected area in China by electrochemical and metallurgical analysis . It is concluded that the absorbed hydrogen due to general corrosion will not be sufficient for hydrogen embrittlement to occur in titanium for at least 10 000 years after deep geological disposal . This represents more than 300 and 5 000 half lives of Cs137 and Cs134 respectively cesium being the most likely element to escape a repository due to its high solubility in groundwaters .

@highlight Hydrogen contents of titanium in deep geological disposal conditions were estimated.
@highlight Effect of hydrogen distributions on hydrogen embrittlement HE was studied.
@highlight The susceptibility of titanium container to HE was estimated over a disposal period of 10 000 years.
