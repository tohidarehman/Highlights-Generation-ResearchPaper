 The basic optical thermally stimulated luminescence and optically stimulated luminescence properties of Tl doped RbBr transparent ceramics synthesized by the spark plasma sintering were investigated . All the samples were transparent in the visible range . As the photoluminescence TSL and OSL spectra two emission bands around 380 and 520nm were observed in all the prepared samples . The emissions around 380 and 520nm would be attributed to the

@highlight As the PL TSL and OSL spectra two emission bands around 370 and 520nm were observed.
@highlight A linear response to the irradiation dose was confirmed in the range of 1mGy to 1000mGy.
@highlight In the Tl doped RbBr transparent ceramics the optimal concentration of Tl for OSL properties was determined to be 1.0 .
@highlight Using the OSL of Tl doped RbBr transparent ceramic we have successfully obtained X ray image of the operational amplifier.
