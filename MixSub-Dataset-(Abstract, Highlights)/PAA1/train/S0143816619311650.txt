 The moisture diffusion process in balsa wood was monitored using the terahertz time domain spectroscopy technique . The reflective THz signals were measured during the drying and the absorption phase of the moisture in the balsa wood . Measurements were conducted along the direction of the wood grain and perpendicular to the direction of the wood grain . From the results the relationship between the pulse intensity of the THz signal and moisture content was quantitatively investigated . Further an image of the moisture concentration gradient was constructed through the THz intensity analysis . From the study it was possible to monitor the variation of diffusion coefficient depending on the moisture content gradient from the THz measurement . Moreover using the measured concentration gradient the moisture diffusion coefficient could be derived regardless of complicated boundary conditions of diffusion . Consequently the degree of moisture diffusion can be successfully measured using the THz TDS technique . This can then be utilized for the determination of the moisture diffusion coefficient in various industrial structures .
