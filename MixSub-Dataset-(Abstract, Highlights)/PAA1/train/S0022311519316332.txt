 This paper describes molecular dynamics simulations of fracture along a grain boundary in nickel decorated with helium filled bubbles . We find that the quantity governing embrittlement of the GB is its areal coverage by He bubbles . Indeed there is a threshold coverageapproximately 18 for the GB studied hereabove which the GB undergoes brittle fracture . During brittle fracture intergranular cracks advance by the growth and coalescence of He filled cavities ahead of the crack front . This process is enabled by plastic deformation of inter bubble ligaments . In models with lower He bubble coverage dislocation activity initiates in the adjoining grains prior to cavity growth and coalescence relaxing crack tip stresses and averting brittle crack propagation . We conclude that the ductile to brittle transition observed in this study is governed by a competition between dislocation emission ahead of the crack tip and localized deformation confined to the inter cavity ligaments .

@highlight Molecular dynamics simulations of fracture along a grain boundary in nickel decorated with He bubbles is performed.
@highlight When the fraction of boundary area covered by He bubbles exceeds approximately 18 the GB undergoes brittle fracture.
@highlight During brittle fracture intergranular cracks advance by the growth and coalescence of He bubbles ahead of the crack front.
