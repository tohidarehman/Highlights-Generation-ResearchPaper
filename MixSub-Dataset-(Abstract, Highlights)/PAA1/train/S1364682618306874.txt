 A systematic investigation and greater understanding of the precipitation chemistry with respect to the altitude gradient in mountainous areas is necessary to promulgate the detrimental consequences of pollution on various ecosystems . Studies on the chemical compositions of wet precipitation were performed on the northern slopes of Mt . Taibai Qinling Mountains one of the highest mountains in East China from different lateral monitoring stations over the period from 2011 to 2014 . All samples were analyzed for major ions SO

@highlight Aims to assess altitudescale variation of precipitation chemistry in the Mt. Taibai.
@highlight Ions concentrationaltitude gradient for the precipitation is found to be 6.58 and 34.04 eq L
@highlight  100 m during monsoon and non monsoon period respectively.
@highlight Ionic concentrations showed a negative logarithmically decreasing trend with increasing altitude.
