 Cyclopentadithiophene and benzothiadiazole derivatives have promising characteristics for use in organic solar cells . In this study we theoretically investigated two donoracceptor copolymers comprising 2 thiadiazol 4 yl 4H cyclopentadithiophen 4 one and 2 thiadiazol 4 yl 4H cyclopentadithiophen 4 ylidene malononitrile with alternating donoracceptor building units . Different copolymer chain lengths were extended to investigate their structural electronic and photo physical properties based on density functional theory calculations . The copolymers exhibited high planarity reduced band gap energies and broad absorption in the visible range and thus they may enhance the performance of organic solar cells . The transition density matrix plots were simulated for the copolymers and used to evaluate holeelectron localization interactions donoracceptor interactions and the electronic excitation processes in their excited states . The charge transfer properties fill factors and open circuit voltages were estimated . Based on our simulations we found that the trimer was the most suitable conformation among the copolymers for designing high performance bulk heterojunction solar cells . The power conversion efficiency of the BHJ based blended copolymers PCBM was estimated as 9.5 . Thus the appropriate design of conjugated materials could considerably enhance the donor properties to further improve the performance of BHJ solar cells .
