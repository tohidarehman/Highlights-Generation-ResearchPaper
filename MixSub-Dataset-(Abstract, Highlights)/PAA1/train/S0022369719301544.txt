 In this study we investigated the electronic structure of halide perovskite titania interfaces using first principle methods . Based on the different possible terminations of methylammonium PbI

@highlight Interlayer composition and band alignment linked in perovskite titania interfaces.
@highlight PbI terminated perovskite titania interface more stable than MAI titania.
@highlight PbI titania interface level alignment better than that for MAI titania.
@highlight Proton induced downshift of conduction band for TiO
@highlight affects band alignment.
