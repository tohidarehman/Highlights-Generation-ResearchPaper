 We report a novel carbon morphology that we name carbon nanopears using chemical vapor deposition in the presence of silicon wafer as a substrate coating Ni catalyst thiophene as the growth promoter and benzene as carbon source . The carbon nanopears observed under optimized experimental conditions have nanometer sized sharp tips nanometer sized roots and solid interiors . The carbon nanopears are composed of graphitized carbon and amorphous carbon with continuous shortening of the length of graphitic sheets from the exterior to interior making them pear shaped . Furthermore a probable CNP formation mechanism is proposed in this paper .
