 Graphane is a quasi two dimensional material consisting of a single layer of fully hydrogenated graphene with a C H ratio of 1 . We study nuclear quantum effects in the so called chair graphane by using path integral molecular dynamics simulations . The interatomic interactions are modeled by a tight binding potential model fitted to density functional calculations . Finite temperature properties are studied in the range from 50 to 1500K . To assess the magnitude of nuclear quantum effects in the properties of graphane classical molecular dynamics simulations have been also performed . These quantum effects are significant in structural properties such as interatomic distances and layer area at finite temperatures . The in plane compressibility of graphane is found to be about twice larger than that of graphene and at low temperature it is 9 higher than the classical calculation . The thermal expansion coefficient resulting from PIMD simulations vanishes in the zero temperature limit in agreement with the third law of Thermodynamics .

@highlight Quantum effects are noticeable for various magnitudes up to room temperature.
@highlight The in plane area shows marked differences with respect to the classical expectancy.
@highlight The compressibility increases by a 9 as compared with a classical calculation.
