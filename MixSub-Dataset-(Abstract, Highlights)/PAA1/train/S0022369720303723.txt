 This paper presents a simple expression for tunneling diameter between neighboring carbon nanotubes in polymer CNT nanocomposites . Two developed models for conductivity of PCNT assuming interphase tunneling effect the fraction of networks and the whole resistance of components are linked to suggest the tunneling diameter by CNT interphase and tunneling properties . The suggested equation expresses the variation of tunneling diameter at different filler concentrations for some samples . In addition the suggested equation is applied to predict and justify the tunneling diameter at various levels of all factors . The tunneling diameter increases by the addition of filler concentration in the samples . In addition thick CNT poor percolation onset dense interphase high net fraction high CNT conductivity and short tunneling distance expand the tunneling diameter . This study can help the researchers to enlarge the tunneling diameter providing the most desirable conductivity in nanocomposites .
