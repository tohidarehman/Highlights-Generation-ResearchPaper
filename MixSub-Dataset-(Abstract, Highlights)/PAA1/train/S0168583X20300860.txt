 The Ag K and Ag K fluorescence lines induced by Rh X ray tube have been observed . The Ag K K intensity ratios for pure Ag and for Ag Cu alloys have been obtained . The results have been compared with multi configuration Dirac Hartree Fock predictions and available experimental values . Strong dependence between measured K

@highlight The Ag K K intensity ratios for pure Ag and for Ag Cu alloys have been measured.
@highlight The alloying effect on the K K of silver in Ag Cu binary alloys have been observed.
@highlight The K K intensity ratios decrease with increasing of Ag content.
@highlight The obtained results may be important in archaeometric research.
