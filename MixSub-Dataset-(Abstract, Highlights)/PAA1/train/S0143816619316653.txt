 In this study the dynamic behaviors of metal vapor plasma keyhole and weld pool during activating laser welding of stainless steel thick plates are monitored in real time by employing a novel sandwich method in combination with a high speed camera system . Meanwhile the welding quality of specimens is inspected and analyzed from the aspects like joint weld formation mechanical properties microstructure and element distribution . The effects of Cr

@highlight The dynamic behaviors of metal vapor plasma keyhole and weld pool during activating laser welding of stainless steel thick plates were researched.
@highlight The effects of Cr
@highlight active agent on the stability during welding process and the quality of welding specimens were explored.
@highlight The active agent can weaken the drastic eruption of metal vapor and plasma enhance the keyhole shape and improve the weld pool stability.
@highlight Application of Cr
@highlight active agent narrowed the width of heat affected zone and increased the weld penetration.
@highlight The active agent suppressed spatter and pore weld defects and improved the laser weld quality of stainless steel specimens.
