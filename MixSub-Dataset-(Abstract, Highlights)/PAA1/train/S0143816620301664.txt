 Biospeckle is caused by statistical interference of coherent beam reflected from a surface having temporal variation due to physiological or biochemical activity . For quantitative evaluation of underlying dynamic speckle activity different point based and full field indexing based techniques were proposed in the literature . However most of the existing techniques involve manual region of interest selection and possess considerable variation of index value with different experimental and analysis parameters . To circumvent these drawbacks in this work we proposed an efficient automated biospeckle indexing technique by combining morphological and geo statistical operators . Performance of the proposed strategy was analyzed and compared in the controlled environment using different modifications of rotating diffuser based simulation model . Robustness of the proposed strategy was also validated experimentally using different bio specimens . Obtained results demonstrated that the proposed technique has high accuracy for all assessed conditions . Multiple object detection capability of morphological operators was also integrated in the proposed technique to assess biospeckle signature of multiple specimens captured in a single stack of frames . Simultaneous dynamicity assessment of multiple objects from a single stack reduced both computational and experimental overheads considerably . The proposed strategy is useful in biospeckle based quality control and automation .
