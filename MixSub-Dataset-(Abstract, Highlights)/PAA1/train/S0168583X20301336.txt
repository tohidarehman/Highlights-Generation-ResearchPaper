 As a new generation of semiconductor materials cadmium manganese telluride is a candidate material for nuclear radiation detection in environmental monitoring and industrial nondestructive testing . In general a planar detector with symmetrical electrodes decreases energy resolution because of incomplete hole collection . To increase energy resolution a hemispherical detector was designed with a volume of 442cm

@highlight 200 volt I V test to study the relationship between resistivity and voltage.
@highlight The effect of annealing on the contact performance of electrodes was studied.
@highlight Tested and analyzed the energy spectrum of alpha particles 5.48MeV .
