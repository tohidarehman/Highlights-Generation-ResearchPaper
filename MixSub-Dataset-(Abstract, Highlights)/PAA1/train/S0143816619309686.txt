 In this paper we have fabricated and characterized a bimetallic optical fiber surface plasmon resonance sensor followed by molybdenum disulfide MoS

@highlight Fiber SPR sensor based on MoS
@highlight nanosheet was proposed and successfully prepared.
@highlight Bimetallic layer can enhance fiber SPR sensing sensitivity.
@highlight Bimetallic layer gives play to the advantages of gold film and silver film.
@highlight It has been confirmed through numerical analysis and experiments that MoS
@highlight nanosheet could enhanced sensitivity.
