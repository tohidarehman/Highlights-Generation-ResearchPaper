 In this paper we investigate the dosimetric effects target inhomogeneities on VHEE beam dose profiles . Dose profile sensitivity to high and low density

@highlight First experimental demonstration of the relative insensitivity of VHEE beams to inhomogeneities.
@highlight Topas GEANT4 simulations on experiments conducted at CERNs CLEAR facility are in good agreement.
@highlight Simulations of proton beams and demonstrate their relative sensitivity to inhomogeneities.
@highlight Relative dose insensitivity of several tissue like equivalents have been explored.
@highlight Dose penetration for Very High Electron VHEE beams explored.
