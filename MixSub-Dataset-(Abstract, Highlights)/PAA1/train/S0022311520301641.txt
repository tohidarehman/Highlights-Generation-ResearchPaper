 Understanding the hydride platelet reorientation in zirconium alloy fuel claddings that potentially occurs during the dry storage process of spent nuclear fuel is of great technological importance for the cladding integrity . In this study detailed microstructural and crystallographic analysis of the circumferential and reoriented radial hydrides in a ZrSnNb cladding tube has been performed . The results show that the crystallographic nature of the reoriented radial hydrides in the material remains the same as that of the circumferential hydrides . The radial hydrides remain to be the

@highlight An internal pressurization approach was proposed to apply the hoop stress on the Zr cladding tube.
@highlight Detailed microstructural and crystallographic analysis on stress reorientation effect of hydrides was performed.
@highlight The misfit strain accommodation mechanism was discussed by micromechanical stress analysis.
