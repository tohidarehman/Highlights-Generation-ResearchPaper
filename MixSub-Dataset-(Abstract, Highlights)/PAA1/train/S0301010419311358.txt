 In this work 2 imidazole was synthesized to perform a fluorescence sensing system depending on the imidazole derivative as a sensor for Cu

@highlight A imidazole derivative can be used as a turn off chemical sensor for selective sensing of Cu
@highlight Small values of DL and QL are obtained such as 1.70M and 5.65M respectively.
@highlight XNOR IMPLICATION and INHIBIT gates are shown at 372 395 and 418nm respectively.
