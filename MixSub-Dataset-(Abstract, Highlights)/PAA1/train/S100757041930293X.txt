 The probability density function of the time variant extreme value process for structural responses is of great importance . Poisson white noise excitation occurs widely in practical engineering problems . The extreme value distribution of the response of systems excited by Poisson white noise processes is still not yet readily available . For this purpose in the present paper a novel method based on the augmented Markov vector process for the PDF of the time variant extreme value process for a Poisson white noise driven dynamical system is proposed . Specifically the augmented Markov vector process is constructed by combining the extreme value process and its underlying response process . Then the joint probability density of the AMV can be evaluated by solving the Chapman Kolmogorov Equation e.g . via the path integral solution . Further the PDF of the time variant extreme value process is obtained and can be used say to estimate the dynamic reliability of a stochastic system . For the purpose of illustration and verification several numerical examples are studied and compared with Monte Carlo solution . Problems to be further studied are also discussed .
