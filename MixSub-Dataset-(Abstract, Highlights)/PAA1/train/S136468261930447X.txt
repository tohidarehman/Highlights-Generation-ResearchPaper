 Altitude structure of turbulence in the troposphere and lower stratosphere over the Indian peninsula is delineated using radiosonde observations carried out from six stations as part of the Tropical Tropopause Dynamics Campaign under the GPS Aided Radiosonde Network Experiment for Tropospherestratosphere Studies program . Thorpe analysis applied to the potential temperature profiles taking into account the impact of atmospheric moisture and instrumental noise is used to estimate the turbulence parameters . This study shows that while the occurrence of turbulence is high in the lower and upper troposphere the region 38km is relatively devoid of turbulence at all the six stations . In general 60 of the Thorpe scale L

@highlight Altitude structure of turbulence studied over six locations of Indian peninsula.
@highlight Occurrence of turbulence is high in the lower and upper troposphere.
@highlight There is no systematic station to station variations in the turbulent structure.
@highlight Convective and dynamical instabilities are responsible for the turbulence generation.
@highlight Thorpe method appears to be good in identifying convectively induced turbulence.
