 Multistability is a common feature of various dynamical systems which manifests itself as the possibility to demonstrate various behaviors for the same parameter values . These behaviors or states of the system must be stable against weak perturbation in order to be observable in real life . However a strong enough perturbation may destroy a certain state and lead to the system switching to another one . From the viewpoint of nonlinear dynamics the response of a multistable system to a strong stimulus depends on the configuration and the mutual arrangement of basins of different attractors . In the present paper we introduce a novel measure for characterization of a multistable system the switching threshold . It equals the amplitude of a minimal perturbation capable of switching the system from one attractor to another . We develop a numerical algorithm for calculation of the switching thresholds and apply it to a number of paradigmatic models including dynamical networks . We show that the values of switching thresholds provide important information about multistable systems and their responses to external stimuli . This information allows to develop methods of optimal control of multistable systems by external signals . Surprisingly it also allows to predict some features of their dynamics under the influence of external noise .
