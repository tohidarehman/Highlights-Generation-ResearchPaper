 Grain boundary embrittlement of reactor pressure vessel steel occurs at the long term operation through the radiation enhanced segregation of impurities . All the known techniques of studying the GB segregation have their advantages and disadvantages and complete information can be obtained only through a comprehensive analysis by different methods .

@highlight Grain boundary segregation in RPV steels is studied by APT AES and fractography.
@highlight P Ni Mn and Si concentration in grain boundaries increases with fluence increase.
@highlight The higher is the bulk Ni and Mn content the higher is Ni Mn and P segregation.
@highlight Co segregation of P and Ni Mn Si in grain boundaries occurs under irradiation.
@highlight Fraction of brittle intergranular fracture correlates with P segregation level.
