 Undermatched shape functions have always been the primary source of systematic errors for non uniform deformation measurement in digital image correlation especially for large curvature displacement . All the other errors arising from grey level interpolation subset size and speckle pattern are overwhelmed by the systematic errors due to undermatched shape functions . The effect of the first order shape functions on polynomials is analyzed and based on this analysis a novel and easy to implement displacement post processing algorithm is proposed to compensate the systematic errors . The direct digital image correlation displacement result is processed by multiple filters with the same window size as the subset and the resulting data is employed to recover the actual displacement field . Theoretically the proposed method is capable of recovering the original continuous displacement function of any order with no bias . The numerical results of elementary function and simulated images show that the proposed algorithm is effective in correcting the displacement systematic bias and improving the subpixel accuracy of digital image correlation . Finally the algorithm is applied to the displacement measurement of shear band .

@highlight The displacement of DIC is equivalent to mean filtered result of actual displacement.
@highlight The convolution of mean filter is analyzed and expanded to a series of derivative terms.
@highlight An algorithm using multiple filtered displacement is proposed based on the expansion.
@highlight The systematic error due to undermatched shape function is compensated by the algorithm.
@highlight The novel algorithm is quite simple easy implementation and timesaving.
