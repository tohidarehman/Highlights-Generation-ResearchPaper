 Thermal ageing behaviors of 15wt . Cr oxide dispersion strengthened steels with the contents of Al of 5 7 and 9wt . which were isothermally aged at 475C for 9000h have been investigated by Vickers hardness measurement tensile test and atom probe tomography to correlate the age hardening with the evolution of nanometer scale structures for understanding the age hardening mechanisms . The age hardening of 15Cr ODS steel is attributed to phase separation . The age hardening of 15Cr5Al ODS steel is considerably higher relative to 15Cr 15Cr7Al and 15Cr9Al ODS steels which is due to the strengthening by both Cr enriched phases and enriched phases formed in 15Cr5Al ODS steel . In 15Cr7Al and 15Cr9Al ODS steels however the age hardening is only attributed to the phase strengthening because phase separation is completely suppressed in the ODS steels when the content of Al is

@highlight Long term ageing behavior in 15Cr ODS steels with 5 7 9wt Al was studied.
@highlight 15Cr5Al ODS steel exhibits the strongest age hardening due to and phases.
@highlight phase separation is completely suppressed in 15Cr ODS when Al content
@highlight 7wt .
@highlight Age hardening from phase strengthening gets stronger with Al content increasing.
@highlight Age hardening mechanisms are proposed for the three Al alloyed 15Cr ODS steels.
