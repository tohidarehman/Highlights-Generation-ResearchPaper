 Women have been facing promotion difficulties in the workplace and lack the opportunities to fully develop their abilities . In this study we proposed a new computational model to explain the promotion dilemma for women from the perspective of work performance stability . From the simulation results we found that stronger risk taking tendency of men at work can influence gender stratification in the organization as well as the overall organizational performance . Specifically womens stable work performance plays an important role in causing their career development dilemma more female employees are stuck at the lowest level and very few women can be promoted to senior levels although womens work ability is significantly higher than mens especially in the middle levels . Simulation results have also been validated using real life data . Some noises in the performance evaluation system can alleviate the above results but they will also lead to a decline in overall organizational performance which in turn have more adverse impact on the organization . This work provides some new insights into understanding womens promotion difficulties by looking outside the framework of discrimination and it cries for further empirical studies .
