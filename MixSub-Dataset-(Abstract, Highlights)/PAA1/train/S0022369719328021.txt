 In recent years supercapacitors have attracted much attention due to their excellent chargedischarge performance long term cycle lifetimes and high specific power . Transition metal oxides are promising candidates for environmentally friendly low cost and high powered energy storage materials . In addition the use of one dimensional nanostructures can markedly enhance the characteristic properties of the transition metal oxides . In this work ZnCo
