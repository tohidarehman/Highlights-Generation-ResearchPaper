 Glasses doped with rare earth ions have attracted considerable interest because of their potential applications in photonic devices such as phosphors optical amplifiers lasers and memory . The design and preparation of host glasses for doping RE ions are very important for achieving the desired performance in different devices . In this study we successfully prepared nano sized SnO

@highlight Fabrication of nano sized SnO
@highlight crystal precipitated glasses activated with Eu
@highlight ions.
@highlight Glasses exhibited strong fluorescence intensities.
@highlight Eu
@highlight ions successfully co doped in precipitated SnO
@highlight nanocrystals.
@highlight Optical energy absorbed in SnO
@highlight crystals transferred to co doped Eu
@highlight ions.
@highlight Emission yield was 75 even with a low Eu
@highlight content of 0.5wt .
