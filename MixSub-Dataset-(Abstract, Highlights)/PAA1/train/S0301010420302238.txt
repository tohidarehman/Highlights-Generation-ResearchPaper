 Although widely existing in nature crystal water compounds are still ignored by photochemistry scientists so far . In this work we mainly investigated the influence of structure water on light absorption charge transfer and photochemical property of Zn

@highlight Coordination interaction of H
@highlight O with Zn results in LMCT transfer.
@highlight LMCT transfer obviously increases light absorption.
@highlight LMCT transfer greatly improves charge separation.
@highlight Crystal water have improved photochemical property of Zn
@highlight  PO
@highlight 2H
@highlight O.
