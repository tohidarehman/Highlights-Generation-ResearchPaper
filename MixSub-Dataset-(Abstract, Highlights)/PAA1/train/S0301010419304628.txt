 The redshift and blueshift of the absorption spectrum of Co doped ZnO have been reported experimentally . The effects on the bandgap and absorption spectrum of Co doping and interstitial H coexisting in ZnO have not been fully elucidated . The electronic structures and absorption spectra of Co doped ZnO interstitial Co doped ZnO and supercell model with four different spacings of substitutional Co and interstitial H co doped ZnO systems were calculated using first principle analysis . Results indicated that the multibody effect of the doped systems is greater than BursteinMoss effect . The bandgap of the doped systems is narrowed and the absorption spectra are significant and presented in order as follows ZnO Zn
