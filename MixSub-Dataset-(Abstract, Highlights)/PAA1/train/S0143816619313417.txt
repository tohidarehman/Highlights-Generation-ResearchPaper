 It is crucial for sparse aperture systems to preserve imaging quality which can be addressed when fast corrections of pistons within a fraction of a wavelength are available . In this paper we demonstrate that only a single deep convolutional neural network is sufficient to extract pistons from wide band extended images once being appropriately trained . To eliminate the object characters the feature vector is calculated as the input by a pair of focused and defocused images . This method possesses the capability of fine phasing with high sensing accuracy and a large scale capture range without the use of combined wavelengths . Simple and fast the proposed technique might find wide applications in phasing telescope arrays or segmented mirrors .

@highlight We demonstrate that using only a single deep convolutional neural network DCNN is sufficient to detect pistons from broadband extended images. To the best of our knowledge the technique reported in this paper has never been reported.
@highlight Compared to other piston sensing methods using neural network the reported technology being able to discern pistons directly from the broadband intensity summations rather than the intensities of separated wavelengths uses only a single DCNN which extremely relaxes the optics complexity.
@highlight Above all we believe this paper is suitable for optics and lasers in engineering.
