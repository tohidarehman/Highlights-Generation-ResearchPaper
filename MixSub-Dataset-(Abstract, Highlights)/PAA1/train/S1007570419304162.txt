 This paper investigates the local stability and stabilization problem of nonlinear time delay systems subject to parameter uncertainties which are represented by interval type 2 T S fuzzy systems with two additive time varying delays . Because T S fuzzy models often represent primitive nonlinear systems well only in the region of validity local stability and stabilization problems are considered . By constructing a novel LyapunovKrasovskii functional and using the matrix inequality scaling approach a new delay dependent local stability and stabilization criterion is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities . Using Lyapunov level set the estimation of attraction domain is also developed . Finally two numerical examples are employed to verify the effectiveness of proposed methods .

@highlight The stability analysis and control design for nonlinear systems with two additive delays and parameter uncertainties are investigated via IT2 T S fuzzy model.
@highlight The local stability analysis and synthesis of IT2 T S fuzzy model with two additive delays are investigated. The problem of estimation of attraction domain is also considered.
@highlight A novel Lyapunov function is constructed and the General Free Weight Matrix approach is introduced to the derive less conservative local stability and stabilization conditions in the form of LMIs.
