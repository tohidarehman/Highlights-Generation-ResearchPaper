 Welded steel plates are widely used in several engineering applications . Usually the material properties of the parent material are prior to the welded structure which frequently causes the welding joint to fail due to fatigue . Predicting the fatigue life of a material is not a simple task especially when considering the welding joint with various constituents . In this study a strain distribution for a steel plate weld joint was investigated using the digital image correlation technology to estimate the low cycle fatigue life . Using the reconstructed strain a nonlinear model of strain was presented . Moreover the rate change of strain was used as a fatigue failure criterion to predict the lifetime . The proposed model considers the strain rules from two aspects maximum value and change rate . With the information of the initial strain value we can achieve the desired prediction for the fatigue life of the steel plate weld joint under the low cycle fatigue loading .

@highlight The strain distribution of the full field steel plate fatigue during the whole period was measured by DIC method.
@highlight The strain characteristic model of the steel plate fatigue cycle process was constructed.
@highlight A fatigue assessment method based on initial strain and strain change rate was proposed.
