 Bone drilling is a common surgical procedure of knee arthroplasty craniotomy stapedotomy dental treatment and laminotomy . Although femtosecond laser processing provides a promising method for precision bone drilling it is still challenging to achieve thermal accumulation suppression and damage protection for large scale hole drilling . In this paper we propose a real time spectral response guided femtosecond laser bone drilling method with the second harmonic generation signals for positioning and monitoring . SHG green signal centered at 513.5nm is generated below laser ablation threshold of bone which can provide as a label free detection for initial positioning . Results show that the spectral intensity ratio of green and white signal gradually decreases due to the accelerated removal of hydroxyapatite with the increased laser fluence while the spectral intensity ratio of red signal and other visible signal can be used to indicate the thermal damage due to the abnormal enhancement of the red signal ranging from 700 to 800nm when carbonization occurs . Based on the real time spectral response at different laser fluence the key laser processing parameters including defocus distance flow rate of cooling water and laser fluence are successfully optimized . Finally a damage free hole with the average diameter of 3mm and the depth of 3.6mm is successfully drilled within 5min while the temperature of surrounding hole wall is 37.1C . The proposed method provides a direct viewing damage free and high efficiency way of laser bone drilling with real time positioning and monitoring .
