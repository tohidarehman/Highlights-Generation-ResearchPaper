 Two narrow fractions of coal fly ash cenospheres with 90wt glass phase and different Si Al ratio shell porosity and thickness globule size and content of a mullite phase were used as a glassy source of Si and Al in the hydrothermal synthesis of pollucite analcime solid solutions at 150C and autogenous pressure 1.0M NaOH Cs Na ratios of 00.25 . Hollow microsphere globules of about 6070 and 140170m in sizes are produced as Cs immobilized forms in this process . The microspheres have a composite mullite ANA wall where ANA is analcime pollucite solid solutions . Composition and morphology of solid products as well as composition of ANA phases were characterized by PXRD SEM EDS and STA methods . The influence of the mullite content and shell thickness on the preservation of the product spherical shape has been established . The degree of Cs

@highlight Microspheres with a composite mullite ANA wall are produced as a Cs mineral like form.
@highlight Analcime pollucite phases with non significant difference in Si Al ratios were obtained.
@highlight Mullite provides the preservation of a spherical shape of crystallized microspheres.
@highlight The average Cs content in solid products is 2332wt .
