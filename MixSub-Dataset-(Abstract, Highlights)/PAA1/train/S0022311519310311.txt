 FeCrAl oxide dispersion strengthened steel is one of the most promising candidate cladding materials of generation IV nuclear reactors because of its excellent resistance to not only corrosion but also creep and irradiation due to the ultrahigh density nanometer scale oxides . Effects of the contents of Al Zr and Ti on the crystal and metal oxide interface structures of the particles in Fe15Cr3.7Al2W0.1Ti0.6Zr0.35Y

@highlight Oxides in Fe15Cr2W0.35Y
@highlight ODS steels with Al Zr and Ti were studied by HRTEM.
@highlight Crystal interface structures of 175 oxides were identified for 3.7Al0.1Ti0.6Zr.
@highlight Crystal interface structures of 213 oxides were identified for 3.8Al0.12Ti0.5Zr.
@highlight Proportions of various types of oxides were determined according to HRTEM results.
@highlight The content ratios of Al Zr Ti cause the polymorphic transition of complex oxides.
