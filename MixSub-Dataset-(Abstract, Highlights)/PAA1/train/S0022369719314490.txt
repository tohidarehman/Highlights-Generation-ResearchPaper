 The development of new and simple surface enhanced substrates is primarily motivated by the ability to design and investigate the plasmonic structures to achieve the optimal performance in enhanced spectroscopy . In this work we numerically design the plasmonic substrates by embedding a nanorod dimer antenna into a nanoring resonator . The single layer composite substrate reveals a double resonance response with a broad spectrum electric field enchantment due to the plasmon hybridization of nanorod dimer and nanoring . The sandwiched substrate shows a complicated optical spectrum with multiple plasmon resonances which can be attributed to the interaction of intralayer and interlayer plasmons . It is also worth mentioning that the electric field hot spots keep unmodified and concentrate at the middle gap of nanorod dimers in composite substrates at different excitation frequencies . The enhanced plasmonic substrate with consistent hot spots at different excitation frequencies can be used in surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy and nonlinear optics .

@highlight The dual band plasmon resonances with wide SERS activity can be realized in hybridized nanorod dimer plasmon substrate.
@highlight The multi band plasmon enhanced substrates with unchanged hot spots can be realized in hybridized nanorod dimer.
@highlight The hot spots in designed plasmon enhanced substrates remain unchanged at different excited wavelengths.
