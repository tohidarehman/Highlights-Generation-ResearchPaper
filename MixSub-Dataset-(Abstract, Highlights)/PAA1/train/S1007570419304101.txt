 It is shown how classes of modulated coupled systems of sine Gordon Demoulin and Manakov type may be reduced to their unmodulated counterparts via the application of a novel reciprocal transformation . Modulations governed by recently introduced integrable Ermakov Painlev II Ermakov Painlev III and Ermakov Painlev IV equations as well as the classical Ermakov equation are considered . In the latter case the procedure is illustrated by the generation of a class of exact solutions to a heterogeneous Manakov system with periodic modulation .

@highlight Privileged integrable systems admit reciprocally related modulated counterparts.
@highlight Modulation may be driven by Painlev and Ermakov equations.
@highlight Periodically modulated Manakov solitons may be obtained.
