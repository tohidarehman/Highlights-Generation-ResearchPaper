 In this study Green Kubo formulism was employed to quantitatively assess thermal conductivity of nanofluids with different solid liquid interaction energy . Anomalous thermal conductivity enhancement was observed in well dispersed dilute nanofluids with strong solid liquid interaction energy . The simulation results indicated that solid liquid interaction is the key factor for the understanding of the heat conduction mechanism in nanofluids . Green Kubo theory and Brownian motion were studied in detail to derive the physical origin of thermal conductivity enhancement . The results suggested that the phonons across the solid liquid interface or micro convection induced by Brownian motion of nanoparticles is responsible for thermal conductivity enhancement . In addition a wide range of thermal conductivity enhancement and nonlinear increasing with volume fraction was observed which is consistent with experiment investigations . The effect of solid liquid interaction energy on the viscosity of nanofluids was also studied and was found to be an insignificant factor . Our results indicated that the nanofluids with strong solid liquid interaction energy should have more significant application potential .
