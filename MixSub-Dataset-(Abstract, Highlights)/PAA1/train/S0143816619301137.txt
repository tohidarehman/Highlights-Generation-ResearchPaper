 The dynamics of splitting of the laser induced plasma plume is investigated by spatiotemporal plasma imaging and spectroscopy . Plasma is induced on a copper target in a broad pressure range 10

@highlight Dynamics of laser induced plasma splitting within broad pressure range.
@highlight Charge separation field to explain plasma splitting phenomenon.
@highlight Deviation from local thermodynamic equilibrium at low pressures.
