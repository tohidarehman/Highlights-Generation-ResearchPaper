 Deposition of corrosion products on micro orifice specimens under accelerated flow conditions was investigated in high temperature water on several substrate materials and water chemistries 02ppm of Li 02.5ppm of H

@highlight Presence of lithium reduces solubility of magnetite and CRUD build up rate.
@highlight CRUD morphology is pH dependent particles dominated at neutral pH and crystalline at alkaline pH 2ppm of Li .
@highlight The radial CRUD build up is independent of substrate material at neutral pH.
@highlight The surface CRUD deposition depends on the electrical conductivity of the substrate material at alkaline pH.
@highlight Electrokinetic activity drives the deposition of magnetite at alkaline pH.
