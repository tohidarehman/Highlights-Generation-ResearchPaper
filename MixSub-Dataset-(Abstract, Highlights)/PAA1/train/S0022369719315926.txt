 The present paper examines molecular motion mechanisms in lamellar molecular crystals of undecylenic acid . Thermophysical dielectric and infrared spectroscopy methods were used to demonstrate the presence of a relaxation process in crystals of undecylenic acid in the temperature range of 60 to 10 . The process is thought to be due to the free rotation of carboxylic groups after dissociation of dimeric rings and the nucleation of topological solitons . Topological solitons originate once the carboxylic groups begin to rotate freely .
