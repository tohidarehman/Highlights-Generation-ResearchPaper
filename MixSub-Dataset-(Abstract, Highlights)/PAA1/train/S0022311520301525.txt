 With the aim of improving the oxidation resistance of zirconium alloy claddings in light water reactors and enhancing the deposition efficiency and economics of surface coating electroplating was used to deposit a Cr coating with a rate exceeding 12m h on the surface of thermally treated Zr 4 alloy predeposited with an intermediate transition nickel layer . The evolution of helium bubbles in the cross section of the Cr coated Zr 4 alloy during 30keV He

@highlight Cr coated Zr 4 alloy was successfully prepared by electroplating.
@highlight Ni layer was designed to eliminate interface defects and enhance interface binding force.
@highlight Metallurgical bonding was formed at the interface between each layer.
@highlight The bubble evolution in Cr coated Zr 4 alloy irradiated by He
@highlight was
@highlight analyzed.
@highlight A new
@highlight irradiation facility with TEM the only in running one in China was introduced.
