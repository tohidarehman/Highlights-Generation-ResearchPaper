 We identify two types of dynamical bifurcations generated primarily by interactions of an invariant attracting submanifold with stable and unstable manifolds of hyperbolic fixed points . These bifurcation types inspired by recent investigations of mathematical models for walking droplet phenomena are introduced and illustrated . Some of the one parameter bifurcation types are analyzed in detail and extended from the plane to higher dimensional spaces . A few applications to walking droplet dynamics are analyzed .

@highlight Experimentalists often study the chaotic walking of droplets on a fluid bath.
@highlight Discrete dynamical models of walking droplets exhibit a variety of bifurcations.
@highlight Homoclinic heteroclinic bifurcations of the models lead to chaos.
