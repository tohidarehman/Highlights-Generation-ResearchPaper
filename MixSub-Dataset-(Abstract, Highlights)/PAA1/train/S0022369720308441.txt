 Palladium chloride and chlorinated poly mixture were prepared into homogeneous solution followed by electrospinning to make uniform nanofibers with average diameter of 460nm . Then these composite nanofibers were treated in ethylenediamine solution to functionalize and crosslink the CPVC molecules inside the nanofibers to improve their chelating ability and solvent resistance . The functionalization and crosslinking of CPVC molecules inside composite nanofibers were confirmed by SEM FT IR EA and PALS characterizations . The catalytic performance of these palladium encapsulated CPVC nanofibers

@highlight Pd nanoparticles were generated in crosslinked and aminated CPVC nanofibers.
@highlight Pd nanoparticles were stabilized by chelating and capping effects.
@highlight These nanofibers exhibited high activity and stability for coupling reactions.
@highlight The activity decay was resolved by PALS and other common characterizations
