 While degradation of concrete due to irradiation is a widely studied subject the deterioration and changes in microstructure of cement pastes immobilizing evaporator concentrates due to gamma radiation is a very specific subject because of the nature of the solidified radioactive waste . The cement paste proposed as possibly suitable binder for cementitious composites immobilizing evaporator concentrates a paste with the same composition but mixed with simulated evaporator concentrates and a reference paste were subjected to gamma irradiation from Co 60 source at doses of 2MGy and studied in terms of microstructure changes using Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X ray Spectroscopy X ray diffraction and nanoindentation . SEM EDX revealed rise of new phases on the NP C samples rich in Na

@highlight XRD revealed presence of charlesite instead of ettringite in composites immobilizing evaporator concentrates.
@highlight Nanoindentation indicated formation of a new phases due to irradiation probably carbonates.
@highlight Irradiation of composites with evaporator concentrates causes formation of sodium carbonates.
