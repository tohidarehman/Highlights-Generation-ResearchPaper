 The Arctic seas are mainly located inside the polar vortex under conditions of low temperature . Sea ice extent in these seas in the winter spring period reaches maximum values with negligible interannual changes . The exception is the Barents Sea where interannual variability of sea ice extent increases from December to February . In winter the vortex edge is often located near the Barents Sea which leads to an increase in surface temperature and a decrease in sea ice extent . We show that the Barents Sea ice extent in winter can be determined by the shape and location of the tropospheric polar vortex .

@highlight The interannual variability of the Barents Sea ice extent reaches 32 in January.
@highlight The tropospheric polar vortex edge is often located near the Barents Sea in winter.
@highlight The Barents Sea ice cover can be determined by the changes in the polar vortex edge.
