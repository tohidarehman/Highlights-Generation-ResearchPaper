 Hysteresis is a special type of behavior found in many areas including magnetism mechanics biology economics etc . One of the characteristics of hysteresis systems is that they are approximately rate independent for slow inputs . It is possible to express this characteristic in mathematical language by decomposing hysteresis operators as the sum of a rate independent component and a nonhysteretic component which vanishes in steady state for slow inputs . This decomposition called

@highlight Hysteresis systems are approximately rate independent for slow inputs.
@highlight Hysteresis systems are causal.
@highlight This paper presents a new decomposition of hysteresis operators into a
@highlight rate independent component and a
@highlight nonhysteretic component that vanishes for slow inputs.
