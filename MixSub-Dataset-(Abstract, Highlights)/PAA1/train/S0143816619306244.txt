 This paper proposed a diffractive imaging technology called rotary astigmatic diffractive imaging . The system uses a rotatable cylindrical lens for rotary astigmatic modulation and a camera for collecting the diffractive patterns distorted in different angles . Then a field can be reconstructed with the patterns by an iterative algorithm . Compared with the original astigmatic diffractive imaging system our simulations show RADI system has the greater performance of convergence with the same number of constrained patterns . In addition it is easy for RADI to increase the number of diffraction measurements to accelerate the convergence further . Considering the center of the cylindrical lens does not coincide with the center of rotation a calibration method is proposed . An optical vortex of charge two is reconstructed experimentally demonstrating the system can solve the problem of unique phase recovery . Besides the reconstructions of a USAF resolution chart with different numbers of constrained patterns shows the rate of convergence increases obviously with the increase of the number of diffraction measurements . The reconstruction shows the resolution of our system is about 14.25lp mm which is 60 of the diffraction limited resolution . Our RADI can provide a high performance way but with simple setup to realize field reconstruction .
