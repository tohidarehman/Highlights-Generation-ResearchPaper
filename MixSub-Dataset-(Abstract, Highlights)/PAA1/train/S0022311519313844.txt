 In the design of used nuclear fuel containers for deep geological repositories copper is considered to be a suitable and long lived barrier for corrosion resistance . The microstructures of state of the art copper materials used in this application produced through extrusion a grain boundary engineered electrodeposition technique and cold spraying were studied via electron backscattered diffraction . Desirable microstructural characteristics for localized corrosion resistance of pure copper were compiled from the literature considering grain size grain boundary character distribution and crystallographic texture . The subject copper materials were found to have favourable microstructures for localized corrosion resistance in particular a high fraction of special grain boundaries especially 3 twins rendering them suitable for the given application .

@highlight Cu coating materials for used nuclear fuel containers were characterized with EBSD.
@highlight Both electrodeposited and cold sprayed Cu contain many special grain boundaries.
@highlight The microstructural features are favourable for localized corrosion resistance.
