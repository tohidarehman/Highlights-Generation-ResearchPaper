 The reactions of hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl radicals with benzene and 10 monosubstituted benzenes were investigated by measuring transient absorption spectra calculating Gibbs free energies absorption spectra of intermediates formed and determining the rate constants of H

@highlight Main reaction of H
@highlight and
@highlight OH with simple aromatic molecules is addition to the ring.
@highlight and
@highlight reactions are favoured independently of the nature of substituent.
@highlight and
@highlight reactions are disfavoured.
@highlight In chloro bromo and nitrobenzene direct substituent elimination also takes place.
@highlight The
@highlight OH adduct of anilinium ion undergoes fast water elimination.
@highlight In benzylchloride
@highlight OH adds to the ring H
@highlight abstracts H atom from the side chain.
