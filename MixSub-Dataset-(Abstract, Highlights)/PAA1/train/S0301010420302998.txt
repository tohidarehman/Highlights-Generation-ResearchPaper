 Herein we report how tuning of molecule electrode coupling strength can turn on the coupling of tunnelling electrons with vibrational modes of central molecule in the two probe configuration of

@highlight Rise in inelastic transmission on changing the molecule electrode coupling strength.
@highlight Relative displacements of the encapsulated metal also plays very prominent role.
@highlight In the present study electrode molecule separation has been varied from 1.6 to 2.2.
@highlight Inelastic transmission in strong coupling case is 100 times of weak coupling case.
@highlight It is also notable that in stronger coupling regime phonon mode numbered 5 contributes to current in A range and relevant excitation takes place at much lower energy which is obviously in complete contrast with weakly coupled system where higher energy phonon modes numbered 5056 have chance to contribute current in A range. Hence in respect of low energy inelastic transmission strongly coupled system is preferable.
@highlight Larger packing of in phase tunneling electron within strongly coupled
