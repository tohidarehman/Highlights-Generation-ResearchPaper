 In this study hydrogen generation from sodium borohydride was achieved via disulfonated poly copolymers . Protons on the sulfone groups of copolymers catalyzed the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride and produced hydrogen . The hydrogen generation rate was affected by the disulfonation degree which is an indication of the amount of sulfone groups in the copolymer . The rate showed an increment as the disulfonation degree increased . Additionally the hydrogen generation rate was a function of both the copolymer amount and borohydride concentration . Moreover the reaction had relatively low activation energy and was calculated from the Arrhenius plot as 19.2kJmol

@highlight The hydrogen generation rate is a function of sulfonation degree of copolymers.
@highlight The hydrogen generation rate increases with polymer amount utilized.
@highlight The hydrogen generation rate increases with sodium borohydride concentration.
@highlight Copolymers are highly reusable and can preserve catalytic activity up to 25 runs.
