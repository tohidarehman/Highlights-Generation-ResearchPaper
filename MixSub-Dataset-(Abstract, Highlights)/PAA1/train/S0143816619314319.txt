 High resolution scanning electron microscope is widely used for microscale material and structure characterization . However the distortion in SEM imaging causes serious error for the quantitative measurement of optical methods . In previous work the distortion calibration requires to set up a mathematic model of SEM imaging and then to determine the model parameters by calculation . The distortion filed is hard to directly extract from the SEM image by classic methods . In order to tackle this problem we developed a direct sampling moir method for simple and fast analysis of grating distortion . In DSM the distortion fields can be directly presented visually through processing a single grating image . The measurement accuracy of DSM was verified by numerical simulation to be better than the classic sampling moir . In the experiment a standard grating with pitch of 6.5m was used in DSM to calibrate the distortion fields at different magnifications in SEM . The fitting results of the calibrated distortion field agreed well with the existing distortion model which demonstrated the feasibility of DSM for distortion calibration in SEM .
