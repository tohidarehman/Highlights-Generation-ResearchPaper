 Investigations on the morphology and phase equilibrium characteristics of corium were performed by a series of experiments in parallel with thermodynamic phase equilibrium analyses . Melting and solidification experiments were performed using corium consists of U Zr ZrO

@highlight Experiments and thermodynamic analyses on morphology and phase equilibrium of corium.
@highlight NUCLEA analysis results on U Zr O Fe system agreed well with the experimental findings.
@highlight U U Zr ratio in good agreement whereas some dispersions observed in oxygen and steel compositions.
@highlight Zirconium diboride phase trapped boron and mainly distributed in the metallic layer.
@highlight Additional data required to improve for chemistry of corium containing B
@highlight C.
