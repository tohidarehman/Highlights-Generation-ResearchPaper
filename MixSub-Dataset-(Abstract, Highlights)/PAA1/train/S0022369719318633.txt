 Modulation spectroscopy is a well established method for the study of optical transitions in semiconductors and has been a valuable asset for the verification of theoretical band structure calculations . The most important aspect of this method is its ability to render clear spectral features with no prior assumptions . One modulation technique is electroabsorption in which the transmittance of a sample is modulated by the application of a time varying electric field while light is incident on the sample . In this work a modified form of electroabsorption was investigated in which the electric field was applied at the interface between the sample and a transparent conducting layer . This technique was applied to investigate the optical transitions in tungsten trioxide WO

@highlight A new modulation spectroscopy technique is devised.
@highlight It is based on modulating the transmittance through a material.
@highlight The method is applied to WO
@highlight films deposited by RF sputtering.
@highlight Sharp optical spectra were obtained and compared to theoretical calculations.
