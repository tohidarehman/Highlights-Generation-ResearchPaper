 With the high speed development of nuclear energy radioactive contamination has attracted worldwide attention . In this study the polyacrylamide titanium dioxide composites PAM TiO

@highlight The adsorption capacities of PAM TiO
@highlight are 146.5mg g for U VI and 38.8mg g for Eu III .
@highlight The adsorption took place at the surface of PAM TiO
@highlight and did not destroy its phase structure.
@highlight The existence of U VI can reduce the removal of Eu III and vice versa.
