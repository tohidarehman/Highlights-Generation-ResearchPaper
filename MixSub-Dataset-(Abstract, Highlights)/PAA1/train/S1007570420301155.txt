 We reveal the networks of simple symmetric periodic orbits in a double barred galaxy model . Specifically we investigate the dependence on the total orbital energy of the positions but also on the stability of the periodic solutions . For every orbital family we also compute the horizontal and vertical critical parameter values of the system at which new periodic families bifurcate from . Of particular interest are the vertical critical points which act as starting points for the creation of new families of three dimensional periodic orbits . The atlas of the simple periodic trajectories is presented in the

@highlight We use a new analytical model for describing the motion of stars in double barred galaxies.
@highlight We reveal the networks of simple symmetric periodic orbits of the system.
@highlight The critical solutions of the system which are bifurcation points are determined.
