 In this paper the scattering between the non topological kinks arising in a family of two component scalar field theory models is analyzed . A winding charge is carried by these defects . As a consequence two different classes of kink scattering processes emerge collisions between kinks that carry the same winding number and scattering events between kinks with opposite winding number . The variety of scattering channels is very rich and it strongly depends on the collision velocity and the model parameter . For the first type of events four distinct scattering channels are found
