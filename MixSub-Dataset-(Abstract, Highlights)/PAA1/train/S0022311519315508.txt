 A batch of hot rolled pure W and doped W sheets under 27 90 rolling reduction were prepared aiming to elucidate how rolling reduction and impurity elements influence the microstructure evolution . EBSD results revealed the three stage evolution during hot rolling including original grain smashing recrystallization and fibrous process . The intermediate recrystallization leads to a typical bimodal morphology in pure W which facilitates the formation of fiber structure at a larger strain . It is the necklace shaped grains that cause non uniform stress and control the slip systems of 111 ND and 100 ND . The doped W sample exhibits a milder dynamic recrystallization behavior and a relative homogeneous recrystallized morphology due to the drag effect of impurities on grain boundaries that inhibit abnormal grain growth during dynamic recrystallization . It is believed that this homogeneous recrystallized morphology of doped W causes the discontinuity of fiber structure and aggravates the generation of the transversal cracks .

@highlight Impurity induced microstructure change in hot rolled W is elucidated.
@highlight The mechanism and diagram of microstructure evolution of hot rolled W is proposed.
@highlight The bimodal morphology after DRX benefits the formation of fibrous grains.
@highlight The cracks in hot rolled W is related to the discontinuity of texture.
