 In the wake of blue phosphorenes theoretical prediction and experimental synthesis it has emerged as an excellent candidate for anode materials in alkali metal ion batteries due to its outstanding electrochemical performance . In the work we have addressed the impact of edge passivation by both hydrogen and oxygen atoms on single adsorption of different alkali metal atoms over zigzag blue phosphorene nanoribbons using first principles calculations . Our results unravel that in the presence of edge H passivation the nanoribbon binds alkali metal atoms inferior to the pristine blue phosphorene with binding energies varying from

@highlight The favorable binding of single alkali metal atoms is sensitive to the type of edge passivated atoms.
@highlight Single adsorption of alkali metal atoms may affect the nanoribbons electronic and magnetic properties.
@highlight The optimized edge passivation is promising for use in rechargeable metal ion battery technology.
