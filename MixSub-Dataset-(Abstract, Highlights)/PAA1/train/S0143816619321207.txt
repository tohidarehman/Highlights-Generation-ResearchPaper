 We report a scheme to generate radially polarized THz radiation by frequency difference of Hermite Cosh Gaussian lasers in hot electron collisional and density modulated plasma . The effect of laser and plasma parameters on emitted THz field profile is investigated . We found that THz field profile varies with spatial intensity profile of pump lasers . The THz amplitude increases with the pump laser intensity gradient . Our investigations show that electron collisions attenuate the THz amplitude without affecting the THz field profile . The highest THz field and conversion efficiency are obtained at resonance condition i.e .

@highlight The report demonstrates radially polarized bright terahertz THz wave generation.
@highlight Radially polarized allow deeper penetration inside the skin with less risk of collateral damage thereby improved safety and efficiency of treatment.
@highlight Radially polarized light is used in tweezers to trap the metallic particles in 3D.
@highlight Electron temperature enhances the THz field and conversion efficiency.
@highlight Electron collisions diminish the THz field and conversion efficiency.
