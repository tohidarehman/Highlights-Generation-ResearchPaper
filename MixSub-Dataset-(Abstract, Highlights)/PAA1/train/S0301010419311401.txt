 Picene as one representative of polycyclic hydrocarbons represents an appealing application in hydrocarbon superconductors . Here using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations we investigated the structural and electronic properties of picene thin films on p type SnSe and Au surfaces . For both substrates at low coverage the molecules present a flat lying geometry while at high coverage the molecules exhibit alternating flat lying and tilt standing configurations . The diffusion of the molecules on SnSe and the splitting of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital state on Au indicate that SnSe surface has a weaker interaction with the adsorbed molecules compared to other metallic substrate . Therefore based on our study on structural and electronic properties we conclude that a semiconductor substrate can maintain the intrinsic properties of picene films . The study of picene on different substrates may pave a way to unveil the structural and electronic properties of hydrocarbon superconductors on substrates .

@highlight The picene molecules present a flat lying geometry at low coverage.
@highlight Picene show flat lying and tilt standing alternating structure at high coverage.
@highlight Vacancies and the molecule diffusion in phase I on SnSe imply a weaker interaction.
@highlight On Au 1 1 1 the distortion in molecular structure induces splitting of LUMO state.
