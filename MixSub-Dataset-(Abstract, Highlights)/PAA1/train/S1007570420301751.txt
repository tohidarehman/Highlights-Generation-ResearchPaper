 The one dimensional shallow water equations in Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates are considered . It is shown the relationship between symmetries and conservation laws in Lagrangian coordinates and symmetries and conservation laws in mass Lagrangian variables . For equations in Lagrangian coordinates with a flat bottom an invariant difference scheme is constructed which possesses all the difference analogues of the conservation laws mass momentum energy the law of center of mass motion . Some exact invariant solutions are constructed for the invariant scheme while the scheme admits reduction on subgroups as well as the original system of equations . For an arbitrary shape of bottom it is possible to construct an invariant scheme with conservation of mass and momentum or alternatively mass and energy .. Invariant conservative difference scheme for the case of a flat bottom tested numerically in comparison with other known schemes .
