 The fourth stage of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle of the C 38 mission was used for the first time as an orbiting platform to carry out measurements of atmospheric parameters on June 23 2017 . The measurements were made in two phases . i During the initial launch phase wherein the launch vehicle traversed from the launch pad to an altitude of 500km . ii During the 10 orbits at an altitude of 350km . The Ionization Density and Electric field Analyzer

@highlight The IDEA payload is flown on the unique PS4 orbiting platform of PSLV C38 to obtain ionospheric measurements.
@highlight First of their kind in situ observations of top side plasma density structure being modulated by rocket exhaust cloud.
