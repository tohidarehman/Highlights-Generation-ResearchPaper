 X ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy was used to address both the local atomic structure and the local electronic structure around Zn Co and S in Co doped ZnS thin films . X ray absorption near edge spectroscopy revealed changes in the strong pre edge feature of the S K edge spectra that depend on the Co concentration and are related to atomic bound state transitions through hybridization between 3

@highlight Co substitutes for Zn generating lattice distortions.
@highlight The shortening of the CoS distance results in a decrease in the lattice parameter.
@highlight The main defects in the structure are Co substitution at Zn sites and S vacancies.
@highlight Co concentration is coupled with changes in the unoccupied local electronic states.
