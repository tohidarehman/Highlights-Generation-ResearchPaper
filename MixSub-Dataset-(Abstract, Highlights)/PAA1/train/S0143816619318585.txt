 In this work we derived an analytic expression for the optical field generated by an off axis Gaussian beam diffracted by a Discretized Vortex Producing Lens . With this system a multifocal arrangement of asymmetric optical vortices is obtained whose topological charge values change with the position along the optical axis . This scheme allows both obtaining a principal asymmetric vortex corresponding with the topological charge value of the phase mask and other asymmetric vortices with charges different from the phase mask charge . With the analytical expression the effects induced by the discretization and misalignment on the irradiance and phase of each vortex can be simultaneously studied . A signal to noise ratio expression is derived to verify if the noise of the multifocal system might affect the optical vortices of interest in a significant way We found that noise is not a problem . In conclusion a Discretized Vortex Producing Lens can be used as a continuous Spiral Phase Plate . Finally we explored the feasibility that the vortex phase could be employed as a displacement estimator .
