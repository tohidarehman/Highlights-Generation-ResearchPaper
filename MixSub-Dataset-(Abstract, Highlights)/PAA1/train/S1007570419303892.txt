 This paper studies the controllability of complex valued impulsive systems with time varying delays in control input . The impulsive systems considered here have a complex valued state space for some typical examples such as biological neural networks and quantum systems can be described by such systems . Using the method of variation of parameters an explicit expression of the solution for the given system is established . Based on the solution so obtained several controllability criteria are presented for such systems . Necessary and sufficient conditions for controllability are further derived for the time invariant case . It is shown that controllability of such systems is dependent on the impulsive function in discrete time the system matrices in continuous time and the time delay in control . Three numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed controllability results .

@highlight Controllability of impulsive system with time varying delay is investigated in complex valued state space for the first time.
@highlight Derive several sufficient or necessary conditions for two kinds of controllability.
@highlight Further concise necessary and sufficient conditions for controllability are obtained when system is reduced to a special case.
@highlight Different from some known results the derived conditions are less conservative and more general.
