 Alloying treatment was performed on 38CrMoAl alloy steel by using continuous scanning electron beam to improve surface performance . The effects of the TiN Ni ratio on the microstructure phase composition and mechanical properties of the alloying layer were discussed . As the TiN fraction in the TiN Ni mixed powder increased fine equiaxed crystals develop at the top of the alloying layer . When the TiN fraction is 20 the alloying layer is mainly composed of fine equiaxed crystals and columnar crystals that are uniformly distributed . The alloying layer with TiN mainly contains Ni Fe Ni as well as phases such as TiN Cr
