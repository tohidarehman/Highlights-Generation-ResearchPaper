 Six degree of freedom sensors enhance the measurement capability of traditional three degree of freedom laser trackers . However the classical 6D measurement techniques still have shortcomings in actual use such as the problem of line of sight and relatively low data acquisition rate . The proposed approach by integrating an Inertial Measurement Unit with a 6D sensor unit of a laser tracker is effective to overcome these limitations . The error is corrected by the combination of a Kalman filter and a backward smoothing algorithm . The Kalman filter only works when the 6D sensor s data is being sent through while the backward smoothing algorithm works during the whole process . The experiments are performed to compare the error in three positions and three rotational orientations between the proposed method and the Kalman filter and evaluate the effects of different rates and IMU frequencies on the algorithm . The simulations are also performed to estimate the maximum outage time . The results verify that the proposed method can solve the problem of line of sight and low data acquisition rate effectively .
