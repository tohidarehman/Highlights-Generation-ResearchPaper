 We study the possibility of using numerical modelling in the process of design a membrane of prescribed morphology and transport properties . We started from a real example of the cross section of alginate membrane cross linked by glutaraldehyde containing 25wt magnetite particles and searched for a numerical model that will resemble its morphological properties like amount of polymer matrix sizes of polymer matrix domains fractal dimension and others . Two different methods of generating models of such were proposed . After choosing the best models based on its morphological similarities to the real membrane we study their transport properties in terms of Brownian diffusion . We showed that there is a good agreement of diffusion type and diffusion constant between the models and the real membrane .

@highlight Artificial membrane structures are generated by program which uses two algorithms.
@highlight Numerically generated structures are compared to the real model membrane.
@highlight Fractal analysis is used for quantifying the structure and morphology of membranes.
@highlight Generated membranes possessing specific parameters are comparable to the real one.
