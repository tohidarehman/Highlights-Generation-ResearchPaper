 Experimental evidences have revealed the existence of intrinsic defects in Half Heusler AuMnSn . In this work using density functional theory we explore the energetics electronic and magnetic properties of intrinsic point defects in HH AMS crystal compound . The defects considered are antisite interstice vacancy and atom swap defects . We find relatively low negative formation energy for Au

@highlight Non stoichiometric composition in many synthesized half Heusler AuMnSn is explained.
@highlight Au interstitial defect in AuMnSn has negative formation energy FE .
@highlight Au
@highlight Mn and Sn
@highlight Mn antisite have negative FE.
@highlight Sn
@highlight Au antisite and Sn interstitial point defects have low FE.
@highlight HMF exists in AuMnSn with Sn
@highlight Au antisite and Sn interstitial point defects
