 In this paper a special experimental system was elaborately designed to probe the existence of microwave non thermal effect . Based on the experimental system the resistance of solution was precisely measured during microwave irradiation . In order to make a comparison with the results of microwave irradiation resistance and electrical conductivity were respectively measured with the same experimental system and electrical conductivity meter under conventional water bath heating . Results showed that the resistances were all decreasing with temperature rising during conventional heating process which was contrary to the results of microwave irradiation method . It proves the existence of a microwave non thermal effect .

@highlight A special experimental system was elaborately designed to probe the existence of microwave non thermal effect where the impact of temperature rising was excluded by making the solution flow at a high speed of 15m s.
@highlight Based on the experimental system the resistance and temperature of the solution were precisely measured by the Wheatstone bridge circuit and optical fiber thermometer in the process of low lever microwave irradiation.
@highlight Resistance and electrical conductivity were respectively measured with the same experimental system and electrical conductivity meter under conventional water bath heating.
