 This study employed ultraviolet images and particle data to investigate isolated auroral spots away from the Earth s auroral oval . Data from SSUSI and SSJ mounted on the DMSP spacecraft were examined . The isolated auroral spots were observed by DMSP F16 SSUSI and F17 SSUSI on 29 May 2010 during the recovery phase of a moderate geomagnetic storm with a minimum SYM H index of 70 nT . The auroral spots were observed between 18 0021 00 MLT and corotated with the Earth but stayed almost at the same magnetic latitude of 60 . It is found that the isolated auroral spots were produced mainly by energetic ring current ions at energies above 10keV . The enhancement in the electron flux with energy below 200eV was also observed for the isolated auroral spots . The MLAT of the electron flux was nearly 2higher than that for the precipitating ions .

@highlight Isolated auroral spots were observed in the evening sector and corotated with the Earth.
@highlight The isolated auroral spots were produced mainly by energetic ions with energies above 10keV.
@highlight Weak electron precipitation 200 eV was observed but the intensity was likely too weak to generate isolated auroral spots.
