 Modification of semiconductor materials by polyoxometalates is a promising strategy for increasing their photoelectrocatalytic activity . In this work we synthesized POM modified CdS composite nanocrystals based on three kinds of Keggin type mixed addendum Mo W POMs Ag

@highlight The semiconductor properties of three Keggin type mixed addendum Mo W polyoxometalates were revealed for the first time.
@highlight CdS polyoxometalate composite nanocrystals show photoelectrocatalytic performance superior to that of pure CdS nanocrystals.
@highlight The CdS PMo
@highlight composite nanocrystals exhibit the highest efficiency for the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of As III .
