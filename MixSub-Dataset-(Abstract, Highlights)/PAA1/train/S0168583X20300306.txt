 The present work reports the in situ ion beam induced luminescence measurements using 2MeV proton excitation of LiF single crystal with the aim of obtaining a further insight on F type centers kinetics and its correlation with the self trapped exciton . It is found that the STE luminescence intensity decreases from the beginning of irradiation . While the dose dependent evolution of F
