 Laser hot wire cladding is a hybrid deposition process where the wire is preheated by resistant heat during the deposition process . This process can dramatically increase the deposition efficiency and the material utilization rate . In this study a cobalt based metal cored wire was deposited by using laser hot wire cladding . The CMOS camera assisted by a green laser illumination was used to monitor the stability of the deposition process and to investigate the molten pool width and length . The effects of processing parameters such as wire feed rate and scanning speed on the clad geometrical characteristics were studied in detail . The variation of the secondary dendrite arm spacing and microhardness with different processing parameters was discussed . The microstructure and corrosion resistance of the deposited alloy were finally analyzed . It was found that the resistant heat applied on the wire was a dominate factor influencing the stability of the deposition process . The clad height could be predicted by measuring the molten pool width . The molten pool length could be used as an indicator to reflect the cooling rate of the process . The clad height wetting angle and dilution rate were all sensitive to the wire feed rate and the scanning speed . The microhardness was mainly determined by the dilution rate . A high dilution rate decreased the clad hardness . The microstructure of the deposited alloy had a typical hypo eutectic structure . An improved corrosion resistance of the deposited coating was obtained when compared to the substrate .
