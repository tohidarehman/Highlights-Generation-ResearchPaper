 The real time transmission of images through a multimode fiber is still a challenging research work . One method completes image transmission by measuring and controlling the full complex field of the MMF . Another method uses artificial neural networks to train and construct the inverse transformation matrix of the MMF . However the class of testing samples usually belongs to the same class used for the training . We propose a method that constructs the inverse transformation matrix of the MMF based on principal component analysis which can reconstruct the grayscale images of natural scene at high frame rate and high resolution . Moreover we use principal component analysis and support vector machine to classify speckle patterns and then images can be reconstructed based on the inverse transformation matrix of corresponding category . The PCA SVM PCA method shows high reconstruction accuracy with few training samples . The proposed method demonstrates general imaging capability over a MMF lengths of 1 m training time used to construct the inverse transformation matrix is short and the hardware requirements are low which provides a feasible method for the MMF endoscope imaging .

@highlight Compared with the CP method the proposed PCA method has lower hardware requirements and higher reconstruction accuracy.
@highlight In the process of image reconstruction when the class of natural scene images belong to the same class of training samples used for the construction of inverse transformation matrix the reconstructed images with higher accuracy can be obtained. The proposed PSP method with non imaging classification can achieve high reconstruction accuracy with few training samples.
@highlight In practical applications noise is inevitable for optical transmission system. The proposed PSP method has high ability to resist external noise attack.
