 Sandwich structures are commonly used in many objects e.g . deck components in bridge deck panel . Safety requirements result in development of structural health monitoring systems that are implemented into sandwich structures . Such systems based on different types of sensors that can be embedded into the structure . The paper presents THz time domain spectroscopy and imaging application for internal structure analyses of a sandwich panel with glass fibre reinforced polymer skin and polyurethane foam fulfilment . In the adhesive bond between skin and fulfilment an array of fibre Bragg grating sensors and piezoelectric transducers was embedded . The analyses were focused on detection and localisation of embedded sensors and transducers and their influence on THz wave propagation . The analysis contains differences in THz wave parameters like refractive index and absorption coefficient and image analyses . Methods that allow to detect and localise of transducers and fibre optics with FBG sensors as well as damage were proposed .
