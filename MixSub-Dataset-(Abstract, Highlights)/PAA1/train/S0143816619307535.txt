 In this article we propose a novel approach for dielectric nanograting fabrication by direct laser patterning . Possibilities of a well controlled ultra short laser recording of Ag

@highlight Single step ps laser writing allows precise formation of nanocomposite nanogratings.
@highlight The alignment of the periodic structure strongly depends on laser fluence.
@highlight Structural changes and phase transitions are caused by electrons injection from NPs.
@highlight The nanograting reflects differently when parallel or perpendicular to light incident plane.
