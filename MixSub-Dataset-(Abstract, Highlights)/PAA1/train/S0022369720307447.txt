 The porous Co based spinel composite oxides containing different transition metals were prepared by soft template method for ethanol complete oxidation in air . The physicochemical properties of the prepared oxides were characterized by XRD BET H

@highlight Porous Co based spinel oxide can be synthesized by soft template method.
@highlight The physicochemical properties of Co based spinel oxide can be effected by transition metal.
@highlight Porous Co based spinel oxide has high ethanol complete oxidation activity at low temperature.
@highlight Catalytic activity is related to the pore structure and surface reactive oxygen species.
