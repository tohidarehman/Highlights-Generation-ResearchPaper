 In this study pure and Al doped CuO nanoparticles has been synthesized using the solution combustion technique . The effect of the Al dopant on the structural surface morphological optical and electronic properties of the CuO NPs was studied . The crystalline structure of the NPs has been studied by X ray diffraction analysis . XRD studies indicate that the NPs produced are highly crystalline with tenorite phase . Al doping was found to modify the bond length and lattice strain of the CuO NPs . The surface morphology of the NPs showed formation of spherical particles for lower Al doping while at higher doping concentration agglomeration of NPs occurs and the particle size changes . A reduction in the optical band gap of the NPs was observed due to Al doping and such a red shift in the band gap can be attributed to incorporation of the Al

@highlight Pure and Al doped CuO nanoparticles NPs has been synthesized using solution combustion technique.
@highlight Al doping modify the structural parameters together with bond length lattice strain and atomic distance of the CuO NPs.
@highlight Surface morphology of the NPs showed formation of spherical particles for lower Al doping while at higher doping concentration agglomeration of NPs.
@highlight The optical band gap of the CuO NPs reduces due to Al doping.
@highlight First principles calculations based on density functional theory DFT study reveal creation of an impurity level is created within the energy gap of the NPs due to Al doping resulting in a reduction in band gap.
