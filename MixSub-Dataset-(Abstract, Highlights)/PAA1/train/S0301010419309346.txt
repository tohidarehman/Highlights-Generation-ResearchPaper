 Thione thiol tautomerization is biologically and synthetically significant proton transfer reaction . Current study analyses the effect of protic solvents on this reaction involving heterocyclic thiocarbonyl compounds having potent bioactivities such as 1 3 dihydroimidazole 2 thione 2 thiohydantoin and 2 thiouracil . The computed catalytic effect of polar protic solvents water and methanol is explained by the favorable lone pair antibonding orbital interactions which facilitates the required proton transfer . Microhydration study up to six water molecules has been carried out to get more insight into the explicit water solute interaction . It has been concluded that four water molecules are enough to model explicit water solute interaction that favorably affects the tautomerism of heterocyclic thiocarbonyl compounds . Moreover the thione formation step of the equilibrium gets relatively more facilitated by the polar protic solvents . The results are further validated by considering a reported thiol thione conversion in enzymatic decarboxylation reaction of 4 phosphopantothenoylcysteine .

@highlight Polar protic solvents facilitate thiol to thione conversions.
@highlight Tetra aquated system is enough to account for explicit solute solvent interactions.
@highlight Catalytic effect of water is validated by considering a reported enzymatic reaction.
