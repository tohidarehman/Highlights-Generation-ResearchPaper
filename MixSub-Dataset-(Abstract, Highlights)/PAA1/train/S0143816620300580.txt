 We propose and experimentally demonstrate a fiber based Bessel optical trap for the simultaneous trapping of both high refractive index particle and a low refractive index particle . We obtain the Bessel beam by incident 980nm beam into the designed integrate fiber structure which is fabricated by coaxial splice a section of step index multimode fiber to the single mode fiber . A high refractive index glass microsphere which is stuck on the tip of multimode fiber is utilized to converge the Bessel beam to produce a bright focal spot and a dark cage along the axial direction . The high refractive index particle and the low refractive index particle are trapped in the bright focal spot and the dark cage respectively . Our simulation verifies the feasibility that particles with high refractive index and low refractive index can be trapped and manipulated at the same time . The proposed optical trap which can simultaneously trap the particles with different refractive index makes it easier to manipulate cells or molecules with different properties and explore the multi molecule interaction which can facilitate the research related to biology and chemistry .

@highlight The three dimensional simultaneous trapping of the HRI and LRI particles by using a single fiber optical Bessel beam is proposed.
@highlight The structure of the proposed fiber probe is integrated simple and easy to fabricate.
