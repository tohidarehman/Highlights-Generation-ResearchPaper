 In this paper we propose a new two stage methodology which is a hybrid model based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition to predict the complex financial time series . The hybrid model comprises Multidimensional

@highlight Using weighted Euclidean distance to match patterns have higher accuracy than Euclidean distance.
@highlight MKNN method is effective for predicting high frequency IMFs.
@highlight ARMA model is effective for predicting low frequency IMFs.
@highlight In the prediction of the residual wave quadratic regression model is simple and effective.
