 Two dimensional nanocrystals with semiconducting electronic properties are emerging as promising materials for electronic devices . Here we present the density functional theory calculations of structural stability Raman spectra and electronic properties of monolayer bilayer and trilayer antimony . The cohesive energy and phonon band dispersion results revealed that free standing Sb systems are stable materials . Calculated Raman spectra showed distinct active modes thus facilitating the characterisation of multilayered structures in different stacking arrangements . It was found that high frequency in plane E

@highlight Cohesive energy and phonon band dispersion results revealed that free standing antimony Sb systems are stable materials.
@highlight The results show that AB and ABC stacked Sb are energetically more favourable than AA and AAA stacking order respectively.
@highlight Distinct Raman frequencies were seen for different stacking layers which is quite useful to identify layer thickness.
