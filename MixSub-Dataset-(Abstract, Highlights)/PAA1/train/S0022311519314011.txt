 In this paper the effects of hydrogen content and temperature on the fatigue crack initiation and propagation behavior of Zircaloy 4 are investigated by

@highlight Fatigue lifetime first increases and then decreases with hydrogen content.
@highlight At RT fatigue crack growth rate increases with hydrogen content.
@highlight Fatigue crack propagation path is affected by the hydride and grain boundary.
@highlight Hydrogen content affects the fatigue crack initiation mechanism.
