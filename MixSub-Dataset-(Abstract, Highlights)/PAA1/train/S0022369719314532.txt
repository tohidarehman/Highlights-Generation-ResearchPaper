 A novel one pot synthesis of polypyrrole reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites with the aim of assessing their potential as a cold cathode material is reported . r GO was prepared by a modified Hummers and Offeman method . The nanocomposites were characterized by transmission electron microscopy field emission scanning electron microscopy X ray diffraction Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy . The isothermal DC conductivity of PPy was found to increase by four orders of magnitude on r GO doping . The nanocomposites were explored for field emission and the results fitted well to the FowlerNordheim model of emission . The maximum values of the current density 26A cm

@highlight A novel one pot synthesis of polypyrrole PPy reduced graphene oxide r GO nanocomposites for assessing their potential as a cold cathode material in field emission based devices is reported.
@highlight Field emission scanning electron microscopy X ray diffraction Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy indicated successful intercalation of PPy within r GO sheets.
@highlight The nanocomposites were explored for field emission and extremely good field emitters with long term emission current stability were obtained.
