 Raman spectra of terephthalic acid regular TPA and deuterated TPA were recorded in the temperature range of 5300K . It is shown that temperature dependences of vibration frequencies provide both the data on proton tunneling in tautomeric bonds and the data on phonon assisted proton jumps . At the same time the quantum delocalization of proton i.e . penetration of proton density distribution function into the neighboring potential well affects the temperature dependence of the frequency of translational vibrations OO and is observed at T180K in TPA and at T170K in TPA . Proton tunneling through the barrier affects the temperature dependence of the frequency of C

@highlight Raman spectra of terephthalic acid normal and deuterated are taken in the temperature range of 5K300K.
@highlight Penetration of proton density into the neighboring potential well is observed at T180K.
@highlight Proton tunneling through the barrier is observed at T100K.
@highlight No coordinated proton deuteron jumps over the potential barrier was observed in TPA over the entire temperature range.
