 This work was part of a program begun in 2001 to develop advanced nuclear fuels originally as carriers for plutonium and minor actinides taken from spent commercial light water reactors so that the plutonium and minor actinides could be burned or transmuted in an accelerator or a fast nuclear reactor . A central part of these experiment programs has been the development of advanced fast reactor fuels because a fast reactor was considered the most efficient vehicle to transmute the actinide waste products and metallic fuels is a central focus of these tests . An experiment design was developed in which a thermal test reactor the Advanced Test Reactor was used to test small fuel pin prototypes by creating areas in the core shielded by cadmium filters to produce a largely epithermal and fast neutron spectrum environment in which the pins could be irradiated . The results of non fertile metallic fuel tests are presented here .

@highlight Post irradiation examination of nonfertile metallic fuels no uranium tests are presented here for a series of compositions with and without minor actinides.
@highlight Precision gamma scanning and fission gas release results are similar to other historical metal fuel experiments in fast reactors.
