 Online elemental analysis of irradiated tissues is an important challenge in proton therapy for estimating the depth of the Bragg peak and monitoring the healing process . In the present study the prompt gamma spectra of the most abundant elements of human tissues were obtained for two different incident protons of 30MeV and 120MeV using the Geant4 toolkit . Train phantoms were defined to study the elemental analysis of the tissue from PG spectra . It was found that the intensities of 7.12 and 3.91MeV PG depend on the mass of

@highlight Geant4 simulation of proton induced prompt gamma spectra of most abundance elements of human tissues.
@highlight Single peak analysis is applied on prompt gamma spectra for determining mass of elements in irradiated phantoms.
@highlight A new approach is proposed to deal with similarly found gamma ray peaks related to multi elements.
@highlight The estimated mass of elements are in good agreement with predefined values.
@highlight The effect of estimated mass errors on calculated proton range is small.
