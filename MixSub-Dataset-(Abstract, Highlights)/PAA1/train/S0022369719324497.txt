 Two dimensional metal carbides are attractive owing to their unique structures and promising applications . Herein we propose a one step compressive route to grow 2D iron carbide challenging the dominant exfoliation approach . First principles simulation showed that artificial compression can drive directional migration of Fe Cr and C atoms which asynchronously accumulated to form 2D hexagonal iron carbide with a stable interplanar distance of 0.39nm similar to the structure of 2D graphene . The microhardness of 2D hexagonal iron carbide was 652HV which is 1.2 times that of original orthorhombic iron carbide . Deformation of

@highlight Two dimensional iron carbide was achieved by a one step compressive route.
@highlight The microhardness of 2D hexagonal iron carbide was 652Hv which was 1.2 times that of orthorhombic iron carbide 560Hv .
@highlight Collaborative deformation of Fe C and Cr C bonds is important for the orthorhombic to hexagonal evolution of iron carbide.
@highlight The one step compressive route may open a new door for the controllable growth of defect free two dimensional materials.
