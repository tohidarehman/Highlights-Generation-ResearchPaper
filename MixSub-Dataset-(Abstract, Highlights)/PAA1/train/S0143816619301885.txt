 Conventional confocal 3D microscopes suffer from a slow measurement speed due to its requirement of scanning in three directions . Although lateral slit scanning has been proven to perform similarly to single point scanning a direct area confocal scanning microscope is commonly considered impossible as the system is reduced into a wide field microscope and loses its depth discerning capability . In this article a direct area scanning method is proposed for 3D surface profilometry based on a tilted focal field . To demonstrate the underlying principle theoretical analysis is conducted with simulation result showing that depth discerning capability can be maintained in area scanning when the tilting angle is specifically chosen according to the numerical aperture of the system . An adaptive experimental setup is constructed based on a programmable light source and a programmable array microscope with chromatic axial encoding . Measurement result of a test target using the proposed method is comparable to the result of conventional array scanning . Although the axial uncertainty is increased by a factor of approximately 2.5 the direct area scanning method is more than 300 times faster than the conventional array scanning mode of the same setup .
