 A novel green tea extractencapsulated silica gel decorated with in situgenerated Pd nanoparticles is reported as an efficient green heterogeneous catalyst in the Buchwald Hartwig CN cross coupling reaction . It was characterized by several analytical techniques . Thereafter a wide range of aryl amines were synthesized in good to excellent yields by reaction of different substituted aryl halides and secondary amines over the catalyst . The material is sufficiently stable and could be used at least six times in a model Buchwald Hartwig reaction without noticeable change in its catalytic activity . Heterogeneity of the catalyst was examined by a hot filtration test .

@highlight In situgenerated palladium nanoparticles anchored to green tea extractcoated silica gel.
@highlight Excellent performance as a reusable catalyst in Buchwald Hartwig CN cross coupling reactions.
@highlight Excellent yield of the products.
@highlight Catalyst used up to six times.
