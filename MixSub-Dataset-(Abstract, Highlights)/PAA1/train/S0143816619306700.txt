 Intense research has recently been carried out in the study of three dimensional light bullets . Based on the experimental approach for obtaining Airy Bessel light bullets by Chong etal we propose a theoretical methodology for obtaining and analyzing vectorial three dimensional bullets . First of all we present the design criteria of binary micro zonal plates that make it possible to obtain Airy Airy bullets with sub diffraction main lobe width . Following the vectorial diffraction theory we analyze Airy Airy vectorial bullets generated by illuminating the designed BZP with temporal Airy circular polarized pulses . The propagation dynamics of the resulting vectorial light bullets have been studied the width of the resulting FWHM of the spatial main lobe at the focal plane being close to 0.75
