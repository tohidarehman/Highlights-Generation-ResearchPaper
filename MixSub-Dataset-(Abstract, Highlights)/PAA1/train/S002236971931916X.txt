 Oxidizing graphite to graphene oxide through non explosive oxidizing mixture at 55C is reported with high yield . GO was anchored with NiS ZnS and CdS metallic sulfide nanoparticles in 1 1 ratio at 85C . MSNPs were obtained by using chloride salts of Ni Zn and Cd metals with thiourea in 1 3 ratio in aqueous GO for
