 Ageing of Cast Austenitic Stainless Steels was attributed to the decomposition of the ferrite by spinodal decomposition and precipitation of G phase particles . This leads to an increase in hardness and a decrease in Charpy impact energy . It is possible to restore the mechanical properties of these steels by annealing treatment above the Fe Cr miscibility gap in order to dissolve phase . In this work an annealing treatment for 2h at 550C followed by water quenching was applied to various Mo free and Mo bearing steels . This treatment allowed to restore almost completely the mechanical properties of Mo free steels and partly Mo bearing steels regardless of the initial ageing time . The mechanical property changes were attributed to the complete dissolution of spinodal decomposition and complete or partial dissolution of G phase particles . After annealing a re ageing kinetics was studied . The preexisting G phase particles have minor influence on the kinetic of spinodal decomposition until 2 400h at 400C .
