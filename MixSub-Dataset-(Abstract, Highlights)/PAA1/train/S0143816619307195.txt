 This report presents a proposal of a new technique to estimate the cross sectional absorption distribution of turbid media from backscattered light by solving a nonlinear inverse problem . After illuminating a beam of light on the surface of a turbid object and measuring the backscattered light as a function of distance from the light incident point we divide the object into multiple virtual layers to estimate the absorption distribution . The path lengths of photon propagation in the respective layers are calculated using Monte Carlo simulation . The absorption coefficient of each virtual layer can be estimated from the backscattered intensity and the path length distribution in a depth direction . For solving this inverse problem the linear calculation results are useful as initial solutions . Then the final solutions are obtained from iteration of the nonlinear calculation . Convergence into a unique solution and robustness of the solution against the measurement noise were confirmed . The effectiveness of the proposed technique was verified through simulation and measurement . By lateral scanning of a sourcedetector pair we can reconstruct a cross sectional image of the turbid medium to the depth to which the detected light reaches .
