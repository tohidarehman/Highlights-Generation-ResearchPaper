 The thermoelectric materials that work in radioisotope thermoelectric generators or space reactor power sources will be exposed to neutron irradiation and gamma irradiation for a long time . Herein the influences of neutron irradiation doses between 10

@highlight Neutron irradiation with dose of 10
@highlight n cm
@highlight  10
@highlight n cm
@highlight induces defects in SiGe.
@highlight Electrical conductivity decreases to 0.014 0.14 of the pristine value after 10
@highlight n cm
@highlight neutron irradiation.
@highlight Themoelectric properties can be recovered after heat treatment.
@highlight Neutron induced damage is worse in n type SiGe than in p type SiGe.
@highlight 10
@highlight Gy gamma irradiation has no influence on themoelectric properties of SiGe.
