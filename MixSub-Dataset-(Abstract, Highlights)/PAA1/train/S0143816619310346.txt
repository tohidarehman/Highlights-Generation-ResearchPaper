 We propose a wrapped phase denoising method based on convolutional neural networks which can effectively denoise a noisy wrapped phase . The noisy numerator and denominator of the arctangent function are firstly denoised by CNN and then the filtered numerator and denominator use the arctangent function to obtain the clean wrapped phase . We experimentally verify the denoising performance using various wrapped phase that contains different noise conditions where the denoised wrapped phase can achieve a satisfactory unwrapping performance using the existing simple unwrapping method . In addition the proposed method is further demonstrated through the comparison of the existing methods and shows an accurate denoising result without adjusting any parameters .

@highlight The proposed denoising method can eliminate severe noise in a wrapped phase. In the current network noise level up to a signal to noise ratio SNR value of 4dB can be successfully removed.
@highlight After CNN denoising a wrapped phase can be easily unwrapped using an existing simple unwrapping method.
@highlight The proposed denoising method is shown to be effective through extensive comparisons with the average filter median filter and windowed Fourier filtering. The proposed method outperforms the conventional average filter and median filter and performs similarly to windowed Fourier filtering. The feasibility of phase unwrapping strategy is demonstrated by comparing with an existing deep learning unwrapping method.
@highlight The proposed denoising method is able to directly provide denoising result without adjusting any parameters.
