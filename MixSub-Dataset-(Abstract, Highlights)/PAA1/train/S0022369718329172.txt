 In this work surface metallization of cotton fabrics was performed by electroless plating using a shorter route than is conventional . The fabric surface was activated by deposition of silver and copper nanoparticles and then a thin layer of copper was coated using electroless plating . The performance of coated fabrics was compared in terms of electrical conductivity electromagnetic interference shielding Joule heating and antibacterial properties with another sample coated with conventional electroless plating . The orthogonal array testing strategy was adopted to optimize the various factors of the electroless plating bath . The samples prepared by electroless plating of copper showed greater performance for the fabric first deposited with silver particles than those first deposited with copper particles or conventionally treated . Samples of copper electroplating over silver had surface resistivity of 20 EMI shielding of 75.53dB and Joule heating of 83.1C . Moreover samples with modified electroless plating showed better attachment of the metal layer and therefore longer durability .
