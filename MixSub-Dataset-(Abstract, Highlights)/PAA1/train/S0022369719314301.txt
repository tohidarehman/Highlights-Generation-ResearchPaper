 We report the facile in situ doping of soluble conducting polypyrrole with cadmium sulfide quantum dots aimed at tuning the mid infrared photoconductivity of PPy films with a planer structure . The doping was done during chemical polymerization of PPy with different mass ratios of the as synthesized CdS QDs . The PPy CdS QDs films were fabricated by electrospray coating between gold interdigitated electrodes . The incident light in the MIR region 7.62mW cm

@highlight Doping of soluble polypyrrole PPy with CdS quantum dots QDs during chemical polymerization.
@highlight Electrospray coating of PPy doped with CdS QDs as photosensitive film with a planer structure.
@highlight QDs doping enhanced the mid infrared photoconductivity of PPy film in the optimum conditions.
@highlight Good photosensitivity good repeatability and independent response in the mid infrared region were achieved.
