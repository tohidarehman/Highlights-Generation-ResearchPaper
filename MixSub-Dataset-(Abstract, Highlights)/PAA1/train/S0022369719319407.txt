 Electrochemical properties of porous nickel foam electrodeposited zinc on Ni foam and electrodeposited reduced graphene oxide on NiZn foam electrodes in 6M KOH electrolyte were investigated . Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic chargedischarge cycling techniques were used to carry out the redox interactions and cycling capacitive properties of the electrodes in KOH solution . Platinum and gold foil were used as a counter electrode and the current collector in the electrochemical measurements respectively . The specific capacitances of the electrodes were found from the GCD measurements as 155 722 and 1820F g for Ni NiZn and NiZn rGO electrodes at the current density of 1 A g respectively . Scanning electron microscope images of the three electrodes were also taken into account to associate all the electrochemical measurements . These results clearly show that specific capacitance values highly increased after the deposition of Zn and rGO to Ni electrode .
