 In this work numerical calculations have been employed to investigate the adsorption equilibrium state of hydrogen atoms on tungsten surface . The surface energy and relevant surface atomic density of different W surfaces are obtained through the empirical potential model . The calculations show that the higher surface atomic densities correspond to the more stable surfaces of which the most stable surface is the W surface . The H adsorption energies are systematically analyzed by density functional theory . The equilibrium concentration dependence for adsorption upon H coverage a temperature range from 300K to 1100K and a pressure range from 10

@highlight Surface energies of various W surface are determined.
