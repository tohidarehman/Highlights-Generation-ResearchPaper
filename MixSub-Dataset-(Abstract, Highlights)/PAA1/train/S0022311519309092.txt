 The effects of alpha radiation on cementitious systems used for nuclear waste encapsulation and the subsequent physico chemical properties have been subject to limited investigation comparative to the effects of gamma and neutron irradiations . This paper outlines an assessment of the impact of PuO

@highlight PuO
@highlight was encapsulated in BFS PFA blended cements used for nuclear waste disposal.
@highlight Cellulose was added to the systems to investigate the effects of organics.
@highlight No large scale microstructural defects were observed and good physical contact between the PuO
@highlight and grout was seen.
@highlight Changes to the phase assemblage were noted in BFS containing grouts.
@highlight Radiolytic gas evolution was consistent with expectations with increased values observed for samples containing cellulose.
