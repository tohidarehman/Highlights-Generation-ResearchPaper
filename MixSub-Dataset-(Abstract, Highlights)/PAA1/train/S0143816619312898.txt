 Whispering gallery mode microcavities have a small mode volume a high quality factor and great application potential in the field of integrated optics . The coupling of light into microcavities has attracted wide attention in the development of optical filters sensors and low threshold lasers . WGM microcavities based on different coupling methods have promising applications for lasing and high precision sensing . In a WGM coupling system the coupling method determines the coupling efficiency
