 The development of multicomponent Al Bi alloys is an alternative approach to control either separation or morphology of the phases forming their microstructures . Furthermore addition of alloying elements in Al Bi alloys has been settled to pursue an optimized combination of wear resistance and mechanical strength . In the present investigation solidification conditions are deduced from temperature measurements and the microstructure is thoroughly characterized . The results highlight the impact of the solidification conditions on the Bi distribution and macrosegregation . A relation is established between Bi droplet spacing and wear resistance and a comparison with previous experiments on Al Bi Cu alloys is outlined . It is found that both Bi segregation and spacing between globules of Bi control the wear resistance of the Zn containing alloy . Despite the similarities of Bi spacings if Cu and Zn containing alloys are compared the wear resistance of the Cu containing alloy is higher .

@highlight Cooling rates higher than 5K s and Bi segregation produced unchanged Bi spacing.
@highlight Microstructure is formed by Bi globules and lamellar AlFeSi particles within Al.
@highlight A single wear performance relationship was proposed.
@highlight Superior wear property was found for the Al Bi Cu if compared with the Al Bi Zn alloy.
