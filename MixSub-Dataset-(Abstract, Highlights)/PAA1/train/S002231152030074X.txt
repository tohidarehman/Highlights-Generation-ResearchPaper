 In search for alternative cementitious materials for radioactive waste encapsulation geopolymers and inorganic polymers have received wide attention . Moreover Fe rich IPs offer an interesting alternative to high density concretes for use in radiation shielding applications . Materials can however be altered when subjected to ionizing radiation creating the necessity to evaluate the materials behaviour under irradiation conditions . In this study the effect of high dose rate gamma irradiation is investigated on CaO Fe

@highlight Iron rich slag based IPs were irradiated with a 8.85kGy h
@highlight Co source.
@highlight The curing time before irradiation affects the materials response.
@highlight We observed strengthening of IPs associated to radiation induced iron oxidation.
