 The icy moons are in the focus of the exploration plans of the leading space agencies because of the indications of water based life and geological activity observed in a number of these objects . In particular the presence of geyser like jets of water near Enceladus south pole has turned this moon of Saturn into a priority candidate to search for life and habitability features . This investigation proposes a set of trajectories between Halo orbits about Lagrangian points

@highlight Design of shadow heteroclinics between Halo orbits of Saturn Enceladus.
@highlight Performance of shadow heteroclinics as science orbits is assessed.
@highlight Ranges times of flight surface coverage and speeds are computed.
@highlight Solutions offer long uninterrupted views of south pole at low speeds.
