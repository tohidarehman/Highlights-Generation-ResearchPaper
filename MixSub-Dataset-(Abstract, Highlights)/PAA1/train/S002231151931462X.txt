 Under nuclear fusion environments displacement cascades in the potential first protective wall material vanadium and its alloys lead to a large number of point defects . As sink of point defects grain boundaries are observed to significantly affect the radiation resistance of structured metals . By using potential energy surface searching tools the interaction between the interstitial loaded 3 110 111 symmetric tilt grain boundary and the point defects in V based alloy is investigated . For the self interstitial atoms loaded STGB the vacancy located within certain distances from the STGB can be effectively annihilated within several nanoseconds via the interstitial emission mechanism . If an alloy doping interstitial as a Cr atom substitute the SIA or the vacancy is stabilized by alloy solutes as Ti atoms forming a solute vacancy complex near the STGB IE works more effectively with lower activation energy barriers and less thermal activation time . The results indicate that the STGB induced IE mechanism raises the radiation resistance of the V based alloy . The results contribute to the micro structure and constituent optimizations in designing an excellent V based first protective wall material .

@highlight For the first time the self healing mechanism induced by grain boundary in an alloy is revealed.
@highlight The self healing mechanism is confirmed to be the interstitial emission which recombines point defects at long time scale.
@highlight The alloy studied is VCrTi ternary alloy which is expected to be a promising first protective wall material.
@highlight The solute vacancy complexes promoted by non equilibrium segregation near a GB are focused and proved to facilitate IE.
@highlight The uncovered differences between the effects of Cr and Ti on IE is beneficial to designing an V based alloy.
