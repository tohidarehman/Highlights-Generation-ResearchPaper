 Discrete time dynamics mainly arising in boreal and temperate ecosystems for species with non overlapping generations have been largely studied to understand the dynamical outcomes due to changes in relevant ecological parameters . The local and global dynamical behaviour of many of these models is difficult to investigate analytically in the parameter space and typically numerical approaches are employed when the dimension of the phase space is large . In this article we provide topological and dynamical results for a map modelling a discrete time three species food chain with two predator species interacting on the same prey . The domain where dynamics live is characterised as well as the so called escaping regions which involve species extinctions . We also provide a full description of the local stability of equilibria within a volume of the parameter space given by the preys growth rate and the predation rates . We have found that the increase of the pressure of predators on the prey results in chaos via a supercritical Neimark Sacker bifurcation . Then period doubling bifurcations of invariant curves take place . Interestingly an increasing predation directly on preys can shift the extinction of top predators to their survival allowing an unstable persistence of the three species by means of periodic and chaotic attractors .

@highlight We investigate a dicrete time dynamical system describing the dynamics of two predators interacting with the same prey.
@highlight Local and global stability features of the dynamics are provided.
@highlight The fixed points and the bifurcations are analytically characterised in a domain of the parameter space containing relevant biological dynamics.
@highlight A deep analysis of the chaotic dynamics is provided by means of the full spectrum of Lyapunov exponents.
