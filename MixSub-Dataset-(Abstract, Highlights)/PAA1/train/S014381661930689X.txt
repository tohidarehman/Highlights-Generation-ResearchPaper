 In the present study the applicability of the digital image correlation method in deriving the notch stress intensity factors is examined for sharp V notched components under mixed mode I II loading . For this purpose in the first step the analytical mixed mode stress and displacement fields around the sharp V notches and the concept of NSIFs are presented . Then in the second step the V notched diagonally loaded square plate specimen is chosen for performing the DIC experiments . Three different notch opening angles with four various combinations of mode I and mode II loadings are considered for the V DLSP specimens tested . Subsequently in the third step the DIC method is employed to determine the experimental displacement fields in the V DLSP samples . Finally the displacement fields obtained experimentally from the DIC technique are fitted to the analytical displacement field to derive the NSIFs of sharp V notches by using a numerical method called the over deterministic method . Comparing the results obtained from DIC method with those obtained from the finite element analysis shows the effectiveness of DIC method in determining the stress field around sharp V notches .
