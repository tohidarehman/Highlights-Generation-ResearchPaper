 Various sensors in Internet of things capture many images and there is growing concern about their secure storing and sharing . Compressed sensing is a promising solution for this problem . However traditional CS based security frameworks only provide computational secrecy with high reconstruction complexities . In this paper we propose a low complexity privacy preserving scheme based on CS and non negative matrix factorization to protect image privacy while maintaining the utility of data . Specifically CS is used to compress and encrypt the data and then noise is added to improve security . At the same time the basis matrix generated by NMF is used to construct a decoding matrix and a decryption matrix . For legitimate users with the decoding matrix the low dimensional data of the original signal can be obtained through simple matrix multiplication without complex reconstruction which can be used for subsequent mining processing . For legitimate users with the decryption matrix the approximation of the original signal can be obtained by only one time matrix multiplication . Compared with other traditional schemes the proposed one avoids the complex reconstruction and ensures the utility of data without revealing the privacy . Experiments and analyses verify the merits of our design in both privacy protection and computational complexity .

@highlight We propose a privacy preserving scheme based on CS which can achieve both the utility of data and privacy preserving.
@highlight By adding noise the security of CS is increased without affecting decoding.
@highlight Authorized users can directly obtain the dimension reduced data or the approximation of original signal through a matrix multiplication rather than the complex processes.
