 Dispersion strengthened tungsten materials represent a new class of W based materials to be investigated for use as plasma facing component in nuclear fusion reactors . However the retention and permeation characteristics of these materials under low energy deuterium irradiation need to be elucidated before the efficacy of these materials can be judged . Due to possible deep penetration of D in W depth profile techniques such as glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy are needed to probe D concentrations many microns beneath the material surface . In this study the D retention behavior of W materials containing 110wt TaC TiC or ZrC are investigated with GD OES . After exposure to a 510
