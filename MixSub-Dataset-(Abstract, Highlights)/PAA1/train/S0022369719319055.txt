 Pure and co doped multiferroic bismuth ferrite nanoparticles were synthesized by the sol gel method . Samarium and cobalt were used as co dopants in BFO . The co doped composites had the formula Bi

@highlight Bismuth ferrite co doped with Sm and Co was synthesized and the crystallite size was found to decrease from 66 to 23 nm.
@highlight The co doped samples showed enhanced saturation magnetization and remanent magnetization of 3.2 and 1.5 emu g respectively.
@highlight The maximum polarization and remanent polarization were 12.5 and 7.5 C cm2 respectively.
@highlight The resistive properties decreased considerably at low frequency and remained almost constant at high frequency.
@highlight AC conductivity increased nonlinearly at high frequency and exhibited nearly invariable behavior at low frequency.
