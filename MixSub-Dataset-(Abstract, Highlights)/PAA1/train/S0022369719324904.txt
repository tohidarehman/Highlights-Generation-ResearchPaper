 In this study we developed an instrumental hybrid catalytic system comprising cellulose fiber and volcanic pumice powder which was applied as a suitable organicinorganic hybrid catalyst for the synthesis of 2 4 5 triarylimidazole derivatives . High reaction yields were obtained in short reaction times using this catalytic system . In physical terms the high porosity of pumice provides an extremely high active surface area for electronic interactions among the components . Moreover the most distinctive properties of this catalytic system are high biodegradability simple separation of the catalyst and good reusability . The natural pumice can be recovered easily using an external magnet and reused with no significant decline in the catalytic activity . The structural characteristics of this efficient catalytic system were assessed using various analytical methods .
