 Porous carbon originate d from Metal Organic Frameworks has attracted the attention of scholars because it inherits large specific surface area plenty of pore structure and adjustable morphology . Here we reported N doped porous carbon with hierarchical pore structure obtained from nickel based metal organic framework . Due to its exceptional porosity N doped nature and large surface area the NPC exhibited superior electrochemical storage performance for lithium ion batteries . The resulting NPC material achieves excellent reversible capacity 725mAh g

@highlight A flexible strategy is exploit to fabricate Nitrogen doped Porous Carbon NPC .
@highlight The NPC have hierarchical pore structures which can accelerate the diffusion of Li
@highlight The NPC exhibits high specific capacity and good rate performance.
@highlight The synthesis route provides a new perspective to produce NPC.
