 A broadband piezoelectric energy harvester with a mechanically tunable potential function is modeled and analytically analyzed . The harvester consisting of a beam and a pre compression spring at one end can be tuned to both monostable and bistable configurations . The axial motion of the beam resulting from the transverse vibration and spring load induces two coupled higher order terms of displacement velocity and acceleration into the governing equations . This significantly complicates the theoretical analysis especially the stability analysis of solutions . Harmonic balance method is employed to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the nonlinear energy harvester . An effective approach is developed to solve the entries of the Jacobian matrix for determining the stability of analytical solutions . This approach offers a criterion for solution stability analysis of congeneric nonlinear systems with coupled higher order terms . The energy harvesting performance and the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the proposed PEH are explored for various base excitation levels electrical resistive loads and pre deformations of the spring . The approximate analytical solutions are validated by numerical simulations . Results demonstrate that the energy harvesting performance of the proposed PEH could be effectively tuned by the pre deformation of the spring . The proposed PEH could harvest vibration energy in a wide frequency range of 091Hz at the excitation level of 0.5g .
