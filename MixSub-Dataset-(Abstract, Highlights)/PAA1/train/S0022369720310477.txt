 Solid nitrogen has received widespread attention . In this paper the calculated structural electronic phonon and mechanical properties are used to investigate the phase transition of solid nitrogen space group P4

@highlight First principles calculated phonons of tetragonal solid nitrogen under pressure.
@highlight Negative group velocity is considered to be the structural phase transition velocity.
@highlight The phase transition starts at a b axis along
@highlight direction.
