 The active controllable metasurfaces based on electromagnetically induced transparency have attracted great interest in the research of terahertz functional devices . We demonstrate a dual mode controllable terahertz metasurface based on complementary plasmon induced reflection structure . Both photosensitive silicon and monolayer graphene are integrated into the unit cell to realize the active control of the EIT like reflection window and the whole resonance modulated by optical pumping and extra electrical voltage respectively . The excellent properties of the modulation depth and the group delay highlight this metasurfaces in the applications of terahertz modulators and slow light devices . Moreover this dual mode modulation in one design provides a good way of commercial terahertz multi functional devices .

@highlight In order to promote the applications of commercial terahertz multi functional devices. This work present a plasmon induced reflection metasurfaces with dual mode modulation.
@highlight The device can control by optical pumping and extra electric field and these two methods can regulate the bright and dark mode independently.
@highlight This work not only gives the simulation results but also gives a practical scheme in the experiment and further clarify this result in the theoretical calculation.
@highlight The multi functional devices with more than two control modes are rarely reported. This work will advance the field of multicontrol and multi functional devices.
