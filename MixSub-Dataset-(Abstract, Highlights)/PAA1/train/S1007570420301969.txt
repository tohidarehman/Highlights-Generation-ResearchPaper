 In this paper a system with energy harvester behavior is modeled by non smooth coupled oscillators subjected to harmonic and random excitations . A modified harmonic balance method is proposed to study the dynamics of the oscillators under harmonic driving . Then the probabilistic response of the system under bounded and colored noise excitations is tackled through the stochastic averaging method . We show that the proposed modified harmonic balance technique is very effective in parameters regime for which the system output waveform is nearly sinusoidal . In this parameters regime the harvester performance is improved for optimum nonlinear magnetic coupling coefficients and for weak nonlinearities and damping in the harvester mechanical part . Under random excitations we find in the weak parameters regime that the probability density functions for the coupled oscillators amplitudes illustrate a single peak mode and exhibit phenomenological transitions as the noisy excitations parameters vary . The mean output powers linearly increase with the colored noises intensities and the piezoelectric MOP especially shows a resonance effect as the bounded noise level increases . Contrariwise probed with Monte Carlo simulation we find that the system exhibits the stochastic P bifurcation for large parameters of coupling and nonlinearity parameters regime for which the harvester under purely harmonic driving demonstrates low performance .
