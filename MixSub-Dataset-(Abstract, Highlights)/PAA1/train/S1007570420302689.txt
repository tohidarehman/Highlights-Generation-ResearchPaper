 We investigate throughout this paper the effect of inhomogeneity on the propagation of solitons in ferromagnetic systems governing the magnetization evolution in a magnetic medium . Indeed we focus our attention on a nonlinear evolution equation derived by M. Saravanan and A. Arnaudon 2018 Phys . Lett . A

@highlight An integral modified KdV equation is considered.
@highlight The KdV equation is solved for the solitons solutions using perturbation technique.
@highlight The effect of inhomogeneity is studied and show deformed soliton excitation.
