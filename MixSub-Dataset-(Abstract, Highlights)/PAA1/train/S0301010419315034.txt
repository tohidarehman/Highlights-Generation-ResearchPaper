 Based on first principles calculations the adsorption and diffusion behavior of non noble and noble metal single atom on graphyne were performed . The hole formed by 12C hexagon ring was found to be the most stable adsorption site . Strong interactions were also verified by bader charge analyses charge difference density and density of states . Furthermore the diffusion properties and growth modes of single metal adatoms were studied . With the adsorption on the most stable site getting stronger the diffusion will get more difficult . The single adatoms diffuse difficultly at room temperature except Pd adatom . Moreover results imply that Fe Co Cu Ru Rh Pt and Pd adatoms present a tendency to grow 3D cluster while Ni adatom shows a tendency to grow 2D metal sheet at high concentration . Results imply graphyne could be a promise candidate substrate for most transition metal atoms .

@highlight The hole formed by 12C hexagon ring was the most stable adsorption site.
@highlight With the adsorption on H1 getting stronger the diffusion will get harder.
