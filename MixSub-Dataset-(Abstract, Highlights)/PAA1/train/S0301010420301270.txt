 Resin was divided into five subfractions by precipitation method of mixed solvents . The effects of molecular size concentration and polarity of resin and its subfractions on dynamic interfacial tensions of alkylbenzene sulfonate solutions were investigated . The results showed that the resin subfractions with larger molecular size had a slight effect on DIFTs and DIFTs curves showed the L shape no matter what polarity or concentration . For resin and its subfractions with smaller molecular size they had a significant effect on DIFTs at higher concentrations DIFTs curves showed the V shape . However the variations of minimum interfacial tension IFT

@highlight The effects of resin and its subfractions on DIFTs of ABS solutions.
@highlight The DIFTs curves changed from the L shape to the V shape.
@highlight Resin with smaller molecular size and higher polarity resulted in lower IFT
