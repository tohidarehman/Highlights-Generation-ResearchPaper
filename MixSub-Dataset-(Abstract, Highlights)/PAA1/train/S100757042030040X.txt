 We establish a time stepping learning algorithm and apply it to predict the solution of the partial differential equation of motion in micromagnetism as a dynamical system depending on the external field as parameter . The data driven approach is based on nonlinear model order reduction by use of kernel methods for unsupervised learning yielding a predictor for the magnetization dynamics without any need for field evaluations after a data generation and training phase as precomputation . Magnetization states from simulated micromagnetic dynamics associated with different external fields are used as training data to learn a low dimensional representation in so called feature space and a map that predicts the time evolution in reduced space . Remarkably only two degrees of freedom in feature space were enough to describe the nonlinear dynamics of a thin film element . The approach has no restrictions on the spatial discretization and might be useful for fast determination of the response to an external field .

@highlight A nonlinear data driven model reduction approach for predicting the solution of the micromagnetic equation of motion LLG equation with the field as parameter is established which represents a novel computational methodology in the community.
@highlight The learning problem is tackled by a non blackbox linear regression in feature space opposed to black box neural network approaches.
@highlight A drastically reduced predictor model consisting of only two kernel principal components was enough to describe the nonlinear dynamics of a thin film benchmark problem.
