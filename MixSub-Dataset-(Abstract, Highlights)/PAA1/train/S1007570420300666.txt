 A new type of spiral wave caused by the pitchfork bifurcation of a limit cycle is reported which may exist in ecosystems containing two species that are not symbiotic . The dynamical behavior of the spiral wave is explained by a superposition principle of disturbance intensity vectors in oscillatory media . This type of spiral wave is characterized by a slow moving line defect that passes through the spiral center . The line defect disturbs the local phase waves whose disturbance can be superposed with the disturbance coming from the spiral core . This superposition principle of disturbance intensity vectors provides a new theory and method for studying the pattern formation in oscillation media . On the one hand our findings shed light on the dynamics of the pattern formation on the other we predict a type of spiral wave which has not been found in nature or laboratories to date and provide directions and guidances for ecological researches about ecosystems containing two species that are not symbiotic .

@highlight A new type of spiral wave is reported which may exist in ecosystems containing two or more species that are not symbiotic.
@highlight A line defect that passing through the spiral center moves very slowly which disturbs the local phase waves.
@highlight The disturbance of the line defect can be superposed with the disturbance coming from the spiral core.
@highlight A superposition principle of disturbance intensity vectors is presented.
