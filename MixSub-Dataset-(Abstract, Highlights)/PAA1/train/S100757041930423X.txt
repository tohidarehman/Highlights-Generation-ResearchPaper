 When network users are interacting intensively by sending large amount of packets during window time handling and transmitting generated data can be challenging without violating quality of service as network resources are limited . As data packets flow has different regime and incoming packets arrival rate depends on users behavior we propose in this paper to analyze the predator prey interaction occurring between two users packets flows traveling network segment considering incoming packets as newborn and queuing packets as adult population using a modified Hutchinson interactive model . We focused our analysis on interaction outcome by performing qualitative studies of the proposed model . Theoretical analyses suggest adopting different queuing strategy and hybrid resources allocation by taking into account users behavior to enhance forwarding performance and improve transmission efficiency .

@highlight Forwarding a given packet requires a decision making process that can be simple or extremely complex depending on the situation.
@highlight In the proposed model we added Holling type II term in prey equation for better control of populations growth and time the predator needs to assimilate captured preys.
@highlight Different aged packets can be handled by network segment during window time as far as allocated resources are not exhausted and network is not congested.
