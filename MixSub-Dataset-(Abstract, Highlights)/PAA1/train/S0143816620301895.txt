 For many three dimensional measurement techniques based on fringe projection profilometry measuring the objects with a large variation range of surface reflectivity is always a very tricky problem due to the limited dynamic range of camera . Many high dynamic range 3D measurement methods are developed for static scenes which are fragile for dynamic objects . In this paper we address the problem of phase information loss in HDR scenes in order to enable 3D reconstruction from saturated or dark images by deep learning . By using a specifically designed convolutional neural network we can accurately extract phase information in both the low signal to noise ratio and saturation situations after proper training . Experimental results demonstrate the success of our network in 3D reconstruction for both static and dynamic HDR objects . Our method can improve the dynamic range of three step phase shifting by a factor of 4.8 without any additional projected images or hardware adjustment during measurement . And the final 3D measurement speed of our method is about 13.89Hz .

@highlight In this paper we first attempted to introduce deep learning into the high dynamic range HDR 3D shape measurement to solve the dilemma between high speed and HDR in the conventional N step phase shifting.
