 In this work a discretized two dimensional Leslie Gower prey predator model is investigated . The results for the existence and uniqueness and the conditions for the local asymptotic stability of the solutions are determined . It is also exhibited that the discrete system undergoes Neimark Sacker flip and fold bifurcation under certain conditions . The discretized system exhibits wide range of complex dynamical behavior viz . periodicity quasi periodicity and chaos with respect to different parameters . Further three control methods state feedback pole placement and hybrid control are deployed to control the chaos in the system . Under certain conditions chaos and bifurcation of the system are stabilized through the control strategies . The extensive numerical simulation is done to demonstrate the analytical findings .

@highlight A fractional ordered Leslie Gower prey predator model is studied. Jury stability test is applied to get certain conditions for occurrence of Neimark Sacker bifurcation flip bifurcation and fold bifurcation.
@highlight A wide range of dynamics viz. periodic solution quasi periodicity and chaos is obtained.
@highlight Three chaos control techniques State feedback pole placement and hybrid control are implemented in order to reduce the complexity of the system.
@highlight State feedback and pole placement technique restore the stability for a certain range of parameters although hybrid control technique works effectively.
