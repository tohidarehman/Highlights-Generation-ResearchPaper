 The effect of Coronal Mass Ejection and Corotating Interaction Region driven storms on the occurrence of ionospheric irregularities over the African equatorial and low latitude region are studied statistically for the first time . In addition to the CME and CIRs catalogs we have used the disturbance storm time

@highlight The SP in the OIIs during CME and CIR driven storms are more prevalent than the EN.
@highlight The EN SP and NE of CME and CIR storms on the OIIs show dependence on the LT at which the storm main phase occurs.
@highlight The SP in the OIIs during CME and CIR storms show a positive and linear correlation with solar activity represented by SSN.
