 Molecular dynamics simulations have been employed to simulate the deposition process of Cu and Ni atoms on the Ni substrate with the different compositions in the Cu

@highlight As Cu content in Cu
@highlight Ni
@highlight film rises the lattice constant of deposited CuNi film increases.
@highlight The high shear strain area of the Cu
@highlight Ni
@highlight  Ni substrate propagates to interface in the indentation process.
@highlight The force hardness of Cu
@highlight Ni
@highlight  Ni substrate decreases as increasing the content Cu and temperature.
@highlight The force hardness of Cu
@highlight Ni
@highlight  Ni substrate increases as increasing the loading velocity.
@highlight The dislocations density increases as increasing the temperature and the loading velocity.
