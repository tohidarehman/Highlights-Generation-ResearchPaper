 Zinc oxide nanoparticles was synthesized using the traditional hydrothermal method and its characterization as well as adsorption performance of heavy metal ions were studied . X ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared confirmed hexagonal structures and functional groups . N

@highlight Characterization of ZnO NPs via different tools analysis.
@highlight ZnO NPs possess the property of selective removal of heavy metal ions from dental wastewater.
@highlight High removal performance was achieved in the wide pH range of 37.
@highlight Study of the Cr
@highlight ions adsorption on kinetic and isotherm models.
