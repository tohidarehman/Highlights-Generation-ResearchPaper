 In this paper dynamics of higher order localized waves for a coupled nonlinear Schrdinger equation are investigated . Based on the generalized Darboux transformation the first to the third order interactional localized wave solutions are derived through algebraic iteration . Specially the new form of seed solutions is supposed which is related to the normalized distance and retarded time . Many novel dynamic structures are demonstrated in the localized waves particularly the third order localized ones where rogue waves coexist with dark bright solitons and breathers in the three dimensional plots . Furthermore the classification of the
