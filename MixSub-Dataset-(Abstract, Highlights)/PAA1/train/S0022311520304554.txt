 Precipitation hardening by precipitates is an effective strengthening mechanism for designing novel high entropy alloys . The stability of these precipitates under elevated temperature irradiation is a major concern for their application in nuclear industry . In the present study a strengthened FeCoNiCrTi

@highlight A strengthened FeCoNiCrTi
@highlight HEA is irradiated with 6.4MeV Fe
@highlight ions at 400C 500 C and 600 C.
@highlight Disordering and dissolution of precipitates are characterized by transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography.
@highlight The ordered L1
@highlight structure of precipitate is susceptible to the radiation damage.
@highlight The behavior of precipitates under irradiation is believed to be controlled by displacement damage and radiation enhanced diffusion.
