 The reactivity of cold gas phase clusters was investigated as a model for chemical evolution in interstellar molecular clouds . Chiral recognition using ions between amino acids and sugars was examined by mass spectrometry and ultraviolet spectroscopy measurements of gas phase tryptophan enantiomers hydrogen bonded with methyl

@highlight Cold gas phase clusters were investigated as a model for interstellar molecular clouds.
@highlight The chiral recognition mechanism changed with the photoexcitation wavelength.
@highlight Enantiomers of biological molecules could be selected in interstellar molecular clouds.
