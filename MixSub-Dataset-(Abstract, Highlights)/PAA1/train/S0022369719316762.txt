 As a sensitive analytical technique surface enhanced Raman scattering is widely used in spectral analysis single molecule detection and biological chemical sensors . Noble metal nanostructures have sensitive SERS properties and usually act as SERS substrates . Moreover semiconductors also possess SERS properties and when the semiconductors are combined with noble metals this can not only enhance the SERS signal but also introduce additional properties . Therefore in this investigation SiO

@highlight A novel FE imprinted SERS sensor based on SiO
@highlight @TiO
@highlight @Ag composites was prepared.
@highlight SiO
@highlight @TiO
@highlight possessed the property of self cleaning and could be recycled.
@highlight SiO
@highlight @TiO
@highlight had a very low detection limit and are a new way to determine FE.
