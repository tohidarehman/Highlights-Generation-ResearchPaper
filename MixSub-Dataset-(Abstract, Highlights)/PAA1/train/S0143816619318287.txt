 Over the last four decades particle image velocimetry has evolved into a powerful and significant measurement technique . The technique has been applied to many areas of fluid mechanics and the accuracy and resolution has been greatly improved over the years . This was made possible by the creativity enthusiasm and commitment of the developers but also by the technical achievements in the field of tracer particles light sources recording systems algorithms and computer power . Although time resolved volumetric PIV measurements are possible today the majority of measurements are still performed using planar PIV techniques for good reasons . First planar PIV is rather simple to both install and use and the data is processed quickly and robustly . Second in many cases planar PIV already provides the desired data to answer scientific questions . Due to the persistent interest in using planar PIV it is the intention of this review to consider some classical operating rules from todays perspective and to prove their validity . This may seem needless at first glance . However it should be noted that once a technique has been established the basic aspects are generally taken for granted . Therefore a critical look from time to time is advisable to check whether the concepts are still valid or whether changes are necessary . Furthermore we intend to deduce under which conditions the use of more complicated techniques pays off .

@highlight In this work we provide a detailed review of particle image velocimetry PIV for velocity measurements in flows. We focus on the planar version of PIV because it is of most interest to our knowledge. The manuscript covers the historical development of PIV as well as the newest findings. In particular the formation of the correlation function and its relation to the measurement result are discussed. We also provide recommendations to the PIV user.
