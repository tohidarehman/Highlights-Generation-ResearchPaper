 Consideration the application of perovskite material in high energy photon detection investigation of high energy photons interactions with perovskite material is necessary . Here we reported a study of high energy electron beam induced physical transformation in perovskite CH

@highlight High energy electron beam induced physical transformation in perovskite thin film.
@highlight The effect of irradiation dose on physics properties of perovskite was considered.
@highlight High energy electron beam induced morphology defects and phase transformation.
