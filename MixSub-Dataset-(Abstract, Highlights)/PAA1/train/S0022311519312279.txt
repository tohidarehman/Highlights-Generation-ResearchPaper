 Many tools such as mass spectrometry X ray diffraction X ray fluorescence ion chromatography etc . are currently available to scientists investigating interdicted nuclear material . These tools provide an analysis of physical chemical or isotopic characteristics of the seized material to identify its origin . In this study a novel technique that characterizes physical attributes is proposed to provide insight into the processing route of unknown uranium ore concentrates and their calcination products . In particular this study focuses on the characteristics of the surface structure captured in scanning electron microscopy images at different magnification levels . Twelve common commercial processing routes of UOCs and their calcination products are investigated . Multiple input single output convolution neural networks are implemented to differentiate the processing routes . The proposed technique can determine the processing route of a given sample in under a second running on a graphics processing unit with an accuracy of more than 95 . The accuracy and speed of this proposed technique enable nuclear scientists to provide the preliminary identification results of interdicted material in a short time period . Furthermore this proposed technique uses a predetermined set of magnifications which in turn eliminates the human bias in selecting the magnification during the image acquisition process .
