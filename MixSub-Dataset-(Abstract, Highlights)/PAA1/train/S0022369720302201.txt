 In the result of increasing energy demand rechargeable Li ion batteries with high energy density are suitable sustainable power sources for the energy storage generations . Keggin type polyoxometalates are being regarded as an electrode material for energy storage devices though advanced improvement is adaptable for futuristic applications . Consequently we demonstrate PMo

@highlight Keggin type POM synthesis is simple required temperature below 200C.
@highlight Li
@highlight HPMo
@highlight clusters is not used anywhere in battery applications.
@highlight The 22 electron insertion in the POM ease stable cycling at higher current rates.
@highlight POM with lithium as counter cation exhibits better capacity and energy density.
@highlight It can lay the groundwork for future electrodes in various applications as well.
