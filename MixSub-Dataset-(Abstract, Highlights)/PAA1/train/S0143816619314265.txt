 The traditional phase coding method has been widely used for three dimensional shape measurement . However the fringe order determined from the coding patterns can not be precisely aligned with the wrapped phase calculated from the sinusoidal patterns when measuring dynamic objects . Consequently phase unwrapping errors will occur around the 2 phase jumps of the wrapped phase . To address this problem the present work proposes a complementary phase coding method for dynamic 3D shape measurement . Specifically the projection of the sinusoidal and coding patterns forms a cycle and the se patterns are shifted by a half period between even and odd cycles . Combining two fringe orders of adjacent even and odd cycles the absolute phase map can be correctly recovered . Moreover to improve the measurement speed all 8 bit gray patterns are converted into 1 bit binary patterns by a binary dithering technique . Both simulations and experiments demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method .

@highlight Both sinusoidal patterns and coding patterns are shifted by half period between even and odd cycles to form a complementary pair.
@highlight The phase unwrapping errors caused by the misalignment problem can be effectively solved by the complementary phase coding method.
@highlight A binary dithering technique is applied to both sinusoidal and coding patterns to improve the measurement speed.
