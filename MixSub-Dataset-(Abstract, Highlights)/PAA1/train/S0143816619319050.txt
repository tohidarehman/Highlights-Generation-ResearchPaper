 The fractional order chaotic systems have characteristics of the all chaotic systems however the improper fractional order chaotic systems have more complexity random sequences which more suitable for chaotic cryptosystems . To investigate the application of improper fraction order chaotic system in chaotic cryptography in this paper an improper fractional order laser chaotic system is constructed and applied in image encryption algorithm . The dynamic performances of the system are studied through phase diagrams Lyapunov exponents spectrum bifurcation diagrams and
