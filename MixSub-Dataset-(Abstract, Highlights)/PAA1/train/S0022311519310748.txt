 Irradiations were performed with 1.5MeV protons to 0.6 dpa at 40150C on additively manufactured 304L stainless steel and the changes in microstructure and mechanical behavior after irradiation were compared to wrought 304L stainless steel . All microstructural and hardness results after irradiation suggest the samples evolve toward a similar state despite significant differences in the unirradiated microstructures and hardness values . A TEM and nanoindentation based investigation of before and after proton irradiation at 40150C is presented . Results are interpreted in terms of initial dislocation content dislocation structures and microstructural and chemical homogeneity .

@highlight Microstructures evolve similarly for irradiated AM and wrought 304L
@highlight Nanohardness values are similar for all samples after irradiation.
