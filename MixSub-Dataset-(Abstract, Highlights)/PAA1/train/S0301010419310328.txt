 In this work we investigate the electronic and optical properties of monolayer GeSe and the possibility of enhancement the photocatalytic activities for the water splitting of monolayer GeSe through strain engineering using first principles calculations . Our calculations indicate that monolayer GeSe is a semiconductor with a moderate indirect gap of 1.13eV at equilibrium and we can control its band gap by biaxial strain . In the presence of biaxial strain
