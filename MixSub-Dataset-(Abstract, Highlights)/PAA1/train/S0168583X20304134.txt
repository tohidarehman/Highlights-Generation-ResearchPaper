 Photofission based active non destructive assay is a promising technique for nuclear waste characterization . The latter is challenging due to the presence of actinides fission products and non homogeneous matrix . This paper presents an optimization study of a 9MeV linear electron accelerator used as a source of Bremsstrahlung photons for such photofission applications . The primary focus is made on qualitative and quantitative assessment of the Bremsstrahlung flux timing characteristics and reduction of background neutrons . Assessment is conducted using Monte Carlo simulations in particle transport codes PHITS and MCNP6 with an objective to compare the simulation results . Our results demonstrate a good agreement between the simulation results of both codes . However for an effective application of the photofission technique for nuclear waste assay a careful selection of the target material and introduction of parasitic neutron suppression techniques are necessary . Analysis routines and simulation procedures are described in detail and results are presented .
