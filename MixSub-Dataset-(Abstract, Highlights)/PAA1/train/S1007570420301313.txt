 This paper presents a one dimensional superconducting photonic crystal refractive index biosensor with high sensitivity which consists of a periodic arrangement of superconductors and semiconductors . The biosensor has high sensitivity and accuracy in the refractive index range of 1.0 to 2.2 RIU below the critical temperature . The resonance wavelength and defect refractive index of the biosensor have a high linear correlation coefficient and the linear correlation coefficient of all experimental groups in this paper is higher than 0.999 . The sensitivity of the biosensor decreases with increasing temperature and when the external temperature increases from 80K to 134K the sensitivity decreases from 6.04396m RIU to 5.71703m RIU gradually . And then the performance of biosensor in blood component detection is researched by FDTD method . The result shows that the sensor has higher sensitivity and shows the same change law in the detection of refractive index changes within a small range such as blood components . When the external temperature is increased from 80K to 134K the sensitivity of the biosensor gradually decreases from 6.85789m RIU to 6.48073m RIU .

@highlight Ablood tissues detection biosensor based on superconducting photonic crystal working at low temperature is proposed.
@highlight The performance of the biosensor is simulated by FDTD finite difference time domain method.
@highlight The results show that it is feasibility and high performance of the biosensor in blood tissues detectionat low temperatures.
