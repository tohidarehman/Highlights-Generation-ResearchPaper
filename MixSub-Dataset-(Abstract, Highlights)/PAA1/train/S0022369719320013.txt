 In the present study a monocrystalline silicon wafer was treated by ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification to enhance the efficiency and service life of Si based devices by reducing reflectivity and improving surface properties respectively . Microstructure surface reflection surface free energy and dry tribological characteristics of Si wafer before and after UNSM were systematically investigated . A silicon nitride Si

@highlight Si wafer with a thickness of about 279m was treated by UNSM.
@highlight Surface roughness and hardness were increased by 400 and 14 respectively.
@highlight Reflectivity of Si wafer reduced at throughout wavelength after UNSM.
@highlight Tribological characteristics were improved after UNSM.
@highlight The average grain size after UNSM was found to be about 50nm.
