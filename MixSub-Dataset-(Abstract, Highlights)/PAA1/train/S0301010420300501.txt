 Colloid particles consisting of biopolymers such as proteins and polysaccharides have been widely used as food or drug components . Here we investigate the interactions and structures in aqueous mixtures of ovalbumin and carrageenan to unravel the complexation mechanism . The pH titration results for the OVA CRG system indicate the structural transition of the OVA CRG complexes happens during acidification . Significant accumulation of insoluble OVA CRG complex coacervates with OVA packed in the hydrophobic structures formed by CRG occurs when pH is lower than the isoelectric point of OVA . The highest turbidity is reached at pH 3.0 because of the strongest electrostatic attraction and further deceasing pH leads to the dissociation of complex coacervates . Composition and ionic strength show significant effects on turbidity and aggregates formation by tuning electrostatic interactions between NH
