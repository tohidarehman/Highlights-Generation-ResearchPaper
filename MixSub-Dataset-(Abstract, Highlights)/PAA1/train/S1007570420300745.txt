 In artificial neural networks the diffusion phenomenon of electrons exists inevitably due to the electromagnetic field of neural networks is heterogeneous . In this paper we study the spatio temporal dynamical behaviors of a reaction diffusion neural network with leakage delay . By analyzing the corresponding characteristic equation the sufficient and necessary conditions of Turing instability are obtained and the existence of Turing Hopf and Turing Hopf bifurcations is also established . Furthermore the truncated normal form up to third order is derived to understand and classify the spatio temporal dynamics close to the Turing Hopf bifurcation point . By numerical simulations we find a pair of spatially inhomogeneous periodic solutions and illustrate the effects of time delays and spatial diffusion on the spatio temporal dynamics of the model .
