 Based on the extended Huygens Fresnel principle the analytical expressions of the spectrum for Gaussian Schell model vortex beam propagating in biological tissues have been derived . The effects of the field point position the species of the biological tissues spatial correlation of beams on the relative spectral shift of GSMVB passing biological tissues have been investigated using the contour plots . It is shown that the spectral change is somewhat slow on the area near the
