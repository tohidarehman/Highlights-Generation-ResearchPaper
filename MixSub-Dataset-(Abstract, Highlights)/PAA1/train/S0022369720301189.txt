 Two dimensional materials have attracted increasing research interest due to their unique physical and chemical properties . As a typical 2D material ZnO monolayers not only generate scientific interest but also may have important technological applications . However it is still a great challenge for ZnO monolayers to be used in electron emission devices . Here the first principles calculations based on DFT D2 have been used to investigate the structural stabilities electronic structure electron emission properties and diffusion behaviors of

@highlight The top of the center of the hexagonal ring of ZnO is the most stable adsorption site.
@highlight The interaction between the
@highlight adatoms and ZnO monolayers results in ionic bonding.
@highlight The band gaps of
@highlight  ZnO monolayers are reduced to zero and exhibit metallic characteristics.
@highlight After the alkali metal is adsorbed a rapidly reduced work function 2.743.26eV was obtained.
