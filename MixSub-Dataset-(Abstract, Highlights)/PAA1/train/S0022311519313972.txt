 The influence of high flux helium plasma irradiation on compatibility between liquid lithium and CLF 1 steel a reduced activation ferritic martensitic steel was investigated since CLF 1 shows potential application as substrate material for liquid lithium plasma facing components . After exposure to helium plasma with flux of 510

@highlight The compatibility between liquid lithium and high flux helium plasma irradiated CLF 1 steels is firstly reported.
@highlight The fuzz induced by helium plasma irradiation improves the wettability of liquid lithium on the surface of CLF 1.
@highlight The porous fuzz nanostructure significantly aggravates the lithium corrosion behavior of CLF 1 in liquid lithium.
