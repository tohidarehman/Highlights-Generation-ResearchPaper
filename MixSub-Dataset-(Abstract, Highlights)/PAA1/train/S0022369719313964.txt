 One of the key challenges in developing lithium ion batteries is the super long cycles . Two dimensional materials with a layered crystal structure disclose many advantages and attract more interests in this field . Here we report a novel method through which the electrochemically exfoliated graphene is employed to construct an anode for ultra long cycle Li ion batteries . The high quality EG was directly sprayed onto the copper foil as a binder free material resulting in high conductivity high volume capacity and bridging properties . The battery has exhibited a high capacity of 356mAhg
