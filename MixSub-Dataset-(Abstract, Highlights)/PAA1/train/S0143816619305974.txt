 In underwater color imaging the scattering media could cause image blurring and color distortion which are the two main problems of image degradation . In this paper we propose a color image recovery method to solve these two problems by considering the crosstalk effects between the RGB channels during estimating the transmittances in RGB channels . The experimental results in turbid water with different colors show that our method can simultaneously enhance the image contrast and reduce the color distortion to realize the clear underwater vision which is attributed to the proper estimation of the transmittances in RGB channels by compensating the crosstalk effects .

@highlight This article proposes an algorithm of polarimetric color image recovery in underwater environment based on compensating the crosstalk effect during estimating the transmittances of RGB channels.
@highlight Due to the proper estimation of the transmittances in RGB channels by jointly processing the information in RGB channels the performance of image recovery is further improved.
@highlight The experimental results in turbid water with different colors blue green and yellow demonstrate that our method can simultaneously enhance the image contrast and reduce the color distortion to realize the clear underwater vision in practice.
