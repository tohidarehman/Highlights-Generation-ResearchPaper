 We investigate defect induced electronic and magnetic properties of zinc oxide nanocrystalline powders prepared by mechanical milling . The average crystallite size decreases as the milling time is increased but the wurtzite structure is stable even after 60 hours of milling . The structural properties are characterized by X ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy . The chemical composition of pure unmilled and as milled powders is determined by X ray photoelectron spectroscopy . Raman scattering spectra were analyzed to find evidence of crystallinity and defect structures in the milled powders . The results obtained from electronic paramagnetic resonance studies demonstrate that the defects are due to both oxygen and zinc vacancies . Since defect induced magnetism has potential application in spintronic devices we measured the

@highlight Inexpensive ball milling process to prepare the nanoscale ZnO powders with high purity.
@highlight Vacancies are largely responsible for ferro magnetic properties of ZnO nanocrystals and which favors the superior application in devices as compared to bulk.
