 Lysozyme and carrageenan are important components widely used in food and pharmaceutical products . In this work we investigated the interactions in the aqueous mixtures of LYS and CRG and the structural transformation of the LYS CRG complexes . When co soluble polymers and soluble complexes are formed in near neutral environment insoluble complex coacervates are formed at lower pHs . Significant accumulation and size expansion of coacervate particles occur at pH 4.0 where maximum interactions are presented at the mixing ratio of LYS CRG 2 1 . The coacervate system is flexible to rearrange to reach a charge balanced state by gradual protonation of LYS and CRG . Addition of NaCl up to 50mM weakens the electrostatic attractions among the aggregates through counterion binding . Thermal stability of LYS by forming complex coacervates differs from that in water and effective protection of protein is achieved as the unfolding temperature is increased by 9C .
