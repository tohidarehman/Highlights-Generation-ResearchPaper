 Based on the newly developed tensor holography theory the null reconstruction in orthogonal elliptical polarization holography is reported . In the recording stage the information is stored in the recording material by two orthogonal elliptical polarization waves . In the reconstructing stage the variation of the power of reconstructed wave with the polarization state of reading wave is studied . Then the null reconstruction the reconstructed wave being identical to zero is observed when the reading wave is the non orthogonal reference wave of recording stage . However in those previously reported experiments when and only when the recording material is illuminated by the orthogonal reference wave the null reconstruction could be observed . Thus our result is very different from the previously reported results and would change the perspective on the null reconstruction . Based on the tensor theory we analyze the condition for null reconstruction in orthogonal polarization holography . For the null reconstruction in orthogonal linear polarization holography the reading wave should be the orthogonal reference wave . However for the null reconstructions in orthogonal circular and elliptical polarization holography the reading wave may be the non orthogonal reference wave . We think the result may enlarge our knowledge about the null reconstruction .

@highlight The null reconstruction is observed when the reading wave is the non orthogonal reference wave.
@highlight The angle between the signal and reference wave is large and the work breaks through the paraxial approximation.
@highlight The prerequisites for null reconstruction in the orthogonal linear circular and elliptical polarization holography are analyzed.
@highlight The result may offer a new knowledge about the null reconstruction.
