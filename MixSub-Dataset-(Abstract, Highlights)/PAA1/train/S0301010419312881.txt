 A series of honeycomb patterned porous films based on self assembly block copolymers with different hydrophilic blocks were prepared using the breath figure method . The variation of hydrophilic moieties into the block copolymers provokes a response in the pore diameter size dispersity and in the surface pore distribution entropy . The morphological properties are examined using SEM and AFM microscopies wettability properties were also studied . The distribution of the pores at the surface and shape variations of the structured films were studied by Raman spectroscopy before and after thermal annealing . We report a significant increase of the order and dispersity narrowing of the pores after thermal annealing which affects the water contact angle . These results were attributed to the process mechanism of the polymer chain self assembly of the different hydrophilic moieties as a result of thermal annealing at temperatures below the glass transition temperature .

@highlight Raman Spectroscopy corroborated the Self assembling of PS hydrophilic diBlock copolymers.
@highlight Pores distribution is self assembling dependent.
@highlight Thermal annealing decreases the pore distribution entropy.
