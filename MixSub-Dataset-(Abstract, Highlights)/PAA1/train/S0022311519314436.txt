 Density functional theory calculations were performed to study reactions on uranium mononitride surface when it is in contact with environment gases such as O

@highlight DFT calculations were performed on the adsorption and reaction behaviors of O
@highlight  H
@highlight O N
@highlight and H
@highlight on the UN 001 surface.
@highlight When T 350K the UN surface is totally occupied by oxygen within a short time scale from hours to 10
@highlight s.
@highlight The diffusion of adsorbed O into the sub layer occurs only after full coverage of O on the UN surface.
