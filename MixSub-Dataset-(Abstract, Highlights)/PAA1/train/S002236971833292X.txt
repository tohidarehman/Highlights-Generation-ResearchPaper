 Silicon clathrates are Si cage based structures capable of hosting other atoms such as sodium in their Si polyhedron cages . Electron spin resonance can provide information on the electronic structure of localized or delocalized electrons in cage like type II silicon clathrates of the form Na

@highlight Isolated Na atoms in Na intercalated type II silicon clathrates are identified as donors by electron spin resonance.
@highlight A Na atom in a Si
@highlight polyhedron is displaced along the 111 direction by the Jahn Teller effect.
@highlight Low temperature electric conductivity is caused by electrons moving in Na clusters or hopping between Na clusters.
