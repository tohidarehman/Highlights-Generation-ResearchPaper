 An optical method for measuring concentration dependent diffusion coefficients of binary solution is introduced in this paper . The concentration spatial and temporal profiles

@highlight A high efficient optical measurement method for measuring concentration dependent diffusion coefficient of binary solution was invented.
@highlight The function relationship between concentration and diffusion coefficient can be obtained from a single experiment.
@highlight The diffusion images were simulated by ray tracing method which demonstrate the invented method is reliable and provide dynamic simulated diffusion processes.
