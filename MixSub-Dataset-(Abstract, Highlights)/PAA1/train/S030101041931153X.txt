 With the aid of ab initio calculations the one dimensional representations of the ring puckering vibrations of several four membered ring molecules have been refined . These one dimensional models include contributions from MH

@highlight Theoretical calculations were used to model the ring puckering vibration.
@highlight Refined and reliable kinetic energy functions were calculated for these vibrations.
@highlight Remarkable agreement between theory and experiment.
@highlight The observed vibrational transition frequencies were fit well with the PEFs.
@highlight Excellent results for nine ring molecules and many of their isotopic species.
