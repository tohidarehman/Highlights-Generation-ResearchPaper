 Microlens arrays were fabricated on polymethyl methacrylate substrate using a microlens array with rear side ps laser swelling in this study . The modified beam energy can ensure the fabricated microlenses are uniform . Using the foci of a microlens array approximately 630 microlenses were fabricated with a single series of pulses which provides greater processing throughput compared to point to point direct laser writing . The formation of smooth microlenses is attributed to photolysis of methyl red and molecular relaxation . The dependence of height and diameter of the microlenses on laser fluence and irradiation time were investigated . The results show that the size of microlenses could be controlled using the appropriate fluence and irradiation time . Finally an array of mirolenses with high uniformity was fabricated over a large area . The diameter and height of the microlenses were measured to be 55 and 12m respectively .
