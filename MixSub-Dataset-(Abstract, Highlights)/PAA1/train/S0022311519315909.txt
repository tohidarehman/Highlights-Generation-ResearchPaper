 Multi metallic layered composite fuel cladding is designed to survive a longer period of time during accident scenarios for light water reactor fuel . One proposed MMLC cladding concept joining Zircaloy to steel via interaction barrier layers will increase corrosion resistance but result in a neutron absorption penalty . This cladding could also result in negative impacts due to mismatches between the mechanical behavior of its layers . In this study the mechanical performance of the MMLC has been evaluated in two ways small scale thermo mechanical simulations and full length fuel rod simulations . Both were carried out using the BISON fuel performance code . The small scale simulations predicted a reduction in residual stress and elastic deformation compared with standard Zircaloy cladding . The fuel rod simulations predicted decreased creep strain larger pellet clad gaps and possible plastic deformation under long time use when compared to Zircaloy and stainless steel cladding alone . The performance of various gap widths and layer thicknesses were compared to assist in the design of MMLC cladding we recommend an MMLC with a Zircaloy steel layer thickness ratio of at least 1.75 and an initial gap width of 40m .
