 The comparison of simulated data with experimental results is needed for the accuracy and reliability of the transport codes . In this work we performed a comparative study of simulated results of projectile fragmentation cross sections for three different models . The obtained results also compared with published experimental data . For simulation purposes the GEANT4 simulation toolkit based on the Monte Carlo codes is used . The models in Geant4 employed to compute the PFXS are the Binary Cascade the Quantum Molecular Dynamics and the Intranuclear cascade . In the present study we reported the interaction of
