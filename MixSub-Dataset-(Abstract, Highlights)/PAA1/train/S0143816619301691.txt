 Binocular stereo vision sensor based on disparity is an important technique in 3D shape measurement . In the application of large field of view a relative short baseline distance of BSVS has heightened the demand for calibration . In this paper a calibration method based on a virtual 3D flexible control field for BSVS with short baseline is proposed . The FCF is constructed by a laser tracker a precision two axis turntable and a camera calibration reference target which can be exchanged with a standard laser tracker target precisely . Firstly the turntable coordinate system is built and the position of the fixed CRT is measured by the laser tracker . Then the turntable with BSVS on it rotates in two dimensions regularly during which the cameras shoot the fixed CRT synchronously and the 3D FCF is constructed . Finally the minimum objective function is established according to the BSVS imaging model to realize the calibration of internal and external parameters integrally . The experimental results show that under the conditions that the baseline is 120

@highlight A novel calibration method based on a 3D flexible control field is proposed.
@highlight This method requires a narrow calibration space and adapts to the varied FOV.
@highlight It is simple to operate and the workload remains unchanged with FOV changing.
