 Chaotic systems have been widely applied in digital image encryption due to their complex properties such as ergodicity pseudo randomness and extreme sensitivity to their initial values and parameters . An image encryption algorithm based on a hidden attractor chaos system and KnuthDurstenfeld algorithm is proposed . First a hidden attractor chaos system is used to encrypt digital image . Compared to a self excited attractor the hidden attractor s attracting basin does not intersect with any small neighbourhoods of the equilibria . It is difficult for attackers to reconstruct the attractor by finding equilibrium points . Therefore the hidden attractor chaotic system is difficult to decrypt . Meanwhile the hidden attractor chaos system is very sensitive to initial values and parameters . Second the KnuthDurstenfeld algorithm has good randomness . In addition the KnuthDurstenfeld algorithm can reduce the time complexity and the space complexity of the permutation while achieving good permutation effects . Thus KnuthDurstenfeld algorithm is used to permutate the digital image . Finally DNA sequence operations are used to diffuse image pixels values . Some experimental analyses have been applied to measure the new scheme and the experimental results illustrate the scheme possesses better encryption performances . This method can be applied in secure image communication fields .

@highlight First a hidden attractor chaos system is used to encrypt digital image. Compared to self excited attractor hidden attractor s attracting basin does not intersect with any small neighborhoods of the equilibria. It is difficult for attackers to reconstruct the attractor by finding equilibrium points.
@highlight Second KnuthDurstenfeld algorithm has good randomness. At the same time Knuthdurstenfeld algorithm can reduce the time complexity and the space complexity of the permutation while achieving good permutation effect.
