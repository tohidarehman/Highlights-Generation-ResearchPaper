 The circular array structure is fabricated on the 304 stainless steel surface by fiber laser and it is connected with the plastic under the condition of heating and pressurizing . The effects of heating temperature connection pressure and coverage rate on the interfacial strength of the 304 stainless steel and plastics were studied and the optimum process parameters of heating temperature and bonding pressure are obtained . The results show that the shear force of 304 stainless steel and plastic is the strongest when the heating temperature is 400C . The strength of the connection joint is enhanced with the increase of the connection pressure and the shear force of the 304 stainless steel and plastic connection joint is the strongest when the pressure is 70kN . After laser treatment the height and quantity of burr in the circular array structure have an important influence on the connection strength between stainless steel and plastic . The number of burrs in the height range of 1020m is defined as

@highlight Mechanical interlocking is the main mechanism for successfully connecting metals and plastics.
@highlight The number of burrs in the height range of 1020m is main factor controlling the shear strength.
@highlight The threshold of the process parameters for the maximum shear strength of the joint is obtained.
