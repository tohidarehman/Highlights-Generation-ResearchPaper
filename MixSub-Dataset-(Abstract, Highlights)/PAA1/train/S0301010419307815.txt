 Coherent spin transport in a DNA molecule has been examined using a first principles calculation . In the calculated model a B form double strand was located between ferromagnetic nickel electrodes and spin transport was calculated under two relative magnetic configurations of electrodes parallel and antiparallel alignments . As a result the molecule was too long to demonstrate an efficient coherent spin transport . Short DNA molecules of ds and ds which were cut out from the Dickerson Drew duplex showed similar results . On the contrary stacking nucleic acids of ds or ds resulted in an efficient coherent spin transport sufficient to cause spin polarization and a certain difference in conductance by varying the magnetic configuration of ferromagnetic electrodes . This result suggested the possibility of tunnel magnetoresistance in the short stacking part of a DNA molecule .
