 Dynamics of low density channel formed by the radial expulsion of electrons and ions due to the ponderomotive force of the q Gaussian laser is investigated . Under perturbation approximation an expression for channel density is derived in order to analyze the depletion of density inside the channel . WKB approximation is employed to study the propagation of q Gaussian laser in the self formed channel . For realizing better channeling and self focusing of laser laser and plasma parameters are optimized . The effect of q parameter on the channel formation and spot size has been graphically presented and discussed .

@highlight In view of more realistic and closer to the experimental situation lasers of q Gaussian intensity profile are chosen to produce low density channel and study its dynamics based on the time dependent model developed for self focusing or defocusing of the lasers.
@highlight A larger q valued laser pulse digs out a broader and deeper channel in the plasma. The parabolic density profile dug by the laser omits the steady divergence.
@highlight Conditions for self focusing or defocusing of the lasers are talked about and it is observed that the self focusing power of the lower q valued laser is higher than that of the higher q valued and Gaussian lasers.
@highlight The nature of oscillations and positions of maximum and minimum values of spot size are found to vary with plasma frequency electron temperature and intensity wavelength and initial beamwidth of the lasers.
