 A multiple image encryption method based on compressed coded aperture imaging and pixel location scrambling operation is proposed . In the encryption process each plaintext image is compressively encoded by its corresponding random matrix which is generated via a row and column displacement transformation operation on an original random matrix and some auxiliary keys . With the help of charge coupled device the superimposed image are then generated by recording and grouping all the encoded images finally the ciphertext image is obtained by pixel location scrambling operation for the superimposed image . During decryption the participant who possesses his her correct key group can successfully reconstruct the corresponding plaintext image by location index key auxiliary keys scrambling operation compressed coded aperture imaging retrieval algorithm . Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations validate the feasibility of the proposed method .

@highlight A multiple image encryption method based on compressed coded aperture imaging compressive sensing and pixel location scrambling is proposed.
@highlight It decreases the redundancy of the key and improves the calculation speed of the reconstruction.
@highlight Only one main original random matrix key is utilized thus the encryption efficiency is greatly raised.
