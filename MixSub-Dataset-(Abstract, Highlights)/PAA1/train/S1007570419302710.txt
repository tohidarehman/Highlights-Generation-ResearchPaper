 In this paper we consider the problem of existence of almost periodic solutions of impulsive CohenGrossberg neural networks with time varying delays . The impulses are not at fixed moments but are realized when the integral curves of solutions meet given hypersurfaces i.e . the investigated model is with variable impulsive perturbations . Sufficient conditions for perfect stability of almost periodic solutions are derived . The main results are obtained by employing the LyapunovRazumikhin method and a comparison principle . In addition the obtained results are extended to the uncertain case and robust stability of almost periodic solutions is also investigated . An example is considered to demonstrate the effectiveness of our results .
