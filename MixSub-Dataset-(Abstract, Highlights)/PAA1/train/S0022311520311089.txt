 Genetic algorithm was applied to search the energy minimization configuration of vacancy clusters in Fe . Molecular statics calculations and dynamics annealing relaxation were employed to calculate the formation and binding energies of vacancies and 3D vacancy or vacancy hydrogen clusters as well as 2D vacancy or vacancy H clusters on and planes . Our calculations show that vacancies prefer to form 3D clusters and vacancy dislocation loops are difficult to form while vacancy H clusters prefer to shape into 2D clusters especially on planes . Since H prefers the directional bonding a vacancy cluster with H atoms tend to form a vacancy dislocation loop with its slip direction along the 100 direction and on the habit plane . Our results are consistent with the experimental observations and provide a possible mechanism for the formation of vacancy dislocation loops in Fe . Furthermore we have also explored how dislocation loops trap self interstitial atoms vacancies and H atoms . It is of interest to note that H atoms strongly bound to

@highlight A possible mechanism for the formation of vacancy dislocation loops in Fe is proposed.
@highlight Vacancy NH clusters prefer to shape into 2D clusters especially on 211 planes.
@highlight The presence of H can greatly promote the growth of vacancy dislocation loops.
