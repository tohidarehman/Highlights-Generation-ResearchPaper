 Current iterative digital image correlation algorithms can efficiently converge at the deformation vector with high accuracy when they are fed with reliable initial guess . Thus the adaptability of DIC method is dominated to a large extent by the estimation of initial guess . In recent years image feature based technique especially the scale invariant feature transform was introduced to DIC for the estimation of initial guess in the case of large and complex deformation due to its robustness in handling the images with translation rotation scaling and localized distortion . However feature extraction and matching in SIFT are very time consuming which limits the applications of the SIFT aided DIC . In this study we developed a SIFT aided path independent DIC method and accelerated it by introducing the parallel computing on graphics processing unit or multi core CPU . In our method SIFT features are used to estimate the initial guess for the inverse compositional Gauss Newton algorithm at each point of interest . The experimental study shows that the developed method can deal with large and inhomogeneous deformation with high accuracy . Parallel computing accelerates significantly the proposed DIC method . The achieved computation speed satisfies the need for real time processing with high resolution for the images of normal sizes .
