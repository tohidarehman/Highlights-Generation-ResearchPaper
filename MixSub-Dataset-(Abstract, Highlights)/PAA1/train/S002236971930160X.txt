 Single crystals of Oxalic acid dihydrate Potassium oxalate hydrate Potassium hydrogen oxalate oxalic acid dihydrate were grown using solvent evaporation technique . Unit cell parameters of the crystals were studied using single crystal XRD and the crystal parameters were found to match with the reported values . Structural properties were studied using powder XRD analysis . Optical absorption studies were carried out to determine the light absorption by the crystal and the optical bandgap was also calculated using Tauc s relation . Emission and thermal properties of the OAD KOH and KHOOD crystals were studied using photoluminescence spectroscopy and TGA DTA measurements respectively and explained in detail . Electrical studies were also carried out to find the resistivity of the material . The hardness of the synthesized crystal was also explored and the parameters such as stiffness constant yield strength fracture toughness and brittleness were evaluated and compared .

@highlight Comparative studies on the OAD KOH and KHOOD single crystals are reported.
@highlight The OAD KOH belongs to Monoclinic and KHOOD belongs to triclinic crystal system.
@highlight OAD KOH and KHOOD crystal bandgaps are 4.06 4.28 and 4.10 respectively.
@highlight The Mayer s number for OAD KOH and KHOOD are 1.78 2.32 and 1.54 respectively.
@highlight Thermal stability is more for KOH single crystal.
