 We report simple and cost effective production of water soluble graphene sheets using coal . The synthesized coal derived graphene sheets were characterized by X ray diffraction high resolution transmission electron microscopy field emission scanning electron microscopy Raman Fourier transform infrared ultra violet visible spectroscopy and photoluminescence measurements . The presence of edge oxygen functionalities in CDG sheets causes to induce fluorescent properties . The nature emission peak does not change with varying the excitation wavelength . To determine its energy storage properties cyclic voltammetry charge discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were done in different electrolytes . The value of specific capacitance of CDG in 1M Na

@highlight Micro sized graphene sheets were synthesized using coal as a starting material.
@highlight It shows excitation independent photoluminescence emission.
@highlight A maximum value of specific capacitance of 277 F g at scan rate of 5mV s was found in 1M Na
@highlight SO
@highlight It shows long cycle stability.
@highlight The low value of R
@highlight indicates fast ion electron transport and rapid adsorption desorption rates of ions in the electrode.
