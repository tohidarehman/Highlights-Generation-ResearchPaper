 This study is directed at developing a micro scale laser scoring process and understanding the laser material interaction in ultra thin aluminium foils . The research is carried out by the latest generation of nanosecond pulsed fibre lasers manufactured by SPI Lasers . Presented comparative analysis of 70W and 120W laser types gives important insights for laser functionality and can provide recommendations for scalability of the process and quality assurance . High average power lasers were used to meet the requirement of high processing speed in aluminium foils . Scoring in aluminium foils was analysed using the fundamental laser material interaction parameters that fully determine the way the material responds to the laser energy independent of the laser system . This approach permits transferring the results from the micro scale laser process between various laser systems . Energy density and laser power density calculated for considered beam spot area at various frequencies were found to be the parameters that determine the scoring ablation depth in the range of 40m60m . Microscopic examination of the ablation depth and score quality was carried out by an LED illumination 3D microscope . The SEM micrographs indicated minor growth of material debris from the ejected material .
