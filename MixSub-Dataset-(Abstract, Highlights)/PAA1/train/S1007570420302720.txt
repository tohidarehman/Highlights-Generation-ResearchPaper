 The quasi threshold phenomenon in Higgins model with mono stability driven by Gaussian white noise is investigated . The initial excitation phase is identified as escaping event with a specific trajectory defined as the quasi threshold . In the limit of weak noise a group of differential equations governing the optimal exit path quasi potential and exponential prefactor are deduced via WKB approximation . Results show that the optimal path approaches the quasi threshold with a nearly tangent way and almost follows the deterministic flow subsequently in the quasi potential plateau making it analogous to the bistable system . Numerical experiments verify not only the results of the optimal path but also the ones of the optimal fluctuational forces . Then the difference between the practical exit location and the position with minimal quasi potential is also revealed by including the exponential prefactor into the expression of exit location distribution . Finally the mean first passage time is evaluated theoretically with the secondary order approximation taken into consideration . These findings and computations shed light on exploring underlying qualitative mechanism and quantitative feature of excitation behaviors in biological systems .
