 This study proposes an inline temperature insensitive FabryPerot interferometer for coal mine microseism sensing based on a cantilever structure . The sensor is fabricated by splicing a section of hollow core photonic crystal fibre between a lead in polarisation maintaining fibre and a multi mode fibre using a CO

@highlight A fibre inline temperature insensitive FabryPerot interferometer is demonstrated as vibration sensor.
@highlight A section of hollow core photonic crystal fibre is employed to form a cavity by a CO
@highlight laser fusion splicer.
@highlight The sensor is temperature insensitive 0.04pm C high sensitive 5.04g Hz and miniaturised.
@highlight The sensor is anticipated to have wide application prospects in microseism monitoring in coal mines.
