 To understand the interplay between lattice structure and spin degrees of freedom a bulk Gd lattice as a hexagonal close packed structure was generated and populated with paramagnetic Gd

@highlight Developing a numerical experiment on bulk Gd as a benchmark material for design of new magnetic refrigeration materials.
@highlight Magnetic entropy magnetization magnetic specific heat magnetic susceptibility are investigated.
@highlight The statistics of spin projections vs. temperature are new elements of analysis.
