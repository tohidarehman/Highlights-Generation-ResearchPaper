 The kinetics and the produced oligomer patterns of organoalkoxysilanes were investigated under different conditions by using gas chromatography because the degree of the polymerization and the siloxane conformations have an effect on the polymer applications . GC peaks were assigned to AS monomers and oligomers by using a mass detector . The pattern of the produced oligomers depended on the catalysts time and the solvent while the kinetics of hydrolysis re esterification condensation and progress depended on the solvent and type of catalyst . The methoxy and hydrolyzed monomers of trimethylethoxysilane were in equilibrium in alkaline and fluorinated media while the monomers were completely converted to dimers in acidic media . An investigation of the effect of solvent properties on the hydrolysis reaction revealed that there was no change in the polarity of the activated complex during spontaneous hydrolysis and that the reaction was not diffusion controlled .

@highlight Organoalkoxysilanes form cyclic short oligomers in fluorinated and alkaline media.
@highlight Dielectric constant of solvent influence polymerization rate.
@highlight The hydrolysis reaction is activation energy and not diffusion controlled.
@highlight Catalytically the reaction is general base and not nucleophilic.
@highlight Salts can be conjugated acid or base or fluorinated catalysts.
