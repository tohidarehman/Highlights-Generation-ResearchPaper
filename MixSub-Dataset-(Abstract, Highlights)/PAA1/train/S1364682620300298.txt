 In this study the trend of annual and monthly rainfall and trend of maximum and minimum temperature of the month have been detected . The presence of trends in annual rainfall time series are detected and evaluated using linear regression Mann Kendall test with Sen s slope estimator and Innovative Trend analysis . Results of trend analysis by LR M K and ITA methods show close agreement . An inverse distance weighting method in Arc GIS is used for developing spatial distribution of the trends over the entire study area of Sabarmati River basin India . Result of the monthly rainfall shows reducing trend in the June month and shows increasing trend for the month of September in the study area . This is indicative of tendency of late starting and late vanishing of the monsoon season . Maximum temperature in the basin in winter months show reducing trend while in summer months temperature show increasing trends . Results shown shifting of summer season extending to the monsoon months . The Land Use Land cover is examined for regional influential linkages to climate change . The change in the seasonal climate bears significance for its inferences in agriculture field and water resources field for fulfilling the demand from available water resources in the river basin .

@highlight Trend is detected for Hydro meteorological parameters in Sabarmati River basin in the state of Gujarat India.
@highlight Trend of the Annual and monthly rainfall maximum and minimum temperature for each month is detected and evaluated and Spatial distribution of it is represented and linked to Land use Land cover in the basin.
@highlight The Seasonal Climate Transference chart for Sabarmati river basin is developed.
