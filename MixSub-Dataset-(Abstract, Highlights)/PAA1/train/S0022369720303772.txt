 The usage of ethylene glycol as high boiling solvent results in the formation of ultrafine highly crystalline tin doped magnetite nanoparticles with an average size equal to 4.85nm . The oxidation of Sn

@highlight The glycol assisted co precipitation was used as the synthesis method of tin doped magnetite.
@highlight The XPS and Mssbauer spectra confirm the existence of only Sn
@highlight ions in magnetite structure.
@highlight Ultrafine Fe
@highlight  Sn
@highlight NPs have high saturation magnetization equal to 49.7 emu g.
@highlight The very low coercivity equaled 13.29Oe was correlated with superparamagnetic behavior.
