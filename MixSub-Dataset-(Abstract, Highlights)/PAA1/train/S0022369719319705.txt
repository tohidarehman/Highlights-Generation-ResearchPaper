 Interest in the application of thermoelectric devices for renewable energy has risen over the past decade . In this paper we calculate the transport properties of various configurations of the transition metal dichalcogenide MSe

@highlight We evaluate the thermoelectric promise of the MSe
@highlight  M Ti Hf Zr monolayers.
@highlight We evaluate strain and the creation of heterostructures for thermoelectric enhancement.
@highlight We find a new heterostructure with remarkable thermopower at low temperatures.
@highlight We propose promising materials with high thermoelectric performance at low high temperatures.
