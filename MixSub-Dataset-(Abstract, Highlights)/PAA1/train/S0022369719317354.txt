 The usage of semiconductor photocatalyst has been received great attention in recent years due to their wide application in photocatalytic water splitting and degradation of pollutants in waste water and environmental remediation application etc . In this study we demonstrated the efficient synergistically piezo phototronic effect of ZnO Ag

@highlight ZnO Ag
@highlight S hybrid has been synthesized using hydrothermal and SILAR methods.
@highlight Physico chemical characterizations were adopted for the confirmation of the catalyst.
@highlight The piezo phototronic performance using organic dye de colorization was investigated.
@highlight The piezo phototronic catalyst ZnO Ag
@highlight S exhibited an excellent degradation of Rh B dye upon photon and ultrasound irradiation with 7 fold increment in rate kinetics with bare photocatalyst ZnO .
