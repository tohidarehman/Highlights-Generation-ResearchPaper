 Three dimensional face reconstruction is important in many intelligent human machine applications e.g . automatic face authentication human computer interface based entertainment and robotic surgery . Most state of the art structured light methods require multiple projections of the designed patterns which is not desirable for face reconstruction because it is uncomfortable or difficult for a person to keep his her face rigid for a period of time . In this paper we propose an approach to reconstruct the three dimensional face by one shot of structured light line pattern . The proposed one shot 3D reconstruction approach calculates the distortion map from the distorted structured light line pattern . It relies on robust image processing methods and the generic features of human face to segment and cluster the projected structured light line pattern from one single captured image . The
