 Uranium rich UZrNb and UZrMo alloys are considered to be good alternative fuel for fast reactors . From that prospective number of selected uranium rich binary and ternary U6X alloy samples with total alloying content of 6 wt were prepared and characterized by X ray diffraction scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive spectroscope and differential thermal analyzer . Molar heat capacity is considered as one of the most important thermophysical properties of nuclear fuel . The molar heat capacity measurements of U6Zr U2Zr4Nb U6Nb U4Zr2Mo and U2Zr4Mo alloys were carried out using differential scanning calorimeter in the temperature range of 323823K . The U6Zr alloy is considered here as the reference composition and the effect of Nb or Mo addition on the molar heat capacity data of U6X alloys has been highlighted . The thermodynamic functions such as molar enthalpy increment

@highlight Measurement of molar heat capacity of U6 Zr Nb and U6 Zr Mo alloys using DSC.
@highlight Molar heat capacity decreases with addition of 6wt alloying element Zr Nb Mo .
@highlight Replacement of Zr in UZr alloy with Nb Mo reduces molar heat capacity.
@highlight Measured molar heat capacities are lower than that estimated by Neumann Kopp rule.
@highlight Evaluation of molar enthalpy and entropy increments using molar heat capacity.
