 Adaptive management of traffic congestion in the Internet is a complex problem that can gain useful insights from a dynamical approach . In this paper we propose and analyze a one dimensional discrete time nonlinear model for Internet congestion control at the routers . Specifically the states correspond to the average queue sizes of the incoming data packets and the dynamical core consists of a monotone or unimodal mapping with a unique fixed point . This model generalizes a previous one in that additional control parameters are introduced via the data packet drop probability with the objective of enhancing stability . To make the analysis more challenging the original model was shown to exhibit the usual features of low dimensional chaos with respect to several system and control parameters e.g . positive Lyapunov exponents and Feigenbaum like bifurcation diagrams . We concentrate first on the theoretical aspects that may promote the unique stationary state of the system to a global attractor which in our case amounts to global stability . In a second step those theoretical results are translated into stability domains for robust setting of the new control parameters in practical applications . Numerical simulations confirm that the new parameters make it possible to extend the stability domains in comparison with previous results . Therefore the present work may lead to an adaptive congestion control algorithm with a more stable performance than other algorithms currently in use .
