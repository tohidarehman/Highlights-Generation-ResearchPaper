 A demonstration fusion reactor will require a huge amount of beryllium with approximately 490 tons . Since the total production of Be in the world for now is approximately 300 tons per year it is anticipated that the demand is dramatically increased as the early realization of the fusion reactor proceeds . The presence of many Be mines as well as information on each Be reserve has already been confirmed with surveys . Since a conventional Be refinement process is considerably complicated including a production process for an intermediate product Be

@highlight A huge amount of beryllium Be with a weight of approximately 490 tons is necessary for DEMO.
@highlight To provide a steady supply of Be for DEMO Be mine development is necessary including the installation of new refinement facilities.
@highlight Beryllium ores were completely dissolved by base and acid solution treatment with microwave heating.
@highlight A novel refinement process for creating Be metal from Be ores has been successfully established.
