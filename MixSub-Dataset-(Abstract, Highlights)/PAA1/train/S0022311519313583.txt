 Carburization of structural alloys used in Fluoride Cooled High Temperature Reactors can result from the interaction between the metal and graphite components and cause changes in alloy properties . However carburization requires transport of carbon from graphite to alloy surfaces through the molten fluoride coolant . This work introduces an alternative to previously proposed carbon transport mechanisms . The new mechanism is based on the generation of carbonate ions CO

@highlight This work introduces a carbon transport mechanism in molten fluoride salt systems based on CO
@highlight impurities.
@highlight CO
@highlight acts as a salt soluble carbon bearing intermediate species that can be spontaneously reduced on metal surfaces.
@highlight CO
@highlight can be generated by reaction between dissolved oxides and graphite.
