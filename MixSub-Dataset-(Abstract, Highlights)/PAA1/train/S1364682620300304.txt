 The study analyses the delayed occurrence of the F region ionospheric manifestations like peak vertical drift and Equatorial Spread F onset in summer solstice of low solar activity years using the ionosonde data at the magnetic equatorial station Trivandrum and Republic of China Satellite 1 data . The analysis reveals the unambiguous role of the time of ionospheric F region zonal plasma drift wind reversal in modifying the above mentioned phenomena . The direct control of equatorial Spread F onset by the F region drift wind reversal is clearly established on a day to day basis in summer season . The role of the time of zonal wind drift reversal in modulating the ESF onset is examined quantitatively by exploring its effect on the growth rate of Rayleigh Taylor instability . Further the study brings out the solar activity variation of the time of F region zonal plasma drift wind reversal for all seasons . The results highlight the need to have systematic neutral wind measurements to better address the enigmatic and multi dimensional problem of equatorial Spread F day to day variability .

@highlight Ionospheric F region vertical drifts are observed to be delayed in summer months for low solar activity conditions.
@highlight Role of F region wind reversal time in modulating the time of peak vertical drift and ESF onset is brought out.
@highlight The study emphasizes the need to have systematic F region wind measurements for Equatorial Spread F prediction purpose.
