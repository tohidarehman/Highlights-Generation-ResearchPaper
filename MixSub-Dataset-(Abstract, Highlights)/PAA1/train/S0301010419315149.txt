 In recent years intermolecular weak interactions especially tetrel bond and halogen bond have aroused widespread concern . However as far as we know the intermolecular weak interactions composed of TF

@highlight Tetrel bond and halogen bond are composed of TF
@highlight X and H
@highlight O molecules.
@highlight The properties of tetrel bond and halogen bond are compared by NBO AIM and EDA.
@highlight Generally the strength of tetrel bond is stronger than that of halogen bond.
@highlight Tetrel bond and halogen bond show anti cooperativity in ternary complexes.
