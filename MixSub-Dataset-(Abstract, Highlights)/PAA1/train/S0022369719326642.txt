 Reduced graphene oxide gallium nitride nanocomposites were synthesized by a facile single step chemical reduction process with variation in the concentration of GaN from GaN1 @ RGOGaN to GaN20 @ RGOGaN . Scanning electron microscopy and X ray diffraction results revealed that the particle sizes of the GaN nanoparticles and the crystallite sizes of RGOGaN nanocomposites were in the ranges of178379 and 0.2430.245nm respectively . The Gaussian deconvolution of Ga N and Ga for GaN1 @ RGOGaN and GaN7 @ RGOGaN indicated various binding energies of core orbital electronic configuration for the GaN in the RGOGaN nanocomposite networks . The X ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements showed the calculated atomic percentage of Ga and N for GaN1 @ RGOGaN and GaN7 @ RGOGaN ranged within 2.325.98 and 4.917.33 respectively . The maximum specific capacitance was forGaN5 @ RGOGaNwith454F g at 10mV s scan rate as measured using cyclic voltammetry . Similar results were found using the galvanostatic chargedischarge method resulting in specific capacitance of 116.8146.1F g at a current density of 1A g. Moreover very low charge transfer resistance was developed reaching a maximum of only 2.36 for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis . These electrochemical measurement results indicated good capacitive behavior of the RGOGaN nanocomposites .
