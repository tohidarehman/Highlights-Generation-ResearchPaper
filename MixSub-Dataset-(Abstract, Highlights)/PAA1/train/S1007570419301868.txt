 In this paper transient influence of correlation between external and parametric excitations on system response is investigated . Time variable has been taken into account . This does not seem to have been studied previously . By describing correlation between excitations quantitively with correlated coefficient general Fokker Planck Kolmogorov equation is reformulated with two parts . The first part relates to the one of independent excitations while the other part is caused by the correlated excitations . Then exponential polynomial closure method by taking time variable into account is further developed for transient responses of nonlinear oscillators under correlated excitations . With the improved EPC method typical system of Duffing oscillator under correlated external and parametric Gaussian white noise excitations is investigated . Based on the results it is found the influence of correlation between excitations on system response depends directly on the magnitude and the sign of the correlation coefficient . Besides the influence seems stationary and not affected by the time . In addition the results obtained from the EQL method are not consistent with the actual ones with unsymmetrical PDFs and nonzero means . It is indicated that the EQL method is not applicable to such case .

@highlight Comparisons between solutions and computational time evidence that the developed EPC method is an effective and efficient method.

@highlight When the external and parametric excitations are correlated the EQL method is not applicable since it does not reflect properties of system responses with unsymmetrical PDFs and nonzero means especially for velocity response.
