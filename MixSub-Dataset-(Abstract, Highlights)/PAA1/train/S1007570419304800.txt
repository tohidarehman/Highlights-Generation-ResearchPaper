 In this paper the nonlinear bending of circular annular sandwich plates with functionally graded material face sheets is studied under mechanical and thermal loads . The governing equations are based on first order shear theory and nonlinear strain displacement relations of van Karman . Nonlinear equilibrium equations are obtained by combining the numerical method of dynamic relaxation with finite difference discretization method . Also material properties are studied in two conditions including temperature dependent and temperature independent conditions . In order to verify the accuracy of the research the results are compared with references as well as Finite element package of Abaqus . Finally the effects of some parameters such as the thickness ratio of core to face sheet boundary conditions temperature and grading index on nonlinear bending are investigated .

@highlight Nonlinear bending analysis of circular and annular sandwich plates with FG face sheets and homogeneous core is investigated.
@highlight The governing equations are derived on the basis of the FSDT and Van Karman strain equations for the large deformations.
@highlight The system of nonlinear equilibrium equations is analyzed by combining numerical methods of dynamic relaxation technique and finite difference method.
@highlight By decreasing the thickness ratio of the core to the face sheet the deflection increases and the radial stress reduces.
