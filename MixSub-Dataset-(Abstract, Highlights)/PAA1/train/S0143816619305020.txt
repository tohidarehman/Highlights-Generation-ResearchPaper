 With the fast development of diffraction limited storage rings and free electron lasers the requirement for ultimate quality X ray mirror is getting higher and the mirror surface needs to approach the sub nm root mean square height specifications . These ultimate specifications challenge the X ray mirror metrology community . In this work we present our developed dedicated stitching metrology platform for X ray mirror metrology . Various stitching methods with different stitching parameters are investigated in our stitching interferometric system . Some experimental results are given to demonstrate its validity and performance . According to the measurement results the repeatability of measuring a flat mirror in the software stitching mode is at 0.1nm RMS level . In relative angle determinable stitching mode when measuring a curved mirror with its radius of curvature varying from 50m to 175m the repeatability is around 1nm RMS .

@highlight We present the recent work on our newly established stitching interferometry for synchrotron mirror metrology develop by the NSLS II optical metrology group. The established interferometric stitching platform at NSLS II optical metrology laboratory can measure synchrotron X ray mirrors with a measurement repeatability at the sub nanometer level.
@highlight Not only for mirror inspection specified in height can the interferometry stitching results also be applied for slope mirror metrology inspection.
@highlight Two different stitching protocols the SSI and RADSI modes are implemented in the NSLS II interferometric stitching platform. Both modes can be easily used in this stitching platform for measuring X ray mirrors with different curvatures. The presented experimental results show very good agreement with other instruments using similar or different measuring principles.
