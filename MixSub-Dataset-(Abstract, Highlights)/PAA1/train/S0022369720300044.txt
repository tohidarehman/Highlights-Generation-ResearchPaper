 A polymer ZnO colloidal solution was prepared as the organic inorganic composite electron transport layer of inverted polymer solar cells by successive modification of ZnO particles with organic dispersant and polyethyleneimine which offers an alternative to previously used complicated processes such as high temperature annealing or multi layer coatings . The modification of ZnO surfaces with 2 acetic acid provides colloidal stability and prevents aggregation of ZnO particles after adding PEI into the ZnO colloidal solution . The amount of incorporated PEI was increased to 10wt and the cell performance parameters of

@highlight Stable PEI ZnO composite colloidal solution was prepared for electron transport layer in polymer solar cell.
@highlight Successive surface modification of ZnO with MEA and PEI yielded stable composite colloid.
@highlight The 40 of enhancement in PCE was obtained by using composite colloid.
