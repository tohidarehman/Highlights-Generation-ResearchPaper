 Towards the malignant impact of red mud on the environment and water pollution caused by organic dyes affluent residual iron ions in red mud are recovered and converted into functional hierarchical porous Fe

@highlight Abundant iron in red mud is hydrothermally converted into hierarchical porous Fe
@highlight microspheres.
@highlight Adsorption isotherm can be well fitted with Langmuir isotherm model with the q
@highlight determined as 342.57mgg
@highlight Microspheres can be easily regenerated and reused with satisfactory chemical morphological and structural stability.
@highlight Major phase of the quasi amorphous iron bearing room temperature precipitate is determined as Fe OH 
@highlight Adsorption kinetic data can be well interpretated via the pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models.
