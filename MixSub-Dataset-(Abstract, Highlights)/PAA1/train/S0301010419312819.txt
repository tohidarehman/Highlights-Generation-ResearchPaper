 A new physical mechanism is proposed in order to elucidate how properties of a metal surface can differ from those of bulk metal . It is related with localization of an external electromagnetic field in the cracks on the surface . The localization decreases Van der Waals attraction between opposite sides of the cracks . This causes the appearance of new cracks . When the system of cracks has fractal structure this self sustaining process leads to the appearance of a finite volume interface between the metal sample and vacuum . This additional volume manifests itself as a swelling and destruction of the sample .

@highlight A new physical mechanism of metal surface corrosion is proposed.
@highlight Localization of EM field in cracks of metal surface causes surface fractalization.
@highlight Fractalization of the crack system generates swelling of the metal surface layer.
