 The requirements of surveillance for security and safety have been extremely growing over the years . Due to the outstanding capabilities of detection in the nighttime infrared imaging has been developed for many applications such as border defense industrial production and civil safety . In recent decades a wide field of view with high resolution has been urgently called for novel surveillance in these applications . However existing surveillance systems can not meet the demands because of the low resolution and bulkiness . Here we present a dynamic foveated infrared imager for surveillance to capture local high magnification images with a large field of view . Such a system is comprised of a peripheric imaging channel for monitoring the whole large field of view and a local high magnification imaging channel for monitoring the key and or suspected region . Notably simulation experimental results indicate that image height has approximately 2magnification in foveated regions .

@highlight A dynamic foveated infrared imager for surveillance is designed.
@highlight The proposed system represents a new imaging mode in infrared band which can capture local high magnification images with a large field of view.
@highlight Dynamic scanning magnification for interested area can be realized.
