 In our previous study cetyltrimethylammonium bromide admicelles on polystyrene microspheres for the adsolubilization of phenanthrene had been developed . In this work CTAB admicelles modified on magnetic PS nanocomposites was used as a novel adsorbent to facilitate magnetic separation . Magnetic PS nanoparticles were synthesized by miniemulsion polymerization in which the emulsifier was polyvinylpyrrolidone and an oil phase consisted of oleate modified Fe
