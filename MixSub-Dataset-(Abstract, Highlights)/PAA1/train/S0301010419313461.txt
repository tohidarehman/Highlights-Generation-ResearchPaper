 Theoretical simulations are frequently used to assign electronic and geometric structure from spectral fingerprints . However such assignments are prone to expectation bias . Bias can be reduced by using numerical measures of the similarity between calculated and experimental spectra . However the commonly used point wise comparisons can not handle larger deviations in peak position . Here a weighted cross correlation function is used to evaluate similarity scores for soft X ray spectra of first row transition metals . These spectra consist of hundreds of overlapping resonances which makes spectral decomposition difficult . They are also challenging to model leading to significant errors in both peak position and intensity . It is first shown how the choice of weight function width can be related to the modeling errors . The method is then applied to evaluate the sensitivity of multiconfigurational wavefunction and charge transfer multiplet simulations to model choices . The approach makes it possible to assess the reliability of assignments from spectral fingerprinting .
