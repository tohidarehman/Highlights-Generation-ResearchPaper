 In this paper we study a 2 parameter family of 2 periodic nonautonomous systems generated by the alternate iteration of two stunted tent maps . Using symbolic dynamics renormalization and star product in the nonautonomous setting we compute the convergence rates of sequences of parameters obtained through consecutive star products renormalizations extending in this way Feigenbaums convergence rates . We also define sequences in the parameter space corresponding to anharmonic period doubling bifurcations and compute their convergence rates . In both cases we show that the convergence rates are independent of the initial point concluding that the nonautonomous setting has universal properties of the type found by Feigenbaum in families of autonomous systems .

@highlight We use symbolic dynamics to study a family of periodic nonautonomous tent systems.
@highlight Sequences of parameters corresponding to consecutive renormalizations are convergent.
@highlight These convergence rates only depend on the type of renormalization.
@highlight We obtain new period doubling sequences corresponding to non renormalizable systems.
@highlight The previous sequences of parameters converge with rate of order 2.
