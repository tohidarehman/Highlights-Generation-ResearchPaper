 First time reports the rapid polymerization of hydrazine oxalyl chloride based polyamide at room temperature . The polyamide has been synthesized by condensation polymerization using hydrazine and oxalyl chloride at 25C using n haxane as solvent . During condensation polymerization HCl has been eliminated which led to HCl doped polymer . Post polymerization modifications have also been done by doping with BF

@highlight In situ HCl doped based hydrazine and oxalyl chloride polyamide HOP was synthesized.
@highlight Rapid polymerization performed within 10min.
@highlight Inter chain H
@highlight exchange in solid state of polyamide was analyzed.
@highlight HOP shows conductivity in range of 10
@highlight S cm.
@highlight Capacitance of HOP is recorded in F range.
