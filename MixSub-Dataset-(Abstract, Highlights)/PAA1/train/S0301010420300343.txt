 The dipole and generalized oscillator strengths of the free and confined atomic system are related to the description of several interesting chemical physical properties e.g . static polarizability photoionization and stopping cross section among others . In this work we show results for the

@highlight It is found the delocalization of the energy levels due to the plasma medium.
@highlight The plasma medium modifies the generalized oscillator strength GOS .
@highlight The GOS transitions amplitude are reduced as the screening length is reduced.
@highlight Implications on the DOS and GOS derived electronic properties.
