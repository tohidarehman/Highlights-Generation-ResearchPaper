 We report the use of a template and functional monomers in the synthesis of three novel polysulfonamide gels with new architectures and functional groups . These mesoporous polysulfonamide gels were prepared by the condensation polymerization of benzene 1 3 disulfonyl chloride linear monomers and cross linkers in the presence of a silica template by a combination of sol gel chemistry and the nanocasting technique . In this synthesis pathway in situ polymerization onto the template surface led to the construction of a silica polymer nanocomposite . Next after removal of the template the nanocomposite gels were transformed into mesoporous polysulfonamide nanospheres . After the physicochemical identification of the synthesized materials functionalized polysulfonamides were used as reusable novel catalysts with high efficiency for the Strecker reaction under mild conditions . These polymers have Brnsted Lewis acid active sites a mesoporous structure and hydrogen bonding . Moreover since these polymers are hydrogels that can absorb water they can promote the Strecker reaction through chemical absorption of the generated water as a driving force . Overall this article describes a novel synthesis procedure and application of porous polysulfonamide gels .
