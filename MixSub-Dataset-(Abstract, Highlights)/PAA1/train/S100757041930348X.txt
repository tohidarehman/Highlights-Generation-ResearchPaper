 In this paper signal propagation is analysed in electromagnetic media described by fractional order models . Maxwells equations with FO constitutive relations are introduced in the time domain . Then their phasor representation is derived for one dimensional case of the plane wave propagation . With the use of the Fourier transformation the algorithm for simulation of the non monochromatic wave propagation is introduced . Its implementation in Matlab allows for generation of time domain waveforms of signals propagating in the media described by FOMs . It is demonstrated that despite high attenuation a small perturbation of the time derivative orders in Maxwells equations allows for tuning of the time of signal arrival to the observation point . In all the cases studied the rate of pulse advancement increases with simultaneous decrease of the value of the time derivative orders in FO Maxwells equations .
