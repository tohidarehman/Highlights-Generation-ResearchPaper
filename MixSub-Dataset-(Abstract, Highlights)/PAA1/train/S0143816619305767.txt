 The application of quantum mechanisms in image processing has attracted wide attention . In this paper an image encryption scheme that is based on hyper chaos and quantum coding is proposed . First based on a novel enhanced quantum representation the bit level adjacent exchange operation is implemented to pre process the plain image which has lower computational complexity compared to conventional bit level switching operations . Then the processed image is diffused by the quantified sequences where the self adapting parameters are applied to quantify the sequences that are generated by Chens hyper chaotic system . In addition inspired by the quantum coding structure a novel scrambling method that is based on quantum location coding is proposed . This method is used to further scramble the diffused image to obtain the final cipher image . The experimental results and performance analysis demonstrate that the proposed image encryption scheme has high security performance .
