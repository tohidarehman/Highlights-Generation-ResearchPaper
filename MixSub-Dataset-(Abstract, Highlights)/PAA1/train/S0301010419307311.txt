 We propose a model for describing oscillatory chemical reactions involving a variety of immiscible solvents . This model describes the interaction between chemical oscillations on both sides of the interface of different solvents and the effect of the interface on chemical oscillations . Based on this model we study the spiral chemical wave in a chemical oscillation with interfaces of different solvents and report a new type of spiral wave . The interface does not hinder the propagation of chemical waves which can continue to propagate through the interface . The frequency of the chemical wave is increased after the chemical wave passed through the interface . The work of this paper enriched the categories of the dynamics of pattern formation . We believe that the results of this study can provide direction and guidance for chemical experimental research about interfacial oscillatory chemical reactions .
