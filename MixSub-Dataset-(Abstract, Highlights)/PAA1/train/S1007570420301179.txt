 The study of an airfoil at low Reynolds number regime was found to be a typical problem where the inception of bifurcations leads the flow evolution from a stationary or periodic behaviour to a purely chaotic one . The present work extends the present literature where numerical investigations of the flow field past two dimensional symmetric airfoils were performed by fixing the incidence and changing the Reynolds number . Conversely here the Reynolds number was fixed at
