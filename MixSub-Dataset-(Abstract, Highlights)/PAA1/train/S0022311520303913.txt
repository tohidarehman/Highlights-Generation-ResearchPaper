 The onset of breakaway irradiation growth in Zr and its alloys has been correlated with the nucleation and growth of faulted vacancy

@highlight Breakaway irradiation growth is correlated with faulted basal c loop nucleation.
@highlight Solute segregation is demonstrated to reduce stacking fault energies.
@highlight Fe and Sn segregation reduces thermodynamic barrier for c loop growth.
@highlight Sn only segregates to growing faulted c loop loops and not c loop precursors.
@highlight Fe and Cr segregation can stabilize c loop precursors in the nucleation regime.
