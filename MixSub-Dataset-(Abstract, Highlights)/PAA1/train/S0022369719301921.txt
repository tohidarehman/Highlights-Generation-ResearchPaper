 Although tin sulfide is a potential thermoelectric material it has not been applied commercially because of its low intrinsic electrical conductivity . Doping is a possible method to improve the thermoelectric properties by promoting its electron and phonon transport characters . In this work we constructed calculation models for SnS and Sn

@highlight A reliable calculation method for thermoelectric properties of doped SnS was proposed.
@highlight Improved thermoelectric properties of SnS by Bi doping were shown.
@highlight Optimum Bi content was determined theoretically which is difficult to do experimentally.
@highlight Importance of the electron thermal conductivity for the
@highlight value was shown.
