 Using density functional theory we have investigated the adsorption characteristics of several explosive compounds on the concave and convex surfaces of a variety of buckybowl materials corannulene sumanene monoindenocorannulene

@highlight Curvature plays a vital role in the adsorption of explosives.
@highlight SUMA exhibits the enhanced adsorption of explosive compounds.
@highlight Electrostatic interactions are predominant between SUMA and the explosive compounds studied.
@highlight Concave buckybowl materials are sensitive towards all the explosive compounds studied.
