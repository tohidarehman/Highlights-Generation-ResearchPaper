 In this study a composite comprising WC particulate reinforced SiAlON was fabricated by spark plasma sintering in order to develop a hard to hard phase configuration and to toughen the hard matrix through particulate reinforcement . Irrespective of the composition the sintered samples were almost theoretically dense . The nature of the overall sintering process for the composite appeared to be guided by the liquid phase sintering of the SiAlON phase . Microstructural analyses using scanning and transmission electron microscopy indicated the presence of both equiaxed and elongated SiAlON grains . The WC grains principally appeared equiaxed in nature . A reaction product was not observed at the WC SiAlON interface . High angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging indicated the reasonable distribution of the elements within the constituent grains and grain boundary . The presence of an intergranular glassy phase was confirmed which was principally rich in oxygen and yttrium with some occasional tungsten in the case of triple junctions . The composite exhibited an acceptable combination of flexural strength hardness and fracture toughness with values around 489MPa 20GPa and 6MPa m
