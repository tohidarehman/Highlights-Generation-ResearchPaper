 Light passing through scattering media will be strongly scattered and diffused into a complex speckle pattern which contains most of the spatial information and color information of the objects . Although various technologies have been proposed to realize color imaging through scattering media current technologies are still inflexible since they require long sequence measurement for each imaging pixel or spectral point spread functions of an optical system . In this paper we propose a color imaging method through scattering media based on phase retrieval with triple correlation . Here we theoretically prove that the spatial averaging of the triple correlation technique can be used to retrieve the Fourier phase of object and we experimentally demonstrate that it can be applied in color imaging through scattering media . Compared to other phase retrieval techniques phase retrieval with the triple correlation technique can retain the orientation information of objects and can composite the color image without rotation operation . Furthermore our approach has the potential of realizing spectral imaging through scattering media .

@highlight We theoretically verified the validity of spatial averaging of triple correlation technique in imaging through scattering media and a method is presented to realize color imaging through the scattering media based on image retrieval in different color channels and compositing image.
@highlight We have shown that a monochromatic target can be reconstructed via retrieving image and compositing image.
@highlight For complex color object a reference object is employed to obtain the relative position of objects in different color channels and experiment results further demonstrate the performance of our scheme in color imaging.
@highlight Our method can also realize spectral imaging through scattering media. Furthermore it will greatly improve its functionality in biomedical imaging.
