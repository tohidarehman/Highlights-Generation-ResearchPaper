 A new system that combines multi vision system and synthetic aperture system is proposed to improve the measurement of small scale or longer range object . In the system the parallax information is recorded by multi vision system meanwhile a higher optical resolution image is obtained by synthesizing several optical apertures of multi vision system to increase the effective aperture . By fusing the higher resolution image into the parallax images we can acquire higher resolution images with parallax information from which the measurement can be improved greatly . As an example a trinocular vision system improved by synthetic aperture has been studied experimentally . Results show that the method can improve the resolution in detection about two times and perform more accurate measurement than traditional multi vision system .

@highlight The system combines the advantages of multi vision and synthetic aperture imaging.
@highlight In this system besides a high resolution image captured by synthetic aperture system lower resolution images with parallax can be obtained by multi vision system.
@highlight By fusing the high resolution image and lower resolution images a high precision measurement can be achieved.
