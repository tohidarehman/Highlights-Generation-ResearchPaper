 Protective coatings of Zr based claddings have been proposed for the development of Accident Tolerant nuclear Fuel . Coatings forming stable oxides at high temperature such as MAX phases are attractive candidates for these applications . In this study CrAlC coatings were deposited on coupons of Zr based alloy by High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering . Cr

@highlight Amorphous CrAlC and nanocrystalline Cr
@highlight AlC coatings were deposited by HiPIMS PVD.
@highlight CrAlC and Cr
@highlight AlC coatings delay the oxidation of Zr alloys at high temperatures.
@highlight Zr alloy protection is effective thanks to the formation of a dense oxide scale.
@highlight Coating and Zr alloy elements interdiffuse at temperatures above 1000C.
