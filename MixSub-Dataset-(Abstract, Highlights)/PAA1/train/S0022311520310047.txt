 The effects of alternating dissolved oxygen and dissolved hydrogen on the corrosion behavior of Alloy 52 are studied by electric electrochemical methods measured in situ including contact electric resistance and electrochemical impedance measurements together with multiple ex situ surface analysis techniques including scanning electron microscopy and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis . The film resistance changes cyclically in both DO and DH cycles . In DO cycle film resistance decreases with the increase of corrosion potential E

@highlight Film resistance in DO cycle and DH cycle shows different trends with E
@highlight Pre immersion in high DH condition can enhance oxidation in DO condition.
@highlight Immersion history in low DH condition is favorable for corrosion resistance.
