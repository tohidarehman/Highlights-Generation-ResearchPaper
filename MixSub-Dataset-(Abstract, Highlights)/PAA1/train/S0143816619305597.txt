 A nonlinear optical multi image encryption scheme based on chaotic system and two dimensional linear canonical transform is designed . Firstly the low frequency sub bands of the four grayscale images are extracted with the contourlet transform respectively . Then the four sub bands are synthesized into a one dimensional sequence which is scrambled with a chaotic sequence produced by the two dimensional logistic map . Subsequently the image converted from the resulting 1D sequence is re encrypted into a white noise like image by phase truncation and phase reservation in the 2D LCT domain . Finally the XOR operation based on the 2D logistic map is performed on the white noise like image to yield the final ciphertext image . The parameters of the 2D LCT and the logistic map as the main keys enlarge the key space of the proposed multi image encryption scheme . In addition the keys regarded as the initial values of the chaotic systems are related to the original images . The phase truncation and the bitwise XOR operation as nonlinear processes improve the robustness of the presented multi image encryption scheme against chosen plaintext attack . Numerical simulation results demonstrate the validity and the reliability of the proposed optical multi image encryption scheme with good performance .

@highlight A nonlinear optical multi image encryption scheme based on chaotic system and two dimensional linear canonical transform is proposed.
@highlight The keys used in the chaotic systems are calculated from the pixels of the original images.
@highlight Multiple images are combined into one image in the presented scheme and the values and the positions of pixels in the image are both changed.
