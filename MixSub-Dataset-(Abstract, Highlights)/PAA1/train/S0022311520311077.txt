 Reduced activation ferriticmartensitic steels with different Cr contents were prepared to investigate the effect of Cr on the reheating cracking susceptibility in the weld heat affected zone . After HAZ simulation stress rupture tests were performed at 650750C corresponding to the post weld heat treatment temperature using a Gleeble simulator . Increasing the Cr content markedly reduced the rupture ductility resulting in an increase in the susceptibility to reheating cracking . This was attributed to the intergranular Cr enriched M

@highlight Reheating cracking susceptibility in the weld HAZ of RAFM steels was evaluated.
@highlight During rupture testing microvoids formed and grew along PAGB around M
@highlight carbides.
@highlight Coarse intergranular M
@highlight carbides acted as initiation sites for reheating cracking.
@highlight Size of intergranular M
@highlight carbide increased with an increase in Cr content.
@highlight Susceptibility to reheating cracking increased with an increase in Cr content.
