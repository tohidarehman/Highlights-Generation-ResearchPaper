 Lens distortion will cause errors in the measurement of deformation by digital image correlation when using a microscope at high magnification for image recording . To improve the measurement accuracy of 2D digital image correlation lens distortion was detected by rigid body translation tests for a micro speckle pattern using DIC calculation and by phase analysis of a cross grating using a Fourier transform . Based on the first order radial distortion model the coefficients for the lens distortion were determined using the least squares method . Then the displacement fields without lens distortion were obtained and accurate measurements were achieved even for images that were deformed by lens distortion . The results demonstrate that the average standard deviation of the displacement fields decreases by 60 for lens distortion correction by rigid body translation tests of a micro speckle pattern using DIC calculation and they decreased by 97 for phase analysis of a cross grating using a Fourier transform . The experimental results verify that digital image correlation is a powerful tool for micro scale deformation measurement using a microscope at high magnification as long as one correct for lens distortion .
