 A Digital Micromirror Device or DMD is an instrument used to encode information on a light beam by modulating its amplitude . This device is composed of an array of tiny mirrors that can be controlled individually and can thus act as binary apertures to control the amplitude of light . DMDs with a diamond pixel configuration have stretching distortion to the uploaded patterns . Although the patterns can be rescaled before uploading to the DMD there is no straightforward method to determine the proper scaling factor . Here we propose a method to find the scaling factor for the DMD by looking at diffraction caustics . We uploaded elliptical slits in the DMD that results in astroids caustics which collapse to a point when the correct scaling is matched . The scaling factor we found corrects both the inherent distortion caused by the DMD and the distortion caused by a slight misalignment of the DMD . This method offers a faster and more sensitive determination of the scale ratio instability of diffraction catastrophes and the very nature of diffraction . This method can be used to determine aspect ratios of other similar devices especially when these devices use differently shaped mirrors or when the devices orientation is constrained such that when it is tilted .

@highlight The digital micromirror device modulates the amplitude of light beams but suffers from scale distortion.
@highlight We demonstrate a method to determine the scale factor of a digital micromirror device by exploiting diffraction caustics.
@highlight The caustics dramatically change from 4 cusped astroid to a central dot pattern when the DMD pattern is properly rescaled.
@highlight This work offers a fast and accurate method to correct the scale distortion of the digital micromirror device without the need for image processing and analysis.
