 Silver nitrate of desired concentration was doped in the as synthesized MCM 41 mesoporous silica and the prepared samples are spin coated onto interdigitated thin films with silver on glass slide . The interdigitated thin film electrodes made of silver were fabricated by RF magnetron sputtering with power of 60Wat 7.210

@highlight Five order of magnitude change in impedance from undoped to Ag doped MCM 41 sample.
@highlight In house sensor system of silver interdigitated electrodes and Ag doped MCM 41.
@highlight Ag doped MCM41 displayed response and recovery time of 24s and 32s respectively.
@highlight The hysteresis of the as synthesized sample was 1.2 with standard deviation.
