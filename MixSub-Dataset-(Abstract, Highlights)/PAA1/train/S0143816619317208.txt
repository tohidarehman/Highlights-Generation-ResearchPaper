 To meet the need of on machine metrology in optical manufacturing a compact and snapshot dual mode interferometric system is proposed for surface shape and roughness measurement . To simplify the measurement process between surface shape and roughness a novel concept of using optical filters to separate the beam paths in the reference arm is introduced . A pixelated camera with a micro polarizer array acquires four pi 2 phase shifted interferograms simultaneously to minimize the environmental disturbance . Besides the configuration optimization based subaperture stitching technique is introduced to extend the measurable aperture range . Both numerical analysis and experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed compact snapshot dual mode interferometer . The proposed system provides a powerful and portable tool to achieve on machine surface characterization of various optical elements over a wide range of spatial frequencies and aperture sizes .

@highlight No reconfiguration removing or adding the matching objective in the reference arm is needed to switch the measurement modes.
@highlight The system is very compact in configuration with the dimension of 195 mm160 mm65 mm.
@highlight The stitching method is introduced for measuring large scale surface shape to address the major limitation of the compact configuration.
