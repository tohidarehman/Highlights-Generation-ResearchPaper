 Among tremendous efforts for enhanced photocatalysis construction of heterojunction has been deemed as an effective means . In comparison with type II heterojunction type I heterojunction receives less attention due to accumulation and increased recombination of charge carriers in one side of heterojunction . Herein we take NaBi MoO

@highlight can be grown on TiO
@highlight nanofibers.
@highlight Type I heterojunction can be separated to two type II heterojunctions by TiO
@highlight Two type II heterojunctions are more active than type I heterojunction.
