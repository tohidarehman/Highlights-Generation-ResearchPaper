 CuCrZr alloy has been widely considered to be used as heat sink materials in the fusion reactor due to its superior properties . However CuCrZr alloy suffers significant creep deformation and softening as the temperatures is above 300400

@highlight A novel Cu based alloy is designed and fabricated.
@highlight High friction of low CSL grain boundaries is introduced into the matrix.
@highlight High density Cr
@highlight Fe particles and Cr particles are detected in the matrix.
@highlight The alloy exhibits high thermal stability even annealed at 500
@highlight C for 72h.
