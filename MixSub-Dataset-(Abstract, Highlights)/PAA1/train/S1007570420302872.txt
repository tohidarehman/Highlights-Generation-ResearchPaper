 In this project we study the periodic Dirichlet boundary value problem for a singularly perturbed reaction advection diffusion equation on the segment in case of discontinuous reactive and convective terms . Applying the boundary function method we construct the asymptotic approximation of the periodic solution with internal transition layer located in the vicinity of a curve of discontinuity of the mentioned terms . For the problem here we prove the existence of the periodic solution estimate the accuracy of the asymptotical approximation and investigate the stability of the periodic solution as solutions of the corresponding initial boundary value problems for the reaction advection diffusion equation .

@highlight The main characteristic of discontinuous singularly perturbed parabolic is that the second partial derivative is discontinuous on the both sides of the discontinuous curve.
@highlight This characteristic leads to solution often feature a narrow internal layer region of rapid change near the discontinuous curve. Especially the value of the solution passing through the discontinuous curve is undetermined.
@highlight We can use the smooth connection method to make the solution smoothly passes through discontinuous curve and determine the passing position.
@highlight This is a new asymptotic method rather than the simply generalization of the methods of corresponding continuous system.
