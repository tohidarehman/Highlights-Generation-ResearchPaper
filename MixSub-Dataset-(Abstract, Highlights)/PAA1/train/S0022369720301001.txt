 Functional nanosized two dimensional clay mineral particles are considered as ideal host materials to manipulate the properties of incorporated organic molecules due to their high cation exchange capacity layer structure and intercalation properties . The interlayer height of clay layers can be manipulated by simultaneous wetting and drying steps . Here we have studied the chromatic behaviour of an organic dye generated

@highlight Synthesis of tetraindolyl derivative.
@highlight Preparation of clay mineral tetraindolyl hybrid self standing film.
@highlight Colour switching of hybrid film due to the change in gallery height of clay.
@highlight Colour switching was reversible with a very good stability.
@highlight Such colour switching is suitable for colorimetric sensor optical switching optical memory etc.
