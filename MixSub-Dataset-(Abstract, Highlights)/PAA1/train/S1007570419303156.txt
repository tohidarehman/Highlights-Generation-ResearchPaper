 Explicit formulas for complexity and unique invariant measure of the period doubling subshift can be derived from those for the Thue Morse subshift obtained by Brlek De Luca and Varricchio and Dekking . In this note we give direct proofs based on combinatorial properties of the period doubling sequence . We also derive explicit formulas for correlation integral and two basic characteristics of recurrence quantification analysis of the period doubling subshift recurrence rate and determinism . As a corollary we obtain that RQA determinism of this subshift converges to 1 as the threshold distance approaches0 .
