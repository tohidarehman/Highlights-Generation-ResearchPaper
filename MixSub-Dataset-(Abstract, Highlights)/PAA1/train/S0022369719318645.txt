 A device consisting of a multidomain liquid crystal polymer network sandwiched between a continuous electrode and a perforated silver electrode shows strong surface deformations upon application of an electric field between the electrodes . Here a new method is presented for the preparation of such a device in which a silver film with circular holes of a well controlled diameter was made by evaporating silver onto a monolayer of polystyrene spheres . Due to multilayer defects of the polystyrene microparticle lithography template larger combined holes were present which provided interesting information about the effect of pore size on the deformation behavior . The results were compared to an electrostatic field distribution from which the conclusion could be drawn that there is a minimum hole size that allows deformation . This knowledge is important for the development of applications for this kind of device as the aspect ratio of the deformations is of crucial importance for effects such as switchable wetting and self cleaning .
