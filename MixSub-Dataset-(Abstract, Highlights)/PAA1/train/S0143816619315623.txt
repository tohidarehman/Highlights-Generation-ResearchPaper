 Phase shifting profilometry has been widely used in three dimensional shape measurement because of its attributes of high accuracy and high resolution . However PSP typically works under fluorescent light flickering with a double frequency of the alternating current frequency which may generate a non ignorable phase error and result in a PSP s measurement error especially for PSP using a high sampling speed . We first mathematically describe the fluorescent light problem model the PSP s phase error and state the problem in high speed PSP . Next a fluorescent light error suppression algorithm is proposed to suppress the phase error . Both the phase error model and the proposed algorithm are theoretically analyzed and then numerically and experimentally verified . The provided numerical and experimental results coincide with the theoretical analysis . The proposed algorithm can reduce the phase error from 0.12rad to a comparable level with system noise of 0.02rad which is significant for the accurate measurement of 3 D shapes for high speed PSP in a fluorescent light environment .

@highlight This is the first time to discover and describe the fluorescent light problem but was totally ignored in phase shifting profilometry.
@highlight The fluorescent light problem could be serious especially for high speed phase shifting profilometry and generates the phase error up to 0.12rad.
@highlight A fluorescent light error suppression algorithm is proposed which can reduce the phase error to a comparable level with system noise of 0.02rad.
