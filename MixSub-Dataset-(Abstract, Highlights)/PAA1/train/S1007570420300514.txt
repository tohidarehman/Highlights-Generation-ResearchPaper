 Bose Einstein condensates provide a clear and controllable platform to study diverse intriguing emergent nonlinear effects that appear too in other physical settings such as bright and dark solitons in mean field theory as well as many body physics . Various ways have been elaborated to stabilize bright solitons in BECs three promising schemes among which are optical lattices formed by counterpropagating laser beams nonlinear managements mediated by Feshbach resonance spin orbit coupling engineered by dressing atomic spin states with laser beams . By combing the latter two schemes we discover from theory to calculations that the two component BECs with a spin orbit coupling and cubic atom atom interactions whose nonlinear distributions exhibit a well defined spatially periodic modulation can support one dimensional localized modes of two kinds fundamental solitons and soliton pairs comprised of dipole solitons or two peak solitons . The influence of three physical parameters chemical potential of the system strengths of both the Rashba spin orbit coupling and atom atom interactions on the existence and stability of the localized modes is investigated based on linear stability analysis and direct perturbed simulations . In particular we demonstrate that the localized modes can be stable objects provided always that both the inter and intraspecies interactions are attractive .

@highlight We address the one dimensional 1D localized modes of spin orbit coupled Bose Einstein condensates in nonlinear lattices.
@highlight The setting supports two classes of 1D localized modes fundamental solitons with a single peak and soliton pairs conisiting of dipole solitons anti phase or two peak solitons in phase .
@highlight The existence and stability of the localized modes are tested by linear stability analysis and direct perturbed simulations.
