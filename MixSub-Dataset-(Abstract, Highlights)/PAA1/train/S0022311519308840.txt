 Lithium aluminate has attracted researchers interests due to its wide applications . The structural electronic optical lattice phonon thermodynamic and thermo conductive properties of LiAlO

@highlight Electronic lattice phonon thermodynamic and thermo conductive properties of LiAlO
@highlight with
@highlight Li isotope substitution.
@highlight Li isotope substitution makes differences on its phonon dynamics thermodynamics and Infrared Raman spectra.
@highlight This is the first approach to calculate the thermal conductivity of LiAlO
@highlight . The method can be applied to other materials.
@highlight This is the first theoretical study on the effects of
@highlight Li isotope substitution on the properties of LiAlO
@highlight material.
@highlight Results are very useful for further to exploring the
@highlight H production and transport through LiAlO
@highlight ceramic pellets.
