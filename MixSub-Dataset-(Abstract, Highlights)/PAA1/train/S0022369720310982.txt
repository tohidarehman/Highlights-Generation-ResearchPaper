 Graphene oxide is considered as a toxic carbon material and the adverse impact of GO has been realized . Herein the spherical chitosan modified silicon dioxide CS SiO

@highlight The removal of GO on CS SiO
@highlight was dependent on pH and ionic strength.
@highlight The removal capacity of CS SiO
@highlight for GO was 111.8mg g.
@highlight The elimination of GO relied on the electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bond.
