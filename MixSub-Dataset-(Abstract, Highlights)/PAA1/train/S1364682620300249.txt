 Energetic particles precipitation which transmits energy from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere represents an important coupling process between two systems . In this study we investigate the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of medium energy energetic particle precipitation with NOAA POES observations . We found the following results During storm time both energetic electron and proton precipitations exhibit dawn dusk asymmetry in the equatorial plane possibly caused by plasma waves that are excited and then interact with energetic electrons and protons at different local times . The energetic proton precipitation appears to contain greater energy flux than electrons in storm time which is contrary to the low energy particle precipitation where the electrons carry the dominant precipitation energy . The depth of the earthward inner boundary of precipitation in statistics is linearly correlated with geomagnetic activity levels represented by the SYM H index .

@highlight Medium energy tens to hundreds of keV energetic precipitation of electrons and protons both exhibits global asymmetry.
@highlight Energetic proton precipitation contains more energy flux than electrons unlike the scenario in low energy precipitation.
@highlight The Earthward extension of precipitation linearly correlates with the storm intensity measured by SYM H index.
