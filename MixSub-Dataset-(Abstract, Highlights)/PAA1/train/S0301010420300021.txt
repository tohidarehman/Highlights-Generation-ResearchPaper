 We report on band structure calculations within a density functional theory of total and projected densities of states as well as experimental investigation of the electronic structure of Cu

@highlight Electronic structure of Cu
@highlight HgGeSe
@highlight crystal is studied by using XES and XPS techniques.
@highlight Total and partial densities of states are computed within TB mBJ SOC U approach.
@highlight Calculations within TB mBJ SOC U approach are in fair agreement with XES and XPS.
@highlight Main optical constants of Cu
@highlight HgSnSe
@highlight are explored in detail.
