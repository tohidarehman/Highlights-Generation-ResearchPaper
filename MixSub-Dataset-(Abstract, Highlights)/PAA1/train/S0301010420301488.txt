 Constructing van der Waals heterostructures can be considered as an effective strategy for generating new physical phenomena that merit for high efficiency nanodevices . Here we construct the

@highlight The PbI2 SnSe2 heterostructure possesses an indirect band gap semiconductor and exhibits a type I band alignment.
@highlight The optical absorption of the PbI2 SnSe2 heterostructure in both the visible light and ultra violet regions is enhanced.
@highlight Type I to type II band alignment and the semiconductor to metal transitions are also observed in the PbI2 SnSe2 heterostructure when the electric field is applied.
