 High purity SiC and SiC SiC composites coated with commercial TiN Cr CrN or CrN Cr multilayer coatings were irradiated in Ar or flowing PWR water in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Nuclear Reactor Laboratory . Irradiation in Ar was performed in the core . In the water environment identical samples were placed in one of three different locations in core providing exposure to neutron damage and radiolysis affected water above core where samples were exposed to radiolysis affected water but not neutron damage or outside of the core where samples were exposed to the coolant water without the effects of radiation . Radiation in Ar revealed significant cracking of all but the TiN coatings attributed to differential swelling between the coating and substrate . Lattice swelling was not observed in any of the coatings but 0.2 void swelling was observed in the Cr coating . All of the coatings failed during water exposures in the core . CrN Cr spalled in each condition . Cr was protective except under radiation damage as a result of cracking and TiN severely degraded in the core with no coating was found following exposure . A SiC coating ATF cladding system is expected to perform adequately following improvements in coating ductility and purity .

@highlight Four commercial coatings on SiC were irradiated in Ar and PWR water.
@highlight Differential swelling led to failure of the Cr and CrN coatings.
@highlight TiN was resilient to irradiation in Ar but failed under irradiation in water.
@highlight Improvements in coating ductility and purity are expected to improve performance.
