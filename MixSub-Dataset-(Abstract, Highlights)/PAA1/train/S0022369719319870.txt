 We present experimental and first principles studies of the lattice dynamics of the recently discovered new compounds La

@highlight Ln
@highlight CrGe

@highlight  Ln La Pr Nd constitute a new class of low dimensional antiferromagnets.
@highlight Observed vibrations of Ln
@highlight CrGe
@highlight Be
@highlight point to the langasite structure.
@highlight Both Raman and IR modes are uniformly distributed over the spectral range 80840cm
@highlight The spectra are well simulated by DFT calculations with the B3LYP hybrid functional.
