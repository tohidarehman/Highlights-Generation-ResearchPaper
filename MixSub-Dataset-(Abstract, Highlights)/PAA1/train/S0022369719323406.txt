 The elemental composition of GeSe glasses prepared by different methods and the distribution of Ge and Se along the bulk sample length are investigated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry . The estimated uncertainty of Ge and Se content measurement is 0.020.05at .

@highlight A technique has been developed for determining the elemental composition of Ge Se glasses and optical fibers by ICP AES.
@highlight The analysis results accuracy is characterized by expanded uncertainty of 0.020.05 at. 
@highlight  0.95 .
@highlight The chemical composition of glassy samples of Ge Se systems and optical fibers depends on the preparation method.
