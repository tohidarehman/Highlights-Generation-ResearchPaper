 Particle size distribution measurement is important for improving product quality inhibiting environmental pollution and safeguarding human health . The near field scattering technique offers many substantial advantages over conventional techniques . However the reconstruction equations are ill posed and it is difficult to get a reliable solution . In this paper we propose a new method that can solve the reconstruction equations . This method combines the Backus Gilbert eclectic theory with truncated singular value decomposition method to obtain a non negative approximation solution as the initial value of Chahine algorithm for fine calculation . Our method exhibited good performance with several numerical cases of unimodal and bimodal PSDs . It was then used for PSD measurement of two standard particles 120 028 and 120 047 using the NFS techniques . The relative errors of the length mean diameter with respect to the peak size of these two standard particles were 0.18 and 0.76 respectively .
