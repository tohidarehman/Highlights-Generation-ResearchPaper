 Alzheimers disease is a worldwide disease of dementia and is characterized by beta amyloid plaques . Increasing evidences show that there is a positive feedback loop between the level of beta amyloid and the level of calcium . In this paper stochastic noises are incorporated into a minimal model of Alzheimers disease which focuses upon the evolution of beta amyloid and calcium . Mathematical analysis indicates that solutions of the model without stochastic noises converge either to a unique equilibrium or to bistable equilibria . Analytical conditions for the stochastic P bifurcation are derived by means of technique of slow fast dynamical systems . A formula is presented to approximate the mean switching time from a normal state to a pathological state . A disease index is also proposed to predict the risk to transit from a normal state to a disease state . Further numerical simulations reveal how the parameters influence the evolutionary outcomes of beta amyloid and calcium . These results give new insights on the strategies to slow the development of Alzheimers disease .
