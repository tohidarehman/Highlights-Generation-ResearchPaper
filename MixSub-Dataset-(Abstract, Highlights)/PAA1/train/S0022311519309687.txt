 This study investigates the effect of a built up sequence on the hot cracking resistivity of dissimilar clads . Dissimilar clads of Inconel 52 and austenitic stainless steel 308L were produced using submerged arc welding of the carbon steel . Hot cracking occurred near the fusion boundary when the STS 308L was cladded to the buffer layer of Inconel 52 . Causative factors were identified as the wide transition zone in the interface between the dissimilar clads and the eutectic type Laves phase having a high level of S and P contents and a continuous geometry of thin films formed along the grain boundary . Hot cracks did not appear when Inconel 52 was cladded to the buffer layer of 308L stainless steel . Hot cracking resistivity was significantly improved by forming ferrite in the interfacial boundary for the Inconel 52 STS 308L clad .

@highlight Hot cracking depends on the built up sequence of Inconel 52 and STS 308L overlay.
@highlight Hot cracks occurred in a wide transition zone having continuous eutectic Laves.
@highlight The ferrites remaining in the interdendritic region improved hot cracking resistance.
@highlight Inconel 52 STS 308L clad had fast solidification and a narrow transition zone.
