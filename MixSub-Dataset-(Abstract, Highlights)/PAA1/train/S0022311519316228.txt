 We use atomistic simulations to investigate the interaction of vacancies and interstitials with interfaces between a crystalline metal and an amorphous covalently bonded solid . We select the gold silicon binary system as a model material and construct interface models along two different facets of crystalline Au and with amorphous Si created at three different quench rates . We compute formation energies of vacancies self interstitials and interstitial impurities as a function of position relative to the interface and find that they have markedly lower values near the interface than in the interior of the adjoining phases . We conclude that crystal amorphous metal covalent interfaces may be as effective at removing radiation induced point defects as interfaces in polycrystalline metals composites . Moreover irrespective of interface character the average formation energies of all point defects at all the Au a Si interfaces we investigated are comparable . Thus unlike in polycrystalline metals where an interfaces crystallographic character has a marked effect on its interactions with point defects all interface types in crystal amorphous metal covalent composites may be equally effective at absorbing all radiation induced defects .

@highlight Atomistic models of crystalline gold Au amorphous silicon Si interfaces are developed.
@highlight Formation energies of vacancies and interstitials are markedly lower near the interface than inside the adjoining phases.
@highlight Irrespective of interface character the formation energies of all point defects at Au a Si interfaces are nearly identical.
@highlight Interfaces between crystalline metals and amorphous covalently bonded solids are effective sinks for point defects.
