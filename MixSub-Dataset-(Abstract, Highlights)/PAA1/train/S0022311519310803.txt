 The former EU reference lithium orthosilicate based breeder pebbles were exposed to neutron irradiation in the HICU experiment to test their stability and tritium release properties under DEMO relevant conditions . The samples varying by three different Li 6 contents were exposed to irradiation at two different temperatures and the pebbles were either pre compacted or not . This second part of the post irradiation examination is focussing on the tritium release behaviour of the ceramic breeder pebbles .

@highlight The tritium release behaviour is strongly influenced by the irradiation temperature.
@highlight Tritium is released in a multi staged process as HTO HT or corresponding fragments.
