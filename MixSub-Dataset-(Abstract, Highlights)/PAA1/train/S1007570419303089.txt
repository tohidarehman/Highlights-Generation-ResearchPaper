 A new analytic multi component gravitational model with three degrees of freedom to describe the orbital properties of stars in a double barred galaxy is introduced . We assume that the galaxy contains two bars the primary one parallel to the disc and the secondary one which is perpendicular to the primary bar . By following the trajectories belonging to large sets of starting conditions we manage to distinguish between localized and escaping motion of stars . The character of orbits is revealed by presenting modern colour coded diagrams on several choices of planes of two dimensions . Additionally we investigate the properties of the normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds associated with the index 1 saddle points of the system . The dynamics near the index 1 saddle points is demonstrated by presenting the bifurcation diagrams of the Lyapunov periodic orbits and by visualizing the restriction of the Poincar maps to the NHIMs . Useful conclusions are drawn by comparing our results with previous related ones from other types of Hamiltonian systems .

@highlight We introduce a new analytical gravitational model for describing the motion of stars in double barred galaxies.
@highlight We reveal the escape dynamics of the system by presenting the corresponding basins of escape of the system.
@highlight The role of the normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds NHIMs associated with the Lyapunov orbits is investigated.
