 The present study aims at understanding the microstructure and mechanical properties of different commercially available TiAl alloys with the composition of Ti 45Al 2Nb 2Mn 0.8B Ti 44Al 4.5Nb 1Mo 0.15B and Ti 47.5Al 2Nb 2Cr developed by direct laser cladding using a high power Nd YAG laser with adapted parameters for laser power velocity and powder feed rate . DLC has been carried out by feeding the powder into the interaction zone of laser beam and substrate forming a melt pool which subsequently solidifies rapidly to build bulk volumes with the dimension of 101010mm . The effect of preheating at 1053K and shrouding environment on the characteristics and mechanical properties has also been studied in details . Direct laser cladding leads to continuous and defect free microstructures . However the microstructures were found to depend on the composition of ternary elements and to some extent on the preheating . There was a marginal coarsening of microstructure when cladding was performed by simultaneous heating . There was predominantly and
