 In this paper we focus on investigating a dimensional generalized breaking soliton equation with five model parameters which contains a lot of important nonlinear partial differential equations as its special cases . Firstly the integrability features of two special cases of the gBS equation are clarified . Secondly a general method is established to construct solutions formed by a combination of

@highlight Some integrable properties of gBS equation are clarified.
@highlight A systematic method is provided to construct multiple cosh solutions.
@highlight The non static lump solution and its analysis are presented.
@highlight The real lump soliton solutions and other exact solutions are obtained.
