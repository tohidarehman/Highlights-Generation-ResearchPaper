 Laser direct copper patterning of fine pitch features on polyimide flexible substrate was investigated . On such thin substrates laser parameters should be optimized in order to minimize the damage beneath the conductive layer as it might lead to severe robustness issues . We selected several parameter sets and compared them in terms of damage depth feature sizes and edge straightness . On bare copper PCBs we managed to limit the average damage to a depth of 8m while getting features characteristics significantly better than what would be obtained with standard chemical etching . We also demonstrated alternative parameter sets that allow to obtain ultra thin features or very straight edges at the cost of deeper damage in the substrate .
