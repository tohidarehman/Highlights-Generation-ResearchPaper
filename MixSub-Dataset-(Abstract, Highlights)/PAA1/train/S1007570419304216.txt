 This paper focuses on the vibration behaviors of a hollow shaft rotor system in presence of an open crack under inherent model uncertainties . Non probabilistic interval variables are used to represent the uncertain parameters which releases the high demands of probabilistic knowledge in the traditional methods . In modeling the shaft local stiffness matrix of the cracked element is derived by using the neutral axis method . The periodic response of the rotor system is solved by combination of the finite element method and the harmonic balance method . A simple mathematical function termed as the uncertain response surrogate function is constructed to estimate the vibrational response in various cases where different parametric uncertainties are taken into consideration . In order to verify the robustness and accuracy of the URSF the bounds of estimated response are compared with those obtained from the classical methods . Results show that the surrogate function has good accuracy and robustness providing an effective method and guidance for diagnosing crack in uncertain context .

@highlight The open crack in a hollow shaft is modeled based on relationships between crack depth and shaft radii.
@highlight The surrogate function for the uncertain dynamic response is established using the interval descriptions.
@highlight The accuracy and robustness of the interval methodology are validated by traditional sampling methods.
@highlight The nonlinear dynamics are analyzed considering various uncertain parameters with different variations.
