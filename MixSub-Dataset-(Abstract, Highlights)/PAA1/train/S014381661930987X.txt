 Two methods are proposed to determine structure surface strain fields in the presence of discontinuities . A partition inverse sequence calculation method is presented to calculate displacement based on image matching from the second last to first image sequentially . The final deformed image is selected as a reference image and several areas of interest are identified along the crack boundary prior to calculation . A strain gauge guided partial derivative of a radial basis function method is introduced to obtain strain distributions . Experimental data from strain gauges that adhered to specimen surfaces are applied to estimate shape parameter and obtain guided values followed by strain calculation based on PD RBF . Two typical experiments are conducted to verify the validity and accuracy of the PISC and SPD RBF . Moreover the proposed methods are successfully applied to evaluate the strain distributions at the crack tip of a cast iron beam . The experimental results further validate the applicability of the proposed methods in handling deformation with discontinuities .
