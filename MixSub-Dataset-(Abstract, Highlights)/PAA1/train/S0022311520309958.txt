 Lanthanide fission products such as neodymium formed during the irradiation of metallic fuels are known to cause deleterious effects from chemical interactions occurring at the fuel cladding interface a phenomenon known as fuel cladding chemical interaction . The use of fuel based additives that bind with the lanthanide elements within the fuel meat alleviating their interactions at the fuel cladding interface is one potential method proposed to mitigate the FCCI phenomenon and extend the burnup potential of such metallic fuel systems . In this study antimony is evaluated as one such additive and neodymium is used to represent the lanthanides . A Sb Nd alloy is fabricated which consists of two intermetallic phases SbNd and Sb

@highlight Antimony is investigated as a potential fuel additive to mitigate fuel cladding chemical interactions FCCI .
