 The C doped modified layer on uranium surface was prepared by pulsed laser irradiating in methane atmosphere . The microstructure of the obtained layer was characterised by X ray diffraction Auger electron spectroscopy and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy . The results show that the obtained layer is a composite layer with a gradual transition structure from UO

@highlight C doped modified layer with C concentration above 40at on uranium surface was prepared by pulsed laser irradiating.
@highlight The layer is a composite layer with a gradual transition structure from surface to interior.
@highlight UC
@highlight is more resistant to oxidation than UC
@highlight  UC under oxygen exposure.
@highlight Free carbon is distributed in the surface layer of modified layer and also formed after oxidation at RT.
@highlight C doped modified layer improved the corrosion resistance of metallic uranium.
