 We consider a modification of the well studied Hamiltonian Mean Field model with cosine potential by introducing a hard core point like repulsive interaction and propose a numerical integration scheme to integrate its dynamics . Our results show that the outcome of the initial violent relaxation is altered and also that the phase diagram is modified with a critical temperature at a higher value than in its counterpart without hard core collisions .

@highlight Systems with long range interactions have drawn a great deal of attention over the last few decades not only because they are common in nature e.g. self gravitating systems and charged plasmas but also due to many unusual phenomena not observed in short range interacting systems. In the present paper we discuss for the Hamiltonian mean field model a much studied system the effects on the system dynamics of the introduction of a hard core point like interaction resulting in a system with both global and strong short range interactions.
@highlight We developed a numeric algorithm for the molecular dynamics of this type of mixed interaction and applied it to understand how the violent relaxation and the long term dynamics are altered.
@highlight This is a first and original step to understand how the special phenomenology of long range interacting systems is altered by hard core potentials and point to new research and relevant open problems.
