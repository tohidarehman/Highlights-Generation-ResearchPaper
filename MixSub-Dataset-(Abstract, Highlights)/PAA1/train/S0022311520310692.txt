 The Fe13Cr4.5Al2Mo alloys one of the most promising candidates for the accident tolerant fuel cladding in the light water reactors were strengthened with Nb addition and the strengthening mechanism were assessed by an internal friction measurement method combined with microstructure characterization . The FeCrAlMo alloy with 1.0wt Nb addition exhibited the highest ultimate tensile strength and an acceptable ductility at each tested temperature . For example at 700C the UTS of FeCrAlMo 1wt Nb was about 215MPa which was 53.5 higher than that of Nb free FeCrAlMo alloy . For Nb free FeCrAlMo alloy a high IF peak P
