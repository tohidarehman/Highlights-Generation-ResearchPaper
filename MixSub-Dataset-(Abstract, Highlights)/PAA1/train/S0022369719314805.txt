 We investigated the electrochemical performance of reduced graphene oxide carbon nanotube hybrid papers as binder free anodes for potassium ion batteries . RGO CNT hybrid papers were fabricated by vacuum filtration and thermal reduction . The potassium ion storage ability of rGO paper was significantly enhanced by CNT incorporation and the electrochemical performance of the hybrid papers was related to the weight ratio of CNTs . The optimal rGO CNT 30 paper can deliver an initial reversible discharge capacity of 351 and 223mAhg
