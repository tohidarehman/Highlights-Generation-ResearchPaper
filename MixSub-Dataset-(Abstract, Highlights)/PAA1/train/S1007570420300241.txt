 Rumors are spreading all over the network drastically affecting millions of people in a minuscule instance . This malicious news can be a cause of panic social unrest political imbalance and slow economic growth of the country . Epidemiological modeling is a valuable tool to describe not only the dynamics of rumor on a social network but also analyzing the effect of various control strategies for handling emergencies . The time delay is viewed as a latent period and immune period in epidemics . Similarly time delay exists in rumor spreading on the social network not only to influence thinkers by rumor adopters but also in expert intervention and government policy . On the basis of these premises we propose a computational mathematical model of malicious news dynamics on a homogeneous social network and demonstrate the effect of delay in expert intervention and government action . Here we observe that it is difficult to judge the opinion of the social network user about any particular event if experts take more time to respond and are not continuously active to make aware of the newcomers . Also social network data become unpredictable so this work can be helpful for the information security of social network data .

@highlight A rumor model on social network is presented.
@highlight We included delays in expert intervention and government action.
@highlight The critical value of delay in expert intervention and condition of Hopf bifurcation are obtained
@highlight The local stability condition of rumor free equilibrium is obtained.
@highlight Delay in expert intervention can be a cause of unstable situation of a social network system.
