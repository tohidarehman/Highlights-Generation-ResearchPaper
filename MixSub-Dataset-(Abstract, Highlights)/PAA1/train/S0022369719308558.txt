 In recent years perovskite solar cells are performing remarkably with efficiency more than 20 . Performance can further be improved by controlling charge transfer and recombination at electron transport material absorber and absorber hole transport material interfaces which ultimately define conduction band offset and valence band offset . Therefore it is worthwhile to investigate optimum band offset to get efficient PSCs . Spiro MeOTAD is organic HTM commonly used in PSCs while CuI CuSCN and Cu

@highlight The PSC with CuI as HTM exhibits best PCE of 22.69 .
@highlight This study shows useful inorganic HTMs alternate to traditional organic HTM.
@highlight Performance of the PSCs strongly depends on the defect density and band offsets.
