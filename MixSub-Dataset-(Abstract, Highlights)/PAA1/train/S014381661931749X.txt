 Laser biological tissue welding is a potential alternative technology from traditional suturing skills . In this study we explored the influence laws of laser scanning path on in vitro skin tissue performance and designed four different scanning paths including heartbeat circle peano20 2 and toothed paths . Then the influence laws of laser scanning paths on temperature distributions mechanical properties and microstructure characteristics were discussed based on the simple factor design of experiments . The samples under the heartbeat path reached the highest peak temperature and the highest tensile strength but possessed sparse microstructure . The peak temperature of the samples under the circle path was close to that of the heartbeat samples but the tensile strength was only 8.667N cm

@highlight Four different scanning paths including heartbeat circle peano20 2 and toothed paths have been designed. And each path shares different symmetry density and linearity. All four paths were designed based on tissue structures and laser properties which can reunion the injured tissue effectively.
@highlight Then the influence laws of laser scanning paths on temperature distributions mechanical properties and microstructure characteristics were discussed based on the simple factor design of experiments.
@highlight We extracted some very important characteristic parameters from skin structure images and analyzed the tissue characteristics based on micro scale.
