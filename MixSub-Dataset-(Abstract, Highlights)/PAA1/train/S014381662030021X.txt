 Diffraction imposes a barrier to resolve objects smaller than half the wavelength used to illuminate them . In optical microscopy this barrier was surpassed 25 years ago . One form of achieving super resolution is the use of complex amplitude pupil masks . Spatial light modulators can be used to produce these masks if we compensate the aberrations introduced by them . In this paper we propose a method to encode a complex amplitude pupil mask in a phase only spatial light modulator of the Liquid Crystal on Silicon variety . We describe the form in which the pupil mask is encoded in a phase grating generated with an LCoS spatial light modulator and how the aberrations introduced by this device can also be compensated with this grating . We present numerical and experimental results that validate the method .

@highlight The method we present here consists of a single element to generate complex super resolving masks characterized by being fully reprogrammable.
@highlight The said element is a spatial light modulator of the LCoS type whose surface s deformations are corrected in such a way it will no contribute to degrading the image quality.
@highlight The phase flicker of LCoS SLM devices that appeared as a biting phenomenon when superposing two different pupils was avoided by generating a complex amplitude pupil mask in a single phase only SLM.
@highlight In the 1 diffraction order are codified a the phase maps that correct the wavefronts emerging from the SLM s deformed surface b the phase pupil and c the amplitude pupil.
@highlight This method can finds applications in microscopy and other optical instruments requiring improving resolution through a super resolving mask.
