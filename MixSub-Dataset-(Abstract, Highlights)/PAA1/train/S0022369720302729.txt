 Solidification experiment of Mg 4Y 3Nd 1.2Al alloy cast in a step like sand mold casting shows that a slow cooling rather than a fast cooling leads to grain refinement during solidification with in situ formed nucleant particles Al

@highlight The grain refinement of Mg 4Y 3Nd 1.2Al alloy is achieved at a slow cooling rate with in situ formed nucleant particles in melt.
@highlight The refinement of mesh size from 3 m to 1 m does not apparently influence the predicted results.
@highlight A critical particle size exists above which the grain refinement becomes less sensitive to cooling rate.
@highlight Surviving possibility of particle in interdendritic area is simulated to be higher under a slow cooling condition.
