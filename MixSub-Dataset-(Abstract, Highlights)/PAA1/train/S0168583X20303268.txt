 K X ray spectra of four intermediate Z atoms Ge As Se and Br generated by photon excitation are analyzed using a wavelength dispersive spectrometer . The energy shifts and relative intensities of low energy K X ray satellites KMMRAE lines are measured and compared with theoretical estimates wherever available . Supplementing the present results with the reported data their dependence on atomic number is examined .

@highlight This is a study KMMRAE of Ge As Se and Br by photon excitation.
@highlight The energy shifts and the integrated relative intensity of KMMRAE are determined.
@highlight The experimental energy shifts agree satisfactorily with theoretical values.
@highlight The integrated relative intensity is slightly underestimated by theory.
@highlight Z dependence of the energy shifts and the integrated relative intensity is examined.
