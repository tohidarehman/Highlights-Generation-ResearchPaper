 We consider a version of the ultimatum game which simultaneously combines reactive and Darwinian aspects with offers in . By reactive aspects we consider the effects that lead the player to change their offer given the previous result . On the other hand Darwinian aspects correspond to copying a better strategy according to best game payoff when the current player compares with one of their neighbours . Therefore we consider three different strategies which govern how the players change their offers greedy moderate and conservative . First we provide an analytic study of a static version of game where Darwinian aspects are not considered . Then by using numerical simulations of a detailed and complete multi agent system on a two dimensional lattice we add an extra feature in which players probabilistically escape from extreme offers for obvious reasons . The players are also endowed reciprocity on their gains as proposers which is reflected on their gains as responders . We also analyse the influence of the players mobility effects . An analysis of the emergence of coexistence of strategies and changes on the dominant strategies are observed which in turn depends on the players mobility rate .

@highlight Ultimatum game is considered in a version that mixes reactive and Darwinian aspects.
@highlight Players that moderate their greedy dominate the population in high diffusion.
@highlight Numerical results are studied considering a suitable Multi agent system.
@highlight Analytical results deduce how the portfolios can lead to the fairness.
