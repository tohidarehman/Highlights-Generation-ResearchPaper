 We experimentally numerically and theoretically characterize the effectiveness of incommensurate excitations at suppressing chaos in damped driven systems . Specifically we consider an inertial Brownian particle moving in a prototypical two well potential and subjected to a primary harmonic excitation and a suppressory incommensurategeneric excitation . We show that the effective amplitude of the suppressory excitation is minimal when the impulse transmitted by it is near its maximum while its value is rather insensitive to higher order convergents of the irrational ratio between the involved driving periods . Remarkably the number and values of the effective initial phase difference between the two excitations are independent of the impulse while they critically depend on each particular convergent in a complex way involving both the approximate frustration of chaos inducing homoclinic bifurcations and the maximum survival of relevant spatio temporal symmetries of the dynamical equation .

@highlight This paper studies the effectiveness in chaos suppresing of incommensurately related drivings acting in a archetypal nonlinear oscillator.
@highlight It has been characterized experimental numerical and theoretically the dependence of regularized behaviours with the parameters of the system.
@highlight It has been shown the fundamental role played by the impulse transmitted by the suppressory excitation.
