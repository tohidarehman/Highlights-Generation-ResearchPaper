 According to Vegard s law larger radius atoms substitute for smaller atoms in a solid solution would enlarge the lattice parameters . However by first principles calculations we have observed unusual lattice shrinkage when W replaces Ge in rock salt GeTe . We attribute this anomalous contract to the larger electronegativity difference between W and Te than between Ge and Te which results in shorter WTe bonds and pronounced local distortion around W dopants . The present work would provide new insight into the lattice parameter determination and a deeper understanding of the structural properties of ternary solid solutions .

@highlight Anomalous lattice shrinkage has been observed when smaller Ge in rock salt GeTe is replaced by larger W.
@highlight The larger electronegativity difference between W and Te than between Ge and Te results in shorter WTe bonds.
@highlight Shorter WTe bonds reduced lattice parameters and induced pronounced local distortion around W dopants.
@highlight Electronegativity difference between dopant and host atoms is crucial in determining lattice parameters of complex alloys.
