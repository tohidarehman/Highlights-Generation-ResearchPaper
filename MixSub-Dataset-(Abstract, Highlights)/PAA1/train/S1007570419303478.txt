 Coupled dispersionless equation is an important model in quantum physics . Complex coupled dispersionless equation has valuable applications in geomerty . Recently Ablowitz and Musslimani introduced and investigated a large class of reverse space reverse time and reverse space time nonlocal integrable equations . In this paper we investigate a reverse space time nonlocal complex coupled dispersionless equation which was proposed in our paper . By means of the Darboux transformation we obtain its multi soliton solutions from zero seed and nonzero seed . The asymptotic behavior of these solutions is discussed .
