 True 3D display with continuous depth rendering is a key issue for augmented reality display system . However the discrete sampling characteristics of current display devices makes the 3D images discontinuous in both lateral and depth directions . For depth information very limited depth planes can be rendered especially when the resolution of the display device is low . To address the limitation a kind of augmented reality display device that can output continuous depth information using a modulated illumination integral imaging technique is demonstrated . Light field with a continuous directional component is achieved in a digitized integral imaging system by using a modulated convergent backlight . A custom designed transparent off axis spherical reflective lens is used as an optical combiner to project the light field images into the real world . Two prototype augmented reality display devices are fabricated that provided continuous depth information ranging from 0.5 m to 3 m for 3D images in front of the optical combiner . 3D images with continuous focus cues and double depth of field are realized using a simple optical structure . The imaging mechanisms of the augmented reality display devices are deduced analytically . The imaging characters of the augmented reality display devices are tested and verified .
