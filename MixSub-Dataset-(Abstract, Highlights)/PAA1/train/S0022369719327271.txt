 In this study europium and dysprosium doped phosphors i.e . ZnO Eu ZnO Dy and Eu Dy co doped zinc oxide semiconductor phosphors with optimized concentrations were synthesized using the conventional solid state reaction method in an oxygen environment . Detailed structural morphological and compositional investigations were conducted using X ray diffraction scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X ray measurements respectively . Photoluminescence emission spectra were recorded under different excitation wavelengths to assess the optical characteristics . Electrical analysis was conducted using an inductance capacitance and resistance meter and a Keithley source meter and magnetic analysis was performed using a vibrating sample magnetometer . XRD confirmed the presence of Eu and Dy ions because the diffraction peaks matched perfectly with those for Eu

@highlight ZnO Eu Dy shows luminescence.
@highlight ZnO Eu Dy is magnetic conductive.
@highlight ZnO Eu Dy is luminomagnetic.
