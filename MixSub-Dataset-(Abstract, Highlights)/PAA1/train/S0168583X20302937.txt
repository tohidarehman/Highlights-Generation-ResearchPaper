 In this work low energy fragment ion beams were produced from hexamethyldisiloxane used as a source material and substrates were irradiated by these beams with supplemental oxygen gas for the formation of silicon dioxide SiO

@highlight Hexamethyldisiloxane HMDSO has been employed for the deposition of silicon dioxide SiO
@highlight  films.
@highlight We proposed a methodology for SiO2 formation with the ion beam deposition with HMDSO.
@highlight We obtained SiO
@highlight ion beams by the mass selection and then irradiated the SiO
@highlight ions to substrates.
@highlight After the completion of experiment we discovered SiO
@highlight films deposited on the substrate.
