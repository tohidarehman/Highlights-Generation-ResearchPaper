 Moving a large aperture reference mirror with a significant weight through piezoelectric transducers for phase shifting introduces considerable challenges and potential problems in conventional reference mirror phase shifting interferometry . In this report we present measured element phase shifting interferometry which provides an alternative approach for RMPSI without the restrictions of both the aperture and weight of the RM . The proposed MEPSI actuates a low friction workbench with an ME on board by single PZT to realize high accuracy phase shifting which is not affected by the aperture or the RM weight of . On this basis a tilt shift immune phase shifting algorithm is further applied to restrain the influence of residual tilt shift errors and other possible error sources on the measuring accuracy . Theoretical analysis and preliminary experiments indicate that the proposed MEPSI can achieve the same level of accuracy as RMPSI and a ZYGO interferometer and the repeatability of MEPSI which is not affected by the weight of the ME is superior to 0.002 . MEPSI solves the problems of phase shifting with large aperture and heavy weight RM thereby providing a simple and feasible alternative approach for conventional RMPSI with the same level of accuracy and with no phase shift calibration .
