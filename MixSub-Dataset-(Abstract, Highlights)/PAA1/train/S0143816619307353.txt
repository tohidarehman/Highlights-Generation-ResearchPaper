 We propose a laser speckle reduction method using a fast focus tunable lens . Different laser beams are generated after modulating the FTL . Thus when the laser beams are used to illuminate a diffuser various speckle images are obtained and the summed speckle images yield a reduced speckle contrast ratio . To maximize the tuning range of the focal length of the FTL for efficient speckle reduction the FTL operates in a resonant mode at the resonant frequency at 97Hz . The effect of the change of the distance between the FTL and the diffuser on the efficiency of speckle reduction is investigated . Experimental results show that the lowest objective speckle contrast ratio is 0.05 . After the application of this speckle reduction component in a laser projector the subjective speckle contrast ratio is reduced from 0.16 to 0.09 . In comparison with other speckle reduction methods the method proposed in this study is simple and effective and can be used in practice in laser projection displays .
