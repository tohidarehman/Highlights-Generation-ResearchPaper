 Transmission electron microscopy was used to compare the microstructural defects produced in an Fe9Cr model alloy during exposure to neutrons protons or self ions . Samples from the same model alloy were irradiated using fission neutrons 2MeV Fe

@highlight Proton irradiation redistributes alloyed elements without necessarily requiring a temperature shift to compensate dose rate
@highlight Vacancy dislocation loops were found to comprise the majority of damage after 2 MeV Fe irradiation
@highlight Proton irradiation lead to larger cavities indicating implanted hydrogen might play a role in their formation
@highlight  phases were found at a density 9 higher when the dose rate from
@highlight was reduced by a factor of 3
