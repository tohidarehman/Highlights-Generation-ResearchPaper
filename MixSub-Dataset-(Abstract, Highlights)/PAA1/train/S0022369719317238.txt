 Quantification of bioactive molecules through voltammetry techniques is significant over the past decades due to its adaptability and precision of assessment at the trace level . The present study involves a sensitive voltammetric process for the detection of nimesulide was developed at nanoclay blended carbon paste electrode applying voltammetric techniques such as cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry in a media of pH 7.0 phosphate buffer solution . The proposed nanosensor increased peak current by a less negative shift in the potential due to electro catalytic properties of nanoclay particles . The persuade of physicochemical constraint on the voltammetric behavior of NIM were studied . Based on the obtained results number of protons and electrons participated in the electrooxidation reaction heterogeneous rate constant value detection and quantification limits were also calculated . The proposed electrode showed lower detection limit value of 1.01nM and hence can be used to determine NIM in tablet and urine samples with good recovery values .

@highlight Novel nanoclay based electrodes were efficiently used to determine nimesulide.
@highlight Nanoclay based sensor showed excellent sensitivity selectivity and low value 1.01x10 9 of limit of detection.
@highlight Nanosensor has potential to apply in the human urine samples with excellent recovery values.
