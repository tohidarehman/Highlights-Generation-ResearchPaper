 Band structure and optical spectrum of hexagonal and tetragonal ScN monolayers are studied using density functional theory . More accurate and reliable mBJ GGA method is applied to find the compressive and tensile strain effects on electronic and optical properties of these structures . Results show different band structure and optical behavior of these models and considerable effects of tension on their physical properties .

@highlight Impact of Stress and strain on electronic and optical properties of h ScN and t ScN monolayers are studied.
@highlight mBJ GGA method is used to find more accurate results for the band gap.
@highlight In contrast to the t ScN the h ScN is only stable under tensile strain.
@highlight The threshold of the absorption spectrum depends on strain values.
