 This paper presents the first comparative experimental assessment of the microstructures of the same surveillance specimens of VVER 1000 high Ni weld after the primary irradiation recovery annealing and re irradiation in the same industrial NPP to assess the possibility of its lifetime extension after annealing up to 60 years . Therein studies of both the initial and radiation induced hardening phases and the behavior of grain boundary segregation as well are presented .

@highlight VVER 1000 high Ni weld is studied by APT TEM AES in primary and re irradiated states.
@highlight parameters of hardening elements are equal in primary and re irradiated states.
@highlight Grain boundary segregation level is the same in primary and re irradiated states.
@highlight Re embrittlement rate of high Ni VVER 1000 welds should not exceed the primary one.
