 By combining experimental observations on Gd doped fuel with a theoretical understanding the variation in thermal conductivity with Gd concentration and accommodation mechanism has been modelled . Four types of Gd accommodation mechanisms have been studied . In UO

@highlight Effect of Gadolinium accommodation mechanism on thermal conductivity of Gd doped UO
@highlight Effect of Gadolinium concentration on thermal conductivity of Gd doped UO
@highlight Less phonon scattering by defect clusters than by isolated defects.
