 In this paper we propose a novel technique called dispersion transfer entropy to determine the information transfer and causal relation in the analysis of complex systems . Symbolization is used to solve the computational burden and noise sensitivity . To deal with the two major issues in symbolization generating partition and information loss we use the Ragwitz criterion to dynamically select parameters and utilize dispersion pattern to keep influential information . Moreover we extend DTE into the multivariate system and propose dispersion multivariate transfer entropy dispersion multivariate transfer entropy curve and dispersion partial transfer entropy . DMTE greatly weakens the influence of synchronicity and similarity in data on information transfer detection which is a breakthrough in solving the limitation of transfer entropy . DMTEC shows the evolution of causal relation over time and DPTE measures the direct causal effect between systems . These statistics can be combined to obtain a more comprehensive and accurate measurement of causality for multivariable systems . Also we apply these methods to simulation data as well as stock markets to verify the effectiveness of our methods .
