 The materials referred to in this work are two cyano oligo phenylene vinylenes soluble in chloroform possessing donor and acceptor groups with a completely extended electron system on the whole chain . For a better description of the correlation structure properties of these new materials we proceeded via spectroscopic analyses and experiment techniques such as thermogravimetric analysis infrared spectroscopy optical absorption and photoluminescence . This experimental study is consolidated by a theoretical study based on the Density Functional Theory allowing the determination of their structural and optoelectronic properties conformation gap E
