 Chemical vapor deposited SiC and nuclear grade SiC SiC composite materials were exposed to light water reactor conditions at the MIT Nuclear Reactor . Three sets of samples were exposed within flowing PWR chemistry coolant under either 1 neutron and ionizing irradiation with resulting radiolysis products 2 radiolysis products without neutron flux 3 loop coolant . Post irradiation examination demonstrated an increase in corrosion from radiolysis products particularly H

@highlight CVD SiC lost less than 1m in thickness year in BWR HWC conditions with 4wppm H
@highlight Radiation damage and radiolysis exacerbated corrosion significantly.
@highlight Localized attack was observed only on samples exposed to damage and radiolysis.
