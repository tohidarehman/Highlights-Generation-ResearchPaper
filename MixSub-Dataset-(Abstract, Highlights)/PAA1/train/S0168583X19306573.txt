 In this paper the effects of 3MeV proton irradiations on gate controlled lateral PNP transistors are investigated with and without molecular hydrogen H

@highlight Effect of H
@highlight on interface traps in the LPNP transistors caused by 3MeV protons are studied.
@highlight 3MeV protons could mainly produce ionization damage in the GLPNP transistors.
@highlight can aggravate the formation of interface traps in the irradiated GLPNP transistors.
