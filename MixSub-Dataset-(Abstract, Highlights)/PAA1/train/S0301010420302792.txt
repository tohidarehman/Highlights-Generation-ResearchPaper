 The relation between surface chemistry and electrical properties of lead sulfide quantum dots is of importance for the development of cost effective field effect transistor and quantum dot solar cells . Herein simple chloride surface treatment has been demonstrated by adding tetramethylammonium chloride into a QD washing step . Absorption photoluminescence and X ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies revealed that Cl

@highlight A simple chloride treatment on colloidal PbS quantum dots is demonstrated.
@highlight The chloride treatment enhances photoluminescence of colloidal PbS quantum dots.
@highlight Pre chloride passivation enhances hole mobility of quantum dot solids.
@highlight The doping polarity is switched from p type to ambipolar.
