 The objective of this paper is to establish that algorithms which reconstruct the coupling between solar proxies based on the properties of the Kuramoto equations and algorithms based on the van der Pol equations might produce similar estimates . To this end the inverse problem is formulated as follows reconstruct the coupling based on the solutions of the corresponding equations . For either system of the equations we construct an algorithm solving the inverse problem and establish that there exists a range of moderate values of the correlation such that the algorithms produce practically identical coupling within the established range . The lower boundary of this range is dependent on the half difference of the oscillators frequencies . Then we apply the two reconstruction algorithms to solar index ISSN and the geomagnetic index aa which are proxies to the toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields of the Sun respectively . Their correlation belongs within the range that yields the proximity of the coupling reconstructed with all solar cycles from 11 till 23 except 20 and possibly 21 . Our finding relate the reconstruction of characteristics of solar activity inferred by Blanter etal from the Kuramoto model to the state of the art solar dynamo theory based on the magnetohydrodynamic equations .

@highlight We extract van der Pol coupling from the solar data similarly to Kuramoto model.
@highlight The error of model misinterpretation in coupling reconstruction does not exceed 10 . 
@highlight The model misinterpretation could not be established in the anomalistic 20th cycle.
