 The only known approach that can break the diffractive imaging based encryption was proposed by Li and Shi in 2015 . However their approach works under the assumption that the phase distribution of the random phase masks is within . In other words it is no longer effective when such requirement is not fulfilled . In this paper we propose a universal method referred to as learning based chosen plaintext attack to break DIBE . The L CPA enables one to recover the plaintext from the ciphertext by aid of a well trained artificial neural network regardless of the phase distribution of the RPMs . Furthermore the proposal can be accomplished with no need of knowing the details of the optical arrangement of DIBE . To our best knowledge this is the first paper that reveals the absolute insecurity of DIBE against CPA . Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposal .

@highlight A new method for breaking the diffractive imaging based encryption is proposed.
@highlight The proposal is universal and has no additional restrictions during applications.
@highlight The proposal can still work even noise or occlusion occurred in the ciphertext.
