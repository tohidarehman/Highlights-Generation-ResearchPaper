 One of the main factors that determine the detection limit in particle induced X ray emission spectrometry is the continuous X ray background . In the case of impinging protons a complete description requires five radiative processes . Among them secondary electron bremsstrahlung is one of the largest contributions and describes the bremsstrahlung radiated by the electrons ejected from the target atoms by proton impact . The calculation of SEB cross sections in the binary encounter approximation entails knowledge of the velocity distributions of the atomic electrons . For this purpose analytical hydrogenic VDs are currently used for all the shells . In the present work numerical VDs calculated from DiracHartreeFockSlater wave functions are employed . Additionally a compact equation for the SEB differential cross section is derived . Results for the ionisation and SEB cross sections of Al Ag and Au calculated from the DHFS and hydrogenic VDs are compared in detail .

@highlight The cross section for secondary electron bremsstrahlung is written in compact form.
@highlight DiracHartreeFockSlater velocity distributions are used for the atomic electrons.
@highlight Hydrogenic velocity distributions are shown to produce inaccurate results.
