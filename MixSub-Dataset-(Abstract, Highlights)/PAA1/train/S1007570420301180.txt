 When a network is reconstructed from data two types of errors can occur false positive and false negative errors about the presence or absence of links . In this paper the vertex degree distribution of the true underlying network is analytically reconstructed using an iterative procedure . Such procedure is based on the inferred network and estimates for the probabilities

@highlight When a network is reconstructed false positive and false negative errors can occur.
@highlight The vertex degree distribution of the underlying network is analytically reconstructed.
@highlight An iteration procedure converges to the correct reconstruction.
