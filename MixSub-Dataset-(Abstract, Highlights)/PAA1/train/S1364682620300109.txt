 The abnormal behavior of the precipitation in recent years has caused shrinkage of water supplies floods and rising seas and rivers in all over the world . Pakistan is one of those countries which are highly effected from this abnormal behavior . In this paper we utilized the concept of drought indices for the calculation and exploratory analysis of the agricultural and hydrological droughts with its intensities at multiple locations . The concept of point processes to analyze the drought periods at different locations was also investigated . The 3 months and 12 months Standardized Precipitation Index were used to calculate the agricultural and hydrological drought events . The accumulated number of agricultural and hydrological drought events are calculated by considering the threshold of 1.0 and analyzed the drought periods by using Non Homogeneous Poisson Process . The parameters of the model were estimated by using Bayesian approach with Gibbs sampling under Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm . The results revealed that SPI provides the better and detailed structure of the agricultural and hydrological droughts with different intensity levels at multiple locations . The study showed that every region of Pakistan was significantly influenced by the agricultural and hydrological droughts with different intensity levels and magnitudes . The NHPP was found to be better in the assessment and analysis of drought events occur during a specific period . The findings of this study can be an important reference for the policymakers and government to take decisions in advance for sustainable environmental management in Pakistan .
