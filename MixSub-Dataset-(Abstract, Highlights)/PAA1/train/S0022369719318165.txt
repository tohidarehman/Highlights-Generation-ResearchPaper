 MAX phases are a large group of nanolaminated carbide and nitride materials of immense scientific and technological interest . Materials of this class are known as metallic ceramics as they show a remarkable combination of metallic and ceramic properties at the same time . To date about 80 MAX phases have been synthesized and more than 650 MAX phases are predicted to be synthesized in the future . At present there are nine MAX phase nanolaminates that show superconducting transitions at low temperatures . Although MAX phases have been studied extensively thorough understanding of the correlation between electronic structure and physical properties is still somewhat limited . Here we review the physical properties of superconducting MAX phases on the basis of electronic structures using first principles density functional theory .

@highlight Superconducting MAX phases are studied comprehensively.
@highlight Nb
@highlight AsC is mechanically superior to the other phases and Lu
@highlight SnC is soft and machinable.
@highlight Lu
@highlight SnC is predicted to be a thermal barrier coating material.
@highlight Ti
@highlight InN is predicted to be a better coating material for preventing solar heating.
@highlight Populated A layers may be the reason for the existence of superconductivity in only 211 MAX phases.
