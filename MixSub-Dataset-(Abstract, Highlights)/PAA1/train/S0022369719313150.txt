 Semiconductors encompassing a broad range of novel electronic magnetic and optical properties have attracted substantial research interest over the past decade promising the development of next generation multifunctional devices . Recently we have observed strong visible optical absorption in AlP after Mn doping . Here the magnetic interaction and optical absorption in Al

@highlight Mn doped AlP energetically favors a ferromagnetic state with short range exchange coupling interaction.
@highlight The Curie temperature can be continuous enhanced even above 220K by in plane biaxial strain.
@highlight A strong optical absorption in the visible range as well as its intensity are almost unperturbed by the applied strain.
@highlight Our findings open up novel strategies for constructing multifunctional diluted magnetic semiconductor materials.
