 The design of efficient non precious metal electrocatalysts is still the hot topic for water oxidation . However the reported transition metal based electrocatalysts usually exhibit far lower activity compared with precious metals . In this work we report the excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance of Mo

@highlight Mo
@highlight shows a lower overpotential than RuO
@highlight and IrO
@highlight  C.
@highlight The half filling 3d orbit of FeNi favors for appropriate adsorption for OH
@highlight The improved electrical conductance by Mo
@highlight C improves OER kinetics.
@highlight This work provides an efficient earth abundant electrocatalyst for water oxidation.
