 Etoposide is a chemotherapy drug served to treat numerous cancers and human serum albumin functioning as transportation of variant small compounds . Its binding interaction was studied computationally and spectrometrically by FTIR UVvis fluorescence and CD with pH 7.40 at 292 300 and 308K temperatures . The obtained results were imparted that HSA bounded by EPD via static process ultimately the formation of EPDHSA complex with strong binding constant 10
