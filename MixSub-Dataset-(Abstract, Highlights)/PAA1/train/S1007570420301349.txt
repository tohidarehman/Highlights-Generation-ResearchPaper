 Stationary density functions statistically characterize the stabilized behavior of dynamical systems . Instead of temporal sequences of data stationary densities are observed to determine the unknown transformations which is called the inverse Frobenius Perron problem . This paper proposes a new approach to determining the unique map from stationary densities generated by a one dimensional discrete time dynamical system driven by an external control input given the input density functions that are linearly independent . A numerical simulation example is used to validate the effectiveness of the developed approach .

@highlight One dimensional discrete time dynamical systems are inferred from stationary densities generated by the systems in the presence of input perturbation.
@highlight The main assumption is that the stationary densities can be observed and estimated given arbitrary initial conditions.
@highlight The unique stationary density function generated by a perturbed system exists corresponding to a specified input density function.
@highlight The stationary density is dependent on the probability density function of an external control input given a transformation.
@highlight A practical algorithm of determining the unknown transformation using stationary densities generated by a system with linearly independent input density functions is introduced.
