 We study coupled unstaggered staggered soliton pairs emergent from a system of two coupled discrete nonlinear Schrdinger equations with the self attractive on site self phase modulation nonlinearity coupled by the repulsive cross phase modulation interaction on 1D and 2D lattice domains . These mixed modes are of a symbiotic type as each component in isolation may only carry ordinary unstaggered solitons . While most work on DNLS systems addressed symmetric on site centered fundamental solitons these models give rise to a variety of other excited states which may also be stable . The simplest among them are antisymmetric states in the form of discrete twisted solitons which have no counterparts in the continuum limit . In the extension to 2D lattice domains a natural counterpart of the twisted states are vortical solitons . We first introduce a variational approximation for the solitons and then correct it numerically to construct exact stationary solutions which are then used as initial conditions for simulations to check if the stationary states persist under time evolution . Two component solutions obtained include 1D fundamental twisted and twisted twisted soliton pairs 2D fundamental fundamental soliton pairs and 2D vortical vortical soliton pairs . We also highlight a variety of other transient dynamical regimes such as breathers and amplitude death . The findings apply to modeling binary Bose Einstein condensates loaded in a deep lattice potential with identical or different atomic masses of the two components and arrays of bimodal optical waveguides .
