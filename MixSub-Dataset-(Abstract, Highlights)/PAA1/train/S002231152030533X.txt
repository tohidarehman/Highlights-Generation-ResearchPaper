 Embrittlement caused by tritium and helium produced as the beta decay product of tritium affects the structural integrity of materials used in nuclear fusion reactors . We assess the embrittlement of 316L stainless steel used as the primary vessel in the tritium storage and delivery system with a planned operation scenario for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor . First based on the current system design and planned operation scenario the tritium and helium concentrations in the primary vessel material are calculated . The effects of tritium and helium on the mechanical properties are estimated in comparison with available experimental data . We conclude that if a forged material is used the mechanical properties of the primary vessel will not significantly degrade over planned operation in terms of fracture toughness . In addition fatigue and creep are expected not to be significant . Last we discuss two possible methods to lower the concentration of helium for the purpose of reducing the residual risk .

@highlight Tritium and helium produced by tritium beta decay cause embrittlement in steels.
@highlight Embrittlement of 316L SS used in T storage delivery system for ITER operation plan is assessed.
@highlight If a forged material is used structural integrity will be maintained.
@highlight Two methods are discussed to further reduce the risk of embrittlement.
