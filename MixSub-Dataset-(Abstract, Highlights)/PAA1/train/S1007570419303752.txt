 The numerical discretization of the ZakharovShabat Scattering problem using integrators based on the implicit Euler method trapezoidal rule and the split Magnus method yield discrete systems that qualify as AblowitzLadik systems . These discrete systems are important on account of their layer peeling property which facilitates the differential approach of inverse scattering . In this paper we study the Darboux transformation at the discrete level by following a recipe that closely resembles the Darboux transformation in the continuous case . The viability of this transformation for the computation of multisoliton potentials is investigated and it is found that irrespective of the order of convergence of the underlying discrete framework the numerical scheme thus obtained is of first order with respect to the step size .

@highlight This paper draws a connection between discrete systems proposed for the ZakharovShabat scattering problem and the AblowitzLadik problems.
@highlight A simple intuitive derivation of the discrete Darboux transformation is provided for each of the discrete systems considered.
@highlight The order of convergence of each of the methods is estimated and numerically verified.
