 We propose a perfect spin caloritronics device based on a carbon based organic chain . A spin semiconducting property is achieved which originates from the edge localized states . The appearance of spin dependent transport gaps results in a large spin Seebeck coefficient . Moveover the dimensionless spin thermoelectric figure of merit at room temperature can be enhanced to as high as 35 . Furthermore the pure spin current or single spin current can be produced at some chemical potentials under a temperature difference and their transport directions can also be tuned by the chemical potential . Therefore the carbon based organic chain is well suited for designing the multifunctional spin caloritronics devices .
