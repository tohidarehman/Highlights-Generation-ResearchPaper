 InP based quantum dots are promising candidates as Cd free quantum dots however they require sharper fluorescence to satisfy the next generation display standard . For this purpose a deeper understanding of the crystal growth scheme and well designed organometallic precursors are needed . Density functional theory calculations were used to find the activation barriers for the initial reaction of Zn Ga and In precursors with trisphosphine and differences in reactivity between dissimilar metal precursors were revealed . The coordinations of the P precursor to Zn In and Ga precursors were found to differ significantly depending on the coordination number and the ionic radius and these results were consistent with reports that found that InZnP can be alloyed but InGaP is not easily alloyed . The activation energies become close to each other when using thiol ligands with less steric hindrance in monodentate ligands . These results will lead to achieving precise composition control and great luminescence properties .

@highlight Both the metal species and ligand affect the formation energy of the metalP bond.
@highlight The smaller ionic radius of the Ga precursor makes coordination to the P precursor difficult.
@highlight The difference in activation energies becomes small when using a monodentate thiol ligand.
