 To investigate the thermal decomposition of perfluorinatedketones ReaxFF parameters were optimized by training against QM derived calculations using Monte Carlo Annealing method . The optimized parameters showed proper descriptions in predicting the geometries relative reaction energies and bond dissociation curves of perfluorinatedketones . For validating the reliability of ReaxFF parameters large scale atomistic molecular dynamics with 1ns long simulations were implemented for thermal decomposition of perfluorinatedketones over the temperature range from 300 to 5000K . Our simulation results suggested that C
