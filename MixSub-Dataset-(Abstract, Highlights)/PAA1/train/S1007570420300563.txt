 In this paper we investigate the European option pricing problem under a regime switching FMLS model . This model is not only able to capture the main characteristics of asset returns it also incorporates the effect of regime switching being consistent with market observations . However option prices under this model are governed by a coupled FPDE system and the difficulty in seeking for analytical solution arises from the combination of the coupled system and the spatial fractional derivative . To deal with this difficulty we develop a two step solution procedure we firstly assume that the future information of the Markov chain is known and we derive the conditional option price by analytically solving a time dependent FPDE based on which an exact and explicit pricing formula for the unconditioned price is successfully worked out by using the Fourier cosine series expansion . It is also shown through the numerical experiments that it converges very rapidly and has potential to be applied in practice .
