 In this study a new type of structure of optical fiber pressure sensor based on polarization modulation is proposed which selects a high birefringence fiber as the sensing unit to measure the pressure in the fluid medium . The PM 1550 01 fiber produced by NTK Photonics Inc. is evaluated as the sample in our subject . Firstly the regularities of birefringence variation on the PM 1550 01 followed by the external pressure load and the ambient temperature are analyzed by the finite element method . The results show that the pressure sensitivity is 2.0510
