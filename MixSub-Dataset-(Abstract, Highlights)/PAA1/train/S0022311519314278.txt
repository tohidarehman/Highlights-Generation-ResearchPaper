 Effects of chemical composition ion irradiation dose and temperature on unfaulting of irradiation induced Frank dislocation loops to perfect loops in two nickel based single phase solid solution alloys Ni20Fe and NiFe20Cr have been studied . The fraction of Frank loops decreases with irradiation dose from 7.2 to 38.4 dpa at 500

@highlight High irradiation dose and temperature favor unfaulting of Frank dislocation loops to perfect loops that can reduce radiation hardening.
@highlight The process of loop unfaulting may be hindered by sluggish diffusion in chemically more complex alloy.
