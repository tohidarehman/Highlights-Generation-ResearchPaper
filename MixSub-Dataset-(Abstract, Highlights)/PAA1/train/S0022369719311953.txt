 Metal oxide photocatalysts have high chemical stability in aqueous solutions but their photocatalytic activity is usually restricted by poor electronhole separation . Although impurity doping has been demonstrated to be an effective way to tune photocatalytic properties the mechanisms of enhanced photocatalytic activity remain ambiguous . Here we show that appropriately incorporated impurities can markedly improve the spatial carrier separation and photocatalytic activity . This concept is demonstrated by experimental and density functional theory studies on the effects of fluorine and nitrogen dopants on photocatalytic H
