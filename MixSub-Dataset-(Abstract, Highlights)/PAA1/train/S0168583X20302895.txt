 X ray fluorescence and numismatic analyses have been used for the study of a sample of incuse coins at the Museo Campano . A group of 31 silver incuse coins of the first coinage iussed by four cities from southern Italy has been characterized . Numismatic examinations provided indications on the synoptic distribution of the specimens from the different colonies and on the historical period . XRF and multivariate data analyses characterized the coins and provided additional information . Results show that the examined coins consist of a silver copper alloy . Trace elements indicate that the alloy may come from the same mine . Values of the AgK L intensity ratio and Ag Cu alloy standards allowed to identify some surface enriched coins . Other characteristics implied evidence that three coins of Metapontum and Croton could be overstruck .
