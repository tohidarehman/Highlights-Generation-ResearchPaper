 As an indirect imaging technique computational ghost imaging obtains the object information by calculating the intensity correlation between a series of computer generated matrices and the corresponding bucket signals which thereby offers a potential application in optical encryption . Here we propose a new steganography scheme called ghost steganography based on the principle of computational GI . In our ghost steganography scheme the bucket intensity signals of a secret image are concealed into the ones of a non secret image by applying a non conspicuous number integration process . To further increase the security we introduce RSA cryptography to encode the integrated bucket signals after the steganography process . Simulation and experiment results fully demonstrate the feasibility of our optical ghost cryptography and steganography scheme . Our work paves a way to the application of GI in steganography and also enriches the knowledge of symmetric and asymmetric optical cryptography . @ Elsevier 2020 .

@highlight An optical ghost steganography scheme is proposed by hiding the intensity signals of one image into other signals.
@highlight The security of ghost steganography is enhanced by applying the RSA asymmetric cryptography into the intensity signals encoding process.
@highlight This work can extend the GI applications into the steganography region and also can enrich the knowledge of symmetric asymmetric optical cryptography.
