 In this paper we propose a new theoretical model for critical opalescence describing the observed peculiarities of small angle scattering of laser radiation by critical CO

@highlight Critical CO
@highlight is considered as fluid randomized optically by density fluctuations.
@highlight Poynting s vector is estimated for laser light single Rayleigh scattering by CO
@highlight molecules.
@highlight Optic path is used instead of geometric one to evaluate the scattered light phases.
@highlight Small angle distribution of scattered light intensity we got fits well with experimental data.
@highlight Statistical properties for large scale critical fluctuations are obtained from experiment.
