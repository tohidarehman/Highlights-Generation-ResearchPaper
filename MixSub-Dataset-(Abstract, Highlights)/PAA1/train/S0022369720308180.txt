 In the present study iron reinforced novel composite materials were produced as alternative shielding materials . In this context linear attenuation coefficients and mass attenuation coefficients half and tenth value layers mean free path and effective atomic number were determined . An experimental gamma ray transmission setup was utilized for determination of MAC values . To confirm the consistency of experimental results the obtained MAC values were compared with those produced using the WinXcom program and MCNPX Monte Carlo code . Moreover exposure buildup factors and energy absorption buildup factors were calculated using a geometric progression fitting method . Relative dose distribution values of fabricated samples were calculated at 5 10 and 20 MFP penetration depths up to 10MeV . In addition to gamma ray attenuation properties basic interaction parameters of charged particles such as protons and alpha mass stopping powers alpha projected ranges and proton projected ranges were determined in the 0.01515MeV energy range . Finally variation of fast neutron removal cross section versus increasing Fe concentration in composites was investigated . The composite with the highest Fe addition showed the best shielding capacity for gamma radiation .
