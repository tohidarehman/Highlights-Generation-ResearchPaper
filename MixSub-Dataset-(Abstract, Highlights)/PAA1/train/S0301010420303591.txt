 The effects of pressure on structural elastic electronic and vibrational properties of NaSe are studied using the SIESTA method . The dimensionless ratio bulk modulus elastic constants Shear and Young modulus and Poissons ration are obtained for each phase . NaSe shows phase transitions from the P6

@highlight The structural electronic elastic and vibrational properties of NaSe is studied.
@highlight All phases of NaSe demonstrate metallic character and dynamically stable.
@highlight NaSe has great ductility however as pressure increases ductility of NaSe decreases.
