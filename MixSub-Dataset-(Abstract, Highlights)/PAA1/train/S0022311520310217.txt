 A high intensity proton beam exposure with 181 MeV energy has been conducted at Brookhaven Linac Isotope Producer facility on various material specimens for accelerator targetry applications including titanium alloys as a beam window material . The radiation damage level of the analyzed capsule was 0.25 dpa at beam center region with an irradiation temperature around 120 C. Tensile tests showed increased hardness and a large decrease in ductility for the dual phase Ti 6Al 4V Grade 5 and Grade 23 extra low interstitial alloys with the near phase Ti 3Al 2.5V Grade 9 alloy still exhibiting uniform elongation of a few after irradiation . Transmission Electron Microscope analyses on Ti 6Al 4V indicated clear evidence of a high density of defect clusters with size less than 2nm in each phase grain . The phase grains did not contain any visible defects such as loops or black dots while the diffraction patterns clearly indicated phase precipitation in an advanced formation stage . The radiation induced phase transformation in the phase could lead to greater loss of ductility in Ti 6Al 4V alloys in comparison with Ti 3Al 2.5V alloy with less phase .
