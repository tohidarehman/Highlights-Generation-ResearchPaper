 Ferritic martensitic ODS steels are one of the candidate structural materials for future Gen IV nuclear fission and fusion reactors . The dependence of fracture toughness on microstructure was investigated by comparing three 9Cr ODS EUROFER steels manufactured through different thermo mechanical processing routes . Quasi static fracture toughness testing was performed with sub sized C specimens and microstructural characterization was carried out using scanning electron microscopy electron backscatter diffraction and transmission electron microscopy . It was found that at lower test temperatures the fracture toughness was primarily controlled by crack initiation at sub micron particles and by production of secondary cracks during fracture . At higher temperatures fracture toughness was predominantly controlled by the matrix ductility and the grain boundary strength with a relatively ductile coarse grained alloy demonstrating higher fracture toughness compared to high strength fine grained alloys . These results and discussion show that variations in thermomechanical treatments can produce significant differences in microstructure and fracture toughness behavior of ferritic martensitic ODS steels .

@highlight Three 9Cr ODS EUROFER steels are compared with respect to microstructure and fracture toughness.
@highlight Secondary cracking induced by residual ferrite improves fracture toughness at lower temperatures.
@highlight Matrix ductility predominantly controls the fracture toughness at temperatures between 100C and 500C.
@highlight Above 500C the grain boundary strength predominantly controls the fracture toughness.
@highlight Variations in thermo mechanical history lead to significant differences in microstructure and fracture behavior.
