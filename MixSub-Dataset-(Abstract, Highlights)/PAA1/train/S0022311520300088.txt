 Pyrochemical reprocessing is being explored for reprocessing of spent metallic fuels of future fast breeder reactors . This process consists of several operations like electrorefining cathode processing and fuel casting process . The cathode processing and fuel pin casting processes are carried out at 10731723K . Hence the process vessels should withstand high temperatures molten metals and molten salts . Several structural materials and coatings have been proposed and evaluated for such applications . However high density graphite is the proposed material for process crucibles due to its high temperature compatibility . Bare HDG can not be used directly due to reactivity with molten uranium and its alloys . Hence coatings like yttria over HDG are being proposed to avoid undesirable carbon contamination of uranium . This review provides the various coatings and their performance evaluation for molten metal applications including our recent works on the development of thermal spray coatings for such an application .

@highlight Structural materials for Pyrochemical reprocessing applications plays a crucial role.
@highlight Graphite crucibles with Yttria coating is preferred for uranium melting application.
@highlight SiC interlayer coating between graphite and Yttria provides better durability.
