 The surface interface energy is a key parameter for determining the properties of nanomaterials . Many studies have investigated the surface energy for free standing nanoparticles but the interface energy of embedded nanoparticles requires further analysis . In this study we developed a model of the size dependent interfacial energy for embedded metallic nanoparticles in terms of the size dependent cohesive energy . The model was applied to PbCu PbAl and AgNi systems as three examples and the results were compared with those obtained using previously developed models and the available experimental data . Depending on the system considered the interface energy could increase or decrease as the particle size decreased . Similarly the dependence of the interface energy on the temperature was also related to the system considered where the interface energy could decrease or increase as the temperature increased . The results also showed that there was a critical value for interface coherency where the effect of size on the interface energy was reversed .
