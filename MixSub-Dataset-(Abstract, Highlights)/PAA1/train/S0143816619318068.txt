 We propose a novel low cost snapshot phase shifting lateral shearing interferometer with full range continuously adjustable lateral shear ratio . A tunable shear plate consisting of a polarizing beam splitter plate and a reflective mirror separates the orthogonally polarization states of the test wavefront into original and sheared wavefronts . The lateral shear ratio can be tuned by adjusting the spacing between PBS plate and the mirror . A pixelated polarization camera simultaneously captures four 2 phase shifted interferograms for phase shifting interferometric measurement . In addition to tunable shear ratio and snapshot capture of phase shifted interferograms one more key feature is that SPLSI can measure the wavefront of low coherence light . The feasibility of the proposed system is demonstrated experimentally . The proposed system provides a simple compact and fast way to achieve the instantaneous phase shifting lateral shearing interferometric testing of wavefronts with minimal impact from environmental disturbance .

@highlight The shear ratio of the proposed SPLSI is tunable from zero to any allowable value.
@highlight The system is applicable for measuring the wavefront of low coherence light.
@highlight Only one capture is needed to obtain four phase shifted interferograms simultaneously.
