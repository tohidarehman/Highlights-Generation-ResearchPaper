 Four different Triphenylamine based dyes named as TPA 1 TPA 2 TPA 3 and TPA 4 as shown below with substituents containing different linkages earlier described inTiO

@highlight We describe four different triphenylamine based dyes named as TPA 1 TPA 2 TPA 3 and TPA 4 with different linkages.
@highlight We investigate the characteristics for all dyes.
@highlight We display the energy level diagrams and electron density for both standby dye and the dye nanocluster systems.
@highlight We investigated the geometry optimization of the complex systems consisting of TPA dyes on the 101 surface of ZnTiO
@highlight perovskite cluster.
@highlight We compare our theoretical results with the experimental data and other theoretical results.
