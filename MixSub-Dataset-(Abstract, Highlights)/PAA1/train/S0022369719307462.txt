 Relaxation analysis has been carried out on lithium graphite intercalation compound focusing on the variation of stage structure and graphene interlayer distances . X ray diffraction coupled with the one dimensional Rietveld analysis revealed that after the termination of electrochemical lithium insertion excessively formed stage I partly transforms into stage II during the relaxation process . In addition the periodic stacking of defective lithium layers forming stage II orders the lithium occupation at the relaxation which is more apparently observed for faster charged sample . Even after the lithium extraction gradual stage changes from I to II accompanied by the ordering of lithium occupation in stage II have been observed at the relaxation process . Lithium ion is rather uniformly intercalated or deintercalated in the graphene interlayers while Li GIC turned into ordered stage structure to achieve the stable state at the relaxation time .

@highlight After Li insertion into graphite stage I partly changes into I and II at relaxation.
@highlight Lithium occupied interlayers in stage II orders at relaxation.
@highlight Even for Li extraction stage change from I to II was detected at the relaxation.
