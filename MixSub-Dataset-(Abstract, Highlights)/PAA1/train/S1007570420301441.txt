 In this study we present a general formulation for the optimal control problem to a class of fuzzy fractional differential systems relating to SIR and SEIR epidemic models . In particular we investigate these epidemic models in the uncertain environment of fuzzy numbers with the rate of change expressed by granular Caputo fuzzy fractional derivatives of order
