 A cursory or even detailed inspection of literature shows that while the annual cycle of precipitation and temperature in Zambia are well understood there is a general lack of documentation on long term trends and periodicities over the country . In this study we extensively examined the temporal and spatial changes in precipitation and temperature over Zambia for the period 19502016 . We used the modified MannKendall test with the aim of eliminating the effect of autocorrelation on precipitation and temperature trends based on Global Precipitation Climatology Centre and National Centre for Environmental Prediction National Centre for Atmospheric Research products . Overall significant decrease in precipitation was evident . We further observed that on average precipitation has been decreasing by 1.1mm yr

@highlight Precipitation has been decreasing by 1.1mm yr
@highlight across Zambia.
@highlight An abrupt change in the trend of precipitation was reported in 1980 1981 significant at 5 significance level.
@highlight Temperature has been increasing at a rate of 0.01C yr
@highlight No sudden changes have been observed in temperature over the country.
