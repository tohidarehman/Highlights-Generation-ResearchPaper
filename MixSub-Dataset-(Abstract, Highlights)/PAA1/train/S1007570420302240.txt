 A study of primary and secondary instabilities in Rayleigh Bnard convection of water copper nanoliquid is made using a generalized two phase model . Boussinesq approximation and small scale convective motion are assumed to be valid . The Brownian motion effect is assumed to be negligibly small and a weak thermophoretic effect is included in the investigation . The parameter regimes for the existence of pitchfork Takens Bogdanov and Hopf bifurcations are reported . Small amplitude modulation is considered to derive the NewellWhiteheadSegel equation and using its phase winding solution the condition for the occurrence of Eckhaus and zigzag secondary instabilities are obtained . The influence of copper nanoparticles on the secondary instability region is reported . The travelling wave solutions for the NewellWhiteheadSegel equation are also presented . Oscillatory convection is not in general preferable in the problem yet in those cases where it can exist the necessary condition for the occurrence of Benjamin Feir instability is discussed . The present investigation sheds light on useful parameters ranges wherein a desired instability can be made to manifest depending upon the need of an engineering application . The Rayleigh Bnard convection can also be used as a rheometric tool for the measurement of viscosity and thermal diffusivity of the nanoliquid in a dynamic situation .
