 During the tunnel construction process contours of primary supports and secondary linings of the tunnel need to be tested to ensure that their quality meets the designed requirements . Traditionally one total station is used to measure the three dimensional coordinates of the measuring points of a crosssection of the tunnel to check whether there are any intrusions . This traditional method has some disadvantages such as few measuring points low precision heavy workload and long working time . In order to avoid these shortcomings a method combining three dimensional digital image correlation and angle feedback scanning mechanism that measures the 3D topography of tunnels during construction is proposed in this paper . In order to reduce the systematic deviation caused by the nonstandard positional relationship between the camera and the rotational axis a calibration method is proposed and implemented to calibrate the positional relationship between the camera and the rotational axis . The proposed device is fabricated and a tunnel is measured at the construction stage . The scanner only takes about 30s to operate . When measuring the tunnel with an inner diameter of about 14 m the overall 3D reconstruction accuracy of the device is better than 10mm .
