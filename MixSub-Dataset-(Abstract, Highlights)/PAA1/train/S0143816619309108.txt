 A problem present in the wood boards industry is the lack of knowledge of its roughness . The roughness causes the formation of voids between the board and the protective cover commonly used to give a special finish to the board . This leads to poor adhesion between the adhesive and the cover which affects the quality of the final product . Thus a precise and fast way to measure the roughness that allows characterization in line and across the board is required .

@highlight The void formation between the surface and the cover plate on wooden boards in the Chilean industry represents a serious problem because it significantly impacts the quality of the final product. The knowledge of surface roughness allows to avoid these defects.
@highlight This research contributes in the search for a non contact methodology that allows to evaluate the surface roughness of composite wood panels.
@highlight The results of this work showed a good correlation between the values of surface roughness obtained by means of optical interferometry and those obtained by means of a mechanical roughness meter.
