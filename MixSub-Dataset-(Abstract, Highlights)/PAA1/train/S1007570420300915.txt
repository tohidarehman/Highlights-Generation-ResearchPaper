 Based on the time frequency analysis a piecewise re scaled method is proposed to realize aperiodic resonance in a Duffing system excited by the nonlinear frequency modulated signal . Based on the aperiodic resonance theory the weak NLFM signal is enhanced greatly . By short time Fourier transform numerical simulations are carried out for several kinds of NLFM signal . The results show that the method enhances the NLFM signal effectively . Meanwhile the effectiveness of the method is still illustrated in the noise background . In addition the noise and the interference frequency can be removed . Noteworthy and differently as what happens with the stochastic resonance and vibrational resonance the aperiodic resonance does not require any auxiliary signal or noise to induce it . This constitutes also a new result of this paper . Next in order to expand the application of this method it is used to process the experiment signal of bearing fault under variable speed condition . The validity of the method is illustrated again . The results provide new reference in processing non stationary frequency modulated signal . Finally an adaptive piecewise re scaled aperiodic resonance scheme is put forward to get optimal parameters to induce stronger aperiodic resonance quickly .
