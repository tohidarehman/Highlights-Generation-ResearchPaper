 Partial slip fretting corrosion of Alloy 690TT comes up in the steam generator of a nuclear power plant in which the damage mechanisms are transformed as dissolved oxygen varies . In this work the coupling between the action of oxide particles sticking into the surface and the electrochemical corrosion caused severe pitting like damage which was enhanced by an increase in DO concentration increasing the wear volume . The initiation of fatigue cracking was controlled by the slip dissolution along with the competition between the film rupture rate and the repassivation rate as DO changes .

@highlight Effects of dissolved oxygen DO on fretting corrosion of Alloy 690TT was studied.
@highlight The wear volume wear width and depth were increased with increasing DO.
@highlight The coupling between the physical and chemical effect caused pitting like damage.
@highlight The pitting like damage was enhanced by an increase in DO.
@highlight The fatigue cracking was controlled by slip dissolution and varied as DO changes.
