 Striking photo induced voltage is observed in YBCO Ag heterojunction irradiated with purple laser revealing that there is an intrinsic built in electric field in the interface . The dynamic evolution and devolution processes of the photo induced voltage are studied at 50K and 300K respectively which are found to be similar to a charging and a discharging process of a plate capacitor . Unusual Current Voltage properties curves obtained at 80K with 28.4mW mm
