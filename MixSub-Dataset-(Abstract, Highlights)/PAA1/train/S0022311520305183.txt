 Zircon is important ceramic used widely due to its excellent properties in particular for nuclear waste immobilization . However it is difficult to obtain mono phase zircon with high yield usually result in double phase ZrO

@highlight Effect of Ce content on the phase and microstructure evolution was elucidated.
@highlight ZrSiO
@highlight retained tetragonal while ZrO
@highlight transformed from monoclinic to cubic.
@highlight Lattice parameters increased with Ce doping revealing lattice immobilization of Ce.
@highlight Grain size and compactness increased with increasing Ce content.
