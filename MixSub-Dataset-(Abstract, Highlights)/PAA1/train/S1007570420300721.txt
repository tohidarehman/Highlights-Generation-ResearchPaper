 In this paper finite time synchronization issue of fractional order complex valued dynamical networks with multiple weights is addressed . Multiple weights are pulled into consideration which makes our model more practical and general than single weight one . Combining Lyapunov method with graph theoretic method and making use of the theory of complex functions finite time synchronization criteria for fractional order complex valued dynamical networks with multiple weights are established by using feedback control and adaptive control respectively . Furthermore the settling time of synchronization is effectively estimated which is connected with the order of fractional derivative the parameters of control and topological structure of networks . Eventually numerical simulations are exhibited to demonstrate the validity of theoretical results and analyse the relationship between the settling time of synchronization and the order of fractional derivative with the parameters of control .

@highlight Multiple weights are considered into FCDNs as the initial attempt which makes the model more realistic in practical applications.
@highlight A finite time synchronization criterion based on adaptive control for FCDNs is derived for the first time.
@highlight Settling time of synchronization depends on the order of fractional derivative the parameters of control and topologica structure of networks.
