 Surface thermodynamic properties related to nanoparticles size and morphology generate significant influences on their thermodynamic behaviors in different physicochemical processes . Herein the electrode potentials of Ag nanoelectrodes formed with various particle sizes and morphologies of nano Ag were determined at varying temperatures . Based on the method of electrochemistry the surface thermodynamic properties of nano Ag were gotten and a comparison was made with theoretical results . It is revealed that with decreasing nano Ag size these surface thermodynamic properties become larger and correlate linearly with inverse particle size . Furthermore for nanoparticles with the same equivalent size the change regularity of surface Gibbs energy enthalpy and entropy with morphology follow the same sequence as cube sphere wire . This study is valuable to provide insights to the influence mechanisms and regularities of nanoparticle size and morphology on these properties .
