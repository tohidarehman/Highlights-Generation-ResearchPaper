 The refined Cloud Imaging and Particle Size cloud wind tracking algorithm is elaborated and the wind product is assessed against the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System Advanced Level Physics and High Altitude winds and the horizontal wind model climatological winds . Multiple searching frame sizes are adopted to generate the preliminary wind sets which are then merged and further edited based on the clustering of the similar wind directions . The mean values of the clusters within the sampling grids of 1.51.5 or 4.54.5 are taken as the final wind product . At the coincidences the CIPS and NOGAPS winds show a moderate degree of deterministic consistency . We have further shown that on the orbit to orbit basis when the NOGAPS modeled ice and CIPS measured ice correlate better the wind agreement is also better . The difference in the two wind sets is most likely attributed to the NOGAPS temperature being deviated from the true temperature that will affect the geostrophic component of the winds and also to the fact that the CIPS winds are often ageostrophic and are cascaded into smaller scales . The CIPS zonal winds are decreased and then reversed in early June and late August whereas in the core of the season they are stronger . This overall variation pattern is shared by both NOGAPS and HWM14 zonal winds . Both NOGAPS and HWM14 zonal winds exhibit 810m s difference between cases using all local times and the CIPS LT range 1323h due to the dominant diurnal migrating tides and this may partially interpret the weaker CIPS zonal winds . The meridional winds do not follow any established intra seasonal variation pattern but rather the variability is susceptible to the sampling longitudes latitudes .
