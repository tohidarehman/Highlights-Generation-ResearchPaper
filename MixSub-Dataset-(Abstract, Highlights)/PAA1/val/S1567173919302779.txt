 A novel zwitterionic lithium benzotriazole sulfobetaine is fabricated by grafting 1 3 propanesultone onto benzotriazole and then lithiating it . The resultant lithium benzotriazole sulfobetaine additive is used as an electrolyte additive in lithium ion batteries in 1M LiPF

@highlight A novel zwitterion is synthesized by grafting 1 3propanesultone onto benzotriazole.
@highlight The zwitterion is lithiated to form a zwitterionic lithium salt.
@highlight Zwitterionic additive improves ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability at RT.
@highlight Full cells have a stable cycle performance at 1C over 100 cycles.
