 Various ionospheric indices based on Global Navigation Satellite Systems data are widely used to study ionospheric disturbances . Two of them produced from the Slant Total Electron Content measurements are studied in the paper well known AATR index and relatively new WTEC index . A comparative statistical analysis of AATR and WTEC indices was made using ISTP SB RAS receivers network . We compared AATR and WTEC indices for studying small and mid scale ionospheric disturbances in different geophysical conditions and different geographical regions . The analysis was carried out at high equatorial and middle latitudes during 20142017 . It is shown that the contribution of diurnal variations of the background ionosphere to AATR is higher than to WTEC . It is shown that at high latitudes the WTEC and AATR dynamics correlates with the level of geomagnetic disturbance . At mid latitudes the contribution of Vertical Total Electron Content prevails other effects . Preliminary statistical analysis of 25 earthquakes with magnitude 6.8 shown that effect of internal atmospheric waves prevails the effect of shock acoustic waves from ground vibrations . The analysis demonstrated that at low disturbance levels WTEC index looks more sensitive than AATR at high disturbance levels the AATR is nearly proportional to WTEC with a factor of

@highlight A comparative statistical analysis of AATR and WTEC indices was conducted.
@highlight At high levels of ionospheric disturbance the AATR is proportional to the WTEC.
@highlight Higher sensitivity of the WTEC to disturbances at midlatitudes is shown.
