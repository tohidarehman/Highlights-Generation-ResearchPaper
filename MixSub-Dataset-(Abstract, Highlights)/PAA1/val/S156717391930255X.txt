 In this work we report a new method for extending the response spectra of organic photodetectors by incorporating PBDT TT C and PBDT TT F in the P3HT PC

@highlight A quaternary organic photodetectors q OPDs using P3HT PBDT TT F PBDT TT C PC
@highlight BM was prepared.
@highlight The effects of PBDT TT F and PBDT TT C added to P3HT PC
@highlight BM on properties of the OPDs were analyzed.
@highlight The essential reasons for the influence of the addition of PBDT TT C and PBDT TT F of P3HT PC
@highlight BM film were studied.
@highlight High detectivity OPDs were prepared using commercially available low cost organic materials.
