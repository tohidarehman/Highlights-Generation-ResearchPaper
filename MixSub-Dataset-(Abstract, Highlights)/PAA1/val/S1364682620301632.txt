 Lightning is one of the most important extreme weather conditions and is associated with heavy convective rain and thunderstorms . However the present understanding of such systems as well their effect on precipitation characteristics are insufficient for proper modelling . In this paper the rain microphysics is studied at Kolkata using an optical disdrometer in relation to the lightning activities . Lightning information is obtained from ground based World Wide Lightning Location Network and Lightning Imaging Sensor onboard International Space Station . The associated cloud features are studied with Doppler weather radar and MODIS satellite measurements . Results indicate significant change in rain microphysics between events with lightning and without lightning . The cloud microphysics indicates that the cloud top temperature is lower and cloud effective droplet size is smaller in case of lightning in comparison to non lightning situation . On the other hand large drops are abundant while small drops are less in numbers in rain with lightning than rain without lightning . The

@highlight This study focuses on the relation between precipitation microstructure and lightning.
@highlight Results indicate significant change of rain microphysical properties between lightning and non lightning conditions.
@highlight Cloud microstructure also seems to vary for the above two rain conditions.
@highlight The results are also helpful for improvement of radar retrieval of precipitation for lightning and non lightning conditions.
