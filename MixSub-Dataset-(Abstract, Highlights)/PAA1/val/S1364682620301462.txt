 The lack of reliable global E region electron density or conductivity measurements has hampered a detailed and quantitative understanding of the E region electrodynamic processes . The characterization of the global E region ionospheric irregularities as a function of local time longitude and season remains a great challenge . In this study we evaluate the electron densities retrieved by Wu in the D and E regions using ground based radar data and empirical models . Unlike in the conventional top down retrieval methodology the new approach avoids the Abel weighting function that carries substantial sensitivity to the electron density residuals from the F region even after they have been corrected . The new technique uses a bottom up approach in which the F region contributions in the excess phase are more effectively removed compared to the Abel inversion and hence more accurate electron density retrievals in D and E regions are determined . The results are compared and evaluated with two low and mid latitude incoherent scatter radar observations the Arecibo Observatorys 430 MHz radar located in Puerto Rico 18

@highlight A novel GPS RO technique estimates electron densities in D and E regions more accurately compared to conventional Abel inversion.
@highlight The technique is evaluated using radar observations and two empirical models IRI 2016 and FIRI 2018.
@highlight Seasonal and diurnal climatology comparisons show good agreement with radar measurements and FIRI 2018 model predictions especially at 85100 km.
@highlight The influence of the solar cycle on the E region can be clearly seen in the retrieved electron density.
