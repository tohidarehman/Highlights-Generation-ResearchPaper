 Based on discussions held at a workshop in Bra Pollenzo Italy this paper elaborates upon 19 outstanding questions of plasma physics in the Earth s magnetosphere . The questions are grouped according to driving processes radiation belt and ring current issues auroral physics internal plasma processes and magnetosphere ionosphere mapping issues . Future needs for magnetospheric plasma physics are outlined .

@highlight 19 magnetospheric plasma physics questions were discussed in Pollenzo Italy.
