 This paper examines the relationships between the integrated solar EUV flux and the measured radiance in the N

@highlight Thermospheric N
@highlight LBH band 140150nm intensities are highly correlated with solar EUV fluxes.
@highlight Spectral shapes in solar EUV emissions over affect the response of N
@highlight LBH radiance.
@highlight The above correlation provides an alternative way to estimate solar EUV flux using N
@highlight LBH radiance.
