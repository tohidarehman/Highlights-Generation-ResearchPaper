 First ever measurements and study of aerosol optical properties from a subtropical humid region of the eastern part of the central Indo Gangetic Plain Gorakhpur is presented . Four years March 2014February 2018 of columnar aerosol optical measurements using a Multi wavelength solar radiometer are analyzed to examine temporal and seasonal heterogeneity in aerosol optical properties and to ascertain aerosol types over the study region along with their seasonal contribution . Average columnar aerosol optical depth at 500nm AOD

@highlight Aerosol optical properties carried out for the first time over Gorkhpur in the central IGP.
@highlight Large heterogeinity in AOD exhibits near pristine to heavily laden aerosol atmosphere.
@highlight Dominance of fine mode aerosols mostly of urban industrial and biomass origin during post monsoon and winter season.
@highlight Dust dominance is maximum during pre monsoon season.
