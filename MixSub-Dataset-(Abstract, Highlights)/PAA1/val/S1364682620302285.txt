 Daily harmonics of the ionospheres total electron content can be mapped using Global Navigation Satellite Systems as recently accomplished by Lean and colleagues . Here those harmonics are determined by tidal analysis of ionospheric path delay from dual frequency radar altimetry . Data from TOPEX Jason 1 and Jason 2 altimeters are used with focus on periods of medium to high solar activity . Diurnal band signals are aliased by the altimeter sampling but TOPEX Jason orbits were designed to achieve acceptable tidal aliasing . Altimeter maps reveal where corresponding GNSS based maps are in error generally near the geomagnetic equator where high wavenumber features are overly smoothed . When ocean tides are deduced from single frequency altimetry a task that relies on accurate GNSS based ionospheric path corrections any TEC errors leak directly into the tide solutions . TEC errors near and west of the Weddell Sea are likely problematic for the CryoSat 2 mission .

@highlight Diurnal oscillations in TEC plus higher harmonics and annual sidelines are mapped globally with satellite altimetry.
@highlight Altimetry reveals errors in corresponding GNSS ionospheric TEC maps especially near the geomagnetic equator.
@highlight Assessing GNSS TEC errors is essential when ocean tides are derived from single frequency satellite altimetry.
