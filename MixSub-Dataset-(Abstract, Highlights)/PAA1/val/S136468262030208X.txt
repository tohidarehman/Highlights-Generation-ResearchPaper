 The results of modeling and analysis of ionospheric parameters during disturbed geomagnetic field are presented . Hourly and 15 min data of the ionospheric critical frequency at Paratunka site for the period 19682019 were applied . The modeling was based on ionospheric parameter multicomponent model developed by the authors . In order to refine model parameters three classes of anomalies were introduced . They characterize strong moderate and weak ionospheric disturbances . On the basis of the modeling we detected short period ionospheric disturbances of moderate and weak intensity preceding magnetic storms . They characterize occurrences of oscillatory processes in the ionosphere at the background of increased solar activity . Comparisons with the International Reference Ionosphere model and the median method were made . That showed the efficiency of the proposed model . For automatic performance of the approach computational solutions were suggested to detect and to estimate ionospheric disturbance parameters .

@highlight The method of ionospheric data analysis allows to study ionospheric disturbances.
@highlight An abnormal increase in the ionosphere on the eve of magnetic storms was identified.
@highlight The comparison of the proposed method with IRI showed its high efficiency.
