 We demonstrated domain wall induced anomalous magnetoresistance generated in asymmetric and symmetric ferrimagnetic Tb Co multilayered and TbCo alloyed wires . The extraordinary Hall effect induced circulating currents in the vicinity of DWs between longitudinal voltage probes are assigned to the anomalous MR. A large anomalous MR 1.5 was obtained in the asymmetric Tb Co multilayered wire . The large MR can be attributed to an addition of spin Hall current with a long coherence length from an adjacent Pt layer . These results open new possibilities for the use of ferrimagnetic multilayered wires beyond multi function devices .

@highlight Domain wall induced anomalous magnetoresistance was observed in Tb Co and TbCo wires due to the extraordinary Hall effect.
