 The effect of precipitating high energy particles on atmospheric physics and chemistry is extensively studied over the last decade . In majority of the existing models the precipitating particles induced ionization plays an essential role . For such effects it is necessary to possess enhanced increase in ion production specifically during the winter period . In this study we focus on highly penetrating particles cosmic rays . The galactic cosmic rays are the main source of ionization in the Earths stratosphere and troposphere . On the other hand the atmospheric ionization may be significantly enhanced during strong solar energetic particle events mainly over the polar caps . A specific interest is paid to the most energetic solar proton events leading to counting rate enhancement of ground based detectors namely the so called ground level enhancements . During solar cycle 23 several strong ground level enhancements were observed . A sequence of three GLEs was observed in OctoberNovember 2003 the Halloween events . Here on the basis of 3 D Monte Carlo model we computed the energetic particles induced atmospheric ionization explicitly considering the contribution of cosmic rays with galactic and solar origin . The ion production rates were computed as a function of the altitude above sea level using reconstructed solar energetic particles spectra . The 24h and event averaged ionization effects relative to the average due to galactic cosmic rays were also computed .
