 Results of analysis of the proxy of Coronal Hole Power index Pch combined with the high speed streams HSS of solar wind for a period from 2011 to 2019 are presented . It is found that the long term variation of Pch index shows a trend of growing Pch towards the minimum of solar cycle while most of other identities of solar activity tend to diminish . Superposition of fast solar wind of CH origin with slow SW of CME s origin synchronized with SC explains increasing decreasing solar wind speed Vsw at L1 point . Total 136 geo effective Pch HSS storms are selected with 4 criteria 3 day increment Pch90 i.u . where Pch Pch 1d d
