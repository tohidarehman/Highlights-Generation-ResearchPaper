 A local maximum value of ionospheric total electron content in midlatitude regions named midlatitude ionospheric peak in this study has been frequently observed during both the daytime and nighttime . We have carried out a modeling study of midlatitude ionospheric peaks in TEC using the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamic General Circulation Model to investigate possible mechanisms driving these peaks . Comparisons between model results and Global Position System TEC observations in the solar minimum year of 2009 show that TIEGCM can reproduce the nighttime and daytime midlatitude ionospheric peaks . Model results indicate that midlatitude ionospheric peaks in the daytime and nighttime are likely caused by different mechanisms . Nighttime midlatitude ionospheric peaks are attributed to the downwards moving plasma ambipolar diffusive flux from the plasmasphere . However the daytime upwards moving plasma ambipolar diffusive flux and poleward meridional winds which can cause ionospheric depletion might play dominated roles in producing midlatitude ionospheric peaks in the early morning in the winter season .

@highlight Nighttime midlatitude peaks are caused by downward plasma diffusive flux from the plasmasphere.
@highlight The seasonal characteristics of nighttime midlatitude peaks depend on local times.
@highlight Daytime midlatitude peaks in the early morning are related to plasma diffusive flux and winds.
