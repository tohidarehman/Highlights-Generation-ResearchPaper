 We present a simple efficient and flexible three dimensional electrostatic model for calculating the magnitude and direction of the electric field from the ground to the base of the ionosphere for a given thunderstorm charge configuration with the aim of evaluating the possibility for sprite inception . The model is based on a method of images solution to Poisson s equation assuming near vacuum conditions and with perfectly conducting upper and lower boundaries . A dipole electrical structure within each thundercloud is assumed with a screening charge above the cloud . The charge centers are modeled with average structural characteristics of summer and winter thunderstorms . To simulate a positive or negative cloud to ground lightning discharge the main positive or main negative charge center respectively is removed from the domain . The computed electric potential at each grid point is converted to the electric field and is compared against the value of the conventional breakdown field to obtain an indication of the possibility of electrical breakdown and hence the possibility of sprite inception . This simple model is particularly useful for performing a sensitivity study with respect to variation in thunderstorm cell charge configuration with no assumption of symmetry in the horizontal or vertical directions . Implications of the presence of neighboring clouds at different relative stages of development on the possibility of sprite inception and on the displacement of sprites from the location of the parent thunderstorm are also examined as well as clouds with inverted dipole charge configuration .

@highlight The method of images can be easily used to map areas of possible sprite inception.
@highlight Neighboring clouds can significantly affect the area of possible sprite inception.
@highlight The influence of horizontally asymmetric charge configurations should be investigated further including time dependence.
