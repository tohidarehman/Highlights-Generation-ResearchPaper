 This study discusses the influence of different composition of negative electrode material on the performance of Ni MH cells . Two major groups of multicomponent alloys were used during the experiments AB

@highlight Multicomponent hydrogen storage alloys were used for electrode construction.
@highlight Addition of nickel increased the negative electrode performance of Ni MH batteries.
@highlight Small amount of carbon materials increased the performance of negative electrode.
