 The observations of vertical total electron content and L1 and L2 band ionospheric scintillations at an equatorial station Tarawa Kiribati under a complex severe space weather event of 49 September 2017 are presented . The VTEC increased significantly by 1.03 and 1.31 TEC units under M5.5 class flare at 20 28 UT on 04 September and M4.2 flare at 01 03 UT on 05 September respectively under the quiet geomagnetic conditions . A positive ionospheric storm with a maximum percentage change in VTEC of 16.7 followed by a negative ionospheric storm with VTEC of 32.8 occurred during the first main phase

@highlight Larger VTEC increase was produced by M4.2 class flare as compared to M5.5 due to SZA dependence of solar flare effect.
@highlight A positive storm efect in VTEC followed by a negative efffect occurred associated with the first main phase of the storm.
@highlight A long duration positive ionospheric storm in VTEC occurred during the second main phase of the storm.
