 A new nowcasting method is herewith proposed to monitor the crucial components of the variability of the stratospheric ozone depletion . A demonstration of this method is performed considering the daily measurements of the minimum air temperature in the latitude range 50

@highlight The first Arctic O
@highlight hole during the winter spring 20192020 was attributed to the colder stratospheric temperatures.
@highlight However the min temperature of the Arctic stratosphere in 20192020 was within the limits of its variability since 1979.
@highlight The winter spring temperature in 20192020 was very close to that of 20102011 when no such O
@highlight hole appeared.
@highlight The O
@highlight hole phenomenon is complex and does not depend only on the temperature regime of the polar stratosphere.
@highlight According to the proposed nowcasting tool the Arctic O
@highlight hole will close in the last week of April 2020..
