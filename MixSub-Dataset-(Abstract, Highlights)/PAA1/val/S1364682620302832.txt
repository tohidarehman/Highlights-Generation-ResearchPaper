 Preliminary results from the measurement of potential gradient for the period of March 2018February 2019at the University of Kashmir Srinagar India is reported . The annual mean diurnal variation of PG represents typical double maxima pattern with the primary maximum at 09001000 LT and the secondary maximum at 19002000 LT which is in accordance with the measurements at different continental stations . The primary maximum of PG and its extended duration is explained by the sunrise effect due to increasing surface temperature the development of surface convection and hence the boundary layer probably favour the uplifting of the surface aerosols . The higher PG values measured at Kashmir valley were explained with the height of the measurement from the surface and the role of mountain valley winds circulation . Monthly mean PG showed the higher value during December and minimum in June and the amplitude variations were attributed to the local PM concentrations . PG is found to be highly influenced by PM

@highlight First measurement of potential gradient PG over Srinagar at the University of Kashmir.
@highlight Diurnal variation of fair weather PG remains higher than the all weather.
@highlight Seasonal PG values are higher in winter and autumn as compared to summer and spring.
@highlight Aerosol and PM concentration plays an important role in atmospheric electricity.
