 Atmospheric tides dominate the mesosphere and lower thermosphere dynamics and show seasonal interannual as well as long term variability . In the present study MLT wind data obtained between 1999 and 2019 from meteor radar observations at Cachoeira Paulista 22.7

@highlight Evolution of DT SDT TDT amplitudes at 22.7S during the declining phases of SC 23 and 24.
@highlight Relationship of the behaviour of tidal amplitudes with the stratospheric QBO.
@highlight Solar cycle signature in the variation of the SDT and TDT has been analysed.
