 Ground based electric field measurements during fair weather and thunderstorms are key parameters for Global Electric Circuit investigations and climate change assessment . We study the variations of near surface electric field during fair weather and thunderstorms . In this work we present daily monthly and yearly distribution of thunderstorm activity from 2012 to 2019at different research stations of Cosmic Ray Division of the A. Alikhanyan National Science Laboratory which has been done the first time for mentioned locations . The distribution of fair weather days based on electric field variation and meteorological parameters are also discussed . According to results thunderstorm activity is very high from May to June and the most active part during the day is from 15 00 to 20 00 LT at three different altitudes .

@highlight The thunderstorm activity and fair weather studies have been investigated for the first time for Armenian region.
@highlight Daily monthly and annual thunderstorm distributions have been presented at different geographic locations.
@highlight The diurnal variations of near surface electric fields during fair weather has been discussed.
@highlight Meteorological parameters distribution has been presented for 3 different locations.
