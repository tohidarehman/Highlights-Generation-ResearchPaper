 An active mapping mission is described that unambiguously connects measurements in the Earth s magnetosphere to visible aurora in the atmosphere . The core of the mission is an electron beam source operated on a spacecraft in the equatorial magnetosphere with the electron beam traveling along the Earth s magnetic field lines to the atmosphere depositing its energy to create an optical beam spot in the atmosphere at the footpoint of the spacecraft s magnetic field line . This optical spot can be imaged by ground based cameras putting the location of the spacecraft s magnetic footpoint into the context of the optical aurora . Scientific instruments carried on the spacecraft make critical measurements of the properties of the magnetosphere at the locations where the magnetosphere powers the aurora allowing the determination of the plasma physics mechanisms by which the magnetosphere drives the aurora in particular answering the outstanding question of how the magnetosphere drives low latitude auroral arcs . Long standing questions in magnetosphere ionosphere coupling that have not been answered because we could not unambiguously connect locations in the magnetosphere with their image in the ionosphere will finally be addressed . In this paper the properties of a standard growth phase auroral arc are collected theories of the magnetospheric generation of auroral arcs are reviewed and critical magnetospheric measurements to discern the mechanisms that drive auroral arcs are determined . Further the plasma physics of the experiment is investigated including spacecraft charging mitigation beam stability beam scattering and electron orbit theory . Tradeoffs concerning the energy of the electron beam are enumerated .
