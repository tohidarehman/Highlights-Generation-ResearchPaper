 The solar eclipse observed on 26 December 2019 over Southern India provided another rare opportunity to observe responses of various trace gases to the remarkably dynamic character of atmospheric photochemistry during an eclipse event . The species that are directly O

@highlight Direct and indirect photochemical impacts on the trace gas concentrations during solar eclipse event are investigated.
@highlight reduced by 48 and NO
@highlight increased by 8 times whereas other species showed variations typical for a normal day.
@highlight Role of radiation in the formation and degradation photochemistry of some of the important trace gases is shown.
@highlight This study also highlights the role of boundary layer dynamics in the trace gas concentrations variability.
