 The wave forcing from below allows the neutral atmosphere to drive short term variability in the ionosphere . Recent modeling studies have shown that secondary waves originated from the nonlinear interaction of the atmospheric tides with planetary scale waves can contribute significantly to day to day variability of the ionosphere . In this study we used MLT neutral wind measured at So Joo do Cariri and ionospheric soundings performed by a digisonde installed at Fortaleza to investigate the presence and the induced variability by a secondary wave in the mesosphere ionosphere system over the Brazilian equatorial region . We found evidences of the nonlinear interaction between a 3.5 day ultrafast Kelvin wave and the diurnal tide . The interaction produced a 1.3 day secondary wave that was found to propagate upward with maximum amplitude of 15m s and relatively long vertical wavelength in the MLT which may allow it to penetrate into the ionosphere . In the ionosphere we observed a common 1.3 day periodic variation in the virtual height and critical frequency f
