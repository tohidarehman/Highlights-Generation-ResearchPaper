 Comparison of the numerical simulation results with experimental data obtained aboard the CHAMP spacecraft has shown that in the eastern longitudes during the local winter period the parameters of electron temperature T

@highlight The result of the electron temperature simulation compared with CHAMP data.
@highlight In the subauroral ionosphere the zone of electron temperature enhancement is formed.
@highlight The zone of electron temperature enhancement forms in both hemispheres.
@highlight The configuration of the zone undergo significant changes depending on UT.
@highlight During 24h the ring shaped and crescent shaped configuration zone can be formed.
