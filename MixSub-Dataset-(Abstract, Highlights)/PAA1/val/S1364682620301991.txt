 A model of electric discharges at mesospheric altitudes has been developed to explain the nature of optical flashes transient atmospheric events observed aboard the Russian microsatellites Universitetsky Tatyana 1 Universitetsky Tatyana 2 and Vernov . The model is based on assumption that large scale areas with a low space charge density and a low electric breakdown threshold can occur in the mesosphere thereby producing electric discharges between the charged areas . Variations in the number densities of electrons and ions in the discharge channel connecting these areas are described by kinetic equations in which spatial derivatives are disregarded . The discharge parameters such as mobility of charged particles rate of ionization and rate of electron attachment to neutral molecules are assumed to depend on altitude in the atmosphere . Numerical simulation and analytical solutions of the basic equation set make it possible to analyze the time dependences of electric field conductivity current and number densities of electrons and ions in the discharge channel at various altitudes in the atmosphere . Theoretical estimates of the TAEs parameters are best suited to the onboard observations under assumptions that first the charged areas of

@highlight Ultraviolet flashes are frequently observed onboard satellite above thunderclouds.
@highlight The presence of large scale charged areas in the mesosphere is assumed.
@highlight Electric breakdown between these areas can explain the observed flashes.
@highlight Governing factors appear to be air ionization and electron attachment to neutrals.
