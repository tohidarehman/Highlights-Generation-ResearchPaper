 In this study we investigated the characteristics of pre earthquake ionospheric effects related to four successive shallow focus earthquakes in Indonesia by the China Seismo Electromagnetic Satellite . By adopting the moving median method the ionospheric electron density detected by the Langmuir probe onboard CSES presented remarkable enhancements along the orbits 2660 0 on July 27 2721 0 and 2728 1 on July 31 2827 0 and 2735 1 on August 7 2934 0 on August 14 respectively which were just 1 5 2 and 5 days before the four earthquakes . Moreover the disturbances mainly appeared in the north and north east within the distance of 2000km from each epicenter . By comparing the disturbed orbits with their corresponding four nearest and four revisiting orbits as well as the predicted values from the International Reference Ionosphere 2016 model the results powerfully illustrated that CSES observed the ionospheric precursors preceding the four Indonesian earthquakes . To make the space borne results more convincing we further studied the grid total electron content data from the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe which exhibited similar anomalies in both the temporal and spatial distributions . In the end the superposed epoch analyses method was conducted on 35M5.8 depth50km earthquakes in Indonesia during 20072017 by using CODE TEC . The statistical results demonstrated that there were significant positive anomalies 17 days before earthquakes within 2000km from the epicenters in this region . The positive plasma perturbations detected by CSES were highly suggested as the seismic ionospheric effects before earthquakes .

@highlight The seismic ionospheric effects in Indonesian region detected by the CSES satellite are investigated.
@highlight The accuracy of the CSES derived results are verifiedby the IRI model and GIM TEC datasets.
@highlight It is suggested that there are four pre earthquake Ne anomalies just corresponding to four earthquakes.
