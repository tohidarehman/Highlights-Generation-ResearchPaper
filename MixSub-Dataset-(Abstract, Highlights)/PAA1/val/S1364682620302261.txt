 The results of an investigation into whether or not eclipse shadow bands have an atmospheric origin are presented . Using high altitude balloon and ground based photodiode arrays during the August 21 2017 total solar eclipse data revealing the light patterns before and after totality were collected at 600Hz . These data were then analyzed using spectrograms which provide information on intensity fluctuations in the frequency space time domain . Both at the altitude of the balloon

@highlight Ground and high altitude balloon based photo diode arrays collected data around totality of solar eclipse.
@highlight Brief chaotic signals attributed to atmospheric scintillation found only in ground based array.
@highlight Data analyzed using spectrograms revealed sustained shadow band signal above and below the atmosphere.
@highlight The author s declare s that there is no conflict of interest.
