 The study investigates the gravity waves activity detected in the mesosphere lower thermosphere region using airglow observations performed by the Spectral Airglow Temperature Imager at the Sierra Nevada Observatory 37.06

@highlight The gravity wave activity detected in the mesosphere and lower thermospherehave been studied using airglow observations taken with a Spectral Airglow Temperature Imager SATI installed at Sierra Nevada Observatory SNO 37.06 N 3.38 W from 1998 to 2015.
@highlight We find activity of gravity waves with periods shorter than 3 h is maximum in summer and winter while the activity of gravity waves with period from 3 to 6 h have maximum activity around OctoberDecember and minimum during summer.
@highlight The gravity wave activity detected from our data set is larger than that of the semidiurnal tide. Nonetheless it is smaller than the planetary wave activity specially in summer where the latter seems to be the largest.
@highlight In general wave activity is the main source of variability of both emissions planetary wave activity being the main one responsible in the case of the O2 emission.
@highlight However rotational temperatures are more affected by seasonal variations specially in OH rotational temperatures which are responsible of more than the 40 of the overall variability.
