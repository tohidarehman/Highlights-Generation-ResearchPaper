 Triboelectric nano generators can be utilized as a power supply for wireless systems sensors and operators . In this paper new flexible TE NGs that use sodium carboxymethyl cellulose poly dimethyl siloxane polyvinylidene fluoride poly films and also sugar as a piezoelectric material were developed and are reported . Also the outputs of NGs made by linear power under a periodic pressure of 0.2MPaat a frequency of 3Hz showed that the highest output of NGs are related to PDMSKATTON PDMS PVDFKAPTON PVDF CMC NGs respectively . It has been also observed that NGs connected in series to each other have a higher output than paralleled NGs so that their voltages increase at higher frequencies . Besides a significant point is that the NGs are made in a low cost affordable and environmentally friendly route which is a superior characteristic with respect to the rest of the NGs .

@highlight A simple environmentally friendly and cost effective method to synthesis the new flexible TE NGs.
@highlight The TE NGs based on CMC PDMS PVDF KAPTON and also sugar used as a piezoelectric material.
@highlight The films were prepared under RT ambient conditions without needing to the ultra advanced devices such as freeze drying.
