 Ionospheric disturbance detected using GPS based Total Electron Content measurements are widely used to study the morphology and dynamics of the ionosphere and its impact on radio communication and satellite based navigation . The IDs normally derived as rate of change of TEC between consecutive ionospheric pierce points at uniform time interval implicitly results in non uniform spatial sampling along the GPS satellite tracks . The non uniform spatial sampling introduces aliasing in ROT . These aliasing corrupt amplitude and Signal to Noise Ratio of the detected IDs . In this study we propose a Spatio Periodic Leveling Algorithm to remove such aliasing . Efficiency of the proposed algorithm was tested by simulating the IDs along a satellite track and validated with GPS observations carried out during 2015St . Patrick s day geomagnetic storm . Spatiotemporal and SNR analyses of simulated and observed IDs reveal that the SPLA is efficient in removing the aliases increases the SNR on an average of 99.5 compared to ROT removes the need of applying elevation cut off and expands the area of coverage up to 65 .

@highlight Non uniform spatial sampling between Ionospheric Pierce Points introduce aliasing in ionospheric disturbances detected by GPS.
@highlight An improvised algorithm to obtain ionospheric disturbances free of such aliasing is proposed.
@highlight The proposed algorithm was validated using GPS observations carried out during 2015St. Patrick s day geomagnetic storm.
@highlight The proposed algorithm efficiently removes aliasing expands area of coverage up to 65 and increases average SNR to 99.5 .
