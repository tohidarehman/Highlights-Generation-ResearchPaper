 Upper mesospheric winds observed by the meteor radar at Kototabang show equinoctial asymmetry with larger westward winds in MarchApril during the strong La Nia years 2008 and 2011 . However the winds are comparable in both equinoxes in the strong El Nio year 2015 . The migrating diurnal tide estimated from Sounding of Atmosphere by Broadband Emission Radiometry temperature at 8090km shows larger amplitudes in March than in September in 2008 and 2011 but comparable amplitudes in both March and September during 2015 . This suggests the major role of the DW1 in driving the large westward winds .

@highlight Equatorial mesospheric mean zonal wind is equinox asymmetric in strong La Nia year.
@highlight They show equinoctial symmetry in the strong El Nio year.
@highlight DW1 tide shows comparable amplitudes in March and September in El Nio year.
@highlight DW1 tide shows larger amplitudes in March than in September in La Nina years.
@highlight This suggests that the DW1 plays major role in driving the large westward winds.
