 Energetic particle precipitation is one of the main processes by which the sun influences atmospheric composition and structure . The polar middle atmosphere is chemically disturbed by the precipitation induced production of nitric oxides NO

@highlight Sub polar O

@highlight perturb zonally asymmetric O
@highlight and short wave heating and thereby planetary wave PW driving.
@highlight The reduced PW forcing strengthens the polar vortices in early winter while the SH polar vortex is weakened in late winter.
@highlight Vertical dipoles in temperatures are induced at high latitudes by dynamically induced anomalous mean meridional circulations.
@highlight The early late winter dynamical changes migrate downward into the troposphere in NH SH .
