 ENSO has significant impact on the precipitation pattern in summer over China . To differentiate the different impacts from El Nio and La Nina two groups of experiments were conducted using WRF Chem CO tracer model with one group for summer 2015 and the other group for summer 2010 . The study explained the difference between 2015 and 2010 as strong El Nio and La Nina respectively with a perspective of the contributions from different vapor sources . The results show that in El Nio years positive anomalies are distributed over southern China while negative anomalies are distributed over the Indian Ocean western China and the Tibetan Plateau . In 2015 the correlation between water vapor and precipitation was higher than in 2010 which indicated a more consistent trend of the water vapor under El Nio than La Nina . The difference between 2015 and 2010 on contributions from different vapor sources were mainly resulted from the Arabian Sea the Bay of Bengal the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean . The Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic Ocean contributed very little over China . The oceanic vapor over China has larger impact in 2015 than in 2010 in June but smaller in July and August . South China and the Tibetan Plateau are two regions greatly influenced by ENSO . In 2015 their average water vapor experienced increases around late June mid July and mid August . Furthermore the increase over SC showed a clear signal transporting from east to west . In 2010 their increases were less significant especially for TP . A stronger water vapor transport under El Nio than La Nina is implied . However the vapor from the Indian Ocean was reduced in 2015 which means the enhancement in water vapor transport towards these two regions were mainly contributed by the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea .

@highlight Opposite patterns of precipitation anomaly showed under El Nio and La Nina.
@highlight El Nio indicated a higher conversion rate from vapor into rainfall than La Nina.
@highlight ENSO related vapor contribution differed mainly on the Indian Ocean SCS and the Pacific Ocean.
@highlight A wave signal of vapor from east to west over South China is showed in 2015.
