 This study is concerned with the effects of a decrease in the air pollution concentration on the lightning characteristics of two large Brazilian cities . The decrease in air pollution happened from March 20 till April 02 2020 and it was caused by the social distancing effort to contain the COVID 19 spread in the cities . In So Paulo the ratio between cloud to ground to intracloud flashes and the average peak current of negative cloud to ground flashes significantly decreased whereas in Belo Horizonte the ratio between positive and negative cloud to ground flashes significantly increased with respect to the values in previous years .

@highlight Social distancing due to COVID 19 reduces the pollution in large cities of Brazil.
@highlight Ratio of cloud to ground to intracloud lightning varies with changes in pollution.
@highlight Lightning polarity and intensity vary with changes in pollution.
