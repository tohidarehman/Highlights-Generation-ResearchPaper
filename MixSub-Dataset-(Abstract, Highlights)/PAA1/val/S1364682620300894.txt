 The ozone layer filters solar ultraviolet radiation and is affected by several photochemical and dynamical processes in the atmosphere . Stratospheric ozone formation takes place primarily in tropical regions and it is the consequence of reactions between atmospheric oxygen and the ultraviolet solar radiation . For the purpose of this paper the atmospheric TOC measurements are calculated using Dobson spectrophotometers in conjunction of satellite data of TOMS and OMI at Cachoeira Paulista 22.7

@highlight Difference estimation values between Dobson at CP NT and TOMS OMI were 3 and 2 .
@highlight The long term ozone trends at two stations are 2.76 and 0.78 respectively.
@highlight Average ozone amounts at each station was 268.89.5 DU for CP and 266.87.4 DU at NT.
@highlight Seasonal cycle with a minimum of 256 DU at CP and NT in autumn.
@highlight Seasonal cycle with maximum of 283 DU at CP and 279 DU at NT in spring.
