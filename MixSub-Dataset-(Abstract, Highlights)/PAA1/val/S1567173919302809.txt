 A proof of concept method for measuring cardiac tissue contraction force using an in house developed piezoelectric cantilever sensor system is demonstrated . Contracting forces of 7.216.6N were measured from a human cardiac tissue construct . Beating cardiac tissue constructs were monitored in situ under a microscope during the contraction force measurements . Development of the measurement method allows very low forces such as the ones that appear in biological small scale systems to be determined .
