 Over the last few decades it has been shown in numerous studies using different observational approaches that although less frequent lightning over the oceans is significantly more intense than over land . To study this difference we set up a laboratory experiment in which we examined the flash intensity of generated lightning strikes as a function of the salinity of the water into which they were discharged . Our experiments clearly showed that the intensity of lightning increased exponentially with the concentration of dissolved salts in the water . We hypothesize that the higher conductivity of the saline water compared to moist soil results in a more efficient charge transfer to the surface resulting in larger peak current discharges and brighter optical flashes .

@highlight This paper sheds light on the mystery around why lightning discharges over the oceans are more intense than those over the continents.
@highlight Many studies have shown more intense lightning over oceans Although even though the amount of lightning over oceans is only around 10 of the global activity.
@highlight We show that the salinity of the oceans plays and important role in the intensity of the lightning discharges in the atmosphere.
