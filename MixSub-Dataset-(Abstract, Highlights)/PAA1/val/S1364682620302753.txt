 Thermodynamic indices have been used as a tool for nowcasting thunderstorms for decades . The present study deals with understanding the variations in threshold values of various thermodynamic indices during pre monsoon season at two north eastern Indian stations Agartala and Guwahati . The study utilises thirty years of radiosonde data surface information about thunderstorms and TRMM daily rainfall data . The threshold values for five years period interval each has been determined for fourteen thermodynamic indices to the whole period . The indices related to latent potential and convective instability responded differently at both the sites .

@highlight The study analyses thermodynamic indices related to thunderstorms for 19872016 over Guwahati and Agartala.
@highlight Threshold values for five years each have been found for the study.
@highlight 12 UTC threshold values are showing clear trends at both the sites.
@highlight CAPE and CIN threshold values are increasing over the sites.
