 European monthly temperatures undergo strong fluctuations from one year to the other . The variability is controlled by natural processes such as Atlantic cycles changes in solar activity volcanic eruptions unforced internal atmospheric variability as well as anthropogenic factors . This contribution investigates the role of key natural drivers for European temperature variability namely the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation the North Atlantic Oscillation and solar activity changes . We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients r for AMO NAO and sunspots compared to monthly temperature data of 39 European countries for the period 19012015 in order to search for fingerprints of the natural drivers . A cross correlation window of 11 months was chosen for AMO NAO and of 120 months for SILSO to account for possible time lags or phase shifts . The r coefficients were mapped out across Europe on a monthly basis to document regional and seasonal changes of the correlation strength . The NAO dominates European temperature variability during the winter months with strongest relationship in February . The AMO modulates temperatures in March to November with best correlations occurring in summer but also in April . Regions of strongest AMO and NAO impacts shift across the continent from month to month forming systematic patterns . Direct correlation of the solar 11 year Schwabe cycle with temperatures was identified only in some countries in certain multidecadal intervals during February March June and September . Previous studies have suggested a significant solar influence on the AMO and NAO . It is likely that the greatest impact of solar activity on European temperatures is of a non linear indirect nature by way of interaction with Atlantic cycles .

@highlight Correlation of AMO NAO and sunspots with European temperatures was studied for 19012015 based on correlation coefficients.
@highlight Seasonal changes were mapped out with NAO dominating in winter and AMO in summer exhibiting systematic regional shifts.
@highlight Direct solar correlations are regionally seasonally restricted greatest solar impact through interaction with NAO and AMO.
