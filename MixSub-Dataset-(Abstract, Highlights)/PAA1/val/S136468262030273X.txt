 The importance of gravity waves in the redistribution of energy and momentum in the Earth s atmosphere is well known . It is extremely important to understand the nature of variation in the GW characteristics to address issues of coupling in the Earth s atmosphere . We have used digisonde measurements to investigate the variation in thermospheric wave dynamics in the daytime over low latitudes during geomagnetic quiet and disturbed times . Vertical phase speeds and wavelengths of GWs are calculated by monitoring the phase offsets in the digisonde derived height variations of constant electron densities throughout the day . During geomagnetic quiet times the magnitudes of vertical propagation speeds of GWs and their vertical wavelengths show seasonal variation and vary in the range of 1070ms

@highlight Daytime vertical propagation of gravity waves is temperature dependent.
@highlight Vertical speeds and scale sizes of gravity waves show seasonal variation.
@highlight Season dependent direction in propagation of GWs are presented.
@highlight Vertical propagation speeds and wavelengths show two peaks annually.
@highlight Vertical propagation in GW is correlated with AE index during geomagnetic storms.
