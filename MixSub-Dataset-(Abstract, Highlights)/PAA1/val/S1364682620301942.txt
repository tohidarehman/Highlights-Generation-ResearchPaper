 Noctilucent clouds are mesospheric ice clouds occurring in the summer hemisphere at high latitudes and an altitude of about 83km . This region is the coldest of the earths atmosphere and is characterized by the presence of wave interaction and dissipation . The processes involved here lead to a variety of structures and instabilities that become visible in noctilucent clouds and are observed by different instruments . In this work high resolution lidar measurements are used to give a wide overview of the structures at small scales below the BruntVisl period of

@highlight Novel lidar measurements of noctilucent clouds NLC with 1s and 25m resolution.
@highlight First time observation of very thin NLC layers with thickness 100m.
@highlight NLC are highly dynamic on small scales and often multi layered.
@highlight We introduce a new categorization of NLC based on small scale structures.
@highlight NLC structures are often advected by the wind.
