 We perform a superposed epoch analysis on two groups of selected geospace disturbance events emerging from single and isolated interplanetary drivers and resulting in either the enhancement or the depletion of the average relativistic electron Phase Space Density . We investigate the occurrence of behavioural temporal patterns of solar wind and geomagnetic parameters chorus and ULF Pc5 wave activity and the source seed electron PSD in the outer Van Allen radiation belt . Our results indicate that the source electron population of 10MeV G exhibits a similar behaviour during both event groups while the 1MeV G population can be considered as negligible for the whole process of wave excitation and electron energisation . Moreover events that result in relativistic electron enhancement are characterised by statistically stronger and prolonged storm substorm and wave activity combined with an abundance of seed electrons of 100MeV G mostly at L 45 the nominal heart of the outer radiation belt .

@highlight Relativistic electron enhancements are characterised by statistically stronger and prolonged storm substorm and wave activity combined with an abundance of seed electrons.
@highlight Source electrons above 10keV are well correlated with substorm activity.
@highlight Source electrons below 10keV exhibit negligible differences.
