 An improved stochastic method for computer simulation of lightning leaders is developed based on the results from optical observation data . The development and attachment process of downward negative cloud to ground lightning in the near ground area is simulated . The distribution of lightning strike points influenced by tall structures is statistically analyzed . The results show that when downward negative leaders initiate at 1500m height over a structure the relative strike frequency for the structure increases at a decreasing rate as the structure height increases . The strike frequency for a 600m tall structure is approximately 3.6 times that for a 100m tall structure . Additionally the structure may attract some lightning to hit itself and shift nearby ground strike points toward the structure . For taller structures the deviation effect is more apparent . It is stipulated in this study that if the ground strike density in the vicinity of the structure is no more than 5 of the average density then the structure has a sufficient protective effect on this area . The data indicate that there is a positive correlation between the protection distance and the height of the structure . The protection distances of structures of 100600m in height are 200m 280m 350m 400m 450m and 480m approximatively which show a declining rate of increase .

@highlight A stochastic lightning leader model was improved to simulate the effects of tall structures on downward lightning.
@highlight The downward strike probability to tall structure and the protection distance increase at a decreasing rate as the structure height increases.
@highlight The tall structure shifts nearby lightning strike points toward itself.
