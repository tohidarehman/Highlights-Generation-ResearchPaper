 We report the microwave synthesis of copper nanowires by using alkylamine mediated approach . The aspect ratio of CuNWs of this study was twofold compared to the previous microwave assisted synthesis study . In addition we showed that microwave synthesis could produce high aspect ratio CuNWs in a much shorter time compared to conventional method . Purification process of CuNWs was done via a simple and fast centrifugation method using water hydrophobic organic solvent system . We also show the importance of purification process on the performance of the fabricated transparent conductive electrode films . Purified CuNWs TCE showed a low sheet resistance of 35 sq with high transparency of 81 at
