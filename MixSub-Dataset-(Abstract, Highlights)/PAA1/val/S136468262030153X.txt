 Among the physical processes in the solar wind plasma the processes taking place in the vicinity of the front of the interplanetary shock wave and on the front itself are of particular interest . In this paper we present an analytical description of such processes which is based on the solution of a system of nonlinear equations of magnetohydrodynamics in a thin layer surrounding the front of the interplanetary shock wave and also on the use of the Rankine Hugoniot conditions in the frontal zone . Two models of a shock wave are considered one which does not takes into account the thickness of the front and another one which takes into account the finite thickness and the fine structure of the front . The influence of both models on the solar wind parameters are compared with each other . Explicit formulas describing the changes of the main solar wind parameters particle flow velocities pressure and the accompanying magnetic field in the vicinity of the front have been derived for both models . Two important facts have been established in the interaction of a SW with a shock wave . The magnetic energy of the shock front is absorbed by the SW and increases its speed . In the case of model II this process is much more intensive than with model I . The kinetic energy of the shock front in the case of model I on the contrary takes energy from the SW which leads to a decrease of the velocity of the SW particles . For model II this effect is practically absent . These results of this work are analytically proven and evaluated quantitatively .

@highlight Two models of a shock wave are considered without and with the finite thickness of the front.
@highlight The transfer of magnetic energy from the FSW to the SW is more intense with model II.
@highlight The transfer of kinetic energy from SW to FSW occurs only with model I.
@highlight Models I and II should be considered not alternative but complementary.
