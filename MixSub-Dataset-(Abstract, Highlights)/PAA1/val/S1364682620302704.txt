 The Annular Solar Eclipse occurred on December 26 2019 which was visible at most of the South Indian subcontinents with greater than 80 obscurity particularly during the morning hours and it played a crucial role in the atmospheric dynamics . For the first time the ground based measurements have used to investigate the fluctuations of air temperature relative humidity atmospheric pressure wind speed and direction UV A radiation and turbulence parameters on solar eclipse day over a semi arid region Anantapur in Southern India . The Surface Layer meteorological parameters have abruptly changed on eclipse day as compared to the control day . During eclipse day the near surface air temperature was significantly decreased and relative humidity increased after 60min of the beginning of the eclipse which mainly due to cooling the surface . The atmospheric pressure has reduced by 0.9hPa during the eclipse period and the winds speed also reduced to 0.92ms

@highlight The significant reduction of temperature has noticed during the eclipse.
@highlight The UVA radiation showed 16.85 Wm 2 decreased at the maximum phase of the eclipse.
@highlight The TKE has reduced to 0.37 m2s 2 due to the turbulence weakening on the eclipse day.
@highlight The stability parameter reached zero at the peak phase of ASE during the eclipse day.
