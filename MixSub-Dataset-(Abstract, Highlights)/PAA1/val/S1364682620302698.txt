 In this study the solar cycle modulation of the connection between boreal winter El Nio South Oscillation and following summer South Asia High are revealed . For El Nio accompanied by low solar cycle or La Nia accompanied by low solar cycle the boreal winter ENSO prominently affects the following summer s SAH variation . The SAH is enhanced and expanded in the meridional and zonal directions in the EL LS phase . The composite difference in the SAH between El Nio and La Nia events is obviously stronger in the low solar cycle phase . In low solar cycle phase El Nio signal and charging process are stronger which lead to stronger warming sea surface temperature appear in tropical Indian Ocean and Maritime Continent extending to northwestern Pacific resulting in larger SAH variations via warming tropospheric temperature . However for El Nio with a high solar cycle or La Nia with a high solar cycle the variations in the SAH and the composite difference of the SAH between El Nio and La Nia events are quite weak in the high solar cycle phase . The charging process over tropical Indian Ocean induced by El Nio is weaker in the high solar cycle phase which leads to weaker warming SST appear over tropical Indian Ocean resulting in smaller SAH variations .

@highlight The ENSO SAH connection is modulated by the 11 year solar cycle.
@highlight Stronger charging process and TIO SST anomalies in low solar cycle phase resulting in larger SAH variations.
@highlight Weaker charging process and TIO SST annomalies in high solar cycle phase leading to smaller SAH variations.
