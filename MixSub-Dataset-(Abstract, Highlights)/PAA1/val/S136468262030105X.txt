 Using large data base of stable auroral arcs observed at Gillam we identified those passes of POES spacecraft which were magnetically conjugate to these arcs . We studied statistically arc locations with respect to the energetic particle isotropy boundaries which are the well known markers of the magnetotail regions . In the dusk and night sectors we confirm previous finding that arcs tend to appear close to or poleward of the electron isotropy boundary IB

@highlight Dusk to midnight arcs appear poleward of the electron isotropy boundary IBe in the low Bz current sheet region.
@highlight Many dawnside arcs appear between electron and proton IBs in the transition region between current sheet and dipole.
@highlight Nearly tail aligned structures are rotated toward azimuthal alignment when mapped from tail equator to the ionosphere.
@highlight Fast flow convection channels BBFs may serve as viable framework to explain a significant fraction of auroral arcs.
