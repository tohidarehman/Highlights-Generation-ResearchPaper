 This paper presents the results of radio observations of ionospheric disturbances associated with the fall of a meteoroid off the east coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula on 18 December 2018 . The ionospheric disturbances were measured with the multipath radio system designed for oblique sounding and located at the Harbin Engineering University campus the People s Republic of China . The main results are as follows . The ionospheric disturbances following the Kamchatka meteoroid entry and explosion have been detected in the temporal variations in the Doppler spectra and signal amplitudes observed over six oblique propagation paths . The possible disturbances have 23 groups of time delays . Depending on the distance between the terminal detonation point and the propagation path midpoint these time delays fall into the 2443 min 93136 min and 141183 min time intervals corresponding to the apparent speeds of 1.92.9km s 620770m s and 310500m s respectively . The disturbances with the apparent speeds of hundreds of meters per second and periods of about 1015min are transported by atmospheric gravity waves . The disturbances propagating with the 1.92.9 km s apparent speeds could be caused by ionospheric processes due to the seismic waves generated by the meteoroid explosion .

@highlight Kamchatka meteoroid of 18 December 2018 detected in Doppler spectra.
@highlight Disturbance apparent speeds 1.92.9km s 620770m s and 310500m s.
@highlight Speeds of hundreds of m s are transported by the atmospheric gravity waves.
@highlight Speeds of 1.92.9km s could be due to seismic waves launched by the airburst.
