 Solar flare forecasting is limited by the current understanding of mechanisms that govern magnetic reconnection the main physical phenomenon associated with these events . As a result forecasting relies mainly on climatological correlations to historical events rather than the underlying physics principles . Solar physics models place the neutral point of the reconnection event in the solar corona . Correspondingly studies of photospheric magnetic fields indicate changes during solar flaresparticularly in relation to the field helicityon the solar surface as a result of the associated magnetic reconnection . This study utilizes data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and SpaceWeather HMI Active Region Patches to analyze full vector field component data of the photospheric magnetic field during solar flares within a large HMI dataset . This analysis is then used to identify and compare trends in the different categories of flare strengths and determine indications of the physical phenomena taking place .

@highlight Larger flare trends differ from smaller flares underlying physics may differ.
@highlight Helicity and twist parameters are of best use to study large flare physics.
@highlight Mean vertical current density is best for forecasting small flare occurrence.
