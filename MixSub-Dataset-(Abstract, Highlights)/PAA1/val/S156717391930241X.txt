 In this study we investigated the effect of plasma treatment on an indium tin oxide film under an ambient Ar atmosphere . The sheet resistance of the plasma treated ITO film at 250W was higher than that of the as deposited ITO film . Plasma treatment was found to decrease the ITO grain size to 21.81nm in comparison with the as deposited ITO which resulted in a decrease in the Hall mobility . The work function of the Ar plasma treated ITO

@highlight We investigated the effect of Ar plasma treatment to control the barrier height for silicon heterojunction solar cells.
@highlight The lower work function was attributed to oxygen vacancies by Ar plasma in the O
@highlight peaks.
@highlight The results indicated the reduction of the work function of the ITO film resulting in an increased V
