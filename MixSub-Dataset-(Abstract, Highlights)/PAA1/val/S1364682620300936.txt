 Sudan low pressure is considered as one of the most effective systems during the rainy season in Iran . Various dry and wet periods are closely associated with the activity of this system during the rainy season as well . The present study evaluated the changes in Sudan low area during four decades which were classified based on solar cycles . The data obtained from the Meteorological Organization of Iran included daily precipitation daily rainfall from the ECMWF dataset with 1 1 spatial resolution sea level pressure and geopotential height at 1000 hPa pressure level from NCEP NCAR dataset with 2.5 2.5 spatial resolution starting and ending in March 1976 and December 2017 respectively . In addition Sudan low pressure systems were selected by navigating the route and the location trajectory of low pressure systems in SLP and the 1000 hPa pressure level maps of the rainfall days . Accordingly 160 Sudan systems were selected using the internal self assessment method . Further the impact of the rainfall system in Iran was studied utilizing the rainfall maps of ECMWF dataset . The results revealed that the sphere of the influence of the Sudan low increased during the rainy season over time . Within this period changes in the areas of influence of the Sudan system remained constant only in February compared to the last two decades while the solar cycles added to the Sudan systems in the other months of the cold spell . This result could be due to a climate change in the direction of the solar activity in the climate of Iran .

@highlight Frontal rainfalls had a significant role in the rainfall rate of other parts of the Iran.
@highlight The survey of 313 synoptic stations in Iran in four solar cycles 1976 2017 revealed that the influence domain of this system on Iran is increasing while Sudan rainfall territory remained constant only in February.
