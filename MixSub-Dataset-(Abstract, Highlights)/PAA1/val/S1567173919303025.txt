 A facile method is developed for the fabrication of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle hollow mesoporous silica spheres and explored their potential application in drug delivery . Through the self assembling process of IONPs and the formation of mesoporous silica shells the IONP HMSs with hollow interior cavity were obtained . The cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide encapsulated IONP containing spheres served as the template to establish the mesoporous silica shells . Typical anti cancer drug doxorubicin hydrochloride was applied for drug loading and release process of IONP HMSs which demonstrated the IONP HMSs have a high drug loading efficiency and allow pH trigged release of DOX

@highlight The magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle hollow mesoporous silica spheres IONP HMSs were prepared.
@highlight The fabrication method could be applied for the hollow structured composite without a template removing procedure.
@highlight The IONP HMSs served as the nanocarrier and applied in the loading and release of doxorubicin hydrochloride DOX 
@highlight The facile route of IONP HMSs could be a promising platform in the application of drug delivery and cancer therapy.
