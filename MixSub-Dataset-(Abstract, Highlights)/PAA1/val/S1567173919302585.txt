 The thermoelectric transport properties of Bi Sn and Bi Sb core shell nanowires grown by the method of on film formation of nanowires were systematically investigated . The electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of nanowires with different diameters were measured as a function of the temperature . The contribution of Sn and Sb shells to the total transport in the C S nanowires was determined using analytical fitting based on the parallel combination of the conductive system model . The carrier interface boundary scattering at the C S interface was quantitatively evaluated as the sheet resistance . In addition the effect of hole doping on the transport properties was also observed in the Bi Sn C S nanowires .
