 Analysing tropopause variability is widely acknowledged to inform the understanding of global regional warming . Tropopause variability studies are generally undertaken where radiosonde data abound . For the radiosonde data deficient South American continent taking advantage of atmospheric remote sensing using Global Navigation Satellite Systems Radio Occultation could offer the means to understand its tropopause variability . In this study 622 914 GNSS RO measurements of Challenging Minisatellite Payload Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment and Constellation Observing System for Meteorology Ionosphere Climate from 2001 to 2017 are used to analyze the annual variability patterns of tropopause heights and temperatures over South America and its relation to global teleconnections . Firstly the RO measurements are validated using atmospheric profiles for 54 radiosonde stations across the continent . The results show increased trend of 13.450

@highlight Insignificant tropopause height increase 13.45039.577m dec obtained for the 20012017 period.
@highlight Tropopause temperature slowly decreased by 0.0210.115K dec over the same period.
@highlight Significant temperature correlation 0.60 obtained from EOF1 with the ENSO 1 2.
