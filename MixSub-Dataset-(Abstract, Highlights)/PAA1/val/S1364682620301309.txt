 Aerosol plays an important role in the climate system by affecting the radiative and energy balances . Hence in this paper the spatial patterns of aerosol burden and aerosol optical properties in four the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 models over East Asia during 20012005 are compared to quantify inter model differences and to evaluate AOD simulations against observations . The evaluation of AOD against Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite retrievals shows that CMIP5 models can reproduce the spatial pattern of MODIS AOD reasonably well . The mean AOD over eastern China shows that NorESM1 M underestimates MODIS AOD by 40 due to the lack of emissions of some aerosol components such as nitrate biogenic aerosol and non desert mineral dust . In contrast to that CSIRO Mk3.6.0 overestimates annual mean of MODIS AOD over eastern China by 20 partially caused by larger aerosol emissions and burden . Compared to MODIS AOD GFDL CM3 performs the best in simulating AOD in eastern China because ammonium and nitrate are included in this model . The comparisons of CMIP5 and Aerosol Robotic Network AOD show similar results . In addition the simulated AOD values are closer to AERONET AOD in Mongolia China Japan and Korea than that in India . The results also reveal that there are some inter model differences of aerosol burden over East Asia caused by the inter model differences of aerosol emissions wet scavenging and transport . Over eastern and northwestern China and the west Pacific the inter model differences of anthropogenic aerosol burden and spatial variabilities are smaller than that of natural aerosol burden .
