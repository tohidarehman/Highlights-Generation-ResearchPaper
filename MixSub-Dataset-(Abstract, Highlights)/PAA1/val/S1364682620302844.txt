 This work studies the temporal variation of rain heights in the Sub Sahelian and Coastal regions of Nigeria using six years Tropical Rain Measuring Mission Precipitation Radar reprocessed data retrieved from the Global Precipitation Measurement constellation Satellites and Era Interim Field of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast . The research reveals seasonal temporal as well as spatial dependence of rain height over the regions . The average annual Zero Degree Isotherm Heights and rain height in the Sub Sahelian regions are 4.796km and 5.11km respectively while the corresponding values in the Coastal regions are 4.845km and 4.91km . The results show that the values recommended by the International Telecommunication Union Radio section underestimate both ZDIH and rain height . Atmospheric parameters at rain height levels were also compared with rain height . Among all the atmospheric parameters considered the result shows that variation of rain height in both regions depends strongly on temperature with a determination coefficient r

@highlight The spatio temporal variation of rain height is an important factor in the estimation of rain induced attenuation.
@highlight Study reveals that International Telecommunication Union ITU R recommendation under estimates rain heights.
@highlight The research reveals that rain height varies more proportionately with temperature than other atmospheric parameters.
@highlight The results prescribed rain heights for the study areas and modeled equations for the prediction of rain heights.
