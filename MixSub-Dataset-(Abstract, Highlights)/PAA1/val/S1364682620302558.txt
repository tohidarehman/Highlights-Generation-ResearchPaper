 Some hemispheric variation features of the near surface air and sea surface temperatures are considered . A specially designed technique of the wavelet based cross correlations is used for this purpose . In phase synchronizations of the hemispheric temperatures as whole as well as such synchronizations between land and sea temperatures are found within the timescales of one two and six seven decades . In contrast no synchronization is found within the timescales between the above indicated ones . Consideration of the afore mentioned temperatures in a long integration of the climatic model of the Marchuk Institute of Numerical Mathematics of RAS shows lack of any synchronization . However results of the Historical experiment when effects of external forces and in particular small variations of the total solar irradiation were taken into consideration reveal similar in phase synchronizations in the same timescales in which the in phase synchronizations exist in reality but during the second half of the XXth century only . Perhaps it is so because the TSI effects were taken into consideration incorrectly for the first half of the XXth century . All synchronized temperature variations lag respective TSI variations . From this one can suppose that the namely TSI variations despite their amplitudes are very small synchronize the hemispheric temperature variations .

@highlight The interhemispheric in phase synchronization of the mean land and sea temperature variations was revealed.
@highlight The existence of the interhemispheric in phase synchronization is supported by a climatic model run.
@highlight Small variations of the total solar irradiation are taken into consideration in this climatic model.
