 The present study investigates long term variation in aerosol optical properties and their associated climatic implications over selected cities of Chitral Gwadar Karachi Lahore Peshawar and Quetta in Pakistan for the period 20052018 . For this purpose aerosol optical depth and aerosol index are retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Ozone Monitoring Instrument . Results revealed annual increasing trend of AOD with maximum values in summer during the study period over all study regions except for Chitral . Similar annual trend was observed for AI but with minimum values in summer . Further temperature and relative humidity showed significant relationships with AOD along with evidences of precipitation influences . In addition the trajectory analysis of Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model confirmed the arrival of both short and long range air masses to the receptor sites . Similarly the direct aerosol radiative forcing and direct aerosol radiative forcing efficiency were calculated using Clouds and the Earth s Radiant Energy System data . The multiyear mean monthly atmospheric DARF values of 8.80 16.32 10.74 21.64 9.10 and 10.94W m

@highlight Increase in aerosol concentration was observed at the most urbanized locations.
@highlight The evidence of increasing decreasing rate of absorbing aerosols in winter summer.
@highlight The evidence of increasing intra seasonality in the direct aerosol radiative forcing.
@highlight Warming effect and associated heating rates could influence the regional climate.
