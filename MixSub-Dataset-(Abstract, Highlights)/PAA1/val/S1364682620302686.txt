 Long term forecasting of solar activity over a scale of centuries is of interest in modeling climate . Reconstructions of solar irradiance based on radionuclides span 9.4 to 11.5 millennia . There is evidence of multiple maxima and minima as well as changes in trend . Analysis of the data yields ambiguous results . Fourier spectra find long cycles in the data but these are not confirmed in the time domain . The autocorrelation function decays slowly over a period of several decades indicating that the data is probably not predictable beyond these horizons . Wavelet analysis indicates that the energy is spread out over a range of frequencies making it impossible to identify cycles at fixed periodicities . This paper tests time series and artificial intelligence models . Forecasting experiments are run over horizons ranging from 44 to 250 years . At 44 years the models do reasonably well but beyond about 88 years the models do not forecast effectively . The deterioration in accuracy is observed in all the methods tested . Despite the finding of low frequency peaks in the spectrum models incorporating long cycles do particularly badly . The failure of the models to predict at longer horizons supports the interpretation that the sun has chaotic or stochastic properties . The forecasts are consistent with simulation studies in which maxima and minima occur at irregular intervals making their timing unpredictable .
