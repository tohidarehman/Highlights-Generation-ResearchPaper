 Doping is a widely implemented strategy for enhancing the inherent electrical properties of metal oxide charge transport layers in photovoltaic devices because higher conductivity of electron transport layer can increment the photocurrent by reducing the series resistance . To improve the conductivity of ETL in this study we doped the ZnO layer with aluminum then investigated the influence of AZO on the performance of inverted bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells based on poly oxy benzo dithiophene 2 6 diyl carbonyl thieno thiophenediyl phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester PC

@highlight ZnO layer was doped with Al nitrate to improve the electron transport property.
@highlight Al doping lead the significant decrement of series resistance at the interface.
@highlight Polymer solar cells with enhanced efficiency were fabricated with Al doped ZnO layer.
