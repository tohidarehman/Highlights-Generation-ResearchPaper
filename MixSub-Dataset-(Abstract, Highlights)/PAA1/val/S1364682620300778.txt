 This study examines the response of surface layer parameters and ABL height to the change in cloudiness over Kochi . Outgoing long wave radiation is considered as a proxy for the cloudiness . Temperature horizontal wind speed vertical velocity variance sensible heat flux momentum flux turbulent kinetic energy drag coefficient and ABLH corresponding to each OLR bin are evaluated during different seasons . It is observed that the temperature response curve is similar for the pre monsoon and the monsoon . Increase in cloudiness is associated with decrease in temperature during these seasons and it is attributed to the presence of organized convections . Pre monsoon consists of organized convections as well as local convections . During post monsoon an increase in temperature is observed in association with local convections having the OLR values less than 180 Wm

@highlight Response pattern of surface parameters varies with season and synoptic systems.
@highlight Analogous response curve for surface temperature during pre monsoon and monsoon.
@highlight Similar response curve for surface wind during pre monsoon and post monsoon.
@highlight Enhanced surface fluxes and TKE with diminution in cloudiness during all seasons.
@highlight Drastic decrease increase in ABL height TKE during the passage of a depression.
