 Poly poly films were fabricated using an electrospray deposition method . The ESD PEDOT PSS films exhibited higher PSS content on the surface than spin coated PEDOT PSS films which results in a higher work function . Based on this result metal electrode free inverted organic photovoltaics were fabricated . The ESD PEDOT PSS was used as the top electrode on the poly phenyl C

@highlight PEDOT PSS films were fabricated using an electrospray deposition ESD method.
@highlight The ESD PEDOT PSS film has a higher work function than the spin coated PEDOT PSS film.
@highlight Inverted organic photovoltaics were fabricated with the ESD PEDOT PSS top electrode.
@highlight The power conversion efficiency was significantly improved with the HAT CN exciton blocking layer.
