 Apparent ionospheric reflection heights estimated using electric field waveforms of negative and positive cloud to ground lightning return strokes that occurred during the same thunderstorms have been compared . We analyzed electric field waveforms of 101 CGs and 74 CGs that were recorded in August 2016 in Florida . For daytime conditions the mean ionospheric reflection height for lightning electromagnetic pulses produced by CGs is larger than that for LEMPs produced by CGs for either first or subsequent strokes although the difference is statistically significant only for subsequent strokes . For nighttime conditions the trend is the same but the sample sizes are too small to draw meaningful conclusions . For daytime conditions the mean ionospheric reflection height for subsequent strokes in CGs is smaller than that for first strokes while for CGs the mean reflection heights for first and subsequent strokes are essentially the same . This disparity is related to the fact that subsequent strokes in CGs usually develop in the channel of the first stroke while subsequent strokes in CGs usually form new terminations on ground and hence are similar to first strokes . In our dataset NLDN reported peak currents for CGs tend to be higher than for CGs for both daytime and nighttime conditions and for either first or subsequent strokes .

@highlight In daytime the mean ionospheric reflection height for CGs is larger than that for CGs.
@highlight In nighttime the trend is the same as in daytime but the sample sizes are too small to draw meaningful conclusions.
@highlight Peak currents of CGs tend to be higher than those of CGs which could be the reason for larger reflection heights for CGs.
@highlight In daytime the mean ionospheric reflection height for subsequent strokes in CGs is smaller than that for first strokes.
@highlight For CGs the mean reflection heights for first and subsequent strokes are essentially the same.
