 Data of temperature anomalies from different sites worldwide for the last millennium are used to extract long term components in global northern and southern hemisphere temperatures for their quantitative contribution to climate change to evaluate and to search for possible causes . The Method of Global Minimum which is capable of making a self consistent selection of trends from a data set and singling out harmonics with varying phase and amplitude is applied . Quantitative description of all components of the spectra including trends extracted for the first time by self consistent method is given and discussed . Temperature trends have highest amplitude in north south hemispheres and globally that leads to their largest contribution to climate change . Trend in north hemisphere temperature described by nonstationary sinusoid at period 1270yr shows maximum near 1300 deep minimum near 1700 and rise since 1700 to present . Trend in south hemisphere has smoothed maximum for medieval epoch minimum near 1800 and rise since 1800 . Both trends go up together since 1800 but north hemisphere temperature grows faster . Trend in global temperature described by nonstationary sinusoid at period 1000yr demonstrates deep smoothed minimum near 1750 and subsequent rise with rate of increase 0.5C 100yr since 1800 . Amplitude of the nonstationary cycle began rise since 1250 and continue to rise for present and close future . Temporal changes of amplitude and phase of nonstationary spectral components have typical features of nonlinear oscillations that points to a nonlinear mechanism supporting the periodical oscillations . It is shown that the 33 yr nonstationary component in global temperature has the highest rate of change 1.2C 100yr or 0.12C 10yr which can explain rapid temperature changes . It is also shown that periods of the temperature spectra include integers of periods of historically known eclipse cycles and of periods related with motions of Jupiter Saturn and Venus . Therefore Sun and Moon Jupiter Saturn and Venus influence on climate variability . The result also means existence of high number commensurabilities between mean motions in the system Sun EarthMoon and these planets .
