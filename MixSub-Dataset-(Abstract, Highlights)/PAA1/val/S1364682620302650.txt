 This work addresses the vertical atmosphere ionosphere coupling through two cyclonic events AILA and WARD observed over the North Indian Ocean . Combined ground Digisonde Tirunelveli 8.7

@highlight Oceanic surface wind reaches maximum and increased convection observed.
@highlight Significant change in atmospheric weather.
@highlight Persistence of weak eastward northward wind in zonal meridional at stratospheric altitudes.
@highlight Reduction of foF2 and intensification of hF2.
@highlight Propagation of GWs of period 4hr to Ionospheric heights during AILA.
