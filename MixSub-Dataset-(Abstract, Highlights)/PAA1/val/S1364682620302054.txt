 In this paper an attempt has been made to investigate the impact of different microphysical parameterization schemes in simulation of leading convective line with trailing stratiform squall lines observed over the Gangetic West Bengal region of India during the pre monsoon season of MarchMay using Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting . The model is employed to study the features associated with three TS squall line observed over the study region . The model sensitivity is evaluated with four different microphysics schemes of the model . Model simulations are carried out with three two way nested domains with horizontal resolution of 18 6 and 2km grid spacing and explicit convection in the innermost domain . The model simulated results are compared with available observations . The analysis demonstrates that the simulation of TS squall lines are very sensitive to the parameterization of microphysical processes of different MP schemes in spite of using similar initial and boundary conditions and model configuration . The model provides better simulations of rainfall maximum reflectivity and vertical profiles of hydrometeors with the Morrison MP Scheme . The study reveals that snow and graupel particles has significant impacts on the simulation of stratiform precipitation region of the TS squall line . The study suggests that simulation of TS squall lines using a high resolution mesoscale model with suitable cloud microphysics scheme is useful for the prediction of such severe events .

@highlight Rearto front flow and front to rear flow is observed in the mature stage of the squall.
@highlight Vertical profile of hydrometeors mixing ratio are well comparable with observed TRMM 2A12 data.
@highlight Cloud Ice and Snow particles have positive impact in development of stratiform precipitation region.
@highlight Strong updraft is observed to persist in the region of copious amount of hydrometeors.
