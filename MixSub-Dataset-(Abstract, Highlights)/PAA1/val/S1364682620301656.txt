 The signature of the low latitude mesosphere response to the February 2017 minor sudden stratosphere warming was detected using the observations of a meteor radar at Fuke 19.5

@highlight The Fuke meteor radar along with ERA 5 were used to study the low latitude mesospheric signatures during the 2017 SSW.
@highlight Large discrepancies are found between the mesospheric winds derived from the Fuke radar and ERA 5 during the 2017 SSW.
@highlight Mesospheric wind measurements from Fuke and Tirupati radars reveal PW oscillations at low latitudes during the SSW.
@highlight ERA 5 does not capture the PW activity in the mesosphere as a meteor radar.
