 We present a brief review of observational results contributing to modern ideas on the evolution of stellar activity . Basic laws derived for both rotationage and activityrotation relationships allow us to trace how the activity of low mass stars changes with age during their stay on the main sequence . We focus on the evaluation of the activity properties of stars that could be analogs of the young Sun . Our study includes joint consideration of different tracers of activity rotation and magnetic fields of Sun like stars of various ages . We identify rotation periods when the saturated regime of activity changes to the unsaturated mode when the solar type activity is formed for G and K type stars they are 1.1 and 3.3days respectively . This corresponds to an age interval of about 0.20.6 Gyr when regular sunspot cycle began to be established on the early Sun . We discuss properties of the coronal and chromospheric activity in young Suns . Our evaluation of the EUV fluxes in the spectral range of
