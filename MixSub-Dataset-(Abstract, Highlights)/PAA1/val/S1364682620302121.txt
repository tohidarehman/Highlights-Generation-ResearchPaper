 The possibility of sporadic E layer formation in the mid latitude nighttime lower thermosphere by horizontal homogeneous and inhomogeneous winds is investigated by analytical and numerical solutions of continuity equation for dominant heavy metallic ions

@highlight Analytical investigation of ion electron convergence tendency into Es type layer under the influence of horizontal wind.
@highlight Numerical solution of the Es layer formation under the influence of horizontal wind.
@highlight Dependence of the Es layer formation and its behavior on horizontal wind direction value and its vertical shear.
@highlight Applicability of theoretical model for HWM14 and also observed horizontal wind profiles.
