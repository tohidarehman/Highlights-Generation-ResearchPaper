 Long term variations in annual frequencies of occurrence of magnetic storms with sudden and gradual commencements were studied on the base of the data from IZMIRAN and Slutsk magnetic observatories for the period 18782015 . It was found that occurrences of strong and moderate magnetic storms with gradual commencements are characterized by a pronounced variability on the multidecadal time scale . Their wavelet spectra reveal strong periodicities of 36 years as well as less pronounced 60 year and 90 year ones throughout the entire time interval under study . The occurrences of strong moderate and weak magnetic storms with sudden commencements are characterized by dominating 11 year periodicities whereas long term variations are substantially weaker . The obtained results provide evidence for a different temporal evolution of local and global solar magnetic fields responsible for solar agents contributing to the development of these types of magnetic storms . The obtained results allow suggesting a possible contribution of solar geomagnetic activity to the formation of climatic oscillations on the multidecadal time scale .

@highlight Magnetic storms with sudden SC and gradual GC commencements show different temporal variability.
@highlight Occurrence of SC magnetic storms is characterized by strong 11 year periodicity.
@highlight Occurrence of GC magnetic storms reveals noticeable long term variations with periods from 30 to 100 years.
@highlight Characteristic feature of GC storms is a dominant 36 year periodicity close to the Brckner cycle.
