 The interannual variability of the total ozone in the equatorial region has been studied using the satellite daily and monthly data in 19782018 . The coupling of the equatorial TOZ changes to the quasi biennial oscillation of the zonal wind in the equatorial stratosphere has long been known . However the detailed analysis of the daily deseasonalized TOZ data over the course of 15 complete wind QBO cycles convincingly showed some new important features of the ozone QBO . The key points of the equatorial TOZ variations are clearly linked with the certain time moments during the downward propagation from 10 to 70hPa of the easterly and westerly regimes of the wind QBO . The equatorial TOZ distinctly maximizes when the westerly regime reaches 70hPa and the easterly regime appears at 10hPa which occur simultaneously . The times of minima of the equatorial TOZ are less obvious due to the westerly regime appearance at 10hPa on the background of the unfinished descent of the easterly regime . Furthermore the seasonal regularities of the wind QBO causes the seasonal dependence of the ozone QBO in the equatorial region . Maxima of the equatorial TOZ are definitely observed near solstice months . This result contradicts to the general belief about lack of the seasonal synchronization of the equatorial ozone QBO in contrast to the seasonally synchronized extratropical ozone . However the coincidence of the equatorial TOZ maxima with solstices and consequently their recurrence every 2 or 2.5 years allow a prediction of the equatorial TOZ based on the long term forecast of the wind QBO . The ozone QBO forecast for subsequent about two years is presented .

@highlight Contrary to general belief QBO in equatorial total ozone clearly depends on season.
@highlight Seasonal features of equatorial ozone QBO are resulted from dependence on wind QBO.
@highlight Maxima of equatorial ozone QBO are observed near solstice months June or December .
@highlight Relation of maxima with solstices leads to their recurrence every 2 or 2.5 years.
@highlight The seasonal dependence allows a long term forecasting of equatorial total ozone.
