 The secular variation spatial pattern of geomagnetic cutoff rigidity Rc is analyzed considering analytical expressions . Strmer analytic Rc equation in terms of geomagnetic latitude is used considering a pure dipolar field for the centered and eccentric dipole coordinates together with a dipole quadrupole superposition simplified equation . Linear Rc time trend for the period 19002020 in a 515 latitude longitude grid is assessed in each case and a comparative analysis is made with trends based on trajectory based Rc estimations . Common features with some analytic approaches are the two patches of Rc positive and negative trends in the western hemisphere even though maximum and minimum trend values are underestimated in all analytical cases . Global mean values are almost coincident except for the dipole quadrupole superposition case . The salient patches pattern may be due mainly to the dipole axis rotation more than to its center displacement its decreasing momentum or the increasing quadrupolar component role . Even though with the advent of better computational tools the trajectory based estimation would be a natural choice to analyze Rc variations we still consider that an appropriatelymodified Strmer equation with its natural advantages of its analytical form and extremely fast way of computation is sufficient for many applications .
