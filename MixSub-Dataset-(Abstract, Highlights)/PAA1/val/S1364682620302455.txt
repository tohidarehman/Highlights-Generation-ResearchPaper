 An attempt has been made to understand the effect of the cirrus clouds on the tropical tropopause thermal structure over a tropical station Gadanki 13.45

@highlight Using radiosonde and CALIPSO observations we report the qualitative estimates of cirrus clouds effect on the tropical tropopause.
@highlight Presence of tropopause cirrus clouds observed to be altering the temperature gradient in the tropopause region.
@highlight For the tropopause cirrus cases CPT becomes warmer by 1.2K COT rises by 0.8km TTL thickness temperature decreases increases by 0.9km 2.2K with increase in the cloud optical thickness and cloud radiative forcing.
@highlight However TTL becomes relatively colder and thicker for the cirrus clouds occurring below the tropopause.
