 Stable auroral red arcs are the consequence of interaction of the outer plasmasphere with energetic ions of the ring current . In this work the event of SAR arc observation using the all sky imager at the Yakutsk meridian simultaneously with the registration of plasmapause and energetic ion fluxes aboard the Van Allen Probe B satellite at the beginning of the large magnetic storm on March 17 2015 is presented . ASI registers the intense SAR arc at the 52 59N geomagnetic latitudes in the MLT evening sector from the observation start at 1116 UT during the low auroral activity at IMF Bz 0 . The Probe B determines the plasmapause location in the L 34 interval and registers the inner boundary of the H

@highlight SAR arc observation due to the ring current overlap with the plasmapause is presented.
@highlight Polarward edge of arc maps the plasmasphere boundary in the dusk bulge sector.
@highlight Equatorward edge of arc maps the inner boundary of the energetic ions flux.
@highlight The energetic ions O
@highlight flux significantly exceeds the energetic protons flux.
