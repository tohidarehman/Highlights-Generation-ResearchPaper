 In this study we discuss a method to embed PEDOT PSS into DNA with a designated concentration of PEDOT PSS and construction of PEDOT PSS embedded DNA thin films . In order to shed light on the interaction between PEDOT PSS and DNA optical spectroscopy measurements were performed . DNA PEDOT PSS thin films showed a broad absorption band around 800nm which was associated with PEDOT PSS . The electrical properties of DNA PEDOT PSS thin films were assessed . A significant enhancement in current for DNA PEDOT PSS thin films DNA was observed which agreed with the decrement in band gap of DNA PEDOT PSS thin films . For the energy storage capability and dielectric constant of DNA PEDOT PSS thin films capacitance measurements were conducted . Frequency dependent capacitance indicated enhancement in the capacitance and dielectric constant by electric polarization of PEDOT PSS in a DNA thin film . Our approach may assist in development of various biosensors and electronic devices with specific functionalities based on biomaterials and conducting polymer complexes .
