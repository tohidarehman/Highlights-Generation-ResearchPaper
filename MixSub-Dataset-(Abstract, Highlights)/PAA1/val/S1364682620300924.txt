 An extreme rainfall event that made major calamity over the Indian peninsula region has been investigated with a focus on the physics of the cloud system as indicated from the multi satellite observations ground based radar and model forecast experiments . The vertical structure of clouds showed deep convective cores embedded in the stratiform and is dominated by warm and mixed phase clouds . Model output indicates that moisture convergence was present in two episodes before both heavy rainfall events and can be used as a precursor for the imminent heavy rainfall . It is the sustenance of high winds and availability of moisture content that contributed to the development of deep convective cloud bands which propagated inland perpendicular to the coastline . These cloud systems produced deep convective cores with a deep supersaturated layer throughout the middle and upper atmosphere introduced a significant amount of supercooled liquid water which facilitated mixed phase clouds . These cloud liquid drops at supercooled temperatures facilitated the production of more ice hydrometeors on freezing . The rapid growth of hydrometeors through riming and aggregation in the mixed phase region lead to heavy and sustained precipitation . The sustenance of the system is also due to the enhanced latent heating over Western Ghats that supported low level moisture convergence in a strongly sheared environment . Documented evidence from this study suggests that the heavy precipitation was a result of the convective cluster as illustrated through satellite observations and numerical simulations .
