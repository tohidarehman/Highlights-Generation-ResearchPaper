 For detection of rather large ionospheric structures using Global Navigation Satellite Systems we suggest employing the analysis of anomalous deviations in behavior of the absolute slant total electron content on particular GNSS receiver GNSS satellite lines of sight . Using data of four high latitude GNSS stations the proposed method allowed us to detect the 5 May 2013 high latitude ionospheric trough determine its location and size and follow the dynamics . The HLIT was located on the dayside within 25 185E . Initially the HLIT equatorial wall and bottom were within 68 78N and 70 80N respectively . The trough northern wall was not registered at this time most likely due to insufficient number of LOSs . During the next hour the trough has moved 2 4 southward . Its bottom lay near 68 76N equatorial and polar walls were within 67 74N and 77 78N respectively . The trough width was about 4 . At 07 0008 00 UT the HLIT structure and location remained almost the same . To interpret the observation results we used the model for ionosphere plasmasphere coupling to simulate the high latitude ionosphere conditions on 46 May 2013 . This simulation showed that on 5 May 2013 a high latitude trough was formed on the dayside at 40 200E and 78 85N . The most likely reason for the formation of HLIT both in model calculations and in reality was a change in the magnetospheric convection in the high latitude ionosphere caused by the moderate geomagnetic disturbances on 45 May 2013 . The trough location determined from the analysis of anomalous TEC deviations on particular LOSs was in good agreement with location of the high latitude ionospheric trough obtained from numerical simulation . Thus the analysis of anomalous deviations in TEC behavior on particular LOSs expands the GNSS potential in detecting large scale irregularities in the ionosphere .
