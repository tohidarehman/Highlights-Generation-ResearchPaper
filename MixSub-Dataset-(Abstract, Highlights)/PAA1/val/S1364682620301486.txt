 Meteorological processes such as tides influence ionospheric variability through vertical coupling . For the first time we have used data from Communication Navigation Outage and Forecasting System satellite from 20082015 to develop a Neural Network vertical

@highlight A model of vertical
@highlight drift taking into account a proxy of tides has been developed based on C NOFS satellite data.
@highlight In most cases the developed models reproduce the diurnal patterns of vertical
@highlight drifts including the expected pre reversal enhancement.
@highlight Inclusion of tides proxy improves vertical
@highlight drift modelling by 22.2 and 16.7 over the East and West African sectors respectively.
