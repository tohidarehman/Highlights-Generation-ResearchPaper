 To perform network RTK positioning a user must receive and apply the information generated from a network . Corrections are generated for the user to consider the atmospheric delays between ther location and the network stations . In order to generate reliable corrections and send them to users one must resolve the ambiguities in the processing step of the network stations . Ambiguities are the number of integer cycles of the carrier phase in the first data collection epoch and are introduced as parameters to be estimated in the processing . Thus the ambiguity resolution process becomes a prerequisite for obtaining high accuracy in network RTK positioning . This process can be divided into two steps estimation and validation . The estimation step aims to obtain the integer values of ambiguities and in the validation step it is inferred if the estimated integer value may or may not be accepted . In this work the LAMBDA method was used to obtain the integer ambiguity estimate and for the validation the Ratio and FF RT tests were used . The objective of this work was to investigate the performance of the ambiguities validation tests for long baselines . The results showed that the FF RT test presented the highest fixed ambiguity percentages when compared to the Ratio test in all analyzed periods . Thus for long baselines positioning in periods of either weak or strong ionospheric activity the use of the FF RT test will cause a greater number of fixed ambiguities to be used in the process of generating the corrections for the user .
