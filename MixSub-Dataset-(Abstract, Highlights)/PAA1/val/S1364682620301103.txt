 Daytime oxygen airglow emission rate variability provides us with a means of remote investigations of the upper atmospheric behavior . Dayglow emission rates typically show a diurnal pattern with a peak at around noon especially during geomagnetic quiet conditions . The photochemical and empirical models show that the emission rates typically vary as a function of solar zenith angle and solar flux . Thus both larger solar flux magnitudes and smaller solar zenith angles contribute to larger dayglow emission rates as the yield of excited oxygen atoms is expected to be greater in those conditions . However variability in the annual dayglow emission rates obtained from measurements at low latitudes Hyderabad India 17

@highlight Annual OI 630.0nm dayglow emission rate variations over low and mid latitudes are presented.
@highlight The dayglow emission variability at low and equatorial latitudes primarily depends on solar zenith angle and solar flux.
@highlight Mid latitude dayglow emission variability depends strongly on the variability of oxygen to molecular nitrogen ratio.
@highlight O N
@highlight values are empirically simulated as a function of day of the year and latitude to assess the compositional variations.
