 The property changes of polymeric films upon degradation are important to develop strategies to prolong the device lifetimes . In this regard we investigated the effects of ultraviolet ozone treatment on the electronic structures of poly 9 9 dioctylfluorene

@highlight Electronic structures of F8BT and PFO films under UVO treatment were studied.
@highlight UVO treatments of F8BT and PFO induce oxidation and thickness decrease.
@highlight The oxidation deteriorates the optoelectronic properties of polymeric films.
