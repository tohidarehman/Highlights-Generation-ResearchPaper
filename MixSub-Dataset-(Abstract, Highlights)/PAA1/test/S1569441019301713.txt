 A Si based vertical nanowire heterostructure array photodetector is designed and studied by a coupled three dimensional optoelectronic simulation . Each nanowire is composed of an InP In

@highlight A Si based nanowire array photodetector is proposed and studied systematically.
@highlight The peak absorption wavelength is fixed at 1550nm.
@highlight A remarkable responsivity beyond 0.8 A W is obtained.
