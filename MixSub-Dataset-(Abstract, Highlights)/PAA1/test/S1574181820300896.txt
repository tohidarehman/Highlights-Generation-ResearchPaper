 We investigated radiation damages induced by irradiating ions in a particle accelerator for a heavy ion inertial fusion system because the radio activation is an unavoidable issue to realize the future HIF power plant . In this study we estimated the radio activation at each part of the HIF accelerator . An evaluation using collisions due to Coulomb barrier gives the safer estimation in the radio activation of the vacuum vessel wall . The estimation results of total cross sections of nuclear reactions between an incident ion and wall elements showed the potential radio activation parts in the HIF accelerator . We indicated that schematic layouts of two types of HIF accelerators with the nuclear reaction cross section and the activated area for the HIF accelerator was evaluated .

@highlight Evaluation for radiation damages in a particle accelerator complex is important for an inertial confinement fusion system driven by heavy ion beams from the viewpoint of social acceptance.
@highlight Effect of radiation damages is estimated by collision due to Coulomb barrier and reaction cross sections between incident ions and chamber wall materials for each part of particle accelerator.
@highlight Activated area is indicated by schematic layouts with cross sections for particle accelerator in the inertial confinement fusion driven by heavy ion beams.
