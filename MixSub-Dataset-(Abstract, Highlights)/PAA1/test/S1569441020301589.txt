 The design flexibility of Hollow Core Photonic Crystal Fibres is a significant feature that allows the fibres to achieve excellent optical properties . Changes in the design parameters of HC PCFs used for gas sensing can affect their optical and gas flow properties . The aim of this paper is to investigate the performance of three HC PCFs with different geometries in terms of their optical mode and gas flow performance . The numerical model for the optical mode analysis is presented . The optical performance of three HC PCFs is examined at different wavelengths in terms of their effective refractive index mode field diameter confinement loss and relative sensitivity . The numerical model for gas flow simulations based on Navier Stokes and gas diffusion equations is also presented . This model is used to examine the gas velocity relative average concentration volumetric flow rate and gas filling time for three different HC PCFs and three different gases . A series of gas sensing experiments based on pulsed continuous wave modulated photothermal spectroscopy is conducted to validate the gas flow numerical model . A comparison between the three HC PCFs indicates that the HC PCF with the smallest size is associated with the lowest confinement loss but the highest gas filling time .
