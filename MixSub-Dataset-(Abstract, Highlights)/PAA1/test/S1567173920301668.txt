 A Carbon quantum dots supported ZnO hollow Sphere were synthesized through a solvothermal method using polyethylene glycol 400 as a solvent . The phase and crystal structure of as prepared ZnO C dots photocatalyst were characterized by powder X ray diffraction . The surface morphology and size of the composite were analyzed using field emission scanning microscopy . The optical properties of the as prepared nanocomposites were examined using UVvisible spectrometer . The photocatalytic activity of pure ZnO and ZnO C dots nanocomposites were evaluated by the degradation of methylene blue under UVVisible light irradiation . The ZnO C dots nanocomposites exhibited maximum photocatalytic MB dye degradation efficiency of 96 which is much higher that the pure ZnO . The enhanced photocatalytic activity of ZnO C dots is due to the extended light absorption in the visible region and suppressed photoexcited electron hole pair recombination rate . Moreover the activity of photocatalyst after five cycles exhibits high stability which is vital for the sustainable photocatalytic procedures . It is concluded that the prepared ZnO C dots composite have low cost good stability and has a great potential application for Photocatalytic dye degradation .
