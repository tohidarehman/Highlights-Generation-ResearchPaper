 In this study a pyramid AgFe embedded graphene oxide nanocomposite was synthesized and characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy and ultravioletvisible spectroscopy . FESEM images indicated the successful synthesis of exfoliated graphene sheets with a thickness of 7 nm 30 nm Fe nanoparticles and pyramid Ag nanostructures where the sides measured from 100 nm to 600 nm . UVvis analysis detected plasmon bands at 700 nm and 914 nm for PAFG . EDS analysis confirmed the presence of elemental Ag and C. Two PAFG phases were obtained after centrifugation which were designated as PAFG1 and PAFG2 . Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy analyses showed that the rhodamine 6G peaks with PAFG1 were 1.75 times larger than those with trinitrotoluene and 1.7 times larger than those with pyrene . SERS analysis of TNT with PAFG2 obtained 1.49 and 1.3 times greater peaks compared with those using pyrene and R6G respectively . On average the performance was around 1.4 times better with PAFG2 for each of the analytes . Measurements of the SERS spectra for TNT and pyrene with annealed PAFG showed that the enhancement factors were 2.2 and 1.7 for the M TNT and pyrene samples respectively . Comparisons of the SERS spectra obtained for mM samples of the three analytes with annealed PAFG showed that the EFs were over three times higher than that with R6G .
