 Based on a two level system the linear and third order nonlinear optical properties are analyzed for CdSe ZnTe spherical core shell quantum dots embedded in various dielectric matrices including poly vinyl alcohol polyethylene and silicon nitride . Our results reveal that by increasing core shell radii ratio the eigenenergies as well as the transition energy decreased . The presence of the dielectric mismatch in the quantum dot matrix system can cause significant enhancement of the linear and third order nonlinear optical susceptibilities . We believe that our findings offer a new degree of freedom in optoelectronic device applications .
