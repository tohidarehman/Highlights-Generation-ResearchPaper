 The key objective of this study is to investigate the local mismatch of pre and post multilayer structure on the active devices . Five pre and post multilayer structure pHEMTs on the same wafer within the same cell between adjacent devices are considered . As the study of local mismatch ensures good yields and a way to gain insights about the technology various comparisons are made including the effects of multilayer structuring . The threshold voltage built in potential and the net doping concentration of the 2 DEG of the devices are extracted through capacitance voltage data . The underlying electrical parameter of the transistors as well as the RF figure of merit has been analyzed . The microwave noise related parameters namely minimum noise figure associate gain noise resistance magnitude of the optimum reflection are also discussed and investigated . Centre to edge mismatch results in minor variation in performance between devices . These studies would help within the advancement of solid proficient and low cost generation of future compact structure in 3 D multilayer MMICs .
