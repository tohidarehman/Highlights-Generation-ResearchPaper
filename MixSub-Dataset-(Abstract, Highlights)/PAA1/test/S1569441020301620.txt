 We propose a novel analytical model for anisotropic multi layer cylindrical structures containing graphene layers . The general structure is formed by the aperiodic repetition of a three layer sub structure where a graphene layer with isotropic surface conductivity of is sandwiched between two adjacent magnetic materials . Each anisotropic material has permittivity and permeability tensors of
