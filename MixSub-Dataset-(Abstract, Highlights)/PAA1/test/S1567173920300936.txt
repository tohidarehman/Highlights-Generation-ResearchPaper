 Among the conventional metallic inks used in the printing process silver exhibits high conductivity and thermal stability . Nevertheless due to the high cost of silver it can not be extensively used for the fabrication of inks . As a competitive alternative copper can be considered as a substitute for silver however copper ink oxidizes under certain atmospheric conditions . To meet these shortcomings a cost effective highly conductive and oxidation free copper based ink has been synthesized in this study wherein oxidation of the copper particles in the copper based ink was prevented by using copper complexes . The copper ink thus fabricated was printed on chemically treated Si SiO
