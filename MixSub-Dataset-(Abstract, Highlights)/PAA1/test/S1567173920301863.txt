 The gate induced drain leakage effect in negative capacitance FinFET is investigated . A LandauGinzburgDevonshire equation is used to estimate the characteristics of the NC FinFET . Specifically metal ferroelectric metal insulator semiconductor and metal ferroelectric insulator semiconductor NC FinFETs are compared in order to figure out the effect of the internal metal layer on the GIDL effect . To analyze the impact of the polarization gradient on the GIDL effect in NC FinFET a polarization gradient coefficient is varied . For MFMIS the polarization gradient doesn t significantly affect the device performance . The subthreshold swing improves but the GIDL effect deteriorates because of the uniform NC effect in channel region . For MFIS the device performance is explicitly affected by the polarization gradient . Smaller polarization gradients result in non uniform NC effect in channel region resulting in severe GIDL effects . On the other hand higher polarization gradients alleviate GIDL effects .

@highlight Impact of the polarization gradient coefficient on the gate induced drain leakage GIDL effect in NC FinFET is investigated.
@highlight In case of MFIS NC FinFET which has a high polarization gradient coefficient the GIDL effect can be alleviated.
@highlight In case of MFMIS NC FinFET the GIDL effect has deteriorated than baseline FinFET because of the internal metal layer.
