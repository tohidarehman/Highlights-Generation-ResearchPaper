 Herein a two dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation has been performed to understand the MHD and the generated magnetic field behaviors of a capacitor coil target . The results showed that a peak B field strength was generated in the capacitor coil target followed by a current peak . This B field depends on a peak current with a pulse duration of 2ns . For a peak current of 2ns the average B field in the capacitor coil target is estimated by the center of the B field from the conventional circular current . The time difference between the peak current and the generated B field is up to 2ns . Furthermore the time difference of the capacitor coil target corresponds to the inductance and resistance of the capacitor coil target . Overall the results suggests that a longer laser pulse will improve the strength of B field generated by the capacitor coil target .

@highlight The results showed that a peak B field strength was generated in the capacitor coil target followed by a current peak.
@highlight The time difference between the peak current and the generated B field was up to 2 ns. In addition the time difference of the capacitor coil target corresponded to the inductance and resistance of the capacitor coil target. These results suggested that a longer laser pulse was required to improve the B field generated by the capacitor coil target.
