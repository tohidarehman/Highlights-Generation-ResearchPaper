 Cauliflower shape nanostructured Cs doped CdO thin films were grown using perfume atomizer . A strong preferential orientation is noticed for the cubic structured CdO Cs thin films . Surface morphology of CdO was strongly influenced with Cs doping . All the doped films exhibit better transparency than pure CdO . With Cs doping the absorption edge seems to shift towards lower wave lengths . The 2wt . Cs doped CdO thin film exhibits a minimum resistivity of 0.9510

@highlight Perfume atomizer is used to synthesize CdO Cs thin films.
@highlight Increased transparency was observed for the Cs doped CdO films.
@highlight Electrical resistivity of CdO decreased with Cs doping.
@highlight Enhanced Haackees quality factor was observed for the doped films.
