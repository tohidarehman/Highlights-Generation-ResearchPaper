 In the present study the effect of dimensions of gold nanorods on its sensing property to detect liquid ammonia was reported . Gold nanorods with two different aspect ratios derived from different lengths and diameters were synthesized using seed mediated growth method and the aspect ratio was controlled by changing the silver ion concentration in growth solution . The morphological and size measurement was performed using Transmission Electron Microscopy and the average value of aspect ratio was found to be 3.0 and 3.2 for GNR1 and GNR2 respectively . The characteristics transverse and longitudinal mode of localized surface plasmon resonance have been clearly depicted in UVvis absorption spectrum of both GNR1 and GNR2 . The red shift in longitudinal mode of LSPR from 718 to 732nm has been observed for GNR with change in aspect ratio from 3.0 to 3.2 respectively . These samples of GNR were tested for liquid ammonia sensing with concentration ranging from 100 to 500ppm . A clear cut blue shift in longitudinal mode of LSPR of prepared gold nanorod was observed . However the GNR2 was found to be more sensitive toward liquid ammonia sensing . The origin of such blue shifting and sensitivity of longitudinal mode of LSPR of gold nanorod was explained on the basis of orientation dependence and Dipolar Exciton Coupling Model of coupled plasmon in assemblies of anisotropic plasmonic nanoparticles . With the help of this model blue shifting in longitudinal plasmon band was correlated with the enhanced formation of H aggregation induced by dipolar coupling of GNR clusters followed by hydrogen bonding after successive addition of ammonia solution .
