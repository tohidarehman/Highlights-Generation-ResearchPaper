 The optical properties of a two dimensional gold nanoparticle over nanosheet have been studied using Finite Difference Time Domain method . 2D AuNP NS hybrid structure exhibits three typical localized surface plasmon resonances which occur in nanogaps between NP NP NP NS and coupled upper and lower surface of NS respectively . Thus the influence of AuNP size surface AuNP coverage NP NP spacing and NS thickness on the localized electric field was analyzed in details . The LSP resonance between NP NS has been predicted to be the most important effect on SERS which is dominant stable and can maintain the SERS intensity even at a relatively low NP coverage . If a slight deviation of AuNPs away from their original periodic positions was permitted a disordered model was then constructed which would more closely approximate the real AuNP NS hybrid structure and was able to calculate the influence of disorder on LSP resonance . A blue shift of the resonance peak was observed and its peak intensity would increase first and decrease then with the increase of NP NP spacing . FDTD simulations have finally illustrated that NP coverage should be controlled ranging from 80.0 to 87.0 or just equal to 100 if both AuNP size and NP thickness is controlled to 10nm . The FDTD simulation results are qualitative agreement with the existing experimental data and are very useful in the future materials designs for AuNS based nanocomposite .
