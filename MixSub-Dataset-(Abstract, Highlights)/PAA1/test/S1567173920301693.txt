 A high speed residue free transfer method using PDMS stamp and water infiltration between graphene and a hydrophilic surface is reported . Monolayer graphene was transferred from an enhanced fluorinated Al

@highlight High speed residue free transfer using UV hardened PDMS stamp combined with increased water infiltration.
@highlight CF
@highlight  O
@highlight plasma treatment enhanced hydrophilicity of Al
@highlight over a SiO
@highlight Enhanced water infiltration boosted the separation of graphene from the substrate with the increased hydrophilicity.
@highlight UV treatment of PDMS reduced the residues of transferred graphene.
