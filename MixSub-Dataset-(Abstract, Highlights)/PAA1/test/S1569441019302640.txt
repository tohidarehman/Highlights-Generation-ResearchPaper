 We design a novel eight channel demultiplexer in a solid fluid phononic crystal structure . The basic structure has been formed by square arrangement of holes filled by water in tungsten background . These holes are embedded in background with filling fraction of 46 . Generally the proposed structure consists of nine type line defects for input and output channels . These line defects consist of two types of hollow cylinders . One of them is used in input channel and the other creates output channels . Input waveguide contains an L branch waveguide which has been made by a row of hollow cylinders of water which is internally filled with tungsten . Each of output channels contains a row of hollow cylinders of Methyl Nonafluorobutyl Ether filled with tungsten . Hollow cylinders have different inner radii in each output waveguides . Hence each output channels can transmit diverse narrow frequency passbands . We use the finite element method to determine the eigenfrequencies of structure . This structure can separate eight acoustic waves in frequency range between 166.6 kHz and 168.1 kHz . Separation of frequencies is accomplished with high quality factor and the width of frequency spectra between outputs are about 200 Hz . Crosstalk values of the proposed structure show that the eight channel demultiplexer has efficient performance so that the worst case of crosstalk value is equal to 26.68 dB .
