 High power laser systems are an attractive driver for compact energetic ion sources . We demonstrate repetitive acceleration at 0.1Hz of proton beams up to 40MeV from a reeled tape target irradiated by ultra high intensities up to 510

@highlight Developed high energy repetitive laser driven proton source up to 40 MeV.
@highlight Demonstrated the stability of the source over 30 shots.
@highlight Investigated the effect of changing laser focal spot size on flux.
@highlight Showed that using thinner targets can increase maximum proton energy and flux.
