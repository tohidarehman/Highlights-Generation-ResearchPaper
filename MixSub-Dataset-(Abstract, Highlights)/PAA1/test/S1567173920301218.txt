 Thickness influence on structural optical and electrical properties of sputtered indium tin oxide with thickness ranging from 60 up to 430nm films has been studied . At the increase of the film thickness crystallinity degree and grain size increased whereas tensile structural distortion as well as resistivity decreased . It was observed that a microstructure evolution takes place the initial amorphous layer evolved in polycrystalline phase with a grainsubgrain surface morphology . Carrier concentration increased at the increase of the film thickness and a general relationship between electrical characteristics and structural distortion has been found . In thinner films larger tensile distortion allowed to include larger amount of interstitial O and or Sn atoms in the lattice . An appreciable impact of the thickness was also observed on electro optical properties in terms of changes in energy gap resistivity and optical absorption . Silicon heterojunction solar cells have been produced and J

@highlight ITO films with different thicknesses have been deposited by RF sputtering at room temperature on c Si and glass substrates.
@highlight Structural and electro optical properties strongly depend on ITO film thickness.
@highlight Microstructure evolution takes place at the film thickness increase giving improvement of film crystallinity.
@highlight A relationship between lattice distortion and charge carrier density has been established.
@highlight Optimized ITO thickness in terms of antireflective properties gives the highest Jsc value in heterojunction solar cells.
