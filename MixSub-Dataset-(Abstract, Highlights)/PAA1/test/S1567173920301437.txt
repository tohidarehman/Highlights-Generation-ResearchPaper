 Biomimetic inspiration from the moth eye structure has led to many studies combining nanoimprint lithography to realize low cost and large area anti reflection coatings . However the scope of application is severely limited by poor mechanical performance due to the intrinsic properties of the coating materials and the nanosized patterns . In this work we demonstrate a moth eye structured epoxy siloxane molecular hybrid fabricated using single UV based NIL on a colorless polyimide to be utilized as a flexible cover window for foldable displays . Low reflection a superhydrophobicity and good inward foldability were achieved together with excellent thermal and chemical resistance . Furthermore in situ uniaxial compression tests revealed that the fabricated structure can be elastically deformed and nearly restored to its original shape even after a large degree of compression . Our findings provide an easy to integrate solution for flexible hard coatings with superhydrophobic and AR properties applicable to foldable optoelectronics .
