 Tungsten oxide is an electrochromic material from which thin films are conventionally fabricated via heat treatment . Here we develop a flash light sintering method to reduce sintering time sintering delivers instantaneous photon energy created via the photothermal effect . The electrochromic efficiency of device with a flash light sintered electrode was 88.50cm
