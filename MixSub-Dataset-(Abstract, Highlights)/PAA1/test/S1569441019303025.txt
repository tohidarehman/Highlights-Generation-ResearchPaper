 Visible light active photocatalytic processes have gained much interest in removing the organic pollutants from wastewater . In this article we report the ZnO prepared by a simple co precipitation method and characterized by PXRD FE SEM TEM DRS and FTIR . The photocatalytic activity of ZnO assisted by H

@highlight ZnO nanostructures for visible light directed photodegradation of crystal violet.
@highlight Photocatalytic degradation of CV under alkaline pH exhibited higher rate of degradation.
@highlight The ZnO showed good and adequate degradation efficiency after various usage cycles.
