 Muscovite mica is a widely accepted substrate for scanning probe microscopy investigations . However mica has intrinsic properties that alter samples and obstruct their analysis due to free charges build up ionic exchange and water adsorption taking place at the surface . In addition to interfacial phenomena there is a growing interest in electrostatic charges on insulators as they are crucial in diverse applications . Despite the high demand for studies of this nature experimental set ups capable of resolving charge build up at the micro scale are still scarce and technically limited . Here we report the imaging of surface charge dissipation on freshly cleaved mica by Kelvin probe Force Microscopy . A local electrostatic charge micro domain was generated by friction between an atomic force microscope tip and mica and its decay was tracked by two dimensional mapping using KPFM . We found time dependent charge dissipation which is attributed to the adsorption of water molecules on mica surface .
