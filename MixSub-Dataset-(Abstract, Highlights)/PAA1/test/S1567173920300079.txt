 Van der Waals layered transition metal dichalcogenides as atomically flat two dimensional materials have been studied extensively in both fundamental science and application fields in recent years . The reduced dimensional properties of TMDCs not only provide a route for the fabricating of efficient field effect transistors and optoelectronic devices but also suggest the possibility of the devices that utilize quantum coherency . In this work we characterize the electron transport properties of ReS

@highlight We have measured low temperature electron transport properties of few layered ReS
@highlight We have observed clear conductance fluctuation associated with coherent electron transport.
@highlight Our study suggests the possibilities of realization of quantum devices based on transition metal dichalcogenide TMDC .
