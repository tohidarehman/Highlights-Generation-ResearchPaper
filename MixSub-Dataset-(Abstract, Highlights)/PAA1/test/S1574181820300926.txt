 A combination of CR 39 track detectors and a stepwise energy filter is a simple method to measure the energy spectrum of laser accelerated protons . The number of etch pits in each area of the CR 39 detector is expected to represent the energy spectrum because the different thicknesses of the filters result in different areas into which the energy reaches in CR 39 . However the higher energy regions may overlap depending on the sensitivity of CR 39 . To avoid overlapping i.e . overestimation of the number of etch pits for each energy region a correction method for the energy spectrum from the number of etch pits was developed . Based on the calculation results of the reaching energy values and incident energy ranges for CR 39 etch pits are selected that should be counted in each area . CR 39 with stepwise energy filters provides a corrected energy spectrum of laser accelerated protons by applying the developed method .

@highlight Laser accelerated protons from hydrogen cluster targets were measured by a combination of CR 39 track detector and a stepwise energy filter.
@highlight The correction method for the energy spectrum from the number of etch pits was developed to avoid overestimation of the number of etch pits for each energy region.
@highlight The combination of the detector unit and the developed correction method allows us to evaluate the energy spectrum of laser accelerated protons.
