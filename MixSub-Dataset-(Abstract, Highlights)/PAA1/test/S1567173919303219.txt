 Zinc oxide is a commonly used electron transport layer in quantum dot light emitting diodes . In this study we used a highly conductive ZnO film via a low temperature process to improve the electron transport behavior of the QLEDs . The electron transport behavior of ZnO film was investigated from the electron only device and the origin of high conductivity was figured out using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy . We found that the oxygen vacancy which can improve the carrier transport in ZnO film was increased according to reduce the process temperature of ZnO . Meanwhile the hydroxyl group which contribute to the quenching effect was decreased according to reduce the process temperature of ZnO . Therefore high performance QLEDs were fabricated using the low temperature processed ZnO and it showed an improved luminance and current efficiency in a full current range . The maximum luminance and current efficiency of the devices were measured as 65 391 Cd m
