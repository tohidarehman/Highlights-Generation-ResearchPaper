 The transient photocurrent technique was performed to explore the dynamics of excitons and carriers at organic active layer buffer layer interfaces . A special device with ITO PEIE NPB C

@highlight The dynamic process of excitons and carriers were explored by TPC.
@highlight The polarity of the TPC changes from negative to positive.
@highlight Changes in polarity shows NPB facilitates hole extraction and exciton dissociation.
