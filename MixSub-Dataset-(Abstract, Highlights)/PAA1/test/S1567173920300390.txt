 H nuclear magnetic resonance measurements have been performed to study the proton dynamics associated with the antiferroelectric transition of a hydrogen bonded single crystal of CsH

@highlight H NMR spectrum shift linewidth and
@highlight were measured to study proton dynamics along the antiferroelectric transition.
@highlight The spectrum showed a composite structure which was deconvoluted into five or six peaks based on the number of proton sites.
@highlight By estimating the chemical shift and linewidth we can identify all the peaks from the six proton sites.
@highlight From
@highlight and
@highlight vs.
@highlight  the activation energies of proton motion are found to be respectively 1.16and 0.83kJ mol.
@highlight Although NMR shift and linewidth data show no evidence 
@highlight highlights a clear increase as a signature across
