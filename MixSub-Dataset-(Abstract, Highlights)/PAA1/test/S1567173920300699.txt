 We report a cobalt ferrite nanorods based magnetically tunable spur line notch filter where vertically aligned CFO NRs has been grown on silver nanoparticles coated silicon substrate . The CFO NRs are coupled with high frequency spur line bandstop filter in flip chip configuration and the device showed excellent tunable microwave properties in the presence of a low bias magnetic field . The center frequency of the tunable filter is 16.4GHz which is shifted to 14.9GHz with 8.7 tunability by applying bias magnetic field 320Oe . The magnetic field tuning of the center frequency is explained on the basis of the change in permeability value of the CFO NRs with bias magnetic field as the NRs are used in the partially magnetized state . For validation permeability value is also calculated by using numerical equations . The experimental reflection of the device has been supported with a simulation using CST microwave studio software .
