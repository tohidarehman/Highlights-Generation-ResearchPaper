 Spin valves with holmium layers and three layer structures metal Ho metal were prepared by magnetron sputtering . A holmium layer in the spin valves is polycrystalline with weak axial 002 texture . The structural coherence length along the hexagonal c axis is approximately 2 5 of the total thickness of the holmium layer . Field dependences of the spin valves magnetoresistance were measured at different temperatures . Correlation was revealed between magnetic state in holmium layer and the shape of magnetoresistive curve . Deviation of magnetic moments of the reference layer and the adjacent part of holmium from the applied magnetic field was investigated . The field induced mobility of the magnetic helicoid in holmium layers was revealed .

@highlight Neel temperature of Ho layer depends on the thickness and microstructure perfection.
@highlight Antiferromagnetic Ho layer carries out exchange bias in the adjacent ferromagnetic.
@highlight Spin valve magnetoresistance correlates with the magnetic state in Ho layer.
@highlight Period of the magnetic helicoid in Ho layer varies with temperature.
@highlight The magnetic helicoid in Ho layer is rotated around c axis by magnetic field.
