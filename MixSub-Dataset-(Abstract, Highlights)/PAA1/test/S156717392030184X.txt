 Herein we present a facile low cost and eco friendly approach for conversion of bamboo timber waste derived cellulose nanocrystals into strong blue luminescent graphene quantum dots by hydrothermal route . The various properties of synthesized Bf GQDs were investigated using different spectroscopic techniques . The probable mechanism of Bf GQDs formation from Bf CNCs and the effect of pH particle size on the fluorescent properties of Bf GQDs also executed . Furthermore Bf GQDs were used for the detection of curcumin in an aqueous environment which is the major prerequisite of the present study . The Bf GQDs showed remarkable photoluminescence quenching kinetics toward the curcumin LOD 30.0nML
