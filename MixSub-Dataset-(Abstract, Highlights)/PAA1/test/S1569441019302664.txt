 Surface plasmon resonance based biosensors are an integral and indispensable aspect of present day pathology owing to its efficient real time and label free detection capabilities . Enhancing the sensitivity of these sensors is of paramount importance as it indirectly affects the detection limits of biomolecules . In this simulation work we make use of antireflective coatings made up of nanomaterials with alternating high and low refractive indices TiO
