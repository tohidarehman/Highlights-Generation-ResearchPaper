 The emission properties of the rare earth elements have been found to be sensitive to the local lattice environment around them and could be employed for probing the local lattice environment . Because each constituent ion of a material should have its own particular structural environment the emission profiles in RE elements depend strongly on the doping sites of RE elements inside the host crystals . We investigated the emission properties of the Eu
