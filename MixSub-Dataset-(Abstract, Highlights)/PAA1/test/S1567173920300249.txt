 Nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots with high blue fluorescence efficiency were synthesized by the hydrothermal method from p Phenylenediamine and p Coumaric acid . The N GQDs possess several superiorities most significantly in excellent solubility and superior photostability . Besides the as prepared N GQDs exhibit a uniform size distribution with a diameter of about 3.80.5nm . After dispersing the N GQDs in water the formed aqueous solution still presents a stable and homogeneous phase even after 2monthsat room temperature . The N GQD dispersion was further utilized as sensing probes for the selective detection of copper ions Cu

@highlight We reported a rapid and sensitive fluorescence nanomaterials sensor with satisfactory selectivity.
@highlight The as prepared N GQDs exhibited excitation independent behavior and high optical stability.
@highlight The fluorescence intensity of the N GQDs could be greatly quenched by adding a small amount of Cu
@highlight ions.
@highlight The linearity range is 010M with a detection limit of 57nM.
