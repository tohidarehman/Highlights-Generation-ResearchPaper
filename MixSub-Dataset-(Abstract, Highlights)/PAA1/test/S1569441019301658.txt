 The mode properties of solid core photonic crystal fibers having square pentagonal hexagonal octagonal nonagonal decagonal and dodecagonal lattice formats with uniform air filling fractions have been evaluated by a full vector finite element method using the software COMSOL Multiphysics 4.3 . Irrespective of the hole to hole spacing for a particular type of lattice the ratio of air hole radii of two PCFs having different AFFs is a constant . The ratio of air hole radii of a pair of PCFs consisting of different lattice types is also found to be constant if the AFF is the same . With dependence on value of AFF used the effect of the order of lattice on the mode area of PCFs exhibit a reversal characteristic while approaching higher order . The effective nonlinear coefficient has been found to be maximized for octagonal PCFs . A reduction in confinement loss to the order of

@highlight The propagation properties of PCFs having different lattice arrays but constant air filling fraction have been evaluated.
@highlight Empirical relationships between the ratio of air hole radii and air filling fractions for 3 sets of PCFs have been deduced.
@highlight Octagonal PCF shows high nonlinearity and square PCF shows flattened dispersion over a wide wavelength range.
@highlight The light propagation properties of the designed PCFs have been compared with those of commercially available PCFs.
