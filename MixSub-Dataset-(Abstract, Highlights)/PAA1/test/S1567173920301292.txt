 In this paper a plasma photonic crystal for infrared radiation modulation which is composed of indium tin oxide and plasma is proposed . The performance of plasma photonic crystal in near infrared radiation modulation is researched by transfer matrix method . The simulation results show that the near infrared radiation pass band can be adjusted by the changing of plasma frequency of plasma . The reflection to near infrared radiation by plasma photonic crystal increases with plasma frequency and that of absorption decreases . In addition the modulation performance of the plasma photonic crystal at different incidence wave angles is also studied . The results show that the incident wave angles have little effect on the transmission of plasma photonic crystal in near infrared band . The reflection of the plasma photonic crystal to near infrared radiation decreases with increasing of the incident wave angle but that of the absorption increases with the incident wave angle . Therefore the proposed plasma photonic crystal has a potential application in tunable near infrared filter devices .
