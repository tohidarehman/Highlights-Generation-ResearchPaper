 Plasmonics has been developed to overcome the serious limitations in design of sub wavelength scale optical components . Plasmonic waveguides can be used as optical biosensors . Recently various waveguide structures have been proposed for sensing applications . Main challenges of them are weak confinement of their guided modes in sensing region and consequently their weak interaction with analytes which lead to low values for the sensitivity . The reported maximum sensitivity for available plasmonic waveguide based biosensors are about 1.12.6 W RIU . In this study two compact plasmonic waveguides referred as surface plasmon slot waveguide and sub metal dielectric loaded surface plasmon slot waveguide are proposed for refractive index sensing applications . SDL SPSW has a high optical confinement in the sensing region which reduces its required transverse cross sectional area and increases the interaction of optical field with analyte molecules . The calculated sensitivity for SPSW and SDL SPSW are about 0.63 W RIU and 1.15 W RIU respectively for 632.8 nm . It has been shown that the sensitivity of SDL SPSW can be enhanced for longer wavelengths and the maximum value of 2.3 W RIU is observed for 1000 nm . The modal effective area of the SDL SPSW structure is about 7.7710
