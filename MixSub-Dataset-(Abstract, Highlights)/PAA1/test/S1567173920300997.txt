 The paper is devoted to optical testing of mid infrared Ge Si photodetectors obtained by stacking of self assembled Ge quantum dots in multilayer structures which are near field coupled to the adjacent nanoplasmonic arrays of subwavelength holes in metallic films . It is shown that photocurrent and near field spectra consist of several sets of peaks which are attributted to surface plasmon waves localized surface plasmon modes or diffractive Rayleigh anomaly depending on the hole diameter and the angle of incidence . We find that for small holes the greatest contribution to the photocurrent enhancement is due to the excitation of the surface plasmon polariton waves for all . As the hole diameter is increased and becomes comparable with the array periodicity the normal incident photoresponse improvement is provided by the Rayleigh anomaly . With the increase of incident angle the photocurrent enhancement is supposed to arise from coupling of the localized shape resonance and propagating plasmon modes .

@highlight The mid infrared photodetection in Si based heterostructures is enhanced by surface plasmons and diffractive effects.
@highlight Surface plasmons in periodic apertures with large aperture size have the character of mixed localized and propagating modes.
@highlight When the aperture size is comparable with the grating period photocurrent enhancement is provided by a Rayleigh anomaly.
