 In this work we emphasize the importance of cavity geometry along with nanoparticle shape and plasmonic nanogap design which plays significant role in understanding the complex plasmonic mode characteristics involving nanoparticle and gap mode resonances . The cross section imprint of planar cavity on metallic film plays decisive role in near field enhancement properties at similar NP size and plasmonic nanogap conditions for spherical and cubical NPOM systems . By mimicking the NPOM structure to metal insulator metal design we understand the resonant emission differences for the respective plasmonic modes . Influence of dominant and weaker gap mode resonances resulted in an interesting optical behavior in NP mode in case of cubical nanostructures . By such extensive investigation and interpretation of sub wavelength complex plasmonic mode characteristics various practical applications in plasmonics field can be accomplished .
