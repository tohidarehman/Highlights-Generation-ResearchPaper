 A gas field ion source has several advantages such as high current density low energy spread and high brightness . In this study Helium gas was used in a GFIS generated using the field ionization and field evaporation processes . The oriented three adatoms tip and single atom tip were prepared with its ion emission stability 9.8 and 10.1 by the nitrogen field assisted etching respectively . The TAT and SAT were reproduced throughout the field evaporation and nitrogen field assisted etching along the same crystal axis with its brightness 2.610

@highlight In this study the 110 oriented three adatoms tip TAT and single atom tip SAT were prepared under the constant applied voltage and variation of applied voltage respectively.
@highlight The 110 oriented hexamer atomic structure with 6 atoms three adatoms and single atom tip were prepared and reproduced along their own crystal axis respectively.
@highlight The brightness for the three adatom and single atom tip could be estimated as 2.610
@highlight A m
@highlight sr and 1.610
@highlight A m
@highlight sr with its ion beam stability 9.8 and 10.1 respectively.
@highlight The field emission electron beams effective radius for three adatoms was calculated to be 2.90 and 1.47 for single atom tip by Fowler Nordheim which was shown to be quite good consistency with an atomic radius of tungsten.
