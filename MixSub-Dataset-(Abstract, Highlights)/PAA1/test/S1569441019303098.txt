 Planar structures with two metal nanolayers supporting long range surface plasmons are described . We introduce a design where a one dimensional photonic crystal is used as a support for a planar dielectric film sandwiched between two metal nanolayers . This quasisymmetric design is compared with a symmetric where two metal nanolayers deposited on opposite sides of the planar dielectric film have the same semi infinite dielectric environment from both sides . Such multilayer structures are useful when electrical power is supplied to the planar film through LRSP supporting metal nanolayers on opposite sides of the film . This planar film may be for example an electro optical crystal or an electroluminescent film . A method for designing such LRSP supporting duplex metal structures based on an impedance approach is presented . Calculations of the optimal thickness for the metal bounded dielectric film which provides minima of optical field inside the metal nanolayers are given for both symmetric and quasisymmetric cases .
