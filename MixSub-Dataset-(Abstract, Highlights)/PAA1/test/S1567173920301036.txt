 A single walled carbon nanotube with conjugated polymer molecules is analyzed via optical spectroscopy . The presence of strongly localized excitonic states in the SWCNT is confirmed using time integrated photoluminescence . The PL spectrum exhibits extremely narrow width which is attributed to the strong confinement of the states by polymer molecules . In addition I observed that the excited states are gradually filled as a function of the excitation power which supports the localized excitonic behavior . Only the ground excitonic state is observed at low excitation powers but three additional PL peaks appear as the excitation power is increased . Especially the power dependent PL spectrum shows a blueshift and increased width which can be elucidated in terms of quantum confined stark effect and the screening of induced electric fields . Overall I demonstrate that the presence of polymer molecules induces several localized states in a single SWCNT .

@highlight The presence of the strongly localized excitonic states in a single walled carbon nanotube SWCNT with conjugated polymer molecules was confirmed based on time integrated photoluminescence PL .
@highlight We observed state filling effects as a function of excitation power with extremely narrow PL spectral width to support the strongly confined states.
@highlight The induced quantum confined stark effect QCSE is screened because of the increased in the number of charge carriers when the excitation power is gradually increased.
@highlight We performed photoluminescence excitation PLE spectroscopy in the single SWCNT to observed the optical absorption from strongly localized excitonic states.
