 In the mechanism of two dimensional superconductivity in doped graphene it was predicted that the presence of dopant bands plays a key role . However it has been challenging to fabricate an ordered phase of alkali metals on graphene owing to its van der Waals nature . We systematically study the phase formation of Rb on graphene epitaxially grown on H passivated SiC . We found a range of control parameters that stabilize the well ordered 2

@highlight The ordered phase of Rb atoms is formed on monolayer graphene.
@highlight Our ARPES spectra reveal a folded band of graphene and a dopant band.
@highlight We identify a key factor for the enhancement of electron phonon coupling.
