 Advancements in technology have led to the use of smartphones as biosensor detectors . However it is difficult to obtain stable color information of colorimetric sensors using multiple smartphones owing to different light conditions and image correction operations . In this study we attempted color detection of the colorimetric paper chip using smartphone embedded light emitting diode and simple transformation calculation . This method enables the acquisition of stable color information using different smartphones by reducing the influence of external light sources . Moreover we studied characteristics such as convergence and distinction of detection result details by the manufacturers and smartphones . These findings suggested the necessity of classification criteria for the use of smartphones to achieve optimal detection . In addition white and black references were used to set the standard for color correction of various light sources . Based on our results we conclude that this approach presents the possibility of smartphone based colorimetric detection in practical applications .

@highlight We have attempted to quantify the bio diagnostic assay by using various smartphones.
@highlight The effect of the external light environment is reduced by the smartphone LED and correction method.
@highlight The deviation between CMOS image sensors in various smartphones is reduced through contrast stretching method.
