 Metasurfaces artificial micro and nano photonic structures can modify wavefront of electromagnetic waves to the desired form . Metalenses are the metasurfaces assuming the role of focusing light . The focusing performance of nested gallium doped zinc oxide nanoring arrangements functionalized by conformal Talbot effect is investigated for communication wavelength 1550 nm . The Talbot effect focusing performance of the 2D finite sized structures are computationally demonstrated in a systematically manner . The impact of geometrical parameters on the primary focal spot and focusing performance parameters such as numerical aperture full width half maximum focal depth efficiency and fill factor is examined and summarized via finite difference time domain numerical simulations . All samples presenting an alternative plasmonic option in this work yield a good focusing efficiency of 50 absolute efficiency of 19 numerical aperture up to 0.67 focal depth up to 1.4 times of focal length and a wide focal spot size up to 6.0654 times of operating wavelength . As a result of finite sized construction conformal Talbot effect is examined from a novel alternative plasmonics perspective . Thus a new planarized focusing platform is employed by using a nanostructured microlens acting conformal transformation optics devices with low cost and light capturing tolerance .
