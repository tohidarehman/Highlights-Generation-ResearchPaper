 To realize a pulsed power discharge plasma using a liquid metal we investigated the dependence of the diameter on the flow velocity of a liquid metal flow consisting of a U alloy . The plasma temperature was measured using a pyrometric method . The results show that the flow velocity estimated by the parabolic corresponds to a theoretical value derived from the difference between the gas pressure and atmospheric pressure . The diameter of the liquid metal flow was found to be 0.5 to 0.9 times smaller than the nozzle diameter . We have also demonstrated pulsed power discharge using this liquid metal load by observing optical emission from plasma . The results indicated that a low temperature plasma was generated by the proposed method .

@highlight We propose a pulsed power discharge plasma source using a liquid metal.
@highlight Liquid metal flow realized with the thickness of a thin metal wire.
@highlight Using U alloy liquid metal flow diameter is 0.50.9 times the nozzle diameter.
@highlight The results showed that low temperature plasma was generated by the proposed method.
