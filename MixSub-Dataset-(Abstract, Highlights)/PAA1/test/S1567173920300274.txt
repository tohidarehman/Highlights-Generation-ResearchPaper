 The memristive effect become a bio electronics research focus with the development of sustainable systems and the application of multifunctional electronic devices . In this paper the natural Lophatherum gracile Brongn was employed as active layer to prepare Ag LGB fluorine doped tin oxide bio memristor . Further different doping ratios nano silver powders were doped into LGB functional layers at 0wt 0.2wt 0.33wt 1.0wt 2.0wt 10.0wt and 20.0wt . It is found that the capacitive coupled memristive performance of the Ag Ag doped LGB FTO devices was markedly changed . Finally it is confirmed that Ag ions transferring and Ag filament formation under the applied voltage are responsible for capacitive coupled memristive behavior . This research has revealed the realization of capacitive coupled memristive effect of bio memristor which opens a new way to achieve multifunctional performance for electronic device .
