 Understanding ferroelectric domain switching dynamics at the nanoscale is a great of importance in the viewpoints of fundamental physics and technological applications . Here we investigated the intriguing polarity dependent switching dynamics of ferroelectric domains in epitaxial BiFeO

@highlight Two different domain switching behavior depending on the bias polarity was observed.
@highlight For the negative bias sideways domain growth initiated by few nuclei was dominant.
@highlight For the positive bias most of domains grew from the pre existed pinned domains.
@highlight The polarity dependent switching is ascribed to asymmetric interfacial defect layer.
