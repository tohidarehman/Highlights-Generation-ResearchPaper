 A novel hybrid all optical infrared switch based on metal insulator metal plasmonic and one dimensional photonic crystal structures is introduced in this paper . A photonic crystal lattice composed of two different Kerr materials is located at the center of the switch . Two plasmonic metal insulator metal waveguides are used to transfer the data signal . Also two dielectric waveguides are used as input and output pump ports . The existence of two separate paths for data and pump signals results in good isolation between such signals . The photonic crystal lattice creates a photonic bandgap region with sharp transmission edges in the data signal path . The created edges in data signal path can be used for the switching mechanism . The proposed structure can operate as an all optical switch using different Kerr materials . The benefits of the proposed switch are having isolated signal and control ports and also its versatile topology . The switch can easily be redesigned and adapted with different Kerr materials for different applications . Furthermore since a hybrid photonic crystal plasmonic topology is used it benefits both from the advantages of plasmonic and PhC structures . Based on the mentioned advantages the proposed switch can be used as a basis to design other complex optical circuits .
