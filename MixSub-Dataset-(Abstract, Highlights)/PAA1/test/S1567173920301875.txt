 A homoepitaxial GaAs channel gives a great interest in the field of semiconductor spintronics due to the longer spin diffusion . By utilizing optimal temperature process and V III flux ratio control the GaAs layer is grown without a serious defect . In a ferromagnet semiconductor hybrid device Tb

@highlight We fabricate a homoepitaxial GaAs 110 channel without a serious defect.
@highlight TbFeCo Ru CoFeB structure is utilized as a spin source to measure the Hanle signal.
@highlight Spin diffusion length in a GaAs 110 is longer than that in a GaAs 100 by 25 .
