 Silicon solar cell texturing is the process of reducing the light reflection of the solar cells by changing their surface structure . Given that multi crystalline silicon wafers have grains with different orientations their texturing process is more difficult to realize compared with those of monocrystalline silicon wafers . There are two types of texturing processes wet and dry texturing . Acidic solution based wet textured mc Si samples have higher reflectance values than mono Si wafers . However the reactive ion etching texturing of mc Si wafers has the advantage of decreasing reflectance to values below 10 . Despite this decrease in reflectance RIE byproducts and plasma induced damage bring about recombination that results in a decrease the passivation properties of the solar cell . In this study the RIE byproducts as well as the plasma induced damage of the RIE textured mc Si wafers were analyzed using SEM STEM and EDS analysis while quasi steady state photoconductance was used to confirm the optical characteristics of the RIE textured mc Si wafers . Additionally HF treatment resulted in byproduct removal and a relatively high implied V
