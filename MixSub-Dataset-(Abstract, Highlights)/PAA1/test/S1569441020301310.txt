 Magnetic resonance images spatial resolution which is a key factor in early diagnosis of many diseases is fundamentally limited by the signal to noise ratio which in turn depends upon the efficiency of the receive radiofrequency coils design . Many various multi channel coils were designed to improve the quality of MR images . Another way to enhance the quality of magnetic resonance imaging is the implementation of resonators based on novel materials such as high permittivity dielectrics . Here we investigate the potential for the sensitivity enhancement with higher order modes of dielectric resonators . We numerically show that because of the unique near field spatial distribution of a dielectric resonator third order mode the receive performance can be substantially improved in comparison with a conventional metallic loop coil of the same dimensions . Moreover we study the performance of the dielectric resonator in comparison with a metallic loop coil which size was optimized to match the sensitivity of the resonator at a particular distance . We demonstrate a 9 fold larger planar field of view with the dielectric resonator than with the loop coil . Our work provides the design guidelines for the improvement of near field MRI sensitivity with the dielectric resonators .
