 A novel and facile hydrothermal route was designed to produce h BN C quantum dots using h BN powder as a precursor and Potassium Sodium Tartare as an intercalant . The resulting yellow solution possessed mono or few layers of quantum dots with an average size of 2.5nm . Due to the incorporation of functional groups on the surface of h BN an enhancement of photo luminescent magnitude and a blue shift were observed in photoluminescence spectra from h BN C QDTs solution . Further h BN C QDTs exhibits a bright blue fluorescence under the irradiation by a 365nm UV light . Next h BN QDTs was utilized as the dielectric active layer by using simple drop casting method between the electrodes and fabricated the nonvolatile resistive switching devices . The fabricated devices exhibited the nonvolatile bipolar resistive switching characteristics with 10
