 A microwave excited atmospheric pressure plasma jet was generated utilizing coaxial transmission line resonators with the resonance frequency of 788MHz . We investigated the effects of the operating parameters such as input power and gas flow rate on the electron excitation temperature and electron density using optical emission spectroscopy . The amounts of various reactive species in the plasma activated media exposed by the ME APPJ were estimated using colorimetric methods . The PAM was applied to A549 cultured cells and subsequently incubated for a given duration . The concentrations of NO

@highlight The amounts of various reactive species in the PAM exposed by a microwave excited atmospheric pressure plasma jet at 788MH were estimated using colorimetric methods.
@highlight The PAM was applied to A549 cultured cells. The concentrations of NO
@highlight and H
@highlight in the PAM incubating A549cells were monitored until 24h.
@highlight The reduced cell viability rate was observed on A549cells incubated in the PAM. The concentrations of NO
@highlight and H
@highlight depended on the operating conditions of plasma jet.
@highlight The cell viability rate exhibited a decrease with increasing power and decreasing gas flow rate.
@highlight Correlation between the concentrations of RONS in the plasma and in the PAM and the cell viability was observed.
