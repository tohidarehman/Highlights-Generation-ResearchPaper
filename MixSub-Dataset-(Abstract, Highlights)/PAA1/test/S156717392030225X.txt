 The characteristics of an atmospheric pressure glow discharge with a metal cathode and water anode and underwater plasma were compared during the formation of nanostructured molybdenum oxide . The electrical and spectral characteristics of both types of plasma were studied . In both cases the emission continuum presents in the spectrum because of sputtering the electrode material . The analysis of obtained powder was performed using scanning electron microscopy and x ray diffraction . Results showed that the mixture of molybdenum oxides is formed for both plasmas .

@highlight We compared two types of plasma in contact with water during the formation of nanostructured molybdenum oxide.
@highlight Emission spectra showed the presence of a continuum which reflects the sputtering of the electrodes.
@highlight Burning two types of plasma leads to the formation of the mixture of molybdenum oxides.
