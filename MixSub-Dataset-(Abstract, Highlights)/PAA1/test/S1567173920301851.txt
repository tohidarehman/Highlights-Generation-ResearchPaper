 Light emitting organic semiconductors have attracted considerable attention for the nanoscale fabrication of organic based displays and their potential application in optoelectronics plasmonics and photonics . In this study core shell hybrid nanostructures of organic rubrene coated on Ag nanoparticles have been synthesized using a chemical reduction method . The thickness of the rubrene shell was 2.66.0nm and the diameter of the Ag core was 3070nm . The optical and structural properties of the Ag rubrene core shell NPs were tuned by hydrothermal treatment at 190C . The Ag rubrene core shell NPs were characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy before and after the HT treatment and their structural properties were confirmed through X ray diffraction analysis . XRD peaks related to an orthorhombic phase were observed along with the original triclinic crystal structure of the rubrene shell and the triclinic crystal domain size increased from 28.2nm to 30.8nm owing to the HT treatment . Interestingly the green light emission
