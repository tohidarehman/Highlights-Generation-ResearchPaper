 Voltage control magnetism is one of the most energy efficient pathway towards magnetoelectric device . Ionic liquid gating method has already shown impressive manipulation power at the IL electrode interface to influence the structure orbital as well as spin of the electrode materials . As key material in anisotropy magnetoresistance sensor and spin valve heterostructure the permalloy Ni

@highlight We demonstrate the feasibility of low voltage 1V regulation of magnetic anisotropy.
@highlight A linear relationship between the surface charge density and the resonance field offset was observed and the linear coefficient was calculated to be 28.7mTm
@highlight  Col.
