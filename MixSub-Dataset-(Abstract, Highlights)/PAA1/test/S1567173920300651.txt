 We report that sequential deposition of a highly crystalline polymer donor and a soluble fullerene acceptor leads to a well defined interpenetrating network and enhanced power conversion efficiencies in bilayer polymer solar cells . Even without the use of solvent additives layered thin films of poly alt 2 2 5 2 5 2 quaterthiophen 5 5 diyl and phenyl C

@highlight Sequential deposition can lead to bulk heterojunction like morphology without the use of solvent additives.
@highlight Bilayer solar cells using crystalline semiconducting polymer donors simplifies fabrication process.
@highlight Interdiffusion of polymer donor acceptor molecules promises enhanced power conversion efficiency of bilayer solar cells.
