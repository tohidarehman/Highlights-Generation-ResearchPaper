 This paper introduces a novel lateral quantum well solar cell and investigates the effects of structural parameters of these nanostructures on the devices performance . For modeling the device first the absorption coefficients and the reflectance parameters of the device at different regions were calculated . Those parameters were then used to find the systems optical generation rate . Finally while considering all the radiative and non radiative recombinations the continuity and drift diffusion equations were solved to find the dark and photo currents . The results indicated that applying quantum wells to the traditional classical solar cells could noticeably increase the systems efficiency . Additionally it was found that efficiency was heavily dependent on the values of different geometrical parameters including the active layers thickness and the width of the wells and barriers . Moreover it was shown that modifying some structural parameters such as the barrier mole fraction could noticeably influence the solar cells characteristics . Therefore to obtain good efficiency it is necessary to optimize these parameters .

@highlight A novel laterally quantum well solar cell was introduced.
@highlight Their efficiency would be higher due to high carrier transport and absorption coefficient.
@highlight This improvement is much more notable for devices under TM illumination.
@highlight Their efficiency greatly depends on system geometrical and structural parameters.
@highlight Increasing quantum well width or decreasing barrier width could decrease efficiency.
