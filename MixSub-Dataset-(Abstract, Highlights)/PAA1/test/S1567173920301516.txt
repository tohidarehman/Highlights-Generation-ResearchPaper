 It was demonstrated that the electrochemical performance enhancements in KOH activated carbon materials should be mainly due to the created polar oxygen containing functional groups OFGs such as such as CO C

@highlight KOH activated CNTs a CNTs were used as the sulfur hosts for Li S batteries.
@highlight FTIR tests indicated a CNT S cathodes performances are linearly dependent on the CO bonds.
@highlight The optimal activation conditions on CNT hosts were determined 10 min 700 C .
