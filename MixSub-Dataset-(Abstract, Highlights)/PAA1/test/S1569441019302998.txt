 Inverse design algorithms can be used to design compact and high performance complex photonic structures . In this study we propose the design of an all dielectric optical resonator based on the concept of the parallel mirror resonator by using the objective first inverse design algorithm . Light is strongly confined using a predefined objective function that creates symmetric mirror regions acting as reflective layers for the fundamental transverse electric polarization mode . Thanks to the flexibility of the algorithm segments of the cavity and dielectric mirror are designed in a simulation region by choosing a cavity of an appropriate length . A time domain analysis of the proposed structure was carried out using the two dimensional finite difference time domain method . The proposed structure has a configuration with a footprint of 13.394 0.592 m
