 The optimum choice of the ligand that stabilizes the colloidal quantum dots and passivate the surface is crucial for tuning the energy level and remain elusive . The atomic ligand passivation with iodide remains superior over other surface treatments . Herein we applied the iodide ligand to passivate the CdSe nanocrystals with an excitonic absorption at 2.1eV by a liquid liquid extraction process . We took the view of the change in the optical and structural properties upon ligand exchange . Finally we tested the performance of the iodide treated dots by employing it in an inverted structure polymer solar cell based on P3HT PCBM .

@highlight This paper highlights the role of the iodide ligand passivation on the surface modification of colloidal CdSe nanocrystal.
@highlight CdSe QDs have been subjected to full optical and structural characterization to trace the change upon surface passivation.
@highlight The iodide treated CdSe dots are then tested in a polymer solar cell based on P3HT PCBM with an inverted structure.
