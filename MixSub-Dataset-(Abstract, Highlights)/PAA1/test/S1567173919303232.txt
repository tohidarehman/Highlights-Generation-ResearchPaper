 One of the efficient strategies to enhance light harvesting capability of metal oxides nanoparticles is to deposit low band gap metal sulfides on them via pseudo successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction

@highlight Using a rotary reactor modernized H
@highlight S treatment of TiO
@highlight nanoparticles is testified.
@highlight XPS and EDS based investigation affirmed the effectuality of H
@highlight S treatment.
@highlight Superior deposition of QDs was realized on TiO
@highlight nanoparticles NPs via
@highlight  SILAR.
@highlight Resultantly TiO
@highlight CdS and TiO
@highlight PbS degraded more RhB dye under visible light.
@highlight EIS and CV also affirmed the efficacy of H
@highlight S treatment for higher QDs deposition.
