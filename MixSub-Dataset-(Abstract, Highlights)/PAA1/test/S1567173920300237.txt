 Vertically aligned carbon nanotubes are used as electron source in various field emission applications owing to its high aspect ratio chemical inertness mechanical strength and electrical conductivity . Here we demonstrate that surface structure modification along with thin film coating enhances the field emission performance such as turn on voltage emission site density and stability . In the present study VCNTs with different heights were grown on silicon wafers by thermal chemical vapor deposition followed by the structure modification of VCNTs using capillarity driven water vapor condensation . We obtained various surface morphologies by varying the water vapor exposure time and heating temperature . In addition the structure modified VCNTs surfaces were coated with W and SiO

@highlight Water vapor induced surface structure modification of VCNTs and successive thin film coating processes are performed.
@highlight We explain the effect of water vapor flux and CNT length on surface structure modification and field emission properties of VCNTs.
@highlight We also identify the impact of thin film coating on the field emission performance of VCNTs.
@highlight W coated VCNTs with modified surface morphology shows the best field emission performance.
