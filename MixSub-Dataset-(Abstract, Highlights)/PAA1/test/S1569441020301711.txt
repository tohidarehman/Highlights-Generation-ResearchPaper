 Plasmonics have allowed revolutionary progress in field of random lasers through improvement of the lasing property via surface plasmon resonance . However localized surface plasmon resonance spectra of conventional metal nanostructures are too narrow to sufficiently cover both the absorption and emission spectra of dyes . Therefore in this paper we fabricate a typical Ag TiO

@highlight A typical Ag TiO
@highlight composite nanostructure with broadened plasmon resonance band has been successfully fabricated through solution reduction method.
@highlight The broaden LSPR band of the prepared hybrid nanostructure can sufficiently cover both the absorption and emission spectrum of dyes.
@highlight The random lasing device based on the new nanostructure with lower threshold sharper peak and higher intensity compared to the other devices prepared for reference is proposed.
@highlight The results further stimulate the consideration of the plasmon effect in random laser systems and help to design high performance and cost effective random laser device.
