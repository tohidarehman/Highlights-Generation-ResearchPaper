 We theoretically report that asymmetric transmission phenomenon of linearly polarized light enables an ultrasensitive and background free metamaterial sensor with a sensitivity of 47.5 THz RIU in the optical range . The asymmetric transmission in the metamaterial arises from the twist arrangement of two cascaded ring apertures and its asymmetric factor can reach 0.47 . Importantly by detecting the direction dependent polarization conversion the metamaterial is capable of sensing refractive index of surrounding medium . The sensing principle dictated by cross polarization makes the sensor background free since co polarization background noise is easily removed . The proposed metamaterial may open up opportunities to develop novel sensors and polarization modulators in the optical regime .
