 In this study we developed a simple hybrid structure and an appropriate numerical analysis method for a prism based surface plasmon refractive index biosensor by using an angular interrogation method . The proposed sensor comprised a prism filled with a hybrid of gold alpha tin selenide and graphene and a sensing medium . Monolayers of SnSe with a similar structure to graphene and phosphorene have exceptional optoelectronic properties and they have attracted much attention as two dimensional materials in a similar manner to other 2D material family members . The performance parameters were determined in terms of the sensitivity detection accuracy and quality factor . The results demonstrated the improved overall performance of the proposed sensor . Inserting an SnSe layer between gold and graphene increased the sensitivity of the sensor and its sensitivity was higher than those of previously reported sensors . All of the performance parameters were enhanced for this hybrid sensor which is not possible with sensors based only on graphene . Increasing the number of graphene only layers improved the sensitivity but decreased the DA and QF . The effect of the electric field distribution on the inserted graphene layers was analyzed with the finite difference time domain technique using Lumerical FDTD solution commercial software . The proposed biosensor may facilitate novel sensing applications .
