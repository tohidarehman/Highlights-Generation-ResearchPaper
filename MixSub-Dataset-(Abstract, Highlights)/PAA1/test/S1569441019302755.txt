 Silicon on insulator waveguides with different geometries have been employed to design various integrated optical components . Reducing the bending radius of the SOI waveguides with low bending loss is essential in minimizing the footprint of light wave circuits . The propagating mode is less confined in the core of the ultra thin SOI waveguide and penetrates to substrate and cladding leading to higher bending loss compared to conventional SOI waveguides with a thicker guiding layer . Although various bending mechanisms have been utilized to reduce the bending loss of conventional SOI waveguides the ultra thin SOI waveguide bends have not been studied in detail . In this paper we present a 60 nm thick SOI waveguide bend based on the truncated Eaton lens implemented by varying thickness of the guiding layer . The three dimensional full wave simulations reveal that the designed waveguide bend with a radius of 3.9m reduces the bending loss from 3.3 to 0.42dB at the wavelength of 1550nm . Moreover the bending loss for the wavelength range of 12601675nm is lower than 0.67dB while the bending loss in the C band is lower than 0.45dB .
