 The absolute density measurement of atomic species such as hydrogen is crucial for plasma processing because of their strong chemical reactivity . In this work to measure the hydrogen atom density in Ar H

@highlight Vacuum ultraviolet absorption spectroscopic VUVAS method considering self absorption effect is modeled and employed.
@highlight Absolute density of hydrogen atom in low pressure ICP is measured using VUVAS.
@highlight Influence of operational conditions on hydrogen atom density and electron density is investigated.
