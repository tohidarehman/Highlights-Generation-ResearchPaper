 topology in two dimensional group IVA materials has been explained by the band orders due to the crystal field splitting at the

@highlight Spin orbit coupling induced band inversion of conduction and valence bands in plumbene and stanene.
@highlight Plumbene and stanene become spin Chern insulators as a result of the band inversion.
@highlight Phase transition from spin Chern insulator topological insulator with under staggered sublattice potential.
