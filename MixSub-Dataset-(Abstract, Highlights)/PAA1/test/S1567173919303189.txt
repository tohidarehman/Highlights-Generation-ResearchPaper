 Oil spills are a major threat to the marine ecosystem requiring immediate solutions to remove spilled oil from oceanic environments . In this study we report a superhydrophobic molybdenum disulfide MoS

@highlight A novel multifunctional oil sorbent sponge has been developed by incorporating 2D MoS
@highlight flakes into porous PDMS sponge.
@highlight The MoS
@highlight  PDMS sponge presents tunable hydrophobicity varying with the concentration of incorporated 2D MoS
@highlight flakes.
@highlight The MoS
@highlight  sponge exhibits excellent adsorption separation and recovery of oil from oil spilled water as well as high repeatability upon repeated use.
