 The chemical and phase compositions and structure of the FeNO films produced by reactive dc magnetron sputtering in Ar or Ar N

@highlight Nanocrystalline FeNO films containing Fe N and Fe
@highlight phases are studied.
@highlight All films contain impurity of O and N which participate in the phase composition.
@highlight Magnetic hysteresis loops indicate the presence of two main modes of coercive field.
@highlight The magnetic structure of the films is discussed in terms of random anisotropy model.
@highlight The magnetic properties of bct nitrous martensite are discussed.
