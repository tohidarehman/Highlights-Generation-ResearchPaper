 Low mode asymmetries represent an important obstacle to achieving high gain inertial confinement fusion implosions . As a step in learning how to control such effects an OMEGA experiment with imposed mode 2 laser drive asymmetries was done to study the expected signatures of this type of asymmetry . In the present work a 3D xRAGE simulation including the stalk mount has been brought to bear on the data from that experiment . Comprehensive comparisons between simulated and measured observables are made . Good agreement between simulated and measured x ray image inferred shell trajectories bang times and neutron emission widths are seen showing that the hydrodynamics are well captured in the simulation . Asymmetries seen in simulated and measured time resolved and time integrated x ray images and areal densities also compare well showing impact of both stalk and mode 2 . On the other hand important differences in measured and simulated neutron emission histories yield and ion temperature

@highlight Comprehensive comparisons between 3D simulated and measured observables.
@highlight Interference between imposed mode 2 asymmetry and stalk mount confirmed in simulation.
@highlight Simulation is overestimating shock burn suggesting overestimated shock ion heating.
