 Here we propose double coil setup to allow high signal to noise ratio broad range heteronuclear magnetic resonance imaging experiments two independent coils one of them tuned to

@highlight A coil for broad range heteronuclear ultra high field imaging is proposed
@highlight The coil properties are studied numerically and experimentally
@highlight The non proton coil is tuned by changing its structural capacitance and inductance
@highlight H and X nuclei coils are uncoupled so they can be tuned independently
@highlight The magnetic field distribution show the coils to allow scanning small animals
