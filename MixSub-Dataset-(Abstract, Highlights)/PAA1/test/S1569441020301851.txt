 A plasmonic refractive index sensor based on a metal insulator metal waveguide coupled with a double concentric square ring resonator is proposed and analyzed both theoretically and numerically . The theoretical and the numerical results are based on the transmission line model and the finite difference time domain method respectively . The theoretical results agree well with the numerical ones . A maximum sensitivity of 1250 nm per refractive index unit with a high figure of merit of 32.8 for the double concentric square ring resonator with one stub is obtained in the near infrared region . Also the double concentric square ring resonator with three stubs is simulated and has a maximum sensitivity of 1270 nm per refractive index unit with a high figure of merit of 58 . Our proposed plasmonic structures could find useful applications in sensing systems and integrated circuits in the near infrared region .
