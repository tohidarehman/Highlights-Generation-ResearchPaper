 Titanium nitride one candidate as an alternative plasmonic material is deposited by the sputtering method on top of a self assembled polystyrene microsphere lattice . The optical transmission spectra of the TiN coated microsphere lattice reveal a transmission pass band attributed to the extraordinary optical transmission phenomenon known from subwavelength hole arrays in metal films . Simulations by finite element method show the presence of a hybrid mode resulting from coupling of surface plasmons on the TiN film to photonic guided resonance modes in the dielectric microsphere lattice . The crucial role of the microspheres in the transmission process is also evidenced by dedicated simulations . Such hybrid colloidal photonic plasmonic crystals based on TiN are promising for future plasmonic applications requiring the thermo mechanical stability of refractory ceramics complemented by a plasmonic efficiency similar to that of gold but also for extending the range of current applications beyond the use of the classical noble metals gold and silver .
