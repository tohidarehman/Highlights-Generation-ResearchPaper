 An advanced approach to minimize the light loss was discussed for III V solar cells by controlling the roughnesses of the device surface . Adhesives with different viscosities were applied to bond the III V solar cells with the supporting substrate before the epitaxial lift off process . The surface roughness of the III V solar cells with epoxy adhesive
