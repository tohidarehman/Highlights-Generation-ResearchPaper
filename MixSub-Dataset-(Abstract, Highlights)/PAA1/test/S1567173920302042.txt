 Herein a highly integrated plasmonic sensor based on a multichannel metal insulator metal waveguide scheme for the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes is proposed . The numerical study is conducted via the finite element method based on commercially available software COMSOL . The sensor design is highly sensitive which can detect a minute change in the refractive index of the analyte . In this study we have used the refractive index values of three different concentrations of ethanol and
