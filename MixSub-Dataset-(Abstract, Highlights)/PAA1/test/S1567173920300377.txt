 Various studies suggest that the performances of TMDs are largely thickness dependent . In this paper we develop a chemical vapor deposition method to synthesis monolayer and bilayer MoS

@highlight Monolayer and bilayer MoS
@highlight flakes were prepared using the solution precursor instead of powders.
@highlight The vapor pressure of the precursor will be controlled through controlling the precursor mass.
@highlight The flakes exhibit high detectivity up to 2.4410
@highlight and a fast response time of 97ms. The photoresponsivity was found up to 7160 A.
