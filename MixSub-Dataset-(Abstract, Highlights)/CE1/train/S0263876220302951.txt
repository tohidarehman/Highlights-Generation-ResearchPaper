 Matchett proposed an exponential stress regime in silos from principal stress cap modelling . It could result in dangerously high stresses in silos . Practical examples of the exponential stress field have been found in the published work of Ramirez et al . for wheat and maize in a steel silo 1.9 m diameter and 5 m tall . The exponential stresses were found during the early stages of the discharge cycle .

@highlight A practical example of the exponential stress regime in silos has been found.
@highlight The data have been successfully modelled by psc and modified Janssen methods.
@highlight The exponential regime is outside of existing design codes.
@highlight It can generate dangerously high stresses.
@highlight Further research is required.
