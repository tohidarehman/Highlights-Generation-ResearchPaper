 In this study a hybrid ultrafiltrationforward osmosis system was compared with a dual stage ultrafiltration process for the harvesting of marine microalgae . To the best of the authors knowledge none of the previous studies compared the performance of a dual stage ultrafiltration process with a hybrid UF FO process for the harvesting of marine microalgae . The application of the hybrid process is expected to reduce the energy consumption for harvesting the microalgae without affecting the concentration factor and final product quality . In forward osmosis the impact of the feed and draw solutions flowrate and the membrane orientation was investigated . The feed solutions were unfiltered microalgae solution and ultrafiltered concentrated microalgae while the draw solution was brine collected from a thermal desalination plant . A maximum total algal harvesting concentration factor of 37.3 was obtained using the hybrid ultrafiltration forward osmosis system and the dual stage ultrafiltration process . The flowrate used in the forward osmosis process was 2.5LPM for the feed solution and 0.8 LPM for the draw solution and the active layer was facing the feed solution . The energy consumption in the hybrid ultrafiltration forward osmosis system was 24 less than the dual stage ultrafiltration system .

@highlight The energy consumption of forward osmosis was 50 less than ultrafiltration.
@highlight The energy consumption can be reduced by 24 using the hybrid process.
@highlight Water flux increased by placing the active layer towards draw solution.
@highlight Reverse solute flux was minimal and did not affect the quality of microalgae.
