 This study numerically investigates the effects of grid bars cross sectional geometry and grid fins arrangement to reshape the windward flow in promoting 90 bend plate fin heat sink forced convection at Reynolds number 60.6 10

@highlight Grid cross sectional shape induced turbulence on 90 bend plate fin forced convection is studied.
@highlight Effects of inline arranged RG inline PG and staggered PG fins configurations are investigated.
@highlight Higher
@highlight with inflow fin misalignment elevates the unwanted vortical structure formation.
@highlight Grid bars with gradual curvature gives closer
@highlight to fin surfaces and promote thermal dissipation.
@highlight grid expresses the highest
@highlight of 57 indicating a potent energy sustainable heat transfer.
