 The dynamic rotating rings electrode has proven to be an efficient configuration for removing contaminants . The flow induced by the complex geometry of the RRE was analyzed by computational fluid dynamics and the multiple reference frame approach rotational speed in the range of 75500 rpm . Assessment of the three type models and realizable to solve the turbulent flow was performed . The results show that the realizable model provides a more adequate physical description of the flow than the other models . The global flow was analyzed using integral parameters such as the average flow circulation time pumping number and power number . The local flow was examined qualitatively through velocity profiles and streamlines . The effect of simulating two different positions of the RRE moving walls concerning the baffles when using the MRF approach was evaluated . The flow pattern is predominantly radial because the electrode external bars propel the fluid to the lateral tank wall . Besides the external bars promote regions of high deformation in the fluid that produce vortices . It was found that the result at 0 is in good agreement with the experimental results of mixing time .

@highlight Numerical analysis with 3 different RANS models is performed in a complex geometry.
@highlight The realizable model has the better performance to predict the flow pattern.
@highlight The flow pattern develop for the rotating ring electrode is predominantly radial.
@highlight The external bars promote the formation of vortices with high turbulent intensity.
@highlight The MRF simulation at 0 alignment is in good agreement with experimental results.
