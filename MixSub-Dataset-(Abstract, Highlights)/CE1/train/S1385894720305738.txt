 The widespread use of pharmaceuticals and personal care products is posing serious environmental issues and it is imperative to develop an effective treatment for removing PPCPs . Herein we used a binary metal oxide of dibismuth copper oxide CuBi

@highlight A reaction system was built from PMS activation and photocatalysis over CuBi
@highlight Highly efficient ability for removing PPCPs was achieved.
@highlight and h
@highlight were determined to be dominant active species.
@highlight Mechanism based on photocatalysis and transformation of Bi Cu ions was proposed.
