 In this study a biochar derived from the pruning wastes of apple trees was thermally modified and was evaluated as a catalyst to explore an innovative strategy of valorization . The BC was thermally modified at 400 550 and 700C denoted as BC400 BC550 BC700 respectively . The removal of 50mg L acetaminophen with 1.0g L biochars was 9.0 except for BC700 without an oxidant . However it was greatly enhanced in the presence of 0.5g L sodium persulfate . The surface area normalized ACT removal rate constant increased from 6.5610

@highlight Graphitization degree defects and basic sites increased with the temperature of biochar modification.
@highlight Acetaminophen degradation was enhanced increased with the temperature of biochar modification.
@highlight Graphitization degree defects C O C O and basicity were correlated with catalytic activity.
@highlight Persulfate was activated via persistent free radicals and delocalized electrons in graphitic structures.
@highlight Different electron donors activated persulfate for the biochars modified under different temperature.
