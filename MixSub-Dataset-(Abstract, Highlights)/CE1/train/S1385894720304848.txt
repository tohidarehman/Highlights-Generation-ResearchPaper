 The design of new family carbon materials to capture more saline ions is one of the biggest challenges of capacitive deionization for water desalination . Herein we demonstrate the preparation of integrated tubular metal organic framework architectures using a 3D scaffold and their derivative of nitrogen doped carbon tubes that possess a maximum salt adsorption capacity of 56.9mgg

@highlight Integrated tubular MOF architectures are synthesized by layer by layer nanopatterning on a 3D scaffold.
@highlight NCTs are prepared by carbonization of integrated tubular MOF architectures.
@highlight NCTs exhibit a maximum salt adsorption capacity of 56.9mgg
