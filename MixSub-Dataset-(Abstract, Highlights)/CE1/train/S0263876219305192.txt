 Synthesis of diblock sodium alginate grafted poly SA g PNVI was investigated as preliminary step toward preparation of blank copolymeric beads and immobilized algal beads for the removal of phenol from aqueous solutions . The diblock SA g PNVI was self crosslinked via calcium ions to make BCB and crosslinked with dead green algae
