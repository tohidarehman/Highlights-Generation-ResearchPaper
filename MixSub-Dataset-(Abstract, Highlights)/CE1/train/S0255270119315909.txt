 This study combines feed splitting internal heat integration and heat integration between Pervaporation retentate streams and internal streams of reactive distillation column employed in TAME production in an attempt to optimize energy consumption in the process . All process parameters in the RD column PV membrane process and process energy consumption were optimized simultaneously . Further the possibility of heat exchange between hot and cold streams was investigated by the optimization algorithm in internal heat integration in the RD column as well as heat integration between retentate streams in PV modules and internal streams in the RD column . Accordingly the number of heat exchangers and the heat exchange ratio of the streams was determined by the optimization algorithm . The Total Annual Cost was adopted as the objective function to be optimized by a combination of Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm . Twelve different processes were optimized and compared . Optimization results suggest that the hybrid R HIDiCPV process with feed splitting and heat integration reduced the energy consumption by 42 and TAC by 45 compared to the hybrid PVRD process and by 47 and 48 respectively compared to the hybrid RDPressure swing distillation process .

@highlight Rather than PSD and ED methods PV was used in methanol recovery section in the TAME process.
@highlight For the first time combination of HIDiC feed splitting and heat integration was used to save energy.
@highlight The heat integration between internal streams of RD column and retentate streams of PV was investigated.
@highlight All process parameters especially PV parameters were considered as optimization parameters.
