 Plasmonic photocatalytic degradation and photoelectrochemical water splitting is very promising in the process of ecological environment protection . However the efficiencies reported are still too low for practical application due to the high recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes which can be improved by optimizing the design and assembly of highly ordered pore structures . In our work a composite plasmonic metal semiconductor photocatalyst Au ZnO hybrid inverse opal nanomaterial was prepared by

@highlight Au ZnO hybrid inverse opal Au ZnO IO was prepared by an

@highlight Bisphenol A not only can be photocatalytic degraded but also efficient mineralized.
@highlight New two step electron transfers on Au ZnO IO significantly improve the charge separation.
@highlight A photocatalytic mechanism was proposed and confirmed by several techniques.
