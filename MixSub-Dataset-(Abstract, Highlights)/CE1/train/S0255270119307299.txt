 High power generation efficiency and environmental performance are obtained in the integrated coal gasification combined cycle power plants . Hot gas clean up is a key technology in IGCC systems . In this paper a moving granular bed filter was constructed to examine the effect on collection efficiency when variations in the working parameters namely the mass flow rate the filtration superficial velocity and the amount of dust particulates at the inlet were introduced . A method to enhance particulate removal was proposed and tested in a lab scale experiment . In addition the study analyses the motion of gas flow in the inlet gas device of filter system . The results indicated a low amount of dust in the outlet of filter system when a mass flow rate of 0.008 kg s and a filtration superficial velocity of 0.42 m s were used . Furthermore this new method is suitable for IGCC and other industrial areas involving high temperature environments .

@highlight Expansion geometry type of the inlet gas device have a uniform distribution of gas.
@highlight A gas velocity of 0.42 m s led to the better particulate flow of the dust cake.
@highlight The lower outlet dust concentration could obtain under a mass flow rate of 0.008 kg s and a filtration superficial velocity of 0.42 m s.
