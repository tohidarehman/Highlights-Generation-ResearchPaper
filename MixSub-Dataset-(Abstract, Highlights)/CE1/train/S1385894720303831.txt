 A spinning disk reactor is a promising contacting device used in the synthesis of nanoparticles through reactive precipitation . The synthesis performance depends on the flow characteristics of the liquid film on the reactor . Using a glycerolwater solution as the experimental medium this study examined the three distinct zones of the radial velocity profile and the formation of hydraulic jump through laser Doppler velocimetry and volume of fluid methods . The results showed that as the inlet Reynolds number increases the inertial effect dominates farther out and pushes the three zones outwards a wider acceleration zone is obtained and the pouring diameter does not affect the synchronisation zone . At higher rotational speeds the centrifugal effect dominates even at a smaller radius and the three zones move inwards leading to a wider synchronisation zone . The hydraulic jump generally occurs at lower rotational speeds higher viscosity or smaller pouring diameter . At higher inlet Reynolds number or lower speeds the jump region expands and migrates outwards . Although the pouring diameter can determine whether the jump occurs it only slightly affects the location of the jump . The synchronisation and jump radii can be predicted using the radial length scale factor . The Nusselt model was modified by incorporating a correction term and a regression model was proposed to predict the maximum film height .

@highlight High rotary speed viscosity or low flow rate with wider synchronised zone in SDR.
@highlight Hydraulic jump formed with low rotary speed high viscosity or small pouring size.
@highlight Prediction of synchronisation radius and jump radius by radial length scale factor.
@highlight Pouring size has little effect on where zoning behaviour or hydraulic jump occurred.
