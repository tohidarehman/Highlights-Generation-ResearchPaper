 A key requirement for materials that adsorb pollutants in aqueous media is the balance between efficiency and biodegradation owing to rising microplastic pollution . Hyperbranched polyamidoamine based microhydrogel particles from ethylene diamine monomer demonstrate high absorbance activity for removing heavy metal ions yet are vulnerable to hydrolysis . Here we copolymerize lysine diketopiperazine and EDA with

@highlight Polyamidoamine microparticles containing lysine cyclodipeptide L DKP are prepared.
@highlight Cu
@highlight absorption capacity and hydrolysis rate decrease with an increase of L DKP units.
@highlight Microparticles without L DKP have the highest Cu
@highlight absorption but degradation leads to re pollution.
@highlight Microparticles containing 20mol of L DKP D2 exhibit the best balance of efficiency stability.
@highlight D2 without disturbing the hydrogen bond leads to a higher Cu
@highlight absorption yet stable in water.
