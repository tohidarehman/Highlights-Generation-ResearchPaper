 Surfactant degradation is a challenging problem related to wastewater treatment . The source of such wastewater can be industrial or domestic with concentrations varying in between 1 to 300mg L. Due to the sheer volume of such streams both kinetics of degradation as well as scale of operation become the governing criteria for the success of a technology . In this work the authors have reported for the first time the possibility of treating surfactant laden wastewater using hydrodynamic cavitation technology . A systematic approach has been adopted whereby the following modus operandi were taken selection of orifice diameter for HC treatment studying the effect of pH and inlet pressure for SDS degradation using HC effect of varying SDS concentration and subsequent degradation studies addition of H
