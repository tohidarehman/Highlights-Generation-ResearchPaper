 A molecular design having t butyl groups surrounding a donor acceptor type core structure was developed as an approach to obtain high external quantum efficiency by suppressing concentration quenching effect caused by strong intermolecular interaction . The donor acceptor type core structure was surrounded by six t butyl groups to separate the donor acceptor core structure between molecules . A heptazine acceptor and a diphenylamine donor based thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitter protected by the multiple t butyl units achieved maximum external quantum efficiency of 32.6 at 1 doping concentration and 23.0 even at a high doping concentration of 20 by reducing concentration quenching effect . Furthermore the lifetime of the thermally activated delayed fluorescent devices was also improved relative to that of the previous emitter with the same acceptor . The external quantum efficiency and device lifetime are better than any other results reported in the orange TADF OLEDs .
