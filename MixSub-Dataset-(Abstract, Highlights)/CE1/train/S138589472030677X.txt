 Significant progress has been made in endowing biomedical materials with antibacterial properties . However the commercialization of these systems still poses various practical challenges . In this study we report a facile technique for the preparation of practical and efficient antibacterial coatings based on well defined polysilsesquioxane structures containing quaternary ammonium cation and long alkyl chains . PSQ is a hybrid material containing organic groups within a flexible and robust siloxane network and can be endowed with different functions according to the synthetic conditions employed in the sol gel process . However depending on the synthetic precursors a non uniform PSQ structure can be formed which limits the functions and stability of the resulting material . Accordingly we synthesized PSQs with homogeneously distributed quaternary ammonium cation and long alkyl chains using optimized synthetic conditions . The PSQs were coated on devices

@highlight Polysilsesquioxanes with siloxane network and antibacterial chains are synthesized.
@highlight The polysilsesquioxanes have a ladder like structure suitable for durable coating.
@highlight The polysilsesquioxanes are easily coated on dental materials via self assembly.
@highlight The coated dental materials show strong antibacterial effect for various bacteria.
@highlight Coatings with nanoscale thickness improve the mechanical strength of the materials.
