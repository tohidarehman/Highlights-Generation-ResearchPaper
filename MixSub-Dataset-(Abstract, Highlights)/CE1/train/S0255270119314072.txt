 Green synthesis of hexamethylene 1 6 dicarbamate by reacting 1 6 hexanediamine with dimethyl carbonate has garnered considerable attention recently because of the usage of DMC which substitutes toxic phosgene . In this study some plant wide processes are proposed for green HDC synthesis . In the first process HDC is synthesized using two reactive distillation columns in series . Excess DMC is used and the mixture of unreacted DMC and byproduct methanol from the RD column tops is separated by using a series of conventional distillation columns . Next each RD column is enhanced by vapor recompression to reduce energy consumption by fully utilizing a small temperature difference between the column bottom and top . By the latent heat released from the overhead vapors of the RD columns VR eliminates all reboiler duties of RD columns and conserves a substantial energy demand from conventional distillation columns . Compared with the process designed by RD the process designed by RD VR can reduce total operation cost and total annual cost by 42.6 and 34.6 respectively . Finally HDC synthesis by using CSTR is designed to compare with the RD and RD VR intensified processes . Simulation results demonstrate that the reactive VR distillation process provides the most economical design for green HDC synthesis .
