 While most papers focuses on catalysts improvement this paper is about a kinetic model based on a new reaction scheme to explain the transformation of ethanol acetaldehyde to butadiene and side products . The reaction scheme presented here is more complex than the route usually presented in the literature

@highlight Experimental butadiene production overTa
@highlight  SiO
@highlight Development of a kinetic model for the conversion of ethanol into butadiene.
@highlight Elaboration of two routes to explain butadiene formation.
@highlight Elaboration of a reaction scheme for butadiene and side products.
@highlight Very good agreement between experimental and simulated values for most components.
