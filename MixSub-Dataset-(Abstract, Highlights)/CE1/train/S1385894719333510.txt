 Metal free activation of peroxymonosulfate has been reported to be more efficient than peroxydisulfate due to the asymmetrical structure of PMS . However we report for the first time that the nitrogen doped porous carbon templated from graphitic carbon nitride exhibits unexpectedly higher catalytic activity in the activation of PDS than PMS as evidenced by 1.74 fold greater rate constant of NC 900 PDS 0.80min

@highlight N doped porous carbon was prepared using g C
@highlight as template and nitrogen source.
@highlight NC 900 exhibits unexpectedly higher reactivity in the activation of PDS than PMS.
@highlight NC 900 surpasses existing N doped carbon materials in persulfate activation.
@highlight PMS activation on NC 900 involves PMS reduction and oxidation mainly producing
@highlight PDS activation on NC 900 consists in PDS reduction for the generation of
@highlight OH.
