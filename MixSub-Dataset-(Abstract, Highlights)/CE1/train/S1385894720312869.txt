 Chemodynamic therapy and photodynamic therapy mediated by reactive oxygen species hold great potential for cancer therapy . However they are still limited by rigorous reaction conditions of efficacious Fenton reaction reliance on oxygen and inherent defects of traditional common photosensitizers . Herein we reported an L Buthionine sulfoximine modified FeS
