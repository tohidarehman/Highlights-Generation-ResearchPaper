 In the current paper the thermo fluid characteristics of a new design of curved tube called a triple spiral tube heat exchanger was achieved with a brave comparative with a double spiral tube heat exchanger as particular reference . A three dimensional computational fluid dynamic model was developed using Ansys 14.5 software package . The Realize k model had been applied with enhanced wall treatment to simulate the thermo fluid characteristics . The governing equations were solved by a finite volume discretization method . The new design was created by adding a third tube to a double concentric spiral tube heat exchanger . The study carried out under consideration of turbulent fluid to fluid heat transfer condition . The influence of different key design parameter such as inlet hot fluid temperatures flow arrangements concentration of Alumina Al
