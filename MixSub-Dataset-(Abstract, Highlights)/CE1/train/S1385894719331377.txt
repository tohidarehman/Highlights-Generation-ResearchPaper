 Despite the fulfilling progress in fabricating metal chalcogenides based battery electrodes most effort focuses on construction of hybrid architectures and or foreign elemental doping for improving electrochemical performance . In this work we report a self template strategy to synthesize hexagonal SnS

@highlight S vacancy rich SnS
@highlight and SnS nanoplates are synthesized.
@highlight Phase transformation from SnS
@highlight to SnS involves generation of S vacancies.
@highlight The S vacancies contribute to improved electronic conductivity.
@highlight The SVR SnS anode exhibits excellent long term cycling stability for LIBs.
