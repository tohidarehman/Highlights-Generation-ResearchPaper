 Developing low cost environment friendly and highly active nanocomposites for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction holds pivotal function in water splitting . Supported cocatalysts on semiconductor can facilitate speedy transfer and separation of photoexcited charge active interfacial response and suppress photocorrosion . We for the first time proposed a novel strategy to formed 2D 2D nanocomposites by loading 2D P doped Ni

@highlight P doped Ni
@highlight S Ni
@highlight SP was firstly used as a cocatalyst for efficient photocatalytic H
@highlight evolution.
@highlight The P doped Ni

@highlight CdS 2D 2D nanojunctions were for the first time constructed.
@highlight The improved charge separation and H
@highlight  evolution mechanisms were revealed.
@highlight The strongly coupled 2D 2D nanojunctions show better activity for photocatalytic H
@highlight evolution.
