 Meeting with severe environmental problems highly efficient environmental friendly and multiple reusable catalysts are demanding to develop . In this work carbon based bimetallic oxides with oxygen vacancies were prepared toward peroxymonosulfate activation for 4 aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester degradation . Among different molar ratios of ferrous ions and manganese ion Fe

@highlight Pyrolysis treatment of Prussian blue analogues to prepare defect rich carbon based Fe Mn bimetallic oxides.
@highlight Lattice oxygen was the main reactive site for ABEE degradation.
@highlight Transition of pyridinic N and sacrifice of lattice oxygen were responsible for enhanced catalytic performance.
@highlight Degradation pathway included electrophilic and radical addition hydrogen abstraction reaction and diazotization.
