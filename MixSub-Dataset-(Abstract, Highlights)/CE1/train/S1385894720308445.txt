 This study investigates the degradation of an antibiotic ciprofloxacin by the photocatalytic sonocatalytic and sonophotocatalytic oxidation inside a novel multi frequency reactor under low ultrasonic frequencies and visible light using N doped TiO

@highlight N TiO
@highlight nanoparticles were used as catalyst for photo sono and sonophotocatalysis.
@highlight A novel multifrequency hexagonal reactor was designed for the studies.
@highlight Sonophotocatalysis had a synergy index of 1.22.
@highlight Effect of real wastewater matrix on the degradation efficiency was studied.
@highlight Degradation products were identified and degradation pathways are proposed.
