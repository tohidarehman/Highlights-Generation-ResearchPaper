 Developing highly active and durable electrocatalysts with low cost for the oxygen reduction reaction is of paramount importance for promoting economical and high performance Al air batteries . Herein nitrogen doped carbon decorated with FeCo nanoparticles catalysts is prepared by a low cost and facile approach employed Prussian blue analogue and dicyandiamide as precursors . The obtained catalyst exhibits remarkable ORR activity with an onset potential and a high half wave potential as well as superior stability in alkaline conditions . The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of electrocatalysts might be resulted from the hierarchical porous structure and synergetic effect between FeCo alloy and N doped graphitic carbon species . As a demonstration the optimized catalysts are employed as the cathode catalysts in a Al air battery which shows remarkable discharge performance with higher open circuit voltage of 1.67V and large power density of 98.62mWcm
