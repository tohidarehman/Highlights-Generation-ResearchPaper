 Oxygen and reactive oxygen species produced during algal photosynthesis are important electron acceptors in photosynthetic algal microbial fuel cell cathodes . In this study spongy and petaline ZnO

@highlight The optimal Zn to Ni molar ratio for fabricating
@highlight cathodes is 0.2.
@highlight carbon felt cathodes have a higher surface area than carbon felt.
@highlight P n heterojunctions in
@highlight cathodes increases oxygen adsorption.
@highlight ROS adsorption capacity can be an evaluation indicator for PAMFC cathodes.
