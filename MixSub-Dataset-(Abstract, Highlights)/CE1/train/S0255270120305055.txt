 Bee pollen has high antioxidant properties and therefore attracts interest in applications such as functional food or ingredient in food cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries . Drying during pollen processing ensures physical and microbiological stability . This paper investigates the performance of an infrared heating assisted fluidized bed dryer for drying pollen grains . Physical characterization of the material and fluid dynamic tests were performed to choose dryer operating conditions . Drying kinetics power consumption and product quality for hybrid drying was compared to those from conventional fluidized bed dryer and isolated IR dryer for pollen processing . The effective moisture diffusivity value in the hybrid drying was approximately 30 higher and specific energy consumption was 52 lower than those of conventional fluidized bed drying . In addition the smoother drying conditions than thin layer IR drying prevented colour degradation of bee pollen thus conserving product quality . Therefore this study shows that the combination of IR radiation with fluidization presents interesting synergistic effect for the processing of bee pollen grains .

@highlight It was observed good fluidization of pollen grains in all the studied conditions.
@highlight The moisture diffusivity during hybrid drying increased in 30 .
@highlight The IR assisted dryer provided a saving of 52 in specific energy consumption.
@highlight The hybrid technique was more efficient without significant colour changes.
