 The behaviour of an electrochemical reactor with decaying swirling flow is analysed for the production of colloidal sulphur using sulphur dioxide from synthetic effluents as raw material . The experiments were done under potentiostatic control with single and two phase flow . The best results were obtained at a cathodic potential of 0.7V against a saturated calomel electrode . Thus in a single phase experiment at a volumetric flow rate of 8 dm

@highlight A reactor with swirling flow is suitable for electrochemical production of colloidal sulphur.
@highlight Colloidal sulphur is the main product of sulphur dioxide reduction.
@highlight Swirling flow detaches the sulphur deposited at the cathode.
@highlight The solution was completely exhausted in sulphur dioxide.
