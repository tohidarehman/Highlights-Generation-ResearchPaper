 Exploring inexpensive and efficient adsorbents is highly desirable for addressing water contamination issues . To overcome the inherent engineering drawbacks of nanostructured adsorbents a hierarchical hybrid membrane constructed by amorphous FeOOH nanosheets grown on carbonized bamboo has been successfully fabricated within several minutes via a facile electrodeposition process . Thanks to abundant binding sites amorphous nature of ultrathin FeOOH NSs and excellent pore accessibility the optimized FeOOH NSs CB membrane exhibits superior As sequestration capability in high removal efficiency fast kinetics and strong anti interfering performance . Significantly the optimized FeOOH NSs CB hybrid membrane can be directly utilized as an efficient filter unit to continuously treat 1160mL of As contaminated water to below the permitted threshold in drinking water accompanied by as high as 1528.7Lm
