 In this work Ce and Mn were added to Cu SSZ 39 zeolites by ion exchange process and their activity performance for selective catalytic reduction of NO

@highlight Ce Mn incorporation improved the activity and hydrothermal stability of Cu SSZ 39.
@highlight More active CuO crystallites and stronger acidity contribute high activity after Ce Mn addition.
@highlight Stable structure acidity and less large Cu oxides promote MnCu SSZ 39 hydrothermally stable.
@highlight Cu
@highlight ion re distribution to ion exchange sites during hydrothermal process over MnCu SSZ 39.
@highlight NH
@highlight  SCR reaction over MnCu SSZ 39 follows LH ER and Fast SCR mechanisms.
