 In an intensified fluidized bed processing of wet particles it is often to use heat transfer immersed tubes to maintain reasonable temperature distribution . The wet particles could adhere to the immersed tubes which hinders the normal fluidization . We studied the gas solid flow in a pseudo 2D fluidized bed of wet particles with the presence of immersed tubes by using CFD DEM simulation with the hysteretic contact model . The gas solid flow characteristics around the immersed tubes and the effects of immersed tubes adhesive force and fluidization velocity on the fluidization of wet particles are analyzed . With the increase of the adhesive force the agglomeration mainly occurs near the bed wall and the channeling mainly appears in the middle of the bed . The immersed tubes can cause the particles to accumulate on the upper surface of the tubes . Also it can break the bubbles and agglomerates when the fluidization velocity is high . As the fluidization becomes poor the particle agglomeration becomes more obvious and coordination number increases . The local poor fluidization zone is observed mainly in the gaps between the wall and the immersed tubes .
