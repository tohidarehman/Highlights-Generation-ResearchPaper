 Mixed matrix membranes have shown remarkable progress in the development of high performance membranes for gas separation . These membranes combine the advantageous properties of both organic polymers and highly selective inorganic fillers . Developments are in process for synthesis and modification of fillers to promote the separation performance . Ionic liquids are an emerging class of solvents having high CO
