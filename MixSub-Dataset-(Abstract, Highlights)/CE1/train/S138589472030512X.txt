 As a promising treatment modality with spatial and temporal control alternating magnetic field triggered magnetic hyperthermal therapy shows broad and promising applications to overcome the drawbacks of traditional focal therapies in combating cancer . However the MHT efficacy is still not satisfactory with the presence of heat shock proteins . In addition sustained tumor hypoxia haunts practical implications for the treatment of solid tumors . Herein a novel magnetic nanosystem composed of hollow iron oxide nanoparticles Fe

@highlight Magnetic nanoplatform was developed to overcome tumor hypoxia.
@highlight The enhanced SDT plays a great role in the alleviation of thermotolerance.
@highlight The synergistic effect between SDT MHT was revealed via modulating ROS and HSPs.
