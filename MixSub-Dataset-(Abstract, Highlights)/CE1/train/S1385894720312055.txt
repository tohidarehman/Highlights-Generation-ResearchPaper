 Heterostructure construction has been regarded as a feasible pathway for nanomaterial fabrication towards optimized properties . Despite impressive investigations on heterostructure fabrication assembling distinct polymorphs to form heterojunction has seldom been focused on relevant aspects . In this work we demonstrated tunable localized surface plasmon resonance by Cu

@highlight Cu
@highlight S CuS polymorphs were synthesized via a simple cation triggering on SnS
@highlight The transformation were mediated by a change in redox state of SnS
@highlight anion framework.
@highlight The polymorphs showed high performance in charge carrier involved photocatalysis.
@highlight The reason can be attributed to the emerging charge transfer in polymorphs.
@highlight The established catalyst exhibits high stability and is easy to be recycled.
