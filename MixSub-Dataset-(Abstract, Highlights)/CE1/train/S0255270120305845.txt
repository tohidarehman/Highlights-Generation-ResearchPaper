 Phase change material considered as a novel energy transport material can be used for modern energy storages . Nowadays the energy transport enhancement can be achieved using the extended heat transference surface . The present research is devoted to numerical simulation of thermal convection of nano encapsulated phase change material within a square differentially heated chamber under an influence of solid fins of different location sizes and number . The governing equations of conjugate convective energy transport written using the non dimensional primitive variables have been worked out by the finite element technique . The developed computational code has been verified employing computational and experimental results of other authors . Impacts of number of solid fins 1
