 The bone defects caused by trauma tumor resections and congenital diseases can lead to deformity and dysfunction . Developing a biodegradable scaffold with tunable osteogenesis and degradation rates is highly essential for improving bone defect regeneration . Eggshell is a kind of natural biomaterial of which the major inorganic component is CaCO

@highlight Waste chicken eggshell was used as template for the synthesis of CaCO
@highlight  MgO nanocomposites.
@highlight The as prepared CaCO
@highlight  MgO nanocomposites and Chitosan were integrated into a biomimetic scaffold.
@highlight The composite scaffold exhibited significant mineralization ability and strong osteogenic differentiation potential.
