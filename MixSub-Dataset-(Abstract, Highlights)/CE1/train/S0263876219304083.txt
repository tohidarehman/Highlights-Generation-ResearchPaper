 This paper studied the model based design of experiment for nonlinear dynamical systems with unknown state delay and continuous state inequalities . The design problem is formulated as a time delay optimal control problem of a dynamic system governed by augmented sensitivity state equations . Consider the co existence of control delay and multiple state delays in the ASSE each continuous state inequality constraint is approximated by an integral constraint using a constraint handling technique based on local smoothing approximation and constraint transcription which guaranteed the satisfaction of state inequality constraints during the experiment . In addition an efficient numerical procedure is derived to determine the gradients of the objective function and constraints which involved integrating an auxiliary impulsive time delay system backward in time . The procedure is combined with standard gradient based optimization methods to solve the MBDoE SDCSI problem . The performance of the proposed scheme is illustrated through the experimental design of a fed batch biomass fermentation process .
