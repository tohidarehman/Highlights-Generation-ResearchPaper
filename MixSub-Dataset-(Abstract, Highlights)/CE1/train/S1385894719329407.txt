 As a novel photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy black phosphorus has attracted increasing attention recently . However some of its inherent drawbacks hinder its further biomedical applications . As with most conventional photosensitizers the PDT efficiency of BP is severely limited by the hypoxia tumor microenvironment and low tissue penetration of ultraviolet visible light . Moreover BP also faces additional problems such as mismatch wavelength between photothermal therapy and PDT as well as no imaging ability for cancer diagnosis . Herein we addressed these challenges through the combination of Fe
