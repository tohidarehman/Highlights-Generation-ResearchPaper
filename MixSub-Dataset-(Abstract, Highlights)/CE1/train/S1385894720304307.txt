 A simple method has been designed for preparing a new material based on the interactions of cellulose acetate cetyltrimethylammonium bromide with tetraethyl orthosilicate in alcohol . In a second step the material is loaded with molybdate . The nano objects produced by this procedure are characterized as microporous hollow spheres with a morphology similar to hollow wagon wheels . These materials were used not only for As removal for Mo but also for naked eye detection of As in solution . The chemical and physical characteristics of these nano objects have been analyzed through XRD FTIR HR TEM EDX TGA DTG and N

@highlight Simple synthesis of hollowwagon wheel sorbent with CA CTAB sacrificed template .
@highlight High surface area microporous hollow spheres of
@highlight  VI for As V sorption.
@highlight Pseudo first order rate and Sips equations for modeling kinetics and isotherms.
@highlight Used as naked eye sensor the material detects As V at level as low as 0.3M.
@highlight Efficient As V desorption using 1mM NaOH solution and high recycling performance.
