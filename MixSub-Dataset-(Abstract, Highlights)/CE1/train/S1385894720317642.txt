 Three dimensional basswood materials were successfully applied to construct molecularly imprinted nanocomposite membranes for the first time . Importantly in this work the TiO

@highlight Basswood was used as the supporting membrane for the preparation of imprinting materials.
@highlight TiO
@highlight TC imprinted surface was designed and prepared.
@highlight Well designed multilevel hierarchical 3DW MIMs were first proposed and applied as selective separation membranes.
@highlight High rebinding capacity and permselectivity performance could be simultaneously obtained.
