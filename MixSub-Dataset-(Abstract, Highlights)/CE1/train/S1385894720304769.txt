 Microporous polymer monoliths have demonstrated high robustness convenient recyclability effective accessibility and impressive catalytic activity in heterogeneous catalysis when employed as catalyst or catalyst support . However their synthesis is restricted by complicated synthetic conditions the use of expensive monomers and inconvenient processing . Hence the design and development of simple versatile and low cost strategy for their synthesis is highly desired . Herein we report a facile strategy to prepare functionalized hierarchical porous polymeric monoliths via a two step method i.e . the copolymerization of high internal phase emulsion followed by external knitting . The hierarchical porous structure that consists of interconnected macropores and abundant micro mesopores was confirmed by SEM and N
