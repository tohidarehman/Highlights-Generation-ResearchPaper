 Photocatalysis has received significant attention as a technology that can solve global energy and environmental issues that are essential for the sustainable development of society . The use of solar light and separated photo generated charges plays an important role in enhancing photocatalytic efficiency . Constructing heterostructure based full solar light driven photocatalysts is a sensible method for widening the solar light response and accelerating charge migration . This review comprehensively summarizes progress in heterostructure development for use in full solar light driven photocatalytic systems including basic photo response theory photocatalytic mechanisms and applications including environmental decontamination water splitting CO
