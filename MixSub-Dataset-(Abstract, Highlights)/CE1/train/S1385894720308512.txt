 To improve the removal of pharmaceutical and personal care products from contaminated water a novel electrolysis integrated tidal flow constructed wetland system was developed . E TFCWs have the highest removal efficiency for the four investigated PPCPs when the electrodes are arranged at the bottom of the E TFCWs . The removal efficiency of four PPCPs increases from 4.41 to 11.71 to 28.83 68.32 when using electrolysis combined with tidal flow constructed wetlands . The synergy effect for the degradation of PPCPs between electrolysis and constructed wetlands on the degradation of PPCPs in E TFCWs were significant while the removal efficiency of PPCPs after the electrolysis is higher than that before electrolysis and electrolysis process accounting for 42.81 68.47 . Electrolysis can enhance the removal of PPCPs through direct oxidation . Moreover the increase in intermediate oxidation compounds in the E TFCWs may imply the enhanced biodegradability of PPCPs during the electrolysis process since the by products of PPCPs were identified .
