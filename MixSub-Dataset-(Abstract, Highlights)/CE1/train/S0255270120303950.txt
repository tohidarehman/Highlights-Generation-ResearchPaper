 Curcumin a natural and non polar pigment of turmeric was used to produce oil in water nanodispersion based on intensified process using subcritical water and Tween 20 as solvent and emulsifier respectively . Response surface methodology was used to obtain optimum temperature ranging 100140 C and heating time from 60 to 180 min at constant pressure of 1.5 atm to prepare nanodispersions . Curcumin nanodispersion with minimum particles size of 15.15 nm and polydispersity index of 0.345 and maximum zeta potential of 13.24 mV was successfully formed using temperature and heating time of 115 C and 155 min respectively . Further analysis indicated that transparency colloidal solution containing dispersed and spherical curcumin nanoparticles had yellow colour with positive b value of 2.75 L value of 2.95 and turbidity of 0.065 NTU with apparent viscosity of 1.19 mPa.s . In addition maximum loading ability of 0.181 g L and efficiency of 90.5 and minimum total curcumin loss of 9.5 were achieved at optimum preparation conditions . Results revealed that prepared curcumin nanodispersion had potent antioxidant activity with high bactericidal activity toward both

@highlight Curcumin O W nanodispersion was prepared using subcritical water as solvent.
@highlight Nanodispersions with desirable properties were formed at 115.16 C and 154.4 min.
@highlight Formed nanodispersions had highest loading ability and efficiency with lowest loss.
@highlight Prepared nanodispersions have potent high antioxidant and antibacterial activities.
