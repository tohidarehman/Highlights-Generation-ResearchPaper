 This publication presents a simple and low cost hydrothermal humification treatment of sewage sludge together with alkali ash and biomass for simultaneous implementation of heavy metal removal nutrient recovery and ash refining . The H C and O C atomic ratio plots obtained from elemental analysis demonstrate that dehydration and decarboxylation under hydrothermal conditions are elemental reactions leading to sludge biomass decomposition and artificial humic matter formation . Introduction of plant biomass into sludge derived samples and adjustment of KOH or alkali ash mass effectively improve the recovery of P element realizing high contents of dissolved phosphorus at appropriate pH values . ICP AES results indicate the drop of Cr and Cd content below detection limit together with a sharp decrease of the elements Cu Zn and Pb after HTH treatment in sludge derived liquid products and the heavy metal elements enriched in sludge derived solids can be recovered into industrial salts by subsequent treatment . Pot planting experiments are conducted to investigate the P availability in both sludge derived liquids and solids for promotion of plant growth . A higher proportion of shoot to root weight 62.1

@highlight A novel hydrothermal humification HTH was used for the treatment of wastewater sludge.
@highlight HTH allowed the recycling of sludge with close to complete recovery of the valuable phosphate.
@highlight HTH effectively reduced the environmental risk of heavy metals from sludge.
@highlight Ternary biomass added to sludge change the extraction efficiency of P and K.
@highlight The optimized process is an all waste strategy route for sludge valorization.
