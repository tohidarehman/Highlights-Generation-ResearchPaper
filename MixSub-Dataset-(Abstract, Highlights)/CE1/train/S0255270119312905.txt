 In Taylor flow the low velocity in liquid film around the bubbles limits the mass transfer between the bubble body and liquid phase . To overcome this deficiency a cross junction

@highlight A novel microchannel with air cavity in side walls is designed and processed.
@highlight The liquid film and bubble deformation are investigated by comparative experiment.
@highlight The renewal of liquid film and specific surface area are improved.
@highlight Velocity slip and radial fluctuation are enhancement mechanism of liquid transport.
