 Development of high energy density lithium metal batteries with high cycling stability is becoming more and more important . In this study a novel and reliable electrolyte additive 2 Fluoropyridine was successfully applied to enhance the stability of different commercial liquid electrolytes and effectively improve the performance of LMBs for the first time . The 2 FP additive was found to play a critical role in the decrease of Li nucleation as well as deposition overpotential and finally supressing the Li dendrites . As a result the high voltage LiNi

@highlight 2 Fluoropyridine is firstly used as an electrolyte additive for lithium metal batteries.
@highlight The additive worked well with a reduced amount of commercial electrolyte.
@highlight The functions of 2 Fluoropyridine were proved by experiments and DFT calculations.
@highlight The batteries with high areal capacity showed improved high voltage and cycling stability.
