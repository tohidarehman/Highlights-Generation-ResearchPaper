 Economizers in preheat systems represent a method for process intensification that has been widely applied . Despite its long history control problems have been reported and attributed to thermal interaction and feedback . A recent paper studied the use of several heat exchanger configurations for preheating streams in an extractive distillation column with a sidestream . The hot solvent recycle stream can be used to preheat the fresh feed to the extractive column or it can be used to preheat the liquid sidestream from the extractive column that is fed to the solvent recovery column . A third alternative that is the most energy efficient uses two economizers in series the first preheating the sidestream and the second preheating the fresh feed . However dynamic controllability issues were experienced that were attributed to positive feedback of thermal energy . A heat exchanger bypass control structure was proposed to handle the problem .

@highlight An extractive distillation system with a sidestream and two feed preheaters is studied.
@highlight Thermal interaction in the economizer heat exchangers can occur if there is two phase heat transfer.
@highlight Avoiding two phase heat transfer in distillation preheat systems is demonstrated to improve dynamic controllability.
