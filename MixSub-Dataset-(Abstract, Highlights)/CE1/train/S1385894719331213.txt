 Wastewater containing highly toxic non biodegradable and carcinogenic organic dyes and metal ions has been regarded as a severe threat to ecological environment and human health . Thus it is of great significance to develop an effective approach to purify this kind of wastewater . Herein novel magnetic adsorbent

@highlight Multifunctional magnetic composite nanoparticles were facilely prepared.
@highlight The as prepared
@highlight showed excellent adsorption capacities for cationic dyes.
@highlight exhibited satisfactory removal rates for metal ions in a wide pH range.
@highlight The good adsorption ability was attributed to abundant active sites from CS PAA.
@highlight s good stability and reusability facilitated its practical application.
