 In this work ultrasound assisted zero valent iron activated peroxymonosulfate oxidation was used to improve the dewaterability of aerobically digested sludge . Capillary suction time reduction centrifuged weight reduction and water content of sludge cake were determined to evaluate AeDS dewaterability . The results showed that the optimal reaction time PMS dosage ZVI dosage and US power were 20min 50mg g total solids 100mg g TS and 50W respectively . Under the optimum conditions CST reduction Wc and CWR were 89.2 67.9 and 40.4 respectively . The quenching experiments showed that sulfate radical was the dominant radical species in the US ZVI PMS system while hydroxyl radical in the ZVI PMS system . Compared to ZVI PMS treatment US ZVI PMS treatment was more conducive to improve sludge dewaterability suggesting that US assistance destructed the passive film of ZVI and accelerated its corrosion consequently resulting in more production of sulfate radical . The significant degradation of tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances of AeDS after US ZVI PMS treatment led to the releases of EPS bound water and even the intracellular water consequently improving AeDS dewaterability . Additionally US ZVI PMS treatment presented the advantages of sludge disintegration and charge neutralization . The ZVI cycle tests demonstrated that the reusability and stability of the recovered ZVI in the US ZVI PMS system were desirable leading to the cost savings .

@highlight US ZVI PMS improved effectively the dewaterability of aerobically digested sludge.
@highlight Reaction time ZVI and PMS dosages and US power were optimized.
@highlight US and ZVI had a synergetic impact on PMS activation in the US ZVI PMS system.
@highlight The release of EPS bound water resulted in the enhanced dewaterability.
@highlight The recovered ZVI reusability was desirable and US ZVI PMS is economically favorable.
