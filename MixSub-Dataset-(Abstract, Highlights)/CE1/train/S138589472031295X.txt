 2 5 diformylfuran is a key near market platform chemical that has been widely used to synthesize various useful compounds . In this study a unique biomimetic system was developed by splitting the oxidation process into multi step redox circulations which can increase markedly the activity and selectivity for the aerobic oxidation 5 hydroxymethylfurfural to DFF . An Anderson type catalyst CeCu

@highlight An biomimetic catalyst CeCu OH 
@highlight Mo
@highlight was employed in reaction of HMF to DFF.
@highlight The yield of DFF could reach 99 under quite mild conditions.
@highlight The Mo
@highlight and Ce
@highlight species play very important roles in the oxidation process.
@highlight Ce
@highlight species was employed as ETMs and CuMo
@highlight anion was used as the electron donor.
