 The improvement in the long term corrosion resistance of conducting polymer coatings was essential for protecting metal bipolar plate in proton exchange membrane fuel cell . In this study carbon powders were functionalized with polydopamine to create a more negative charge surface and their morphologies were examined by TEM test . Then polypyrrole coating was successfully electropolymerized on 304 stainless steel in the presence of carbon powders . Therefore the conducting property of PPy coating could be restored by incorporating carbon powders when the coating suffered aggressive attack . The structure morphology and thermal stability properties of the synthesized PPy PPy C and PPy C PDA coatings were investigated using SEM AFM FTIR and TG analysis . The anti corrosion performances were also investigated in a simulated PEMFC working environment 0.1M H

@highlight The PDA powder improves the conductivity adhesion and barrier of PPy coating.
@highlight PPy C PDA coated 304SS exhibits a high corrosion resistance during 720h immersion.
@highlight Lower contact resistance of PPy C PDA coated 304SS is achieved.
@highlight Mechanisms of durable anti corrosion performance of PPy C PDA coating are studied.
