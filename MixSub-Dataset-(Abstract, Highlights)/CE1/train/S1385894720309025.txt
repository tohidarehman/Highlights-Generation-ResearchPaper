 Polymer based composites with high dielectric constant and low loss are highly desirable due to their inherent advantages of easy processability flexibility and lightweight . Herein a functional nanofillers halloysite nanotubes decorated reduced graphene oxide hybrid microstructures

@highlight hybrid microstructures were prepared via controllable electrostatic self assembly.
@highlight microstructures exhibited good dispersion in the PVB composites.
@highlight The composites showed high dielectric constant and low dielectric loss.
@highlight The mechanism of the enhancement in dielectric performance was systematically discussed.
