 The high efficiency synthesis of biofuel valerolactone from biomass derived levulinates is a challenging task . The Meerwein Ponndorf Verley reduction with its extraordinary chemoselectivity is advantageous for the hydrogenation process compared to the molecular hydrogen based process using noble metal catalysts . Therefore we used a classical Al based isopropoxide to catalyze transfer hydrogenation of methyl levulinate to GVL . A high yield of GVL up to 97.6 could be achieved using 2 proponal as the H donor and solvent under mild conditions . Besides three reaction stages were observed in the conversion including transesterification hydrogenation and cyclization . LC MS analysis and the density functional theory caculations revealed that Al atom of Al O

@highlight Al OiPr 
@highlight exhibited high efficiency on conversion of ML to GVL under mild conditions.
@highlight ML was prone to undergo transesterification than direct hydrogenation.
@highlight Al atom activated ester carbonyl of ML before activating the ketone carbonyl.
@highlight 2 Propanol participated in the cyclization process as proton transfer carrier.
