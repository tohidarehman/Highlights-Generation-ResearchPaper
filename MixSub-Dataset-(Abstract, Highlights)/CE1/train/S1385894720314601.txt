 Multicomponent photocatalysts loaded with two interfacial co catalysts may exhibit greater improvement in hydrogen evolution than those without any co catalyst or with only one co catalyst . Two major issues should be solved in developing such photocatalysts . One is how to obtain photocatalysts with two interfacial co catalysts by a controllable approach . The other is what are key factors affecting photocatalytic activity . In this study TiO
