 Monoacylated symmetrical diamines are building blocks or intermediates of several well established drugs . However for the symmetrical diamines the two amine groups located in a similar chemical environment make the selective monoacylation rather difficult and no kinetics study has ever been reported before . To comprehend this kind of reaction more deeply a continuous flow microfluidic system was developed to evaluate the reaction kinetics of

@highlight The kinetics of
@highlight  phenylenediamine monoacylation was studied in a microreactor.
@highlight The possible reaction mechanism was postulated from the kinetics study.
@highlight The accuracy of the kinetic model was proved by validation experiments.
@highlight The effect of each parameter on selectivity was studied by the kinetic model.
