 With the development of flexible wearable electronic devices energy storage equipment like supercapacitor with high energy density good mechanical properties and safety has attracted more and more attention . However the currently existing energy storage materials normally suffer from several drawbacks such as poor flexibility hidden danger toxicity and especially low energy density limiting their practical applications . Expanding the voltage window by employing the hydrogel electrolyte is regarded as an effective method to improve the energy density of supercapacitor . Herein we employ a zwitterionic natural polymer hydrogel with excellent mechanical strength and flexibility as electrolyte to assemble a solid state zinc ion hybrid supercapacitor with Zn foil and activated carbon electrode . The H ZHS exhibits an amazingly wide and stable voltage window of 2.4V high maximum energy density of 286.6 Wh kg
