 Recently designed a multiframe flat sheet membrane contactors consisting in ten parallel frames alternating aqueous and organic phase was successfully used for chromium removal from aqueous solution . As a result five chambers contain aqueous phase and the others contain the organic phase . Aliquat 336 was used as a carrier using polypropylene flat sheet membrane for Chromium removal . The results show that the extraction was more efficient by increasing the inlet chromium concentration and the number of frames but was not affected by the increasing of the thickness of frames .
