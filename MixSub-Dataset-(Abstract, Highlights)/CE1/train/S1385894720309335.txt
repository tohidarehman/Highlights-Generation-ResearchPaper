 Disulfide bonds are commonly exploited as dynamic crosslinks to fabricate degradable self healing hydrogels . However the low energy dissipation capability and low density of disulfide crosslinks in the hydrogel networks give these hydrogels poor mechanical properties slow and non autonomous self healing and incomplete polymer degradation . This paper reports a strategy for synthesizing multifunctional hydrogels by copolymerizing 2 3 dimercapto 1 propanol and

@highlight Novel poly disulfide based hydrogels with multifunctional properties are designed.
@highlight They show very fast self healing in air and underwater without external stimuli.
@highlight They show extraordinary stretchability and fast complete degradability.
@highlight They have good electrical conductivity and non cytotoxicity.
@highlight These hydrogels can be used for 3D printing both in air and underwater.
