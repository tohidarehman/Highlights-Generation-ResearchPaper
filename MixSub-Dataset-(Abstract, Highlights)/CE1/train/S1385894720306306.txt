 Nanoscale zero valent iron is easy to agglomerate and be oxidized by surrounding media and even can t be prepared continuously which have seriously restricted its application in environmental restoration . Herein we report a facile technique for the continuous preparation of nZVI with excellent dispersion and stability on a large scale using impinging stream rotating packed bed as the reactor and chitosan as the stabilizer . The effects of high gravity factor liquid flow and the additive amount of chitosan on the removal capacity of the chitosan stabilized nZVI were investigated . It was discovered that the removal capacity toward Cr was firstly increased and then reduced with each operating parameter increasing . The reactivity of CS nZVI prepared via different reactors and IS RPB was studied through the removal of Cr . With enhancement mass transfer and rapid micromixing capacities of IS RPB reactor CS nZVI prepared in IS RPB had higher reaction rate constant 0.0836min

@highlight The chitosan stabilized nZVI were prepared through IS RPB reactor in a large scale.
@highlight Production rate of the nanoparticles reached 1.21kgh
@highlight The nanoparticles exhibited better dispersibility and stability.
@highlight They also showed higher reactivity for removal of Cr VI .
