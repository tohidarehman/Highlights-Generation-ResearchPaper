 Numerical studies are carried out to explore thermo fluidic transport characteristics of laminar flow through tubular heat exchangers using a compound technique which is formed from the combination of twisted tape with twisted tube . The twisted tape is installed inside a twisted tube which has an elliptical cross section . Both minor and major arrangements are examined and the obtained results are compared with those of the straight tube as well as straight tube equipped with twisted tape and twisted tube . The comparison is made for three different levels of twist pitch and five Reynolds numbers . Our results show that the dependence of transport characteristics on the enhanced models is strongly affected by both the twist pitch and the Reynolds number . In contrast to the heat transfer performance it is found that the pressure drop of the ST TT is always more than that of the TT . However the highest values are recorded for the TT TT minor and the TT TT major . At the range studied the best overall hydrothermal performance is obtained for the TT TT minor while the ST TT and the TT TT major have comparable performances . The results display that increasing twist pitch and Reynolds number leads to better overall performance in all models . The maximum performance index of 3.21 is found for the TT TT minor at the Reynolds number of 1800 . The results of the current analysis may be considered as a basis for selection of flow path geometry for design of tubular heat exchangers .
