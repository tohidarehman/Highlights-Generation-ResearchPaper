 Laponite nanodiscs are low cost synthetic silicate clay with extreme hydrophilic behavior . Therefore laponite can be used to enhance pervaporation membranes performance . Poly laponite pervaporation membranes were fabricated via simple exfoliation method of the nanoclay in the polymer solution followed by chemical crosslinking using glutaraldehyde . The fabricated membranes were employed to study the pervaporation desalination performance when treating reverse osmosis concentrated brine solution . The effect of nanofiller concentration on membrane properties as well as the water diffusion coefficient through the membrane swelling measurements was investigated . The highest rejection of 99.98 was achieved using 7 wt laponite nanocomposite membrane at 40 C with a flux of 31.2 kg m
