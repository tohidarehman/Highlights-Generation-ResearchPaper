 Here we report for the first time the fabrication of a glassy polymer nickel oxide hybrid membrane as a gas separation membrane . A PI is used as a continuous phase and nickel oxide nanoparticles were utilized as a dispersed phase . The structure of mixed matrix and pure Matrimid membranes are investigated by employing various characterization techniques including scanning electron microscopy Fourier transforms infrared differential scanning calorimetry X ray diffraction and tensile stress strain to characterize the NiO nanoparticles . The effect of NiO nanoparticles content 05
