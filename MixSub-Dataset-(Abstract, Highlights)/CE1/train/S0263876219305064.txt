 A linear analytical solution to the principal stress cap force balance equations for asymmetrical stress in a circular silo has been derived . Principal stress relationships are linearly through gradients J

@highlight A simple analytical solution for ecc stresses in silos has been obtained.
@highlight The model compares well with physical data.
@highlight A dangerous exponential stress regime has been theoretically identified.
@highlight The model is quick and may be a base case for mode detailed studies.
