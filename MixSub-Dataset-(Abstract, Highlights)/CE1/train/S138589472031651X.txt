 At present photocorrosion is one of the factors that seriously restrict the improvement of photocatalytic performance . Herein we successfully constructed AgVO

@highlight A photocatalyst solved two urgent problems simultaneously that is it has the property of One Stone and Two Birds.
@highlight Effects of various parameters on Cr VI reduction were studied systematically.
@highlight Toxicity assessment after photocatalytic reaction were studied.
@highlight The 20 AgVO
@highlight  ZnIn
@highlight exhibited the top flight photoreduction Cr VI activity.
@highlight AgVO
@highlight  ZnIn
@highlight were universal for photodegradation of Cr VI and antibiotics.
