 Recently developing insoluble cross linkable functional layers plays a vital role for solution processed organic light emitting diodes . Here two vinyl based cross linkable hole transporting materials V TPAVTPD and V TPAVCBP are designed and synthesized . Additionally cationic photoinitiator 4 octyloxydiphenyliodonium hexafluoroantimonate is first introduced to chemically induce vinyl based photo cross linking process aiming at lowering cross linking temperature and enhancing hole mobility . As a result cross linking can occur at expressly low temperature of 120C with 95 solvent resistance . Moreover hole mobility is markedly enhanced with the value higher than 10
