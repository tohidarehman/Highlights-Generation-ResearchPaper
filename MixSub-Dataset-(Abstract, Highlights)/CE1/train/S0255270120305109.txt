 Methanol to aromatics process not only involves the dehydrogenation aromatization reactions but also the undesirable side reactions . As produced aromatics composition was not favorable for the subsequent para xylene manufacturing process in the MTA plant . In this study we proposed the decentralized methonal feed strategy for process intensification of MTA and compared the effects of the centralized feed and decentralized feed on MTA reaction . It was found that the decentralized feed could weaken the occurrence of side reactions and affect the product distribution the aromatics yield produced no change though . By inhibiting the dealkylation and disproportionation and isomerization reactions the decentralized feed decreased the yields of benzene and toluene while increased the xylene yield and PX selectivity in X beyond thermodynamic equilibrium which is highly expected in industry . With the decentralized feed the restricted hydrogen transfer reaction increased olefins and C5 non aromatics which could be further converted into aromatics and reduced unwanted alkanes . Our methodology of process intensification provided insight into product distribution optimization to match large materials flow in terms of PX production in the MTA plant .
