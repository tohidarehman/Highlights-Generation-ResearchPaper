 High temperature Sodium sulfur batteries have been commercial owing to their high energy density . However their extra safety and cost issues caused by high temperature inhibits their wide application . Recently room temperature Na S batteries have attracted widespread attention due to the low cost and excellent energy density . Nevertheless they still suffer from the poor conductivity sluggish redox kinetics and shuttle effect . Herein the incorporated polar Co

@highlight C Co is fabricated and evaluated for Na S batteries at room temperature.
@highlight Efficient physisorption chemisorption and electrocatalytic conversion are achieved.
@highlight Superior cycle and rate performances confirm the effective NaPSs shuttling relief.
