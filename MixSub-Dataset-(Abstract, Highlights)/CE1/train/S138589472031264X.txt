 Developing convenient and rapid method for eliminating uranium from massive contaminated water under emergency conditions is highly needed . Herein we developed a novel chemical precipitation strategy based on graphene aerogel capsulated with the degradation products of phytic acid . With hydrothermal treatment graphene oxide was twisted and reduced to generate aerogel acting as an encapsulator . At the same time phytic acid was degraded into various compounds and capsulated into graphene aerogel with a high loading capacity of 85g g. After adding PAGA into uranium contaminated water the degradation products were released out of GA skeleton to combined with uranium and form sediments . The elimination capacity reached up to 3550mg g within 40min and the obtained sediments possessed good stability in the following 72h . PAGA capsule also presented high removal rate in various water systems making it a kind of versatile material in the elimination of uranium under emergency conditions .
