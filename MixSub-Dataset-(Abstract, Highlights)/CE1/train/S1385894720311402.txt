 Highly crystalline boron nitride nanotubes having multi walls and a small diameter were synthesized using a triple DC thermal plasma reactor with hydrogen injection . Triple torch configuration not only generates larger high temperature regions than single torch but also allow precursors to directly penetrate the core of the plasma flame the hottest area in the reactor . A triple torch increases the productivity of BNNT synthesis by preventing the flow of precursors into the rim of plasma flame a problem that occurs with single torch due to the high velocity and viscosity of the central flame . The role of hydrogen in the growth of BNNTs was analyzed by thermodynamic equilibrium reaction calculations and numerical analysis of thermal flow in the system . The reaction calculations revealed that hydrogen facilitates the formation of NH NH
