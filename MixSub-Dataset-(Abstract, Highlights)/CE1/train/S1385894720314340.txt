 Thermosetting resins with narrow processing window are difficult to be processed by conventional melting processing methods . In this paper a novel molding sintering processing method inspired by powder metallurgy was introduced to address the processing issue of thermosetting resin with narrow processing window . Bio based adenine phthalonitrile was employed to verify the processability of MSP . Results demonstrated that ADCN resin processed by MSP possess excellent thermal and thermomechanical properties . Furthermore MSP not only handle the processing issue of thermosetting resin with narrow processing window but also introduce the characteristics such as reducing composition segregation into thermosetting system . Graphene and ADCN composite was prepared to demonstrate the characteristic mentioned above . PADCN composite with graphene spread uniformly has been prepared by ball milling blending MSP method . Preliminary research indicated the outstanding electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness of graphene ADCN composite .
