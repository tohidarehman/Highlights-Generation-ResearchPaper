 Colorimetric methods for Fe determination based on complexation of heterocyclic amines such as phenanthroline and ferrozine have been widely used for analysis of iron species in solution which is critical to discuss the mechanism of Fenton and related reaction systems . However the reliability of both methods in the background of hydrogen peroxide has never been addressed . In this study we demonstrate that serious Fe overestimation possibly occurs for both methods in Fenton systems particularly for the Phen method . A systematic variation of incubation conditions reveals that the available Fe concentration depends greatly on the incubation time after mixing the colorimetric reagents with the sample . Also it is highly sensitive to pH and temperature as well as the initial concentrations of Fe H

@highlight Fe II in Fenton systems could be overestimated by classical colorimetric methods.
@highlight Phen and FZ accelerate Fe III reduction by H
@highlight The addition NH
@highlight F could improve the stability and accuracy of both protocols.
