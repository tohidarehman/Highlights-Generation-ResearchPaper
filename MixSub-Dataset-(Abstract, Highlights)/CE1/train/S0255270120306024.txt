 Since the demand for gluconic acid has increased during the last years alternative processes to minimize its production costs associated to raw material and separation are being developed . In this study a hybrid process consisting of gluconic acid production by a multi enzyme system with an

@highlight Enzymes activity is not affected by the liquid membrane.
@highlight gluconic acid removal enhances the hybrid system performance.
@highlight pH in the multi enzyme system can be controlled by the liquid membrane operation.
@highlight Low levels of ion strength improve gluconic acid multi enzyme production.
