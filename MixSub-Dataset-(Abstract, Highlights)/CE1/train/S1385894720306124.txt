 Bone implant associated infection is one of the major concerns in orthopedics and may even result in implant failure . To this end we developed a strategy for the fabrication of an antibacterial coating on titanium implants with pH response to combat bacteria mediated acidification of the local microenvironment . It includes three steps first we synthesized levofloxacin loaded zeolitic imidazolate framework 8

@highlight The
@highlight  LBL coating is fabricated on titanium implants.
@highlight The coating displays pH response while then inducing alkaline microenvironment.
@highlight The surface coated titanium implants show strong antibacterial activity
@highlight The fabricated biocompatible titanium implants enhance bone formation
