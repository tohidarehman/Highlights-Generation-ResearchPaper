 The search for efficient cheap and robust sorbent materials which can effectively remove iodine compounds from off gas streams in used nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities is still challenging . Herein we report the development of bismuth doped mordenite zeolite with different loadings for removal of iodine 129

@highlight Development of bismuth doped mordenite adsorbents with various bismuth loadings.
@highlight Higher surface area and porosity for the bismuth modernite than that for bare mordenite.
@highlight 2.5 fold increase in iodine capacity for bismuth modernite than that for bare mordenite.
@highlight 36 of iodine release to water from the iodine loaded adsorbents.
