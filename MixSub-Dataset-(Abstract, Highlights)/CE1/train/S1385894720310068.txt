 Thermocatalysis and photocatalysis have been widely investigated to removal of volatile organic compounds . However thermocatalysis needs high temperature to activate oxygen species therefore resulting in additional energy consumption . Meanwhile photocatalysis suffers the rapid charge recombination and the slow surface process . Herein we combined thermocatalysis and photocatalysis into a free standing composite film catalyst that was prepared through a facile filtration method using two dimensional graphene oxide manganese oxide MnO
