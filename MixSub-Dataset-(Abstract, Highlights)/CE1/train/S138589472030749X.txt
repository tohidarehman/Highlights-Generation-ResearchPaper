 To develop a low cost efficient and environmentally benign technique for the simultaneous removal of heavy metals and organic contaminants is a great challenge in practical wastewater treatment . In this work a novel iron modified rectorite composite was prepared via the degradation of Rhodamine B in a Fenton like process and used for the simultaneous degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride and reduction of Cr through heterogeneous photo Fenton processes . The results reveal that the introduction of RhB to the rectorite could induce more iron ions into its interlayers which accelerates the decomposition of H

@highlight The simultaneous removal of a heavy metal and organic contaminant was achieved.
