 Chitosan are deemed as a promising candidate to environmentally friendly materials owing to the inexpensive biodegradable and rich reserves . Nevertheless the application of chitosan materials still confronts chemical instability and low mechanical strength . In this study we grow ultrafine nitrogen doped TiO
