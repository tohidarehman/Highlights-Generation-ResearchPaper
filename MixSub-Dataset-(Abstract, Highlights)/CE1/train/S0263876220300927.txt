 This work investigates the effect of adsorbent geometry on diffusion mechanisms assuming form factors as a new approach in the conception of mass transfer model . Experimental nickel adsorption on activated carbon and sugarcane bagasse were selected as case studies . According to SEM images the activated carbon geometry can be approximated as a sphere with sphericity of 0.47 while the sugarcane bagasse geometry was considered an infinite cylinder . In both cases the equilibrium data were suitable elucidated by Sips isotherm and the thermodynamic parameters revealed exothermic and spontaneous adsorption process . The numerical solution of the diffusional model was developed and presented in detail considering the geometry of each case study . Finite difference approximations and nonlinear least squares methods have been successfully used to estimate and predict the dynamic adsorption behavior in terms of mass transfer phenomena . It was observed that the adsorption rate was influenced by the geometry and textural characteristics of the adsorbents . Both surface diffusion and pore volume diffusion presented a significant contribution in the activated carbon adsorption . However only surface diffusion was significant in the sugarcane bagasse adsorption since its porosity is three times lower than activated carbon .

@highlight The effect of adsorbent geometry was investigated on the diffusion mechanisms.
@highlight As a new approach form factor was incorporated into the diffusional model.
@highlight PVSDM model was the most appropriate to represent the kinetic data for activated carbon.
@highlight Surface diffusion represented over 97 of intraparticle diffusion for sugarcane bagasse.
@highlight Adsorption rate was influenced by the geometry and textural characteristics of the adsorbents.
