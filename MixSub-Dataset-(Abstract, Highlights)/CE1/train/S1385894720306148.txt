 Thermoregulating textiles are highly demanded for both human health and labor productivity especially in hot working environments . It is challenging to balance wearability and thermal insulating property as they usually demand for opposite porosity . Here learning from the porous structure of polar bear hair we report a polyimide aerogel fiber obtained by a freeze spinning technique . A textile woven with such polyimide fiber is thermally insulating strong and highly stretchable fire retardant and temperature resistant . Additionally it can be readily incorporated with other functions such as acid alkali resistance and thermoregulation by surface modification and infiltration of phase change material . All these properties indicate its potential in protective clothing in hot environments . With the versatility and scalability our approach paves a new way for fabricating smart textiles with well defined microstructure and multifunctionality by learning from nature .

@highlight Overcome fragileness of polyimide aerogels by building biomimetic porous structure.
@highlight The fiber is mechanically strong and highly stretchable at a high porosity.
@highlight The fiber shows excellent thermal insulation property even at up to 500C.
@highlight Other functions such as acid alkali resistant and thermoregulation.
