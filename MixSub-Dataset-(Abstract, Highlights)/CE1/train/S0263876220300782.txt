 Fracturing fluid filtration loss is a significant research topic related to fracture propagation formation damage and the cost of hydraulic fracturing . To reduce the loss nanoparticles have been used to enhance the fracturing fluid properties such as viscosity and well building ability . In this work silica nanoparticles with different concentrations were added into the viscoelastic surfactant fluid composed of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and sodium salicylate . A micro pore throat structure was applied to investigate the flow characteristics of those three fracturing fluids with Deborah numbers
