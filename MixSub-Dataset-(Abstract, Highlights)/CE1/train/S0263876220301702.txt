 To date there is no information on the microfluidic emulsification of dibutyl adipate and n butyl acetate in water . Since these solvents are very suitable for microencapsulation by interfacial polymerization it is highly necessary to study the emulsification behavior of these solvents in microchannels . This work shows that the microfluidic emulsification of these solvents in water may fail to obtain stabilised flow regimes . This is due to droplet coalescence and wall wetting even if a hydrophilic microchip is used . Hydrodynamic results show that squeezing and dripping regimes are especially affected because of the wall wetting by the dispersed phase . This difficulty can be circumvented by adding a surfactant into the aqueous phase . However high surfactant concentrations should be used for the water dibutyl adipate system . Indeed comparison of flow maps for several surfactant concentrations seems to indicate that the dynamic interfacial tension is higher than the one expected for surfactant concentrations lower than one hundred times the critical micelle concentration . The estimated diffusion time of Tween 80 is compared to the droplet formation time at different conditions . The choice of more appropriate dimensionless numbers to represent flow maps is also discussed .

@highlight The wetting behavior of two green solvents are studied in a glass microchannel.
@highlight Partial wetting of the solvents modifies the flow maps without adding any surfactant.
@highlight High surfactant concentration 10CMC should be used to stabilize droplet formation.
@highlight Only at 100CMC of Tween 80 can it avoid the effects of dynamic interfacial tension.
@highlight The choice of dimensionless numbers for the dispersed phase is discussed.
