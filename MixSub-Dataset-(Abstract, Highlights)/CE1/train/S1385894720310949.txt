 Polyurethanes foams are used in a wide variety of applications therefore the quantity of the PUF residues generated is an ecological and environmental problem . Hence the concerns about the disposal of PUF scraps can be minimized by their recycling . Although some companies are already using acidolysis as a chemical route the main degradation mechanisms and chemical reactions involved in this recycling process have received little or no attention . Hence this study aims at contributing to a better understanding of the reaction path involved in the depolymerization of PU . For that purpose PU wastes of flexible foams were depolymerized using succinic acid and the reaction was monitored using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy nuclear magnetic resonance and determination of the hydroxyl number OH

@highlight The chemical recycling of PUF wastes using succinic acid was successfully achieved.
@highlight The main degradation paths involved in acidolysis of PUF wastes have been identified.
@highlight The reaction time at which further studies are required was identified.
@highlight The recycled polyol was successfully used in the production of rigid PUFs.
