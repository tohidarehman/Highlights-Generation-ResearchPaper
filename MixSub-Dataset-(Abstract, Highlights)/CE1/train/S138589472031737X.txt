 Antibiotics a power tool to combat pathogenic bacterial infection have experienced their inability to kill drug resistant bacteria due to the development of antibiotic resistance . As an alternative nanostructured mechanical bactericidal surfaces may hold promise in killing bacteria without triggering antimicrobial resistance however accumulation of dead bacteria would greatly reduce their antimicrobial activity . In this study for the first time we report a surprising discovery that the lotus leaf well known for its superhydrophobicity has demonstrated not only strong repelling effect against bacteria but also bactericidal activity

@highlight The lotus leaf demonstrated not only repellency against bacteria but bactericidal activity.
@highlight The bactericidal mechanism has been proved to be a cell rupturing effect.
@highlight A hierarchically structured surface was designed and prepared.
@highlight The artificial surface displayed synergistic antimicrobial activity based entirely on physical mechanism.
@highlight The structured surface has the great advantage in maintaining long term effectiveness in antimicrobial activity.
