 Nitrogen removal in constructed wetlands is often challenged by limited nitrification due to low oxygen transfer and or limited denitrification due to the lack of carbon source . In this study a novel tidal integrated vertical flow constructed wetland was developed to treat secondary effluent with low chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen ratio raw sewage as a carbon source . Three different mixing ratios of raw sewage to secondary effluent on nitrogen removal performance and microbial community were investigated . The results showed that mixing ratios slightly affected NH

@highlight A T IVCW was developed to treat secondary effluent using a cost saving electron donor.
@highlight Efficient NH
@highlight  N and TN removal rates were achieved with the C N ratio of 2.35.
@highlight Partial denitrification anammox PDN AMX played a vital role in nitrogen removal.
@highlight and
@highlight were responsible for PDN AMX in the saturated zone.
@highlight The T IVCW is an alternative strategy for the treatment of low C N ratio sewage.
