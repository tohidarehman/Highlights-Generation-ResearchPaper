 Dinuclear Ir complexes are drawing increasing attentions due to their impressive luminescent properties . In this work we report a promising molecular framework for developing novel charge neutral dinuclear Ir complexes . Unlike most of dinuclear Ir complexes reported previously the two Ir centers are held by a cyclometalated bridging ligand which can form a rigid structure to suppress the nonradiative decay . The resultant dinuclear Ir complexes are highly emissive in both solution and doped film with photoluminescent quantum yields up to 0.78 . Two functional flanking ligands are used to further tune the luminescent properties . Compared with that of corresponding conventional mononuclear Ir complex the emission of dinuclear Ir complexes can be greatly red shifted by over 110nm . Theoretical calculations are performed to understand these impressive photophysical properties of these dinuclear Ir complexes . Finally solution processed organic light emitting diodes are fabricated to evaluate their electroluminescent properties . The orange red device based on
