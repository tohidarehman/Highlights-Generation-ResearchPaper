 Surgical site infection with instrumentation is an undesired and troublesome complication in orthopaedics . Surgical debridement is currently the main treatment option . However the poor prognosis remains the major problem and over 40 of patients needed additional surgery to remove the implant . To eliminate SSI antibacterial and biocompatible implants are urgently needed . Herein a novel biocompatible polydopamine IR820 Daptomycin coating with triple therapy functions was successfully fabricated to enhance the anti infection ability and osteogenic property of titanium implants . In which PDA served as a biocompatible binder to immobilize IR820 and DAP and possessed photothermal and osteogenic properties . The releasing of DAP inhibited the growth of
