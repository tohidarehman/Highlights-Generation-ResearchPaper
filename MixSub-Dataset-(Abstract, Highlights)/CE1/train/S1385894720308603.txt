 In this study highly crystalline mesoporous small sized stable and efficient nitrogen doped Ceria nanoparticles were synthesized using deep eutectic solvent and used for the photocatalytic degradation of sulfamethaxazole a widely used human medication and emerging water contaminant . The N doped Ceria resulted in 96 removal of SMX versus 59 by Ceria under solar irradiation at 150min time using

@highlight Deep eutectic solvent and nitrogen doping enhanced stability and efficiency of Ceria.
@highlight Removal of sulfamethaxazole was inhibited in the presence of h
@highlight and
@highlight OH scavengers.
@highlight Second order rate constant of sulfamethaxazole with
@highlight OH was calculated.
@highlight Degradation pathways were established and estimated toxicities of SMX and its DPs.
@highlight Ceria NPs were highly active against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria.
