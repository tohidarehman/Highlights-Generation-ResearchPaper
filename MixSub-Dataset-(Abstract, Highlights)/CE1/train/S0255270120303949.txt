 Ultra deep desulfurization for production of clean fuels is of great significance from environmental outlook . In this paper adsorptive desulfurization of wild naphtha was investigated in pilot scale using Mg

@highlight Adsorptive desulfurization of wild naphtha was studied in pilot scale.
@highlight Mg OH 
@highlight  surface coated ceramic foam filter was used as adsorbent.
@highlight Process was optimized using RSM methodology to maximize the sulfur removal efficiency.
@highlight Temperature was the dominating process variable based on the Sobol sensitivity analysis.
