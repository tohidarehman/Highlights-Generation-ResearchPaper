 CuO ZSM 5 PSSF was synthesized by a combined wet lay up papermaking secondary growth and chemical vapor deposition method for the catalytic oxidation of ethyl acetate in the fixed bed reactor . Ethanol and acetaldehyde are found during the oxidation and 3 wt CuO ZSM 5 PSSF catalyst exhibited the best performance with 90 conversion of 1500 ppm ethyl acetate at 254 C with GHSV of 15 000 h

@highlight A novel porous CuO ZSM 5 PSSF catalyst was prepared by chemical vapor deposition.
@highlight Effect of copper loading on the catalytic performance of ethyl acetate was studied.
@highlight CuO ZSM 5 PSSF showed lower byproducts selectivity than CuO ZSM 5.
