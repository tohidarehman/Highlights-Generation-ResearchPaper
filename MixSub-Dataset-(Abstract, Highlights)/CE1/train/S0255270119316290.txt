 In this paper the combination of ultrasound with photolysis and water flow is thoroughly investigated for optimizing the sonochemical efficiency in a horn type reactor under the optimal parameters of immersion depth as 274mm power dissipation as 450W and initial concentration of KI solution as 0.006mol L respectively . In comparison to individual ultrasound treatment the combined approaches with US WF UV WF US UV and US UV WF can effectively enhance the sonochemical efficiency which is improved by 11 45 86 and 106 respectively . The facts may mainly be attributed to coalescing and clustering of cavitation bubbles prevented by mixing behavior of WF and lots of hydroxyl radicals generated by water molecule homolysis of UV photolysis . This work has been clearly demonstrated that the sonochemical efficiency was remarkably improved by the combined approach of US with UV and WF .
