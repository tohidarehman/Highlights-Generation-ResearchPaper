 Progesterone a widely used progestogen has become a refractory pollutant present in urban runoff . The removal of PGT in wastewater is urgent owing to its endocrine disruption . In this study a nano CuO loaded halloysite nanotube was prepared by a simple hydrothermal method which could be used as a catalyst to activate persulfate for the degradation of PGT . The characterizations showed that the nano CuO was uniformly loaded on the HNTs to form corn like structures with a large specific surface area . The optimal PGT degradation efficiency was achieved with the addition of 0.5g L catalyst and 7mM PS . The effects of pH HCO

@highlight The optimal conditions for the degradation of PGT by CuO HNTs PS system were explored.
@highlight CuO HNTs PS system have excellent anti interference ability.
@highlight Coexisting free radical and nonradical pathways were verified.
@highlight The possible degradation pathway and the intermediates of PGT were proposed.
