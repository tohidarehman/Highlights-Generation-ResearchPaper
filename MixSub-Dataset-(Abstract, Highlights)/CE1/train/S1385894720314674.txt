 A framework is presented for deriving accurate predictive models of nonlinear processes based on data either experimental or computational or a combination thereof . The derived model is low dimensional hence appropriate to be used as an efficient Digital Twin of the process at hand . Diffusion Maps a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm is implemented in order to identify an economical description of the data . This can be thought of as a nonlinear counterpart of Principal Component Analysis that instead of passing linear hyperplanes through the data identifies a parametrization of the low dimensional manifold on which the data are sampled from . As a result in nonlinear processes such as the tubular reactor model used here as a case study where multiple states may be observed experimentally or in simulations for the same set of parameter values the proposed approach is able to identify a low dimensional yet accurate representation of the data . In order to make out of sample predictions appropriately trained artificial neural networks are implemented . Both the training and application of the neural networks requires limited computational effort because of the dimensionality reduction step that precedes .
