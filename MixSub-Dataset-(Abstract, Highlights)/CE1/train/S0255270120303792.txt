 The interest in phenolic compounds has significantly increased in the recent years due to their multiple health benefits and antioxidant activity . In this study microwave assisted extraction was applied for extracting phenolics from the Sacha Inchi shell an underutilized by product of the SI oil processing . Response surface methodology was used to estimate the optimal operating conditions . A Box Behnken design was employed to investigate the effects of the microwave power ethanol concentration E30 E60 and E90

@highlight MAE of phenolics from Sacha Inchi shell was optimized.
@highlight Optimal MAE conditions were found at 1500 W Ethanol 63.0 and 110 s.
@highlight Phenolic extracts from Sacha Inchi shell exhibited high antioxidant activity.
