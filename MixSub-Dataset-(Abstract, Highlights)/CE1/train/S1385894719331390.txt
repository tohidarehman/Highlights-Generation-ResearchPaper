 N doped carbonaceous materials are highly promising for efficient removal of microorganic contaminants from aqueous solutions by simultaneously serving as adsorbents and catalysts . However their recollection from aqueous solutions for repeated use is challenging . Here we designed a magnetic N doped graphitic carbon coreshell structure for oxidative degradation of various microorganic contaminants via the activation of environmentally friendly peroxymonosulfate . The magnetic Co

@highlight Magnetic N doped graphitic carbon coreshell structures MN GCCSs were synthesized.
@highlight MN GCCSs had great catalytic reactivity for removal of microorganic contaminants.
@highlight MN GCCSs were more reactive than the commonly known activators of peroxymonosulfate.
