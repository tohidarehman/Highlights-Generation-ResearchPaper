 Low cost and large scale fabrication of high efficiency near infrared photocatalysts are especially promising for the degradation of organic pollutants . Herein a facile in situ etching method by growing BiOCl nanosheets on self crystallized upconversion SrO Bi

@highlight An innovative self crystallized upconversion luminescence SBBO GC is studied.
@highlight GC15 obtains from facile in situ etching method that possess core shell structure.
@highlight The MO degradation rate of GC15 is 79 under NIR irradiation for 90min.
@highlight GC15 can be easily regenerated and high photocatalytic activity will be maintained.
@highlight The NIR GC photocatalyst is suitable for large scale production.
