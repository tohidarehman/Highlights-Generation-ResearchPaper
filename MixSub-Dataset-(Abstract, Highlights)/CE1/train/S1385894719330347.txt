 Most of present studies are focusing on improving cancer therapy effect by synthesizing new carriers or drugs while little attention is paid to develop new drug loading patterns and improve the efficiency . Herein a novel and smart nanosystem that not only realized targeted delivery and responsive degradation but also achieved facilely visual drug loading and release was reported for the first time . To build this system highly fluorescent carbon quantum dots were synthesized and served as an effective indicator and carrier to achieve visual doxorubicin loading by the strong fluorescence resonance energy transfer interactions between them . Biodegradable nano MnO

@highlight A novel and smart nanosystem realizing drug visual loading was reported.
@highlight Targeted delivery responsive biodegradation and drug release were achieved.
@highlight The first experimental example to treat cancer migration with MnO
@highlight was reported.
@highlight Both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed excellent cancer therapy effect.
