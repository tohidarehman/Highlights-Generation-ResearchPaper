 Regeneration of spent CNT is one of the most significant steps but usually neglected in adsorption application . In this study microwave ultraviolet system was applied to regenerate spent CNT and further degrade the desorbed tetracycline simultaneously . Both regeneration and mineralization ratios were detected to evaluate the regeneration performance . And they ascended with the increment of microwave power as well as regeneration time . Adsorption capacity of the regenerated CNT recovered to 100 and 37 of tetracycline was mineralized to carbon dioxide at 500W for 2.5min . High total gas flow rate demonstrated negligible impact on mineralization ratio . After 5 adsorption regeneration cycles regeneration and mineralization ratios kept at approximately 80 and 27 respectively while BET surface area went up . Three kinds of reactive oxygen species including ozone hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen
