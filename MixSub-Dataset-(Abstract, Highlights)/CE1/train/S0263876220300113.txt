 Kinetic modeling is essential for industrial applications . The applicability of six mathematical models to describe the kinetics of the conventional and ultrasound assistant extraction of polyphenols from fresh and distilled grape marc and its components seeds and skins after removal of non polar compounds was studied . The best extraction yield of TPC for all the samples was obtained using UAE with ethanol water mixture as solvent 200 W and 26 kHz after 30 min . The two site kinetic model showed R
