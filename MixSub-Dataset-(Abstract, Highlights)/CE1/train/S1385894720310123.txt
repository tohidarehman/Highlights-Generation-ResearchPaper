 As the effective way for utilizing low grade thermal energy chemisorption technologies have been widely researched by establishing various phenomenological models and analogical models . But the existing kinetic models have the disadvantages of complexity or narrow adaptability and they also can not adapt to the serious hysteresis phenomena found in recent years . In order to obtain wide adaptable kinetic models of halide ammonia for material level in this paper the sorption and desorption kinetics which consider hysteresis effects of halide ammonia with MnCl

@highlight Three analogical models coupled with hysteresis effect are established and compared.
@highlight Kinetic parameters for MnCl
@highlight  NH
@highlight and CaCl
@highlight  NH
@highlight are ensured with sensitive analysis.
@highlight The model prediction and feasibilty of different working paris are validated.
@highlight The model adaptablity to large scale occasions is proved with 200g sorbent.
