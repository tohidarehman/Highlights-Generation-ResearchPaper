 Potassium ion battery and sodium ion battery have been considered as next generation energy storage devices due to their low cost and abundant resource . The main challenge lies in the lack of novel electrodes to accommodate the large size K Na ions . Herein a facile solvothermal method coupled with a polydopamine coating and post annealing strategy is developed to synthesize unique box like

@highlight NiS were encapsulated in nitrogen doped carbon cages
@highlight the NiN chemical bond.
@highlight Highly conductive network and fast ionic diffusion channels were constructed.
@highlight Cycling stability could be attributable to the stronger affinity of N doped carbon.
