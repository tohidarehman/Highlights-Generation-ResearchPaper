 Gene therapy has been recognized as one of the most potential approaches on cancer treatment field . Arginine rich cell penetrating peptides have attracted enormous interests in gene delivery field due to their superior membrane translocation capability . Herein we developed a novel arginine rich peptide based gene delivery system consisted of tri block copolymers C

@highlight An arginine riched peptide as gene vectors.
@highlight The fluorous chains conferred anti serum capability.
@highlight The bridge like peptide enhanced cellular uptake efficiency.
@highlight Good tumor targeting ability and strong anti tumor effects.
