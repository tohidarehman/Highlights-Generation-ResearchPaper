 The efficiency of microbial electron transfer is fundamental for determining the performance of fermentative hydrogen methane production . To facilitate microbial electron transfer conductive magnetite nanoparticles were added into a cascading dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion system that was inoculated with

@highlight and CH
@highlight production were both enhanced with magnetite nanoparticles MNPs .
@highlight production HP pathway shifted to acetate pathway leading to high NADH NAD
@highlight Hydrogenase and electron transport system activities increased with MNPs during HP.
@highlight MNPs promoted the secretion of redox active humic substances during CH
@highlight production.
@highlight and
@highlight were selectively enriched in the presence of MNPs.
