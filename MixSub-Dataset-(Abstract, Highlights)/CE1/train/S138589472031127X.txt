 Two dimensional metallic nanosheets and mesoporous nanostructures attract increasing attentions in fields of energy conversion and storage due to their own different structural advantages . However integration of their structural advantages into bimetallic or multimetallic systems for constructing highly efficient catalysts by facile methods is still a challenge yet greatly desired . Herein we propose a feasible one pot strategy for the synthesis of mesoporous IrAu nanovesicles . The synthesis could be achieved by co reduction of metal precursors in the presence of formic acid as reducing agent and poly styrene

@highlight Mesoporous IrAu nanovesicles are successfully fabricated by a one pot synthetic strategy.
@highlight Mesoporous IrAu nanovesicles exhibit Pt like catalytic activity for ORR in alkaline conditions.
@highlight Mesoporous IrAu nanovesicles show enhanced catalytic durability and improved methanol tolerance.
