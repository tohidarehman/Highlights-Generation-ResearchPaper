 Nowadays the low combustion efficiency and combustion instability are the two major challenges in the design and development of meso micro combustor . Heat recirculation and catalytic combustion are one of the best methods to solve those problems . The low combustion rate far from catalytic surfaces in micro combustor is a serious issue in catalytic combustion . To solve this problem the novel micro combustor with separating cylinder is proposed . The fuel combustion efficiency in HRMCC is higher than that of HRMC at the same inlet velocity . When the inlet velocity is 0.5 m s the combustion efficiency gap between HRCC and HRMCC reaches up to the maximum value of 7.4 . The methane conversion per unit catalyst in HRMCC is higher than that of HRMC and it also increases as inlet velocity increases . Besides the location of separating cylinder in HRMCC does not show obvious influence on combustion efficiency and methane conversion per unit catalyst . However it has a great influence on the size of high temperature region in HRMCC . The high temperature area size becomes larger as the separating cylinder in HRMCC becomes further from outlet .

@highlight HRMCC exhibits higher combustion efficiency and methane conversion per unit catalyst than that of HRMC.
@highlight The combustion efficiency gap between HRMCC and HRMC reaches to maximum value of 7.4 at inlet velocity of 0.5 m s.
@highlight The location of separating cylinder has little influence on combustion efficiency and methane conversion per unit catalyst.
@highlight The location of separating cylinder has a great effect on the size of high temperature region.
