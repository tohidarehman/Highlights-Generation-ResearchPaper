 Nowadays lightweight flexible and wearable sustainable electric power sources have attracted increasing attention due to the rapid development of portable electronics . Graphene fiber fabrics as newly discovered carbon textiles have exhibited attractive properties for wearable power devices . How to realize scalable construction of non woven graphene based fabric electrodes with high areal capacitance is challenging for portable electronics . Here a novel coagulation bath fabrication technique was firstly reported to prepare reduced graphene oxide fiber fabrics for areal energy dense supercapacitors . The as prepared rGOFFs showed high flexibility and conductivity . The symmetric supercapacitors assembled with rGOFFs based fabric electrodes performed a high specific gravimetric capacitance C

@highlight One step continuous spinning of rGO fibers was achieved.
