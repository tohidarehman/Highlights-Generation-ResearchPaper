 The semi hydrogenation of 2 methyl 3 butyn 2 ol and 2 butyne 1 4 diol over three sets of catalytic static mixers coated with commercial and non commercial palladium and nickel catalysts has been investigated and optimised over a range of conditions achieving excellent results of up to 87 in alkene yield selectivities above 90 and space time yields of up to 3.0 kg L

@highlight Alkynes are semi hydrogenated to alkenes in continuous flow over 3D printed catalytic static mixer scaffolds.
@highlight Hydrogenations using commercial and non commercial catalysts are optimised using a Design of Experiment approach.
@highlight High conversions selectivities and space time yields are achieved.
@highlight A kinetic loop study is conducted deriving k values for the consecutive reaction pathway.
