 Marine exhaust gas is seriously harmful to the environment and only using a single pollutant treatment device is difficult to meet the emission regulations . It is imperative to study integrated and efficient marine exhaust gas pollutant removal technology . This study proposes a novel process capable of removing NOx and SOx in marine exhaust gas and this process can achieve higher NOx and SOx removal efficiency and lower nitrate concentration by using urea peroxide CO NH

@highlight A novel oxidation absorption process for removing NOx and SOx in marine exhaust gas.
@highlight Urea peroxide can reduce SOx and NOx by about 100 and 90 respectively.
@highlight Reaction temperature liquid gas ratio and urea peroxide concentration can control the removal efficiency of NOx.
@highlight Urea peroxide can efficiently remove NOx and inhibit the generation of nitrate.
