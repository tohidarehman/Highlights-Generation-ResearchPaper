 To guide the practical application of ozonation coupled with tubular ceramic membranes the performance and the mechanism of mitigated membrane fouling by pre ozonation filtration and

@highlight EfOM decay in effluent by pre ozonation was the key to decreased membrane fouling.
@highlight Pre ozonation did not improve backwashing efficiency but
@highlight  O F was favored.
@highlight ozonation destroyed the adhesion between fouling and membranes.
