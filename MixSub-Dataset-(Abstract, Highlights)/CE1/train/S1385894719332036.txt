 Incorporation of nanoscale colloidal objects into three dimensional hydrogel networks can not only reinforce the hydrogels as colloidal cross linkers but also add many extra functionalities for diverse applications . For the first time deformable droplets of liquid metal in combination with sonication were suggested to be able to initiate and gel acrylic acid via a facile sonication procedure with comparison to many inert rigid solid nanofillers . The LM droplets were also stabilized by the resultant hydrogel shells . Besides softness stretchability and notch insensitive toughness the LM droplets also offered moldability as well as an exceptional self healing property by releasing active radicals and ionic cross linkers of Ga

@highlight For the first time liquid metal is found to be able to initiate free radical polymerization of AA.

@highlight The ionic hydrogel combines mechanical robustness self recovery and conductivity.
@highlight The sensing capability for strain is determined.
