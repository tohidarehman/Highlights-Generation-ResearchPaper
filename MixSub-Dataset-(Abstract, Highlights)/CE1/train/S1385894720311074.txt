 The construction of flexible all polymer based conductive aerogels for piezoresistive pressure sensors is often hindered by a trade off between robust mechanical properties and elastic responsive conductivity . Here a highly flexible and compressible conductive aerogel was fabricated by integrating poly poly with polyimide through facile strategies of freeze drying and thermal annealing . With a controlled ratio of the two components the composite demonstrates a well ordered and interconnected porous structure composed of
