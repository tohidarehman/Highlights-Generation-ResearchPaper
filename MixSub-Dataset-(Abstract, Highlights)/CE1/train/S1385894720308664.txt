 Protein plays an important role in the maintenance of osmotic pressure and binding and transportation of nutrients to cells which is essential for the rapid regeneration of bone tissues . Bovine serum albumin is the most abundant plasma protein in the body . Here theBSA based hydrogel was first developed through the thiolated bovine serum albumin employing the robust and reversible SAg coordination which owns injectable self healing and antibacterial properties for the treatment of bone defect regeneration . First the BSA was treated with Traut s reagent to replace the primary amine groups of the lysine residue in its primary structure with thiol groups . Then the thiolated BSA was added with silver nitrate to be crosslinked . SAg coordination took place immediately when sBSA and silver were mixed and a shear thinning hydrogel was thus produced . By adjusting the proportion of BSA the mechanical properties of the hydrogels can be adjusted . Moreover this novel protein based hydrogel is bio degradable and can slowly release silver ions to generate an antibacterial effect for
