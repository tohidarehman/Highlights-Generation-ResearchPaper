 A novel 2D 3D hybrid nanocomposite adsorbent was synthesized by confining a 2D porous organic polymer in pores of commercial 3D anionic exchanger beads using a facile repetitive deposition method and evaluated for the removal of four phenolic contaminants from water . The immobilization of TCBD in D318 conferred on the adsorbent a robust water stability a rapid solid liquid separation and an enhanced anti self aggregation property . The effects of pH contaminant type coexisting inorganic anions and natural organic matter on adsorption performance were studied . TCBD D318 exhibited high adsorption capacities

@highlight New reusable 2D POP 3D anion exchanger nanocomposite adsorbent TCBD D318 prepared.
