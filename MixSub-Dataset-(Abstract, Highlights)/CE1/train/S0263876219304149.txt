 In this study organic contaminant degradation was intensified by increasing the oxidative capacity of the reaction system through simultaneous photocatalysis and heterogeneous persulfate activation . Fe nanoparticles were served as a multifunctional modifier to enhance the photoactivity of graphitic carbon nitride by tuning optical properties as well as persulfate activation rate by introducing a new activation pathway . The synthesized photocatalysts were characterized by X ray diffraction Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy transmission electron microscopy UV visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and photoluminescence analysis . Oxidation power of the proposed system was examined by the degradation of Rhodamine B as a model pollutant under visible light irradiation . The effect of operating parameters contributing to the degradation process including initial pH and the concentration of the photocatalyst and potassium persulfate were investigated in detail . Scavenging experiments proved that the photocatalyst hole and sulfate radicals play a major role in RhB degradation and a plausible mechanism for the generation of oxidative species was proposed . Furthermore reusability tests revealed that the photocatalysts possess excellent stability after three repetitive experiments .
