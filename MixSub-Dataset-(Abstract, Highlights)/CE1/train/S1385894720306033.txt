 A new polyethersulfone composite membrane using nanostructures of polyaniline and reduced graphene oxide was prepared by the phase inversion process . The investigation focused on the use of PANI and rGO as conductive dopants along with camphorsulfonic acid and dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid for PANI preparation . Higher conductivity was obtained for the membrane doped with PANI DBSA 4.50.3Scm

@highlight Electrically conductive PES PANI rGO membranes were prepared using phase inversion process.
@highlight PANI and rGO additives improved the membrane conductivity hydrophilicity and permeability.
@highlight Fouling studies of the PES PANI rGO 0.2g membranes revealed less propensity to organic fouling.
@highlight Application of external voltage reduced fouling for this electrically conductive membrane.
