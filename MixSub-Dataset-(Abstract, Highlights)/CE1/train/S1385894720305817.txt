 Potassium ion batteries have aroused intensive interests as a promising alternative to lithium ion batteries for large scale energy storage however the lack of high performance anode material is one of the key challenges for their development which is mainly caused by the large size of potassium ions inducing severe volume change and pulverization of anode materials . Here we report a FeSe

@highlight Novel FeSe
@highlight  nitrogen doped carbon composite have been fabricated.
@highlight The composite was applied as anode material of potassium ion batteries.
@highlight The composite demonstrates superior cycle stability and rate capability.
