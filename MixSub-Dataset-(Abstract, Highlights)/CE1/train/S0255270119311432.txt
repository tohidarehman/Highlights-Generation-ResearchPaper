 Cellulose acetate based membranes are used for water desalination . Cellulose diacetate was prepared from cellulose powder . Reverse osmosis membranes were prepared on polyester sheets using CDA based through phase inversion technique . The structural morphological and hydrophilic properties of the prepared membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance scanning electron microscopy and contact angle measurements . The FTIR and NMR revealed the presence of the carbonyl groups and degree of substitution in CDA . Modified membranes by Grafted to improve the performance and the anti biofouling properties of cellulose acetate reverse osmosis membranes . The anti biofouling properties were studied by measurements of static protein adsorption . The effect of grafting the membrane on the salt rejection and water flux was studied using a cross flow RO unit . The results indicated that 15wt of 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid Grafted membranes have lower adsorption of protein and microbes in addition to increased salt rejection to 99.24 and water flux to 17.12l m
