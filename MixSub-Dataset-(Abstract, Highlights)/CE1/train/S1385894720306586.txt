 In this work a new adsorbent i.e . lysozyme nanofibrils conjugated with long chain PEI which could be successfully modified with the aid of a polydopamine interface was prepared by a simple and green method . The resulting fibrous composites exhibited superior adsorption and selectivity for lead removal due to their primary amino groups even in the presence of coexisting Ca

@highlight The AFL PEI was obtained using a bioinspired ultrafine amyloid lysozyme nanofibrils as the carrier.
@highlight The ultrahigh surface to volume ratios ca. 400 provide a rapid Pb removal in 2
@highlight None
@highlight min.
@highlight The selectivity index is 80 times greater than the commercial 001x7 resin.
@highlight The nanofibrils effectively treated 12 200kg water kg sorbent with regenerated property.
