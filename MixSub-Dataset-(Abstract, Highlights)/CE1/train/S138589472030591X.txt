 The reaction pathways and chemical kinetics of tryptophan and its products were elucidated under hydrothermal conditions from experiments at 265 280 295 and 310C . Tryptophan participates in several primary reactions leading to the formation of six identified primary products . The primary reactions include decarboxylation deamination and cleavage of CC bonds . Several of the primary products are also formed via secondary reactions . A chemical kinetics model based on the reaction pathways provides excellent correlation of the experimentally observed trends . The model indicates that both the reaction temperature and the initial concentration of tryptophan are influential on the selectivity of the parallel primary reaction pathways as formation of higher molecular weight products directly from tryptophan is a second order reaction and has the highest activation energy . These new results and the reaction model provide insights into the chemistry that occurs during hydrothermal valorization of proteinaceous biomass .

@highlight Tryptophan undergoes decarboxylation deamination CC bond cleavage.
@highlight High initial concentrations of tryptophan promote inclusion of N into bio crude oil.
@highlight Mild temperatures promote formation of aqueous soluble products.
