 There are some reports showing that microwave heating has a positive effect on the non polar reaction liquid with polar solute . For the continuous flow microwave heating of non polar reaction liquid the methods such as the addition of a high loss dielectric material are generally used but there is a problem that the temperature of the fluid will continue to rise which can not be maintained within a stable range . In this paper a novel double layer packed bed is designed in order to solve the above problem . The double layer packed bed is divided into a heating layer and a thermostatic layer the packing of heating layer is composed of the high loss dielectric material the packing of thermostatic layer is composed of a mixture of the high loss and low loss dielectric material in a certain proportion . Both the experimental and simulation results verified that the non polar liquid temperature can rapidly rise to the preheating temperature in the heating layer and remain stable in the thermostatic layer while passing through the double layer packed bed under microwave irradiation . The practicality of the double layer packed bed was exemplified in the continuous synthesis of geranyl butyrate that proceeded more rapidly under microwave irradiation than conventional heating .
