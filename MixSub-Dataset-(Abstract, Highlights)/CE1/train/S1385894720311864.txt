 During the wound healing process it is necessary to protect the tissue from bacterial infections and other external damage in environment . Functional artificial hydrogels as suitable wound dressings to act as barriers have attracted more and more attention . In the study described herein quaternary ammonium and double bond modified chitosan and metalorganic framework particles were used to synthesize photosensitive hydrogels through free radical polymerization . The synthesized hydrogels exhibited excellent photothermal properties under 808nm near infrared light irradiation due to the existence of PBNPs which could absorb NIR light and produce light due to the charge transfer between Fe

@highlight Prussian blue and modified chitosan were used to synthesize photothermal hydrogels.
@highlight Prussian blue nanoparticles could strengthen the hydrogels as cross linker.
@highlight The electropositive hydrogels could capture bacteria and kill them combined with heat.
@highlight The hydrogels could kill 99.97 
@highlight and 99.93 
@highlight under light irradiation.
