 Ferric arsenate is an important arsenic containing compound in the mining impacted environment and hydrometallurgical tailings especially in the disposal of smelting wastewater in nonferrous smelting industries . It acts as an intermediate for arsenic removal and immobilization in the disposal of arsenic containing wastewater . However amorphous ferric arsenate suffers from poor stability with a high arsenic leachability in the aqueous environment . In this study we develop a new strategy to remove and immobilize arsenic from copper smelting wastewater using copper slag through an
