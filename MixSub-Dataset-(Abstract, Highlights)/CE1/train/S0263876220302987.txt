 The objective of this study is to understand the impact of process variables on particle binding during corn stover pelleting . Initial particle attrition or percent fines 425 m in 1 4 in . and 7 16 in . hammermill screen size was measured at 34.36 and 20.24 respectively . A single pellet press was used to do the pelleting tests by varying the hammermill screen size and 7 16 in . corn stover moisture and residence time . The pellet properties measured were the particle dimensions percent fines e.g . 425

@highlight Hammer mill fitted with 6.35 and 11.11 mm screen produced 34.36 and 20.24 of fines 425 m in corn stover.
@highlight Pelleting helps particles to agglomerate and reduce the percent fines 425
@highlight None
@highlight m .
@highlight Moisture content of 1015 w.b. and residence time of 45 s produced fines of about 19 for 6.35 mm grind and about 13 for 11.11 mm grind.
@highlight Focused Ion Beam tomography indicated a lamellar structure in pellets with voids.
@highlight CT Scan analysis indicated lower moisture and residence time increased the number of agglomerates and their size.
