 Graphene is considered as one of the most promising anode materials for alkali ion batteries in term of large specific surface area and high conductivity whereas low initial Coulombic efficiency poor capacity and fast capacity decay severely block the commercialization process . Here we designed reduced graphene oxide with three dimensional interconnected hollow channel architecture via electrospinning electrospray and carbonization techniques . Benefiting from the unique 3D interconnected hollow channel architecture 3D IH rGO anode exhibits extraordinary lithium storage ability with high initial Coulombic efficiency outstanding reversible capability 1216.0mAhg

@highlight 3D IH rGO is firstly synthesized by using PA66 as the removal template.
@highlight The hollow structure can efficiently prevent pulverization and aggregation of rGO.
@highlight The interlaced channels provide more transmission pathways and absorption sites.
@highlight 3D IH rGO exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance in LIBs NIBs and KIBs.
