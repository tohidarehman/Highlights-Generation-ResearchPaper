 As a continuous phase fluid creates a specific environment for the whole flotation process and accordingly play important roles . This paper aims to characterize the fluid intensification effects on threephase interactions which closely relate to turbulent dissipation . Generally the turbulence comprises distinct vortices wherein macroturbulence dominates transport phenomena intermediate eddies are responsible for energy redistribution and smallscale vortices regulate microinteractions . This review indicates that the strengthening effects of agitated flows on uniform mixing interparticle and particlereagent interactions contribute to the hydrophobicity improvement of desired particles . Further the focus transfers to bubble distribution and behavior . Turbulence can strongly affect the bubble evolution process by imposing external stresses and inducing relative motion in them thereby creating reasonably balanced bubble distributions for successive stages . Theoretically the optimized hydrodynamic environment corresponds to the maximized particlebubble collision efficiency and provides sufficient kinetic energy for particles to break the energy barrier of attachment . Though the mineralized bubbles are vulnerable to the surrounding fluid a modulated hydrodynamic environment can be oriented at detaching inferior particles and improving flotation selectivity . Critically turbulent conditions should be designed to accommodate the actual situation and some available theories on modelling particlebubble interactions require further modification .
