 As promising next generation energy storage system all solid state lithium batteries offer great potential for achieving high energy density and improved safety over lithium batteries with liquid counterpart . Dense microstructure with high ionic conductivity are prerequisites for solid electrolyte . The promising Li garnet electrolyte suffers from poor sinterability which results in porous structure and large grain boundary resistance . Herein we report that the poor sinterability of garnet Li
