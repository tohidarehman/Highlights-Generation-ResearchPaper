 Deep eutectic solvents are generally used as attractive solvents or extractants rather than catalysts in the field of synthesis and separation . Herein dual Brnsted acidic DESs were prepared by mixing sulfonated quaternary ammonium and oxalic acid as extractants and catalysts for deep oxidative desulfurization . Compared to the DESs with single acidic group the dual acidic DESs exhibited much higher catalytic activity likely due to the synergistic effect . The

@highlight Dual Brnsted DESs were designed as extractants and catalysts for oxidative desulfurization.
@highlight The reaction mechanism was studied in depth through experimental and theoretical method.
@highlight Synergistic effect made the DES showed higher catalytic activity than other DESs.
@highlight Decreasing viscosity of DES was verified as effective strategy to improve reaction rate.
