 In this study the selective extraction of molybdenum from the spent hydrodesulfurization catalysts using emulsion liquid membrane method was investigated . Cyanex 272 and ammonium fluoride NH

@highlight Mo separated from spent HDS catalysts using ELM method.
@highlight Cyanex 272 and NH
@highlight F were used as extractant and stripping agent respectively.
@highlight Under the optimum conditions more than 75 of the Mo was separated.
@highlight None
@highlight  and
@highlight were calculated to be 220.79 185.83 and 142.03 respectively.
