 Selenium is a prospective candidate of electrode material for high energy batteries . However the low Se loading volumetric expansion and polyselenide shuttling between cathode and anode are major factors to limit further development . To overcome above issues the hollow carbon structure with interconnected mesopores is used to confine Se composite via a facile annealing treatment route . The Se HMCS electrode exhibits excellent performance including a long cycle life 710mAhg
