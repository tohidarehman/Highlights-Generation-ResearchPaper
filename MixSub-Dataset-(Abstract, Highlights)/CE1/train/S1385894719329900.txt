 Membrane technology has gained great attention as one of the promising strategies for carbon capture and separation . Intended for such application membrane fabrication from various materials has been attempted . While gas separation membranes based on dense polymeric materials have been long developed there is a growing interest to use porous materials as the membrane material . This review then focuses on emerging organic containing microporous materials to be used for the fabrication of membranes that are designed for CO

@highlight Criteria in selecting microporous meterials for CO
