 Nowadays inorganic and organic pollutants always coexist in the environment thus an economic and efficient treatment is urgently required . In this paper a novel nanoscale zero valent iron produced from the reaction of acid mine drainage with NaBH

@highlight A high performance of Cr VI removal was obtained in AMD nZVI PDS process.
@highlight Transformation products of Cr VI Cd II and ATZ were identified.
@highlight SO
@highlight contributed to nearly 84 of the overall ATZ degradation.
@highlight The possible pathways of ATZ degradation were proposed.
@highlight A reaction mechanism for the removals of Cr VI Cd II and ATZ was proposed.
