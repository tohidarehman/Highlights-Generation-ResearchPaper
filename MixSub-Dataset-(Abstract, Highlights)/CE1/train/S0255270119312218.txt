 A kinetic model is proposed to describe the formation of hyperbranched polymers HBPs by the self condensing vinyl polymerization SCVP of inimers in a continuous stirred tank reactor CSTR with the addition of trifunctional cores . The dependence of the average degree of polymerization DP and the degree of branching DB on the Damkhler number Da is calculated by a generating function method . If the SCVP system has no core initiators the flow in the CSTR may be stopped at a Da of approximately 0.5 which is caused by the formation of HBPs with ultrahigh molecular weights then the stable operating range becomes very narrow . The growth of HBPs in the SCVP can be retarded by adding the core with high reactivity into the CSTR . Therefore formation of HBPs with ultrahigh molecular weights can be avoided even though the A groups are almost completely consumed at a high Da number . For example the reduced weight average DP is less than 1000 when the degree of conversion of the A group is 0.99 and only a few unreacted monomers remain in the product . The proposed model is useful for designing and optimizing a flow process for producing HBPs by the SCVP in a CSTR .
