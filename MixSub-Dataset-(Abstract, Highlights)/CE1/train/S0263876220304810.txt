 The thermodynamic study of beech wood gasification was performed in a pilot scaled fluidized bed reactor at different operation conditions including temperature range from 600C to 900C using CO

@highlight Gasification endothermicity increases with temperature.
@highlight Pyrolysis requires higher energy input than CO
@highlight gasification.
@highlight Syngas lower heating value increases when biochar is used as bed material.
@highlight Steam gasification requires less energy input than CO
