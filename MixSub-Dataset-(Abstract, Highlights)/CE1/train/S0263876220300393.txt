 Millimeter sized hydrothermal carbon beads with excellent acidic resistance and enhanced adsorption performance for Cr was obtained via hydrothermal treatment of chitosan beads . Their physicochemical properties were comparatively characterized by Raman spectra FT IR elemental composition analysis SEM N

@highlight Hydrothermal carbon beads HCB was obtained from chitosan beads CSB .
@highlight The millimeter sized HCB shows great acid resistant adsorption stability for Cr VI .
@highlight Highly removal efficiency of HCB was hardly affected by the co existing anions.
@highlight Hydrothermal treatment is beneficial to expose the active sites of HCB.
@highlight The easy separated HCB shows excellent adsorption cyclic performance.
