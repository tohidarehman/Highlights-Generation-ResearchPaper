 This paper aims to provide an experimental investigation on the thermal conductivity enhancement and heat transfer performance of water based Al

@highlight Two step method was used to prepare stable nanofluids at concentrations of 0.125 .
@highlight 0.25 0.5 and 1.5 of m V.
@highlight The heat transfer enhancement was better in water based Al
@highlight nanofluids than aqueous TiO
@highlight nanofluids.
@highlight Zeta potential value revealed the superiority of PVP over PVA surfactants.
@highlight The nanofluids provided faster cooling than water due to their enhanced thermal conductivity.
@highlight Maximum of 21 enhancement in heat transfer performance is attainable with Al
@highlight nanofluids having PVA surfactant.
