 In this study a hydrocyclone was designed and manufactured to achieve an inlet flow rate of 1 L min in the experiment which was conducted using soda lime bead with a specific gravity of 2.5 . Numerical analysis was performed with FLUENT utilizing the Reynolds stress turbulence and volume of fluid multiphase flow analysis models . Errors in the experimental and numerical analysis were confirmed to be 5.13 1.70 and 2.79 for the inlet pressure flow rate at the underflow outlet and total separation efficiency respectively . To determine the separation efficiency a laser diffraction particle size analyzer was used to confirm the distribution of particles the error in each particle size caused by a reduction in particle size during the experiment was found to be about 5 . Results from the numerical analysis were consistent with the experimental ones . It was confirmed that the performance of the hydrocyclone could be accurately predicted using numerical analysis . Using the verified value interpreting model the performance of the hydrocyclone was compared with inlet flow rates of 0.61.2 L min . Additionally hydrocyclones achieving 1 L min inlet flow rate with inlet velocities of 1 and 3 m s were designed for predicting the performance of hydrocyclones in various sizes .

@highlight The performance of a hydrocyclone for 1 L min of flow rate is analyzed for the first time.
@highlight Numerical and experimental methods are used to evaluate performance of the hydrocyclone.
@highlight Different sizes of the hydrocyclone were designed numerically studied and compared to ascertain how the size of the hydrocyclone affected the performance.
@highlight Based on the results it is expected that the hydrocyclone could replace a centrifuge separator in plant protein extraction. This technology enables real time processing that is impossible with a centrifuge separator.
