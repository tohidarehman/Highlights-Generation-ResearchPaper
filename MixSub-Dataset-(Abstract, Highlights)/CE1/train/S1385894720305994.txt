 With the rapid growth of electronics and telecommunication there is an intensive requirement for developing electromagnetic interference shielding technique to prevent malfunction of electronic equipment and threats to human health from electromagnetic waves . Herein we demonstrate a multifunctional EMI shielding skin which not only shows an excellent EMI shielding effectiveness but also can play a role as a pressure sensor . The EMI shielding skin consists of freestanding foam structured graphene reinforced poly matrix . The graphene foam is decorated by Fe
