 Three kinds of GO based Z scheme photocatalytic materials were synthesized to remove harmful algae and Microcystins LR . The physicochemical properties of the photocatalysts were characterized . The inhibitory effects of three photocatalysts on the growth of algae under visible light were compared . The photocatalytic degradation pathways and mechanism of MC LR by Ag
