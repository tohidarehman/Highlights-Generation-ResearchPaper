 Conjugated microporous polymers have gained great attention because of high surface area and permanent pores with good gas adsorption capability but most of them are hard to disperse in water and thus barely used in sewage disposal . Herein we adopt sulfonation to post synthesis sulfonate grafted CMPs which possess unexceptional dispersity in water . The sulfonate grafted CMPs also exhibit fast adsorption towards cationic dye solutions especially methylene blue . Because of the porous structure MB molecules interact with CMPs not only on the surface but also in pores increasing the contact sites and adsorption efficiency . This research greatly expands the exploration and application scope of CMPs .

@highlight Sulfonate grafted CMPs exhibit fast adsorption capacity on aqueous dyes.
@highlight The maximum adsorption of sulfonate grafted CMPs on cationic dyes reaches 1650mg g.
@highlight Sulfonate grafted CMPs absorb 97 of MB 100mg L in 25min.
