 Ice based Freeze Desalination offers a potential alternative to recover fresh water from seawater . There has been increased interest over the years in the development of continuous crystallizer configurations to address the combined challenge of ice yield and salinity reduction in FD . In this work experimental studies have been conducted to establish the potential of a novel continuously operated U shaped crystallizer for ice based Freeze Desalination . Unlike conventional FD crystallizers researched till date this crystallizer integrates pre cooling chilling and freezing of saline water in a single unit along with in situ ice removal . Preliminary experiments were carried out using synthetic salt water to investigate the effect of salt water flow rate and coolant temperature on product water yield and salinity . Salinity was found to increase with water yield . The overall phase change heat transfer coefficient has also been estimated . Subsequently test runs were carried out using seawater samples under prescribed operating conditions identified from the synthetic salt water runs . Salinity reduction was observed to increase with an increase in number of washing steps and wash water requirement . The results obtained provide a strong case to promote the use of the U shaped crystallizer for ice based FD .
