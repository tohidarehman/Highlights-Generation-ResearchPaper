 Ni rich layered oxides are potential cathode candidates materials for Li ion batteries due to their low cost and high energy density . However it is difficult to reproducibly prepare uniformly distributed element and well controlled morphology of Ni rich layered oxide particles . This study develops a continuous microfluidic reaction process to synthesize spherical carbonate precursors Ni

@highlight NCM 622 cathode material was synthesized via a facile microfluidic reactor.
@highlight The material has well developed layered structure excellent elemental distribution small size and uniform particles.
@highlight The structural stability and cycling performance of the cathode was improved.
