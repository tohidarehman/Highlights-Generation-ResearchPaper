 Due to the drawbacks of conventional methods of desalination the adsorption desalination system has been introduced as a replacement with several advantages such as capability of using low grade waste heat low cost and production of cooling as its second output . The aim of the paper is to provide a conceptual theoretical framework based on new advanced adsorption desalination and cooling system configured of double cycle multi bed dual evaporator with internal heat recovery . As an innovative approach the cycles are coupled through integrated equipment working as a condenser for one of the cycles and a high pressure evaporator for the other one . System performance is investigated in terms of specific daily water production low and high pressure cooling capacities and overall conversion ratio . It is shown that not only SDWP of the proposed configuration increases by 20 in comparison to the single cycle multi bed dual evaporator system but also it is capable of producing considerable amounts of two grades of cooling water . The proposed configuration with 9.6 m3 of SDWP along with 24 and 25 Rton ton of high and low grade cooling capacities could be a suitable alternative to conventional configurations of adsorption desalination . Furthermore a full sensitivity analysis is carried out by manipulating several system parameters and the system performance is evaluated .
