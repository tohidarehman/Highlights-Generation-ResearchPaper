 Mineral dust has a significant effect on the atmospheric heterogeneous chemistry and environmental risk prediction of VOCs . In this work a comprehensive theoretical study for the gaseous and heterogeneous reactions process of four Low Molecular Weight unsaturated ketones with O

@highlight The gaseous and heterogeneous reactions of LMW unsaturated ketones with O
@highlight are compared by DFT.
@highlight SiO
@highlight represents a strong sinking of LMW carbonyl compounds.
@highlight More HMHP detected on SiO
@highlight than that in gas phase may be related to the promotion of SiO
@highlight on CH
@highlight OO H
@highlight O.
@highlight The environmental risks may increase due to the promotion of SiO
@highlight to the studied reactions.
