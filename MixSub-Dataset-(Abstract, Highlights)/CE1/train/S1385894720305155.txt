 Excessive reactive oxygen species as effective cancer therapeutic agents can promote tumor apoptosis . However the clinical applications of ROS mediated cancer therapies still have many limitations such as self defects of traditional photosensitizer adverse tumor microenvironment and insufficient ROS production . Here two dimensional and highly oxidized ilmenite nanosheets HOIL NSs formula FeTiO

@highlight A Z scheme heterojunction functionalized 2D HOIL NSs were fabricated.
@highlight HOIL NSs have high charge separation efficacy and enhanced redox potentials.
@highlight HOIL NSs can both modulate the TME and produce
@highlight OH by catalyzing Fenton reaction.
@highlight A high photothermal conversion of HOIL NSs was observed exposed to 808nm laser.
