 Pollution of antibiotics in water has aroused global concerns . In this study non thermal discharge plasma oxidation was applied to eliminate three antibiotics with different substituent groups and chemical properties tetracycline sulfadiazine and ciprofloxacin . All the three antibiotics could be effectively degraded but with different reaction kinetics and the reaction rate of TC was always the highest followed by SD and CIP . Reactive oxygen species including

@highlight Discharge plasma was used to remove antibiotics with different structures.
@highlight Antibiotics removal efficiency under various experimental conditions was evaluated.
@highlight Contributions of reactive substances to antibiotic decomposition were analyzed.
@highlight Gaussian with DFT was used to predict the sites on antibiotics susceptible for ROS attack.
@highlight Possible decomposition pathways of different molecular structures were proposed.
