 A major challenge for effective decontamination of arsenate from aqueous solution is the development of adsorbent possessing enormous high active sites with strong affinity to realize both high adsorption capacity and reduction of arsenate down to permissive levels . Here we demonstrate that this challenge may be overcome by doping Mn atoms into La

@highlight Mn doped La
@highlight CO
@highlight  MnL exhibited superior arsenate capture capacity of 555.6mg g.
@highlight The residual of As V was well below the permissive value for drinking water.
@highlight Doping with Mn atoms enhanced adsorption sites and reduced adsorption energy.
@highlight Surface complex and anion exchange dominated As V removal at low As V MnL ratios.
@highlight Forming LaAsO
@highlight precipitates contributed greatly at high As V MnL ratios.
