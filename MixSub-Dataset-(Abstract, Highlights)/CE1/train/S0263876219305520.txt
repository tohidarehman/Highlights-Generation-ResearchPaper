 The influence of reactor scale impeller tip speed and specific power on the overall homogeneity of two dimensionally similar stirred tanks of 50

@highlight Mixing indices may be used to reduce energy needed to achieve slurry homogeneity.
@highlight Suspension quality most consistent in smaller vessels than in larger vessels.
@highlight Higher P V ratios are achieved in smaller vessels with similar impeller tip speeds.
@highlight Inconsistencies in mixing attributed to limited mixing in the axial direction.
@highlight Less homogeneous suspension at low solids loading than at high loadings.
