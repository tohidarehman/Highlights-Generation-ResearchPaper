 Lateral heterostructures consisting of two dimensional layered materials are generally nanosheets that are unfavourable to various applications such as photocatalysis because they are prone to agglomerate and against for multiple absorption and utilization of light . Herein for the first time we prepare ultra thin tubular LHSs of graphitic carbon nitride and carbon dots with thickness of 8.0nm via a facile one step thermal polymerization of the supramolecular complexes composed of melamine cyanuric acid and cyclodextrin as starting monomers . Interestingly the structural topology of the CN C Dots LHSs can be effectively modulated by the amount of CyD . The obtained tubular porous LHSs are nearly perfect nanotubes with wall thickness of about 8.0nm the smallest one reported so far which not only greatly increases the accessibility of active sites and light harvesting via high light absorption and scattering but also shortens the route of carriers migrating towards the surface and improves the mass transport . In comparison with CN the optimized ultra thin tubular porous CN C Dots
