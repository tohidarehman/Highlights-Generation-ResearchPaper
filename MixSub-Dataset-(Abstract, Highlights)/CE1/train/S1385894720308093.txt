 Recently hierarchically porous materials have attracted considerable attention in the field of water treatment due to their enhanced adsorption performance including high adsorption capacity and fast adsorption rate . Herein a facile yet efficient dual template method to manufacture hierarchically porous chitin microspheres is reported . In the prepared method two templates play respective roles micron size CaCO

@highlight Hierarchically porous chitin microspheres HCM were prepared by a facile dual template method.
@highlight The as obtained HCM shows improved specific surface area of 221.08m
@highlight The obtained glycinemodified GHCM shows excellent adsorption performances.
