 Extensive efforts have been made for research on the development of selective separation membranes however the simultaneous promotion of stable selectivity and high permselectivity still faces its challenges . For the first time a subversive synthesis strategy with hierarchical structure was proposed for the preparation of double layer based molecularly imprinted nanocomposite membranes . Herein the polydopamine based imprinting process was initially performed on the surfaces of SiO

@highlight Double layer based molecularly imprinted membranes were successfully synthesized.
@highlight An imitated core shell synergistic integration process was designed for selective separation of TC.
@highlight Well designed hierarchical DLMIMs were first applied as selective separation membranes.
@highlight High rebinding capacity and permselectivity performance could be simultaneously obtained.
