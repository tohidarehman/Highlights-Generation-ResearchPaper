 Rotating disc contactor is one of the most important extraction columns for liquid liquid extraction . A single stage horizontal axis RDC was developed and used for extraction of emulsion system . The extractor composed characteristics of narrow mixing space of 1

@highlight Mass transfer was greatly enhanced in a narrow mixer.
@highlight Oil Phase separation was enhanced in oil wet slits.
@highlight Circulation flow formed dispersion coalescence dispersion process.
@highlight Continuous extraction of ethanol from water with 2 ethyl hexanol.
@highlight Extraction effect in HRDC was better than one equilibrium stage.
