 Optical thermometry offers great precision repeatability flexibility and stability hence providing performance advantages in non contact temperature measurement . To assess its potential for controlling the temperature of steam cracking furnaces ethane steam cracking experiments were carried out on pilot plant scale . The control performance of the pyrometer was found to be comparable to that of a weld on type K thermocouple the latter being representative of the industrial standard . The tested optical thermometer is suited as a sensor to measure tube metal temperatures of a steam cracking reactor coil either inside or outside of the firebox . Due to its fast response time optical thermometer temperature measurements help to prevent temperature overshoots which have an adverse effect on the tube longevity and coke formation . Flexibility in positioning makes optical thermometry a viable alternative compared to conventional type K thermocouples .

@highlight Steam cracking pilot plant experiments have been performed with various temperature measurement devices.
@highlight Process gas temperature pressure and product yields were measured during the different experiments.
@highlight Optical thermometers could replace Type K thermocouples in a temperature control loop for steam cracking furnaces.
