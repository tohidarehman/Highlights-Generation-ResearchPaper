 The aluminum fluorine reaction hold great potential in crippling Al pre combustion sintering and agglomeration during combustion . Herein the laser sensitive Al PVDF fuel rich films were prepared by employing a sponge like microvoids structure through a phase inversion method coupled with micro segmented flow displaying the laser power threshold and ignition delay time by less than 4.8Jcm
