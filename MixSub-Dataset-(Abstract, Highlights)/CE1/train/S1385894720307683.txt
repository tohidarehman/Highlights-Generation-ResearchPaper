 Due to the limited access to safe drinking water there is an emerging need to have a quick water decontamination strategy wherein all the major contaminants of water like dyes organic compounds and pathogenic bacteria can be removed using a sustainable approach . Herein we introduce a facile method to strongly couple photocatalytic dual active AgBiO

@highlight Strongly coupled AgBiO
@highlight based recyclable and reusable composite membranes with no significant leaching of Ag ions.
@highlight Enhanced water flux and protein fouling resistance with FRR 875 and BSA as model foulant.
@highlight Complete
@highlight remediation in the presence of light as well as dark conditions.
@highlight Effective bactericidal action against secondary wastewater verified by live dead assay.
@highlight More than 83 degradation of recalcitrant Methylene Blue and 4 Nitrophenol.
