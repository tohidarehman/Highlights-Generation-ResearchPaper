 Heterogeneous photo Fenton reaction with iron based magnetic materials has been proposed as an alternative to the homogeneous Fenton process to remove contaminants of emerging concern because of the low cost facile recovery and reuse . The iron based material is not only a reservoir to maintain an effective concentration of iron in solution but it also activates H

@highlight The effect of HA coating on MPs was studied in photo Fenton like process.
@highlight XPS allowed to relate iron surface speciation with photo Fenton reactivity.
@highlight Humic acid coating enhances the catalytic efficiency for 4 CP degradation.
@highlight The efficiency of MP HA was tested by degrading CECs in real wastewater sample.
