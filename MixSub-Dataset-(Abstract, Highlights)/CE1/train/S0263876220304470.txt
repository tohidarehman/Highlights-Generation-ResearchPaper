 Amorphous iron hydroxide based material was selected as a suitable adsorbent for the siloxanes from biogas and landfill gas . The adsorptive characteristics of the desiloxanation process were studied through a lab scale experiment using a simulated gas containing a mixture of siloxanes and a field experiment on an actual environment scale . The iron hydroxide based adsorbents exhibited high activity in adsorption of siloxanes during lab scale experiments where the obtained adsorption capacity was about 26.3 with N

@highlight Iron hydroxide based adsorbents were used to remove of siloxanes from biogas.
@highlight Space velocity effects the siloxanes capture in a field experiment.
@highlight High activity 26 in adsorption of siloxanes was obtained in a lab scale experiment.
@highlight High removal efficiency in siloxane adsorptions was obtained during the in situ test.
