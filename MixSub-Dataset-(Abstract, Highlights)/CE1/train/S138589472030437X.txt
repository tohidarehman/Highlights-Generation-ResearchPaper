 Toward eradicating tumor it is crucial to facilitate the sustained delivery of encapsulated drugs and render enhancements of therapeutic effectiveness . Local cancer therapy with combined drugs has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy . Herein we put forward to construct a hybrid nanocomposite in which metal organic frameworks were integrated with thermosensitive hydrogels to devise an injectable implant . Doxorubicin and celecoxib were coloaded into the system for localized oral cancer therapy Dox Cel

@highlight The hybrid material integrating MOFs into hydrogels are designed for the first time.
@highlight Doxorubicin and celecoxib are coloaded in the system for local oral cancer therapy.
@highlight The nanocomposite realizes simultaneously pH responsive dual drug sustained release.
@highlight The nanocomposite enhances the antitumor effect and mitigates toxic side effects.
@highlight Original data of MOFs reveals no permanent toxic effect only reversible anomalies.
