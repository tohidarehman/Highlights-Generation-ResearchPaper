 Copper nanowire is one of the most promising candidates for next generation transparent conductive film . However practical applications of CuNW are still limited by several drawbacks including loose wire to wire junctions poor resistance against oxidation chemical and thermal damage . To concurrently address these urgent issues highly conductive and stable TCF is prepared based on

@highlight Firm junctions between stacked CuNWs were achieved by electrodeposition coating Ni shell.
@highlight The sheet resistance of
@highlight NW TCF decreased from 513 to 15.8Ohm sq at a transmittance of 88 .
@highlight The electrical resistance of
@highlight NW network remained stable after storing in atmospheric environment for a week.
@highlight The
@highlight NW network could resist H
@highlight corrosion up to 450s.
@highlight The morphology of
@highlight NW network kept intact after heating at 400C for 30min.
