 Nanoscale metal organic frameworks are promising materials for many applications . However for actual applications it is a big challenge to change the brittle MOFs into flexible materials suitable for universal large scale fabrication . Herein we develop a facile universal controllable large scale strategy to fabricate the tightly bonded and flexible nanoMOFs based composites by flexibly controlling the nucleation and growth of nanoMOFs . Based on this universal strategy a series of tightly bonded and flexible
