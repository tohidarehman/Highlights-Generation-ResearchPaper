 The hydrolysis acidification tank was usually selected as the pretreatment of combined industrial and domestic wastewater for municipal wastewater treatment plants . Strict source control and urbanization substantially reduced industrial wastewater fed into MWWTPs and thus HAT should be repurposed . Long term survey of a full scale MWWTP showed HAT had adverse effects on biological nutrient removal of subsequent activated sludge systems because it increased difficulty of BNR owing to carbon source loss and generated sulfide preferentially combining with ammonia monooxygenase in anaerobic phase of posterior biological treatment process to significantly inhibit activities of nitrifiers . Full scale experiment of bypassing HAT achieved more efficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal and thus three pilot scale systems were designed to investigate process performance by upgrading HAT to anaerobic side stream reactor and anaerobic main stream reactor . The three systems were equally effective in chemical oxygen demand total phosphorus and ammonium nitrogen removal . Upgrading HAT to ASSR and AMSR enhanced total nitrogen removal from 63.3 to 65.1 and 72.0 and achieved sludge reduction of 15.4 and 40.5 . Intrasystem flow analysis confirmed that upgrading increased proportion of COD utilized for denitrification .

@highlight Hydrolysis tank HAT reduced COD for nutrient removal and inhibited nitrification.
@highlight Upgrading HAT to anaerobic side main stream reactor ASSR AMSR was studied.
@highlight Upgrading HAT improved nitrogen removal and achieved sludge reduction of 15.440.5 .
@highlight AMSR enriched hydrolytic and predatory bacteria while ASSR favored slow growers.
@highlight AMSR is a cost effective and advantageous upgrading strategy for HAT.
