 The extensive use of fluoroquinolones antibiotics makes great contributions to human society but it also brings serious threats due to its stable chemical properties and difficulty in natural degradation . Since FQs can form stable chelates with polyvalent metal cations the new adsorbents based on this chelating agent can not only remove FQs effectively but also have the characteristics of selective identification on target pollutants . In this paper novel sodium alginate based gel spheres were prepared by droplet polymerization with sodium alginate as functional monomer AlCl

@highlight Novel sodium alginate based gel spheres were prepared by droplet polymerization.
@highlight The prepared GA SA Al Ca gel sphere showed good adsorption performance for S OFX.
@highlight The adsorption equilibrium of two prepared gel spheres could be reached in 10min.
@highlight The stabilities could be greatly improved by ion and covalent crosslinking.
