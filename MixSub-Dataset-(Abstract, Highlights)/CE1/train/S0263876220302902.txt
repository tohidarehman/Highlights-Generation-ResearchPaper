 A recent paper developed a complex divided wall column with two walls in a single vessel that was capable of separating a four component mixture into four high purity products . The walls created three internal sections in the middle of the column . One section was sealed at the bottom and had a small reboiler from which the lighter of the intermediate boiling components was withdrawn . A second section was sealed at the top and had a small condenser and reflux drum from which the heavier of the intermediate components was withdrawn . The feed was introduced into the middle of the third section that was open at both ends . The top of this section was connected to the rectifying section of the vessel which had a main condenser and reflux drum from which the lightest component was produced in the overhead distillate . This section was also open at the bottom and connected to the stripping section of the vessel which had a main reboiler from which the heaviest component was produced as the bottoms .

@highlight A column with side stripper and side rectifier is proposed as a more straightforward alternative to a complex divided wall column.
@highlight The economics are essentially the same.
@highlight The proposed process provides more robust controllability since both the liquid and vapor splits can be manipulated.
@highlight Large disturbances in throughput and feed composition are effectively handled.
