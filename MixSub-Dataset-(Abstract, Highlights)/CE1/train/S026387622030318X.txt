 The possibility of paraffins and C4 olefins mixture separation on membranes made of polyethylene with radiation grafted sulfonated polystyrene is shown . The selective separation is achieved due to the butenes and isobutene facilitated transfer in the form of a complex with a proton . Moreover despite the significantly larger cross sectional size obstructing the transfer isobutene molecules are also transferred much faster than butane and the separation coefficient reaches 3.8 . An unusual fact was discovered of separation selectivity and permeability increase with the separated gases flow humidity rise .

@highlight Membrane from polyethylene with radiation grafted sulfonated polystyrene was used.
@highlight The membrane allows the selective separation of paraffins and C4 olefins mixtures.
@highlight Separation selectivity permeability increase with rising the gas flow humidity.
