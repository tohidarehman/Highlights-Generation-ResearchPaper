 Currently phosphor materials play an important role in designing noncontact remote optical thermometers . Although many approaches have contributed to improve thermometric performance of optical thermometers including optimization of host materials size of nanoparticles dopant type and concentration as well as excitation density and phonon energy engineering the development of highly sensitive optical thermometric materials is still a challenge . Hence we developed novel CaNb
