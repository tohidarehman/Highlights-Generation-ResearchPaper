 Optical stimuli materials have been applied in many fields since it can be activated from external system and localized in time and space . Although optically healable polymers have been well developed in recent years to be healed under mild conditions remains a big challenge for these materials . Herein we report the design and synthesis of a metallo supramolecular polymer containing azopyridine ligands to address this conundrum . The resulting photo healable polymer is highly stretchable with a high toughness 16.33MJ m

@highlight Supramolecular networks based on metal ligand coordination were fabricated.
@highlight Photoresponsive metallo supramolecular performed dynamic properties and self healing abilities under light stimulus.
@highlight Light healing process displayed excellent self healing behavior in different conditions.
@highlight The supramolecular elastomer exhibited excellent sensing behavior in sensor applications.
