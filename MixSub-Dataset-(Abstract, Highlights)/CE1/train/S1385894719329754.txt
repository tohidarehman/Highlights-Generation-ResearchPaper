 In this study a comparison between electrochemically activated peroxomonosulfate and peroxydisulfate using carbon anodes was conducted for the first time . PMS activation was achieved using graphite and multi walled carbon nanotube anodes which significantly promoted the degradation of organic pollutants sulfamethoxazole . The radical probing and scavenging experiments demonstrated that SO

@highlight Electrochemically activated PMS significantly enhanced organic pollutants degradation.
@highlight Compared with PDS electrochemically activated PMS was easier to generate SO
@highlight Electrochemically activated PMS exhibited strong resistance towards water background components.
