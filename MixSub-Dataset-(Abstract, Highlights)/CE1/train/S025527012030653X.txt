 In this study Zinc Aluminium layered double hydroxide was synthesized to fabricate membranes with superior hydrophilic and photocatalytic characteristics . The prepared LDH was extensively characterized and employed for the preparation of polyetherimide mixed matrix ultrafiltration membranes which displayed 96 BSA rejection and a flux recovery ratio of 88 even after 3 cycles . M 1 displayed a 94 degradation of organic dye in 120min when irradiated with UV light . Further nanofiltration membranes were prepared by incorporating Zn Al LDH into the polyamide layer during the in situ interfacial polymerization to prepare thin film nanocomposite membranes . MT 2 displayed improved hydrophilicity 94.5 rejection of cationic dye 91 rejection of inorganic salt CaSO
