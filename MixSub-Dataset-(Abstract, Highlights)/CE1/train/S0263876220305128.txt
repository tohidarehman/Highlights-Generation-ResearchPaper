 This work investigated the removal of toluene using cyclic adsorption oxidation operation in a fixed bed dielectric barrier discharge plasma catalytic reactor containing Pd ZSM 5 catalyst . The modification of ZSM 5 with Pd catalyst substantially improved the adsorption capability for toluene . The catalyst adsorbing toluene was readily regenerated during the plasma catalytic oxidation step . The synergistic effect of the catalyst promoted the toluene oxidation process as well as improved the selectivity towards CO
