 The traditional aeration leaching process for the upgrading of reduced ilmenite is extremely sluggish and needs significant improvements in its efficiency . An improved aeration leaching process which comprises reduction aeration with a catalyst wet magnetic separation and further leaching was used for the preparation of synthetic rutile in the present study . The effects of NH

@highlight An improved Becher process for the production of synthetic rutile was proposed.
@highlight Catalysts significantly enhanced the aeration process.
@highlight Magnetite can be steadily formed as by product with the existence of AQ 2 6.
@highlight The recovery rate of titanium was improved by magnetic separation method.
