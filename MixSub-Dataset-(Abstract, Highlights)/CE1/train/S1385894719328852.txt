 Chemoselective hydrodeoxygenation of lipids to diesel like hydrocarbons is important for biomass to biofuel conversion . Here we design a new Ni based catalyst Ni MoO

@highlight Partial oxidation of Mo
@highlight CT
@highlight MXene is used as a novel support for Ni based catalyst.
@highlight The Ni MoO
@highlight @Mo
@highlight CT
@highlight catalyst shows enhanced activity and selectivity ratio of C

@highlight The major product of palmitic acid HDO is C
@highlight  demonstrating a high C atom economy.
@highlight The improved performance is ascribed to the synergic effect of metal Ni Mo
