 It is the hot issue for Li organic battery that whether the higher specific surface area of the porous organic polymers as the electrode materials can benefit to the better battery performance . In this article the conjugated polymer based on star shaped benzene thiophene structure and benzene ethynyl thiophene structure were designed and successfully prepared . The pBHT polymer exhibits the unique stacked hollow tube morphology and possesses the high surface area 1139m

@highlight Thiophene based polymers with different morphology and surface area are designed.
@highlight The pBHT with hollow tube morphology and high surface area shows the low capacity.
@highlight The morphology may affect the SEI formation and possible Li transporting problem.
@highlight The pBABT with the macroporous morphology shows the high capacity and stability.
@highlight The morphology of electrode material influences the stability performance of LIBs.
