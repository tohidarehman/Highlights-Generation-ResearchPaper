 Disc donut strippers are widely equipped in fluid catalytic cracking units of petroleum refineries . In this study circumferential gas solids flow heterogeneity in a disc donut catalyst stripper was investigated using both experimental and CFD simulation approaches . A four channel fiber optical densitometry was used to measure the radial gas solids profiles synchronously from four different circumferential angles . Computational particle fluid dynamics model was used to simulate the experimental stripper section . It was found in experiment that the circumferential gas solids distribution is highly heterogeneous throughout the disc donut stripper . Local gas bypassing existed under all the experimental conditions . The CPFD model successfully predicted gas bypassing and circumferential flow heterogeneity in the disc donut stripper . However previous two fluid model simulations on disc donut strippers using a single mean particle size can only predict axially symmetrical flow distribution . According to a series of sensitivity analyses it is shown that the consideration of particle size distribution is a possible key reason leading to the successful prediction of the circumferential flow heterogeneous by the CPFD model .
