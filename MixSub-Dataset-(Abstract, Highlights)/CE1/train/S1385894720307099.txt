 Multi level and multi angle designations of photocatalysts have attracted great attention to address the insufficient photogenerated charge generation and transformation in photocatalysis . In this study we reported an ultrathin 1D 2D W

@highlight Ultrathin 1D 2D W
@highlight  g C
@highlight nanocomposites have been synthesized successfully.
@highlight 1D 2D W
@highlight  g C
@highlight present high remove rate for IBF under light irradiation.
@highlight The LSPR effect of W
@highlight play vital role for the NIR light response ability.
@highlight and
@highlight OH radical species are all participated in this reaction system.
@highlight Distinctive multiscale structure caused the promoted photocatalytic activity.
