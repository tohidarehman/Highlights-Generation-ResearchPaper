 This article develops a four column hybrid process of hetero azeotropic distillation and pressure swing distillation for separating a ternary multi azeotropic mixture i.e . an organic aqueous solution with a low concentration of isopropanol and diisopropylether . For improving its economic and energetic performances an intensified process by heat pump and dividing wall column is proposed namely HAD DWC VRC PSD . The quantified performance improvement over the HAD PSD process reveals that the annual energy cost is drastically reduced by 39.7 from 45.527.4 per tonne of IPA and DIPE while the total annual cost is cut by 11.7 from 92.081.3 per tonne of IPA and DIPE . Besides the thermodynamic efficiency is increased from 19.80 to 25.96 and the carbon footprint as an indicator of unsustainable energy use is abated by 59 . Overall the HAD DWC VRC PSD process is economically viable and eco sustainable in a way .
