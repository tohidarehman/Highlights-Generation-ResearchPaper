 In this study bimetallic metal organic frameworks containing the metalloligand unit linked by Fe and Co cations were synthesized successfully with different stoichiometric ratio of precursors . FeCo BDC were investigated by XRD FT IR SEM XPS ICP MS BET and TEM techniques . Effects of stoichiometric ratio of precursors peroxymonosulfate concentrations catalyst dosages and initial pH on the phenanthrene degradation were evaluated . The results indicated that 99.0 of phenanthrene removal efficiency was achieved at pH 3.15 50mg L FeCo BDC 2 0.6mM PMS 1.0mg L phenanthrene and 30min reaction time . Based on the scavenger experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance analyses SO
