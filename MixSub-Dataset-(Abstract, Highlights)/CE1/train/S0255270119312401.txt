 Rotating packed beds are an intensified alternative to conventional absorption columns . RPBs could substantially reduce costs associated with reactive absorption processes such as post combustion CO

@highlight Internal pressure drop measurements of rotating packed bed under rotation are presented.
@highlight Simple modelling approaches are applied that explain the pressure drop.
@highlight Free vortex formation in the RPB eye has been observed through pressure plane measurements.
@highlight Flooding data based on liquid flows from the RPB eye is presented.
