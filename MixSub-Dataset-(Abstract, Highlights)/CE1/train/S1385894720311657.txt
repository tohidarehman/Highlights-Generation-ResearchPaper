 In this work four novel hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents were prepared from a combination of menthol or thymol as hydrogen bond acceptors with 1 decanol or 2 methyl 2 4 pentanediol as hydrogen bond donors for the extraction of boron from aqueous solutions . The DESs were characterized in terms of their physical and thermal properties . The DES critical properties were estimated using a group contribution method based on the modified Lydersen Joback Reid and Lee Kesler mixing rules . Later the solvents were evaluated for their capability to extract boron from different aqueous solutions and the extraction and stripping efficiencies were used as performance evaluation criteria . The hydrophobic DES made with MPD showed high extraction efficiency of boron up to 90.1 and 83.2 for Thy MPD and Men MPD respectively . Stripping of boron from the DES phase was done using 0.1M NaOH as stripping solution . Moreover FTIR spectra were recorded before and after extraction of boron to better understand the extraction mechanism . The extraction was due to the complexation between MPD in the DES and boric acid . The hydrophobic DESs offer an environmentally benign alternative as extractants and allow for the use of water miscible diols like MPD in the extraction of boron from aqueous environments such as industrial wastewater or boron rich brines .
