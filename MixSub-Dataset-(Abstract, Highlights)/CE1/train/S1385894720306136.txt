 Soy protein based adhesives showed great potential for replacing petroleum derived formaldehyde adhesives in the commercial wood industry . However soy protein adhesives have several problematic limitations particularly with respect to low water and mildew resistence . As such in order for soy protein based adhesives to be practically applicable on an industrial level a multi function bio based crosslinker that resolves both low water and mildew resistance must be designed . In this study we synthesized a multifunctional crosslink agent by reacting soybean derived daidzein with epichlorohydrin and incorporating it into soy protein to parpare a 100 bio wood adhesive with significantly improved water and mildew resistances . The results showed that by using 6wt DDE in the adhesive formulation the dry and wet shear strength of plywood bonded with the SPI DDE adhesive increased by 52.3 and 164.4 respectively compared with that of SPI adhesive and was shown to be 22.3 and 69.6 higher than that of the industrially used SPI PAE adhesive . These improvements were attributed to formation of double cross linked network and elevated adhesive toughness . Furthermore the resultant adhesives mildew resistance property were also improved with the addition of DDE which extended the shelf life of adhesive and durability of the resultant plywood . Thus this resultant DDE can be used to improve the mechanical properties and mildew resistance for bio hydrogels or bio based composites and polymers .

@highlight The soybean derived daidzein was epoxidized to develop a bio based crosslinker DDE .
@highlight DDE was used to modify soy protein adhesive to form a 100 bio based wood adhesive.
@highlight Using 6 DDE the dry and wet shear strength of plywood increase by 52.3 and 164.4 .
@highlight DDE improves adhesives mildew resistance and extends adhesives shelf life to 12h.
