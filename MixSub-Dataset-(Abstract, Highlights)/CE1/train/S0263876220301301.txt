 In flotation the fluidization can enhance the coarse particle recovery which is dependent on the quiescent flow condition and is also affected by the liquidsolid interphase drag force . In this study the liquid and particle flow behaviours are investigated by using the Eulerian Eulerian two fluid model combining the kinetic theory of granular flow coupled with the RNG

@highlight Spherical and aspherical drag models are examined in liquidsolid fluidized bed.
@highlight Drag models based on irregular particle show best results than spherical drag.
@highlight Restitution and specularity coefficient 
@highlight  are quantified.
@highlight Location of strong circulation in fluidized bed is identified and discussed.
@highlight Nearly inelastic collision or no slip case shows less effect on granular temperature.
@highlight Liquid velocity and
@highlight affect significantly on solid pressure for nearly no slip case.
