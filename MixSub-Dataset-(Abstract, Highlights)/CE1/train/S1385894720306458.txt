 As a promising energy saving technique the eco friendly and low cost solid state white light emitting diodes based on quantum dots have been widely studied . Herein a WLED device prepared by coreshell structure nanocomposites based on Ag In S

@highlight Overcome the aggregation induced quenching effect of CDs in solid state.
@highlight A novel white light emitting nanocomposite with a coreshell structure has been synthesized.
@highlight A UV pumped WLED with a CRI up to 91 has been fabricated with the nanocomposite.
@highlight Controllable blue yellow PL intensity ratios of the prepared nanocomposite.
