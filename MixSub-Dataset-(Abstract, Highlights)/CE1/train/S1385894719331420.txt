 The autotrophic nitrogen removal could be achieved in the one stage or two stage PN ANAMMOX systems . A number of researches were carried out to study the impact of HET on the one stage PN ANAMMOX system . It is still not clear about the role of HET in the ANAMMOX process of the two stage system . The granule sludge system used for the ANAMMOX process also included the flocs resulting in the segregation of biomass between the flocs and granules . How the HET is segregated between the flocs and granules is still unknown . In this study we examined the role of HET in the two stage system ANAMMOX process and how the biomass segregation affects its role . The increase of floc SRT from 7h to 30d increased the floc granule ratio by 150200 depending on the influent COD concentration . The biomass segregation affected the role of heterotrophic bacteria in the ANAMMOX process of the two stage PN ANAMMOX system . When there was no biomass segregation the heterotrophic bacteria negatively impacted the TN removal as the presence of HET within the granules reduced the number of ANAMMOX bacteria reducing the nitrogen removal capacity . Under biomass floc granule segregation conditions the HET predominantly resided in the flocs and increased nitrogen removal by providing additional nitrite through the denitrification process . Compared to the TN removal without biomass segregation the segregation of HET between the floc and granules caused 3 to 40 more TN removal depending on the influent COD concentration .

@highlight Biomass was segregated in the form of granules and flocs.
@highlight Biomass segregation affects ANAMMOX reactor efficiency.
@highlight Model was developed to simulate the biomass segregation in ANAMMOX reactor.
@highlight Heterotrophic bacteria predominantly occupied the flocs.
@highlight Heterotrophic bacteria in the flocs promote nitrogen removal.
