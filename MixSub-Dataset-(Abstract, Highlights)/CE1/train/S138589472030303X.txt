 In an attempt to attain synergistic therapeutic benefits and address various intrinsic limitations of the highly efficient black phosphorus quantum dots we fabricated poly

@highlight BPQDs and GA encapsulated polymeric nanoparticles are fabricated using the SCF technology.
@highlight GA promoted the PTT efficiency of BPQDs by hampering the thermoresistance of cells.
@highlight PA imaging guided synergistic PTT chemotherapy is achieved towards cancer ablation.
