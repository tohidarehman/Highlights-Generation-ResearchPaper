 Polypyrrole based fiber shaped supercapacitor is attracting increasing attention as energy storage devices of flexible and wearable electronic products in recent years . However its application is limited by the low specific capacitance and poor rate capability mainly suffering from inferior conductivity and inhibited ions channels of fiber electrode . Here a high performance flexible FSSC is constructed based on hierarchically interconnected porous poly poly PPy composite fiber prepared by in situ chemical polymerization of pyrrole on a novel highly conductive PEDOT PSS hydrogel support . The good electronic and ionic conductor properties hierarchically porous structure and interaction of conducting polymer hybrid fiber ensure fast electrons transfer ions diffusion and the efficient utilization of whole electrode . Benefiting from the well designed hybrid architecture and synergistic effect the PEDOT PSS PPy hybrid fiber in FSSC exhibits superb volumetric areal length specific capacitance 393.8Fcm
