 Highly chemical stable and antibacterial materials are desirable for bone reconstruction and packaging applications . Crosslinked polymer inorganic materials have attracted significant attention in this respect owing to their low cost simplicity and excellent mechanical properties . Up to this work it remains challenging to fabricate hybrid organic inorganic films with controlled electrochemical photocorrosion and antibacterial performance that are stable in the aggressive solutions and solvents . In this protocol paper we report a new approach to designing crosslinked polymer inorganic films with enhanced corrosion protection and antibacterial performance by manipulating the amount of citric acid and polyvinyl alcohol in the hydrogen film PxCy . Ultrathin PxCy films are fabricated in situ by interfacial crosslinking process on the porous inorganic surface synthesized via straightforward plasma electrolysis . Enhanced electrochemical photocorrosion and potential antibacterial performance for IC PxCy film is achieved by using contorted crosslinking agent CA for the interfacial crosslinking process . The electrochemical performance is enhanced remarkably in the order of IC P6.5C3.5 IC P5C5 IC P10C0 IC and IC P2C8 which account for the synergistic integration of the IC and PxCy as well as degree of crosslinking between PVA and CA . In addition the results indicate that IC P6.5C3.5 IC P5C5 and IC P2C8 have outstanding antibacterial activity .
