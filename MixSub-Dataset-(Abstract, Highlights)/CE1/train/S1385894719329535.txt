 The interface polarization are of great important for electromagnetic wave absorption . However the tailored interfacial structure and corresponding effect on EWA remain a huge challenge . Here a novel strategy of constructing interfacial hierarchical structure is reported to unveil such basic relationship . The melamine carbonized sponge composites with interfacial hierarchical structure are successfully synthesized under the assistance of trace amounts of nickel metal catalysis . The as prepared MCS composites present adjustable microwave absorption performance with carbonization temperature increasing from 600 to 900C . Experimental and simulation results reveal the excellent EWA benefitting from appropriate interface polarization . Moreover the model of interface polarization in dielectric behaviors is proposed . As a result the interface factor is found to be a key factor to balance interface polarization . Remarkably when the value of is optimized to 0.3 MCS8 achieves ultralight 5.36mgcm
