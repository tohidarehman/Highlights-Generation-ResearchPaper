 In the solvolytic liquefaction reaction of biomass biopolymers are produced by bond breakage in the complex lignocellulosic composition using the appropriate solvent and functionalizing the related fragments under mild conditions . The utilization of these bio polyols as carbon sources has enhanced the conspicuous relevance in the handling of agroforestry by products as an alternative to fossil fuel based sources taking into account the terms sustainability and environmental impact . In this study a green and inexpensive method based on the resinification and subsequent foaming of bio polyols produced by solvolytic liquefaction of the tree bark was adopted to synthesize carbon foams with a well developed hierarchical porous structure . The novelty of this study to brighten the studies in the literature was to examine the characteristics of biomass based carbon foams produced by adding two types of non ionic surfactants into the synthesis medium at different surfactant biomass ratios . This study comprises a promising technique that promotes self foaming in the existence of non ionic surfactants to produce reticulated carbon foams from forest industry wastes with porous graphitic structure high surface area up to 758 m
