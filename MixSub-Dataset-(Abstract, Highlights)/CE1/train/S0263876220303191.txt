 This work proposes a methodology to perform exergy analysis of an intensified isothermal reactive extraction process . The method involves two steps . The first one includes the modeling and adaptation of a material utilization diagram to allow the estimation of exergy losses and gains for each component and for the overall process . In the second step the utilization of exergy of the different reactive extraction configurations was estimated through the calculation of exergy indicators . The strategy estimates the effect of the operation and design parameters on the indicators and determinates the process configuration with the best utilization of exergy . The method was applied to the butyl acetate and n amyl acetate reactive extractions processes in single and multiple stage operations . For both cases of study improvements in the exergy indicators were obtained by using a countercurrent configuration with two stages . Exergy indicator of 88.45 and 82.97 for butyl acetate and n amyl acetate respectively were determined for product stream . The method proposed can support the search for optimal operation and design parameters and help the development of highly efficient reactive extraction processes .
