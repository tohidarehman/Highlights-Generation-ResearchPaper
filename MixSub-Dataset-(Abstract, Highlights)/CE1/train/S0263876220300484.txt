 Hot melt extrusion is increasingly applied in the pharmaceutical industry for the formulation of solid dispersions of drugs with improved solubility and release . However tableting of milled extrudates may present problems due to adverse thermo mechanical effects on elasto plasticity . In this work compression of hot melt extruded polyvinyl based and polymethacrylate polymers with glass transition temperatures T

@highlight For polymers with medium
@highlight  compression at 40 C counteracts adverse effects of HME.
@highlight Compactibility improvement at elevated temperature is due to increased plastic deformation.
@highlight Only mild temperature increase is needed which is feasible with modern tableting equipment.
@highlight Knowledge of compression temperature effects helps development to full scale production.
