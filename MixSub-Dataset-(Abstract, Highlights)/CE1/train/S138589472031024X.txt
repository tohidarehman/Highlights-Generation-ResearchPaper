 The radioresistance of tumor cells is considered to be a major factor responsible for the clinical failure of radiotherapy . Instead of simply increasing the radiation dose effective elevation the tumor radiosensitivity is an alternative strategy for successful cancer treatment . Here we report a facile solvothermal protocol to synthesize the rod shaped heterogeneous Bi
