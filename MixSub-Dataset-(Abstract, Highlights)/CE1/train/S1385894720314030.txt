 Integration of microreactors with ultrasound is a promising way to intensify gas liquid mass transfer . The present study locally visualized and characterized the O

@highlight Local investigations of the gas liquid mass transfer in microreactors under ultrasonic oscillation.
@highlight Ultrasound can significantly affect the gas liquid hydrodynamics.
@highlight Ultrasound can induce a periodic expansion and contraction of the bubble.
@highlight Enhancement of gas liquid mass transfer by ultrasound is more pronounced during bubble flowing than the formation stage.
