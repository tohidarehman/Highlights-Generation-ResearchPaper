 The operational performance of a chemical process plant highly depends on the assets condition and maintenance practices . As chemical processes are highly complex systems increasing the risk frequencies and their interactions the maintenance planning becomes crucial for stable operation . This paper provides a critical analysis of the recently developed approaches for asset maintenance approaches in the chemical industry . The strategies include corrective maintenance time based risk based condition based and opportunistic maintenance . Various methods on selecting the optimal maintenance strategy are discussed as well . This paper also evaluates reliability issues in chemical plants and integrated sites encompassing the maintenance optimisation . Several directions for potential future improvements are proposed based on this analysis as follows potential study of exploiting production or other opportunities to postpone or conduct earlier maintenance joint optimisation of spare part ordering strategy and data driven maintenance planning study is needed fault propagation modelling of structural dependent units to facilitate proper maintenance planning a framework or tool that consider quantitative and qualitative time variant data inputs is lacking for business informed asset maintenance .

@highlight State of the art of asset maintenance planning in the chemical process industries.
@highlight Integrating risk based and condition based maintenance planning.
@highlight A tool to handle quantitative and qualitative time variant data is needed.
@highlight Opportunistic maintenance with units dependency in process and site level to increase efficiency.
@highlight Data driven spare part ordering and maintenance planning model is needed.
