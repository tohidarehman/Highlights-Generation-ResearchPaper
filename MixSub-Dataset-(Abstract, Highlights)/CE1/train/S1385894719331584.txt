 Membrane based processes are increasingly applied in shale gas flowback and produced water reuse . However severe membrane fouling remains a big challenge for maintaining long term operation . The present paper investigates for the first time the performance of the integrated ozonation ultrafiltration reverse osmosis process to treat SGFPW for water reuse . Results showed that pre ozonation could efficiently mitigate membrane fouling . The integrated process removed more than 98 of total dissolved solids 96 of dissolved organic carbon and 96 of all ionic constituents in SGFPW . Significantly the effluent could meet the water quality standards of irrigation livestock water and surface discharge . Removal of targeted pollutants is negatively influenced by the high concentrations of chloride and bromide because of their high reactivity with ozone and hydroxyl radicals HO

@highlight Ozonation is combined with membrane process to efficiently reuse SGFPW.
@highlight Effluent of process is suitable for irrigation livestock and surface discharge.
@highlight The mechanism of poor efficiency of ozonation in treating SGFPW is firstly proved.
@highlight Pre ozonation decreased TFI and HIFI by 8595 and 4659 respectively.
