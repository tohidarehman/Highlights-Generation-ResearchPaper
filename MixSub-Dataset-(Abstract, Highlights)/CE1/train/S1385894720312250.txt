 With increasing global food demand the production and protection of agricultural crops in safe and secure fashion has become a critical issue . Herein we report a novel type of nanopesticide based on avermectin and composite nanocarriers made from the functionalization boron nitride nanoplatelets with 3 mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane and poly diacrylate . Such nanocarriers exhibit a high pesticide loading capacity due to their layered nanostructure and their favorable interactions with AVM molecules achieved through hydrophobic effect stacking and electrostatic interactions . By changing pH from 7 to 11 the release kinetics could be transformed to a zero order process from a first order process with about a two to three fold increase in the release rate . The pH responsive behavior was ascribed to hydrolysis of ester groups of PEG under alkaline conditions . These pesticide nanocarriers reduced the degradation rate of AVM against UV irradiation about 30 . In summary novel nanopesticides based on BN composite nanocarriers opens new avenues for the delivery of hydrophobic pesticides in the field of agriculture and crop protection .

@highlight BNNP PEG MPTMS nanocomposites are prepared via condensation and Michael addition reaction.
@highlight Such nanocomposites are applied as a promising long term stable aqueous nano carrier for pesticides.
@highlight Nanoconfinement effect and carrier facilitated features of 2D nanocarrier offer a pH responsive pesticide delivery strategy.
