 Maximization of the energy capability of energetic materials by organizing energetic moieties into dense arrangements is of great significance . In this study two novel high energy regioisomers 3 4bis furoxan and 3 4bis furoxan were synthesized by employing controllable synthetic strategy . The constitutional isomers were thoroughly characterized using multinuclear NMR and IR spectroscopy elemental analysis as well as single crystal X ray diffraction . Notably BFTF 1 shows the highest crystal density

@highlight Two novel high energy regioisomers are synthesized via ingenious construction strategy.
@highlight A regioisomer exhibits the highest crystal density among CHNOF compounds reported thus far.
@highlight The structure analysis shows how the
@highlight  oxide position affects their densities.
@highlight This study demonstrates regiochemical modulation could be a powerful tool to enhance the energetic properties.
