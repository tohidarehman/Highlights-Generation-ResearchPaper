 Biochar was added into constructed wetlands as an amendment to the main substrate for improving the removal efficiency of pollutants and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions . Four types of mesocosm scale CWs i.e . unamended subsurface batch CWs and surface batch CWs and biochar amended SSBCWs and SBCWs were established in this study . The SSBCWs outperformed SBCWs in both removing pollutants particularly COD NO

@highlight SSBCWs outperformed SBCWs in removing pollutants and abating GHG emissions.
