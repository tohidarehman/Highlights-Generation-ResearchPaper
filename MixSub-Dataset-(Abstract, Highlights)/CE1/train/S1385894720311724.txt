 The design and synthesis of efficient and affordable electrocatalysts for water oxidation are essential to advance water splitting technology which depends on developing earth abundant catalytic materials with rational compositions and structures . Here we propose a facile synthesis of FeNiOOH nanosheets grown on FeNi foam by in situ chemical oxidation as a novel 3D electrode for oxygen evolution reaction . This FeNiOOH FNF electrode shows outstanding electrocatalytic performance in alkaline electrolyte including high OER activity that requires a small overpotential of 252mV to achieve a current density of 10mAcm
