 The main purpose of this study is the optimization of the operating mode for cryogenic distillation columns that provide an isotopic enrichment in stable isotopes . The analysis is based on an experimental cycle for

@highlight This paper deals with enrichment of
@highlight CO by carbon monoxide cryogenic distillation.
@highlight An experimental run is simulated using a commercial simulation software.
@highlight An optimized semi batch distillation is proposed varying the feed flowrate.
@highlight The proposed cycle allows reaching the desired specification in one third the time.
