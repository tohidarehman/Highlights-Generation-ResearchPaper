 It has been shown that seeded granules of calcium carbonate can be produced in commercial batch high shear granulators such as the Cyclomix high shear impact mixer . Seeded granules are attractive to the pharmaceutical industry due to their high uniformity and good mechanical properties which can assist efficient tablet manufacture . In the current study attempts to produce seeded granules of Durcal 65 and PEG 4000 binder using hot melt granulation are reported in response to the recent shift towards continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing . Various screw configurations and rotation speeds were investigated in a series of experiments to determine the relationship between process conditions and granule properties . Particle size analysis strength measurement and structural characterisation were used to quantify granule properties . It was found that using a series of kneading elements arranged at a 60 staggering angle located near to the feed section of the extruder screw generated strong spherical granules . From structural characterisation approximately 515 of extruded granules were found to be seeded . Twin screw melt granulation is therefore considered to be a promising technique for continuous production of seeded granules although a more detailed investigation is required to optimise yield and quality .

@highlight Seeded granules are appealing to industry due to improved mechanical properties.
@highlight TSE HMG seeded granule production is promising but has low yield.
@highlight Increased TSE screw speed increases granule compression strength.
@highlight Mixing elements towards the start of the screw reduces fine production.
@highlight Increased sphericity of granules with increased screw speeds with mixing elements.
