 The objective of this work was to describe the dispersion state of flavonoids in the press liquor obtained after filtration compression of fresh citrus peels . An original methodology for the quantification of the dispersion based on a size fractionation and its evolution over time was proposed . Three fractions were identified a particulate fraction a large colloidal fraction and a small colloidal and soluble fraction . Narirutin and naringin were initially found on small colloidal soluble form . During time an aggregation of the compounds present in the press liquor revealed by turbidity measurements was observed . This aggregation resulted in an increase of the particulate fraction at the expense of the colloidal one . This aggregation seemed to trap naringin that progressively appeared in the particulate fraction although that no evolution of narirutin location was observed . The tendency to sediment of the formed aggregates was evaluated by a Turbiscan optical analyser in the objective of their future isolation . The stability study of the press liquor over time showed that this suspension was physically stable the aggregates flocs were not able to settle at room temperature certainly because of interparticle repulsion or other reasons as low floc density porous floc structure etc .
