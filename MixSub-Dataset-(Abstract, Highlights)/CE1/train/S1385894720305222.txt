 The thermal management of catalytic reactors dedicated to highly exothermic reactions is often challenging due to the existence of a positive thermal feedback . Up to now many design and control options have been used to operate such reactors safely and efficiently . The present study examines the theoretical benefit of resorting to an alternative stabilization strategy based on the use of induction heated pellets . Under given inductive conditions the thermal power released by these pellets is a decreasing function of their temperature . Wall cooled fixed bed methanation reactors containing mixed catalytic and induction sensitive pellets are simulated numerically . The steady state behavior of reactors enhanced by induction is compared to the behavior of conventional reactors . It is shown that the parametric sensitivity of induction reactors is lower than that of a conventional reactor achieving the same conversion . Induction reactors also demonstrate an ability to reach a higher chemical yield than a conventional reactor before entering the runaway region . The impact of the operation conditions and of the induction sensitive pellets properties on the stabilization is analyzed .
