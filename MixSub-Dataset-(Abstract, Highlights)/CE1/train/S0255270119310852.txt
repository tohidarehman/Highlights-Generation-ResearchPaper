 Mixed matrix membranes based on two different MOFs dispersed in Matrimid 5218 were studied . The synthesized particles were characterized by N

@highlight Incorporation of MOFs to Matrimid improved its separation performance.
@highlight The membranes were tested for helium separation from single gas He CH4 and He N2 .
@highlight MMMs showed the higher glass transition temperatures compared to pure Matrimid.
@highlight Gas performance of MMMs with Cu BDC was better than Cu BTC.
@highlight 30 Cu BDC Matrimid was chosen as the best MMM.
