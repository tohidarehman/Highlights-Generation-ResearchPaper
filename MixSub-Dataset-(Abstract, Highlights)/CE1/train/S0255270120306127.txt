 Extraction in microchannels has been studied extensively . However the recovery of the solute and the solvent from the extract in microchannels has not been part of any reports . Hence in this work extraction of propionic acid using n hexane and toluene and its subsequent recovery by distillation in microchannels is reported . Moreover a total annual cost comparison between microchannels and conventional extraction and distillation units has been made . Microchannel extraction and distillation were conducted in a serpentine microchannel . The maximum percentage extraction is 36.3 with toluene . The maximum extraction efficiency is 99.6 with toluene and 98.4 with n hexane . The overall K

@highlight Extraction and distillation of propionic acid was conducted in microchannels.
@highlight Maximum extraction efficiency is 99.6 with toluene and 98.4 with n hexane.
@highlight Hexane and toluene recovery is 95 and 73 respectively by microchannel distillation.
@highlight Power consumption in microchannel distillation is twice less than the flash unit.
