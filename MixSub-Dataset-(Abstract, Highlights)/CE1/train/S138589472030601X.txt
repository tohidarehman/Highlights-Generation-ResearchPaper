 4 Chloro 3 5 dimethylphenol as a typical antimicrobial compound has been widely used in medical products and cosmetics and has been detected in municipal wastewater . Significant concerns about its persistence and potential toxicity has been paid to in the aquatic environment . In this study we explored UV and UV persulfate advanced oxidation process as potential options to remove PCMX for the first time . A steady state kinetic model was established to simulate the experimental results and to predict the concentration of reactive oxidant species under different reaction conditions . The second order rate constants for PCMX reacting with SO

@highlight The second order rate constants of PCMX with SO
@highlight and HO
@highlight were determined 
@highlight Degradation of PCMX was predicted by the steady state kinetic model under various conditions 
@highlight Density functional theory was applied to identify the radical reactive sites of PCMX 
@highlight Six main elimination pathways were proposed based on HPLC MS MS analysis 
@highlight Accurate toxicity of forty seven byproducts was calculated via the QSAR method.
