 Radioiodine is a challenging contaminant to remove from aqueous wastestreams resulting from spent nuclear fuel reprocessing . To create a selective economical adsorbent a Cu loaded bispicolylamine chelating resin was produced from commercially available reagents and its performance for removal of aqueous iodide and iodine was assessed . The resin possessed a large equilibrium uptake capacity of 30514mg.g

@highlight A novel use for a copper functionalised chelating resin is demonstrated.
@highlight High capacity and selectivity for iodide in static and dynamic experiments is proven.
@highlight Uptake proceeds via ligand exchange REDOX chemistry and charge transfer complex formation.
@highlight A fraction of the bound iodide is extremely chemically and thermally stable.
@highlight The adsorbent shows potential for the treatment of spent nuclear fuel reprocessing waste.
