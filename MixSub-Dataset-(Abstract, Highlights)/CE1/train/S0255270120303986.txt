 Orange is one of the most consumed fruits in the world part of the production is directed to the production of industrialized juice that generates the orange bagasse . Initially it was evaluated the influence of virgin and hydrated CaO pre treatment on the mechanical dewatering stage and on the thermal drying in the vibrofluidized bed . In the mechanical dewatering stage humidity reduction from 1 to 0.6 was obtained probably because of the interaction between the adsorbed water of pectin molecules and the CaO . No significant variations were identified in the type of CaO used in this step however the increase in virgin CaO content led to an increase in the flow of the removed moisture . The drying kinetics of the pressed waste in vibrofluidized bed were analyzed with vibration amplitude and frequency of 0.015 m and 6.16 Hz respectively at 70 and 80 C where the humidity was reduced to approximately 0.1 and only decreasing rate period was identified . The drying kinetics compared the influence of CaO pre treatment under different conditions and in general the use of CaO improved the drying process . The dry waste was also characterized where it was identified high higher heating value and high volatile matter .

@highlight It was evaluated the influence of virgin and hydrated CaO pretreatment on the mechanical dewatering.
@highlight The thermal drying in the orange bagasse vibrofluidized bed was evaluated.
@highlight The addition of CaO promotes a reduction of approximately 40 of moisture.
@highlight Differences between the application of virgin or hydrated CaO were not found.
