 With emerging flexible substrates perovskite solar cells have entered into a new stage of development toward flexibility portability and miniaturization . However this promising landscape is hindered by the necessity the high temperature processes . In this study a highly efficient stable and flexible planar perovskite solar cell is fabricated using an all room temperature pathway . First a nanocrystalline SnO

@highlight Flexible solar cells with of 17.38 were fabricated at room temperature.
@highlight Ultrasonic vibration was realized for both electron transport and active layers.
@highlight Surface energy was responsible for room temperature sintering within 5min.
@highlight Large grain size perovskite layer was prepared free of the thermal annealing.
