 A simple low cost and highly efficient process is required to produce free radicals from peroxides for degradation of organic pollutants . In this study for the first time CoFe

@highlight CoFe
@highlight prepared at 300C with an amorphous structure activated PMS efficiently.
@highlight The column reactor continuously treated SCP wastewater without catalyst recovery.
@highlight The Co leaching amount significantly decreased in PMScolumn reactor system.
@highlight The treatment capacity was 78000Lm
@highlight with 1.0 CoFe
@highlight loading.
@highlight A complete mechanism for PMS activation by CoFe
@highlight was proposed.
