 The present study reports the formation of alumina based inorganic layer via soft plasma discharges for optimizing chemical stability and catalytic activity together . Alkaline silicate electrolyte with complexing agent is formulated to soften the destructive nature of plasma discharges in water . The presence of complexing agent having large denticity activates the swarms of soft plasma events resulting in a less porous architecture than that with simple structure due to a homogenization of electrical field . Accordingly such inorganic layer comprises stable aluminosilicate since chemical transformations are facilitated to a greater extent by soft plasma discharges . The conformal inorganic layer in the present work demonstrates protective and catalytic features together on account of a synergy between compact microstructure and dynamic surface topography caused by residual tracks of plasma discharges . The reformation of electrical double layer after disruptive events which underlines the formation of soft plasma discharges is discussed on the basis of quantum chemical calculation and impedance analysis .
