 A flame retardant and superhydrophobic coating was deposited on cotton fabrics using a simple two step spraying method . In detailed the first step involved flame retardant layer consisted of alkylammonium functional silsesquioxane phytic acid complex while the second step generated superhydrophobic layer that was composed of hierarchical structured titanium

@highlight Flame retardant and superhydrophobic coatings were constructed on cotton fabrics by a facile two step method.
@highlight The treated cotton showed super flame retardancy in terms of self extinguishing behavior.
@highlight The peak heat release rate of the treated cotton was significantly reduced by 70 compared to pure cotton.
@highlight The treated cotton exhibited fascinating anti fouling and water oil separation abilities.
@highlight The coatings on cotton fabrics displayed good abrasion resistance and washing durability.
