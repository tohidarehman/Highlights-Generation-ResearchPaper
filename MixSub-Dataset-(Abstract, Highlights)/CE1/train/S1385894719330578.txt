 The amide condensation reaction is crucial for preparing biological probes with a polypeptide backbone . The traditional condensation reaction requires the monomer and condensing agent to be pre mixed and activated by physical agitation mixing which entail long time require many reagents and yield several by products . In microfluidic mixing devices the high specific surface area of microchannel enables traditional chemical reactions to be accomplished efficiently and quickly using only trace amounts of reagents in real time . This paper presents a serpentine mixing channel for the activation of amino acid monomers . A number of outward convex elliptical structures are introduced to both sides of the improved serpentine microchannel creating a Dean vortex that increases the mixing efficiency at low Reynolds condition 90 at
