 Antibiotics are widespread in water and wastewater which could react with chlorine to produce disinfection byproducts during disinfection process . Activation of permanganate by bisulfite generates a permanganate bisulfite ultra fast oxidation system which exhibits more complete oxidation of refractory organics than conventional advanced oxidation processes . This study explored the formation and speciation of trihalomethanes haloacetic acids haloacetonitriles haloketones and trichloronitromethane during chlorination of antibiotics as well as the impact of

@highlight HAAs formed from antibiotics were much more than that of THMs.
@highlight Disinfection byproducts formation potential DBPFP of sulfamerazine was the highest.
@highlight Monochloroacetic acid was dominate in chlorinated ciprofloxacin and sulfamerazine.
@highlight Trichloroacetic acid was dominate in chlorinated chloramphenicol.
@highlight PM BS oxidation effectively reduced DBPFP of antibiotics even with
@highlight present.
