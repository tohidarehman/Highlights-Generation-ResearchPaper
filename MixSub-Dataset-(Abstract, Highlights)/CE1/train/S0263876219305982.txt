 McCabe Thiele diagrams were developed as a graphical tool for designing binary distillation columns . In this article the method to construct McCabe Thiele diagrams for multicomponent systems is presented illustrating specifically at total reflux for ideal and nonideal systems . Firstly a variety of examples were used to depict the novel representation of the vapour liquid equilibrium in two dimensional space as contours of VLE for the generation of the xy diagram . Once the contours of VLE are represented in 2D various design scenarios can be investigated using the generated plot . Hence the proposed graphical method retains the authenticity simplicity and versatility of the binary McCabe Thiele method . Through examples it is shown that the depiction of the contours of VLE is a powerful visual tool to identify the type of separation azeotropes and tangent pinch points . Thereafter the procedure for calculating the number of stages is presented at total reflux for ideal and nonideal ternary systems to determine the minimum number of stages required . Several simulations for an acetone benzene and chloroform system were generated using Aspen Plus to validate the proposed graphical method . Lastly it was shown that the proposed graphical method correlated more closely to rigorous simulation than traditional methods .

@highlight Vapour liquid equilibrium VLE data of multicomponent distillation systems are represented as contours on an xy plot.
@highlight These contours provide a powerful visual tool to identify difficult separations azeotropes and tangent pinches.
@highlight The minimum number of stages for azeotropic ternary systems at total reflux is calculated from the plot of contours.
@highlight The graphical method was validated using rigorous simulations.
