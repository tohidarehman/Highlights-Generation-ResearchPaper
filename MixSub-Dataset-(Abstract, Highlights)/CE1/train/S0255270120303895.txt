 3 Diethylaminopropylamine a diamine with high reaction rate and large absorption capacity was investigated in this work to evaluate its CO

@highlight The mass transfer performance of CO
@highlight absorption in DEAPA solution was investigated.
@highlight DEAPA exhibited much larger CO
@highlight absorption capacity than other amines.
@highlight The effects of seven influential factors on J
@highlight were examined and discussed.
@highlight An correlation was established to predict K
@highlight and J
@highlight values with an AAD of 6.84 .
