 Per and polyfluoroalkyl substances such as perfluorooctanoic acid are recalcitrant to conventional wastewater treatment processes . In search for a more effective technology we prepared a carbon sphere modified bismuth phosphate composite photocatalyst through a hydrothermal process . BiOHP CS was able to adsorb 99 of PFOA in 2h and subsequently

@highlight A novel bismuth phosphate and carbon sphere composite BiOHP CS was prepared.
@highlight BiOHP CS showed much enhanced adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of PFOA.
@highlight ATR FTIR analysis proved side on corporative adsorption of PFOA on BiOHP CS.
@highlight BiOHP CS degrades PFOA via a cyclic photocatalytic chain shortening mechanism.
@highlight Carbon alters electron distribution of C
@highlight F bonds and promotes hole oxidation of PFOA.
