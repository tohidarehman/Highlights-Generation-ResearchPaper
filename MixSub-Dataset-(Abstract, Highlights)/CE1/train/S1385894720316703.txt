 Functional graded nanofibrous membrane are gaining great attention in biomedical fields for the reason that it allows tunning the composition structure and bioactivity of each layer . Herein we reported a novel FGM prepared by sequential electrospinning technique to guide bone tissue regeneration . The FGM consisted of two aligned gelatin nanofiber surface layers to improve the biocompatibility and enhance bone regeneration and a random PCL nanofiber core layer to render the membrane isotropic mechanical strength . To eliminate bacterial infection risk the pro metronidazole with infection responsive release property was synthesized and loaded into the outer layer . The FGM displayed comparable mechanical strength with PCL and similar biocompatibility to gelatin . The surface aligned nanofiber structure could regulate epithelial cell spread along the aligned direction instead of infiltration growth and were more beneficial for the migration and proliferation of osteoblast . In addition the loaded Pro MNA displayed infection responsive release behavior and robust self defensive antibacterial function was achieved . These results suggested that the FGM simultaneously fulfil several criteria of biocompatibility space maintaining capability antibacterial property and osteoconductivity . Consequently the FGM displayed better bone regeneration performance than the commercial Bio Gide membrane evaluated by the skull defect model of rabbit . We concluded that the FGM had potential to be used as an ideal GTRM due to its improved overall performance .
