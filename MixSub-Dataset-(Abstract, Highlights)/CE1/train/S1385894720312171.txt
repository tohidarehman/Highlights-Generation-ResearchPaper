 For the first time palladium supported on hydroxyapatite was synthesized by integrating ion exchange method and single mode microwave technology . The effect of ion exchange time on the methane CH

@highlight A strategy was developed to prepare Pd loaded hydroxyapatite HAP as catalyst for low temperature methane combustion.
@highlight The Pd HAP 5 catalyst exhibited excellent H
