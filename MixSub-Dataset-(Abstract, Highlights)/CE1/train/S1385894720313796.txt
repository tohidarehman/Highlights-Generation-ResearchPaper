 In this study natural chalcopyrite was employed in the activation of peroxymonosulfate for bisphenol S degradation . Firstly the NCP catalyst was characterized via X ray diffraction scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy techniques . Then several key parameters such as catalyst dosage PMS dosage and initial pH were investigated in NCP PMS system . Furthermore the transformation of various free radicals SO

@highlight The natural chalcopyrite can efficiently activate PMS to degrade bisphenol S.
@highlight The main free radicals responsible for BPS degradation at different initial pH were studied.
@highlight The role of copper iron and sulfur species were investigated.
@highlight Bisphenol S degradation mechanism in NCP PMS system was proposed by DFT calculation.
