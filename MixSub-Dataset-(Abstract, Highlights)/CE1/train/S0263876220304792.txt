 The present work demonstrates the potential of oil n hexane miscella separation from a local factory via a hybrid nanofiltration evaporation process . In the membrane separation solvent resistance nanofiltration membranes lab made of polyvinylidene fluoride as support poly dimethylsiloxane or cellulose acetate as coating materials and a commercial composite membrane were used . To perform this study a representative spiral wound module made up with the membranes previously mentioned was employed . For miscella mass transfer through the SW module a plug cross mixing flow model was used . From experimental miscella permselectivity data at T 30 C and p 20 bar an analytical final expression of mass balance was obtained which correlated the retentate oil concentration with the membrane area . The multistage process of such membranes was integrated by a number of single stage in series . In the multistage membrane performance evaluation several restrictions were imposed on the model considering the operational conditions of the local factory that uses an evaporation and steam stripping process . Seven stage total membrane area 702 m

@highlight Lab made and commercial membranes were used in the design of a multistage process.
@highlight Plug cross mixing flow model to analyze the miscella mass transfer through membrane.
@highlight Composite poly vinylideneflouride 10 poly dimethylsiloxane membrane showed the best effectiveness.
@highlight Seven stages in series gave the best multistage membrane performance high both n hexane purity and oil concentration.
@highlight Hybrid process reduced 50 of the energy cost and 60 of the consumption of water and steam.
