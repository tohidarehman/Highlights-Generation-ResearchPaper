 The design and construction of noble metal free electrocatalysts with superior activity high efficiency and robust stability is still a big challenge for overall water and urea splitting . Herein a novel hybrid electrocatalyst comprising fullerene quantum dot decorated CoNi layered double hydroxides nanosheet arrays anchored on porous Ni foam is elaborately fabricated . Beneficial from the synergetic effect between FQD and CoNi LDH the obtained FQD CoNi LDH NF exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution as well as urea oxidation under ambient atmosphere . Impressively to drive a current density of 10mAcm

@highlight FQD decorated CoNi LDH nanosheet arrays anchored on NF was fabricated.
@highlight The hybrid shows superior electrocatalytic performance for water and urea splitting.
@highlight The mechanism was studied in combination of experiment and DFT calculation results.
