 The high efficiency separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes are significant to achieve highly photoelectrochemical water redox efficiency . Here we integrate anatase TiO

@highlight Anatase TiO
@highlight is fabricated with abundant oxygen vacancies by acid treatment.
@highlight Rutile and anatase TiO
@highlight homojunction can avoid the formation of electron trapping sites.
@highlight Oxygen vacancies increase carrier concentration and enhance the conductivity.
@highlight ZnFe LDH lowers the onset potential and accelerate surface OER kinetics.
@highlight r TiO
@highlight  a TiO
@highlight  ZnFe LDH exhibits largely promoted performances in the PEC water oxidation.
