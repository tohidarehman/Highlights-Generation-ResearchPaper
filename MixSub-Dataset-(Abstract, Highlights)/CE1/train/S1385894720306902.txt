 This work describes a new application of a composite of ZnO and polypyrrole in the partial photocatalytic oxidation of 5 hydroxymetilfurfural to 2 5 furandicarboxylic acid using air as an oxygen source under visible light illumination . The composite of ZnO PPy was synthesized by polymerization method and characterized by Raman spectroscopy cyclic voltammetry and Tafel curves . The electrochemical characterization of ZnO PPy shows this composite is active under visible light due to the presence of a higher value of exchange current density

@highlight Partial oxidation of HMF under visible light irradiation to biorefinery products.
@highlight Basic Ph favors the cleavage of CH bonds in the CHO groups throughout oxidation of 5 HMF.
@highlight Kinetic modeling and activation energies analysis were undertaken.
@highlight Relationship between interchange of current density of ZnO PPy composite and its catalytic activity.
