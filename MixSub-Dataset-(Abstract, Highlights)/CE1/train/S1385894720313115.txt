 Electrospun polypropylene fibrous membrane was selected as a substrate to graft ionic liquids and avoid tedious ILs separation and recovery . A catalytic membrane BILs g PPF was prepared by long distance and dynamic low temperature Ar plasma flow activation and subsequent grafting with dual SO

@highlight A novel multistage membrane series reactor was developed to catalyze esterification.
@highlight ILs was grafted into porous PP fiber membrane to prepare catalytic membrane.
@highlight Green low temperature Ar plasma activation and grafting strategies were carried out.
@highlight The catalytic membrane reactor showed high catalytic activity for esterification.
@highlight The proposed kinetic model can predict the esterification reaction well.
