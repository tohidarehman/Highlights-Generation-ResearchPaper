 Considering the global production of banana a large amount of banana peel waste is being generated world widely . Thus pyrolysis of BP was investigated to develop a technically reliable platform for the simultaneous waste management and energy recovery . To synergistically increase the sustainability of BP pyrolysis this study adopted carbon dioxide CO

@highlight Valorization of banana peel to energy as a form of syngas was achieved by pyrolysis.
@highlight Banana peel pyrolysis in CO
@highlight produced more than 20 times of CO comparing to N
@highlight CO
@highlight  cofeed pyrolysis manipulated biocrude composition and biochar morphology.
@highlight CO
@highlight was changed into fuel via a sustainable thermolytic platform of food waste.
