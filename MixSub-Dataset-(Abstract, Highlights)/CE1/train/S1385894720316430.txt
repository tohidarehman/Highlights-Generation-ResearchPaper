 Heterobimetallic zeolites have been considered as highly efficient catalysts to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions but economic and sustainable preparation methods have been lacking . This paper presents an economic and sustainable one pot synthesis strategy to prepare the heterobimetallic FeCu SSZ 13 zeolite with high crystallinity via the mesoscale depolymerization reorganization of natural aluminosilicate minerals without the use of any synthetic silicon aluminum and iron containing chemicals . Systematic characterization results reveal that the resultant FeCu SSZ 13M sample has smaller crystallize size larger specific surface area and pore volume lower acid strength and more isolated Cu

@highlight Highly crystalline FeCu SSZ 13 was one pot synthesized from natural minerals.
@highlight Neither silicon aluminum and iron containing chemicals were used.
@highlight The synthesized zeolite has small crystallize size and large specific surface area.
@highlight More iron and copper species are incorporated into the framework of FeCu SSZ 13.
@highlight The resultant FeCu SSZ 13 shows outstanding catalytic performance in NH
@highlight  SCR.
