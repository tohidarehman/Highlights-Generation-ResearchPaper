 Epidermal sensors via self adhesive hydrogels offer great promise for the motion detection health monitoring and disease diagnosis . However the self adhesion of recent hydrogel sensors trends to be inefficient for the wet oily and sweaty skin of human . Besides it is also enormously challengeable to construct a robust adhesion system in both oil and water . Herein a facile approach is presented to fabricate DNA inspired anti freezing tough and wet adhesive hydrogels assisted by nucleobase pairs . The hydrogels simultaneously demonstrate robust adhesion for various substrates and non swelling behavior in the water and oil as well as remarkable mechanical stability and adhesive behavior in a harsh environmental temperature from 20C to 80C . Furthermore a hydrogel epidermal sensor is successfully fabricated and can effectively adhere to the wet skin of human for monitoring various human motions including speaking nodding and various joint bending . The multiple advantageous features would endow DNA inspired hydrogels with considerable potential in promising applications in multiple solvents such as flexible electronic devices battery adhesives soft robots .
