 A novel nanocomposite of sodium montmorillonite with L Histidine was prepared to remove Pb and Cu from aqueous media . The resulting nanocomposites were characterized by XRD FT IR BET SEM TG DTG XPS techniques . All characterizations confirmed the anchoring of L Histidine to Na Mt and the packing sequence of His in the interlayer gallery may form a monolayer structure . The His salt obtained a skewed orientation compared to the silicate surface . The single co adsorption of Cu and Pb by pure and modified i.e . Na Mt and His Mt were carried out by batch adsorption experiments . The maximum adsorption capacity

@highlight Montmorillonite was modified with green and environment friendly Histidine salt.
@highlight His Mt is proved to be a high efficiency adsorbent for removal of heavy metal ions.
@highlight Maximum adsorption capacity for Pb II and Cu II with His Mt is 107.73
