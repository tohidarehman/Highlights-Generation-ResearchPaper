 The structural phases spinel inversion degree metal reduction and performance of Al Ox and Mg Al Ox supported monometallic Co and Ni catalysts prepared by co precipitation method were studied for dry reforming reaction . Catalysts were characterized using ICP MS N

@highlight Different textural bulk properties facilitated different performances.
@highlight Ni Co reducibility from Ni Al Ox and Co Al Ox were different.
@highlight Co Al Ox showed no activity to CO
@highlight reforming while Ni Al Ox did.
@highlight MgO improved the performances of Co Al Ox than Ni Al Ox for DRM.
@highlight Incorporation of Ni Mg increased spinel inversion while Co did not.
