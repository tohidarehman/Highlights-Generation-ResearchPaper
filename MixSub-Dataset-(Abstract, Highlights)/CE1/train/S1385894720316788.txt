 The objective of this study was to investigate the impact that algae have on bacterial treatment of poultry litter slurry anaerobic digestate . We hypothesized that algae could provide benefits to heterotrophic and nitrifying organisms due in part to provision of dissolved oxygen . No other studies to our knowledge have shown that algae provide benefits to nitrifying bacteria in the treatment of anaerobic digestates . Batch cultures of the native digestate community were grown alone or with the addition of activated sludge microorganisms and or the green algae

@highlight Symbiotic growth benefits observed between algae and activated sludge microbes.
@highlight Algae supported nitrifying bacteria which otherwise died out in digestate.
@highlight Algae supported phosphate accumulating bacteria population in digestate.
@highlight Algae promoted organics removal from anaerobic digestate by heterotrophs.
