 The development of effective sorbent materials to remove mercury from real waters is a challenge . Here we report the simple preparation of high performance GOPEI aerogel for Hg remediation by self assembly of high branched polyethyleneimine with elevated molecular weight and graphene oxide under acidic conditions . Our studies revealed that the improved dimensional stability of GOPEI aerogels critical for their use as sorbent materials was obtained for a ratio GO PEI 3 1 . A small amount 10mgL

@highlight An aerogel is obtained from graphene oxide and a high MW branched polyethyleneimine.
@highlight Highly efficient removal of Hg from natural waters tap river and sea .
@highlight GOPEI high efficiency is attributed to persistent negative surface charge.
@highlight The aerogel performance is poorly affected by the existence of co ions and pH.
@highlight The residual concentrations of Hg in water is in accordance with WHO.
