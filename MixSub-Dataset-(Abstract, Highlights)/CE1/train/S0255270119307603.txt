 In the continuous search for the improvement of processes recently alternative schemes have been proposed to separate and purify levulinic acid produced from the acid hydrolysis of biomass . These alternatives offer both energy and economic savings and reduction of environmental impact however their control properties have not been considered for possible industrial implementation . In this work a controllability analysis was carried out of previously optimized designs using the relative gain array the total condition number and a sensitivity index for performance assessment in open loop . Finally the dynamic performance in closed loop is evaluated using PI controllers having as criteria the integral absolute error . Through analysis the best scheme obtained presented a low total condition number however its sensitivity index is below the average of all the designs analyzed . Additionally the RGA analysis shows a stable structure in the frequencies studied keeping low values of eco indicators 99 and total annual cost . The general topology consists of a liquid liquid extraction column a conventional distillation column and a dividing wall column with a decanter . On the other hand by means of this robust analysis of the control properties was proposed some guidelines between the structure for improving control properties in intensified distillation schemes .
