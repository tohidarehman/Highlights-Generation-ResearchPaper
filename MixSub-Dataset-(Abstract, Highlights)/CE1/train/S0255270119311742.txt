 Porous carbons are considered to be promising sorbents for carbon capture and sequestration . As precursors the use of biomass materials has acquiring special interest due to its low cost and high availability . Among all the possibilities to convert low value biomass into these interesting sorbents hydrothermal carbonization has demonstrated several advantages such as lower energy consumption over pyrolysis . In this work activated hydrochars using two phase olive mill waste as precursor have been prepared through physical and chemical activation using CO

@highlight Two phase olive mill waste was used to produced activated hydrochars.
@highlight The physical activated sample resulted to be the most promising option.
@highlight Doping carbons with nitrogen does not appear to enhance their adsorption capacity.
