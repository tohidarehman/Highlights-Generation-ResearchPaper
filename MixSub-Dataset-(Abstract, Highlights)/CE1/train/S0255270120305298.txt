 Various mixtures of surfactants and nanosilica particles were investigated to assess their influence on rising bubble hydrodynamics . For this purpose local velocities of rising bubbles were measured experimentally . Also the effects of concentration of three types of surface modified silica nanoparticles on density viscosity and surface tension of surfactant solutions were determined . Experimental results revealed that the simultaneous presence of nanoparticles and surfactant molecules led to the decrease of local velocities of rising bubbles . The presence of nanoparticles in surfactant solutions leads to a more reduction of bubble local velocity . This could be caused by the formation of surfactant nanoparticle complexes and their adsorption at the gas liquid interface . However the increase of concentration of nanoparticles from 0.02 to 0.04 wt led to an increase in bubble local velocities . That effect may be related to adsorption of surfactants to nanoparticle liquid interfaces i.e . low surface coverage of surfactant may increase local surface tension and lead to increasing the mobility of bubble surface .

@highlight Local velocities of bubbles rising in various mixtures of nanoparticle surfactant were measured experimentally.
@highlight Nanoparticles surfactant mixtures led to the decrease of local velocities of rising bubbles.
@highlight Higher nanoparticle concentration caused the opposite trend increasing bubble velocity.
@highlight It may be the result of adsorption of surfactants to nanoparticle liquid interfaces i.e. low surface coverage of surfactant.
