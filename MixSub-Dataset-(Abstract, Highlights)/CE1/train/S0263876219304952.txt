 In this study the effects of contact force modeling parameters which included the particleparticle friction coefficient spring constant ratio of the tangential spring constant to normal spring constant normal restitution coefficient and tangential restitution coefficient presenting in the linear spring dashpot contact model on the hydrodynamics profile of spouted bed reactor were investigated via computational fluid dynamics coupled with discrete element method using Multiphase Flow with Interphase eXchange . First the base case simulation was validated with the experimental data . Next the 2
