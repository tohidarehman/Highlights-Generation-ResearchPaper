 With the exploitation of ultra high temperature deep wells the fluid loss reducer as the core treatment agent of drilling fluid in addition to ensuring the fluid loss performance it needs to have both high temperature and high salt resistance and certain inhibition . Thus N methacrylamide and 1 3 propane sultone were used to synthesize a betaine type zwitterionic functional monomer named DMAPMAS . A zwitterionic copolymer PADAN as a fluid loss reducer for drilling fluids was prepared by attaching 2 acrylamide 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid N vinylpyrrolidone and synthetic DMAPMAS to the main chain of acrylamide via aqueous solution free radical polymerization . It not only has great thermal but has good fluid loss and inhibition performance . In addition the addition of PADAN can effectively improve the particle size distribution of the drilling fluid system . The combination of PADAN and sulfonated polymer SMC SMP II and SPNH has the effect of reducing the fluid loss of drilling fluid . Moreover it has good adaptability to a variety of drilling fluid systems . Applied to the sulfonation drilling fluid system and the polysulfide KCl drilling fluid system it has the significant effect in fluid loss reduction and less impact on the rheological properties to adapt to various drilling fluid systems .

@highlight Synthetic copolymer has strong resistance to temperature and salt.
@highlight The suppression performance in high temperature and high salinity environment is better than average.
@highlight The product can make the particle size distribution of the drilling fluid in a reasonable state.
@highlight It have great compatibility.
