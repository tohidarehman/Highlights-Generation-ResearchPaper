 Aqueous phase reforming of four polyols was studied over a bimetallic Pt Pd catalyst supported on mesoporous carbon in the temperature range between 200C and 225C . Addition of formic acid was studied for a potential industrial application which involves upstream reactive extraction of hemicelluloses .

@highlight Aqueous phase reforming of polyols over mesoporous carbon supported bimetallic Pt Pd catalyst.
@highlight Detailed identification of gas and liquid products.
@highlight Improvement of hydrogen production by adding formic acid.
@highlight Similar selectivity to alkanes for most of polyols with mainly methane.
@highlight Presence of significant amounts of methanol and propane diols in the liquid phase.
