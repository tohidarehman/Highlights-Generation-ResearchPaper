 A simple and regulatable strategy was proposed to synthesis hierarchical porous carbon from heavy residue of waste tire derived pyrolytic oil . Magnesium acetate powder was adopted as a pore creator and adjustor which was mixed with heavy residue and tetrahydrofuran by grinding . Subsequently the various pore structure carbons were obtained after evaporation carbonization and MgO removal . The change in pore size was significantly observed with the magnesium acetate dosage . In this method the addition of magnesium acetate could result in higher carbon yield . Remarkably the carbon prepared at optimum condition exhibited higher specific surface area and micro mesopore structure leading to an excellent performance towards dye contaminant removal . The prepared porous carbon sample exhibited best adsorption capacity at 298K for methylene blue . Furthermore the effect of pH and temperature on adsorption capacity of prepared porous carbon were also investigated . The adsorption process of MB onto porous carbon was favorable according to the Freundlich model parameter 1

@highlight The heavy residue can be used as a novel precursor for preparing porous carbon 
@highlight The pore structure can be adjusted by magnesium acetate dosage.
@highlight The carbon prepared showed maximum methylene blue adsorption capacity of 843.5mg g at 298K.
