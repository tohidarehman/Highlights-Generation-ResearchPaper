 The interfacial property of cathode materials in Li ion batteries plays a vital role for the mass transport in electrochemical process . In this paper Li

@highlight Li
@highlight RuO
@highlight is first reported as coating material for LLOs.
@highlight LRO layer could form electronic ionic highways on the surface of cathode material.
@highlight The interfacial stability and conductivity of cathode material were enhanced.
@highlight The electrochemical performance was greatly improved after incorporation of LRO.
