 In this work the design that integrated vapor recompression heat pump into reactive divided wall column is proposed for the synthesis of isobutyl acetate . Due to the large differential temperature between the overhead vapor stream and bottom stream in the reactive distillation column five different RDWC HP processes are designed in which the compressed stream provides heat in the single side reboiler or double side reboiler or interreboiler . The total annual cost energy consumption and CO

@highlight A reactive divided wall column combining heat pump is proposed for IBOAC synthesis.
@highlight Five RDWC HP schemes are explored for the large differential temperature system.
@highlight TAC of the proposed RDWC HP RD SC is reduced by 21.11 compared to the RDWC process.
@highlight CO
@highlight emission of the proposed RDWC HP RD SC is reduced by 87.05 compared to the RDWC.
@highlight TUC of the proposed RDWC HP RD SC is reduced by 26.26 compared to the RDWC process.
