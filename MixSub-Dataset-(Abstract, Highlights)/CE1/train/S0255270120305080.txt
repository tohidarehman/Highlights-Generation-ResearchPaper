 The presence of recalcitrant organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals personal care products hormones and antibiotics in the aquatic environment is a growing concern as they are resistant to conventional treatment processes . Many of these compounds are categorized as contaminants of emerging concerns . Ozonation process is highly effective but it is usually restricted by the poor mass transfer rate of ozone into the water . Hybrid ozonation ultrasonication system has been emerging as an efficient method for the rapid removal of these stable compounds due to the synergy between the two effects . The process is technically simple more effective and achieves fast degradation with no addition of chemicals is necessary . Mature understanding on the hybrid system is however yet to be established . In this manuscript a detailed review is conducted on the fundamental issues regarding ozonation ultrasound US O
