 Bimetallic iron and copper oxide nanoparticles supported on hydroxylated diamond exhibits an improved activity for the heterogeneous Fenton phenol degradation under natural or simulated sunlight irradiation with respect to analogous monometallic samples or than analogous FeCu NPs on graphite activated carbon and P25 TiO

@highlight Bimetallic iron copper oxide nanoparticles supported on nanodiamonds have been prepared.
@highlight The catalyst shows superior activity compared with analogous carbon or TiO2 catalysts.
@highlight The catalyst shows good recyclability and stability specially working at pH 6.
@highlight Turn over numbers of 105 000 have been reached for experiments at pH 6.
@highlight The catalyst decomposes H
@highlight to hydroxyl radicals
