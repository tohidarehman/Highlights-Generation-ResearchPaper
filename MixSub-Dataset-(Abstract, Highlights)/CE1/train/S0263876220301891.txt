 Experimental data is required to estimate unknown parameters for a mathematical model describing thin film growth and to optimize the chemical vapor deposition process . The most informative experimental data can be obtained by sequential model based design of experiments but this requires significant effort to implement compared to factorial design of experiments . For CVD processes it is not clear which approach is better or more efficient . Here we compare the effectiveness of sequential A optimal with a factorial using a case study involving a mechanistic model of thin film deposition . The sequential A optimal MBDoE and factorial DoE are compared based on their effectiveness in obtaining accurate parameter estimates and model predictions . Synthetic experimental data is generated from simulations with the true parameters plus noise . The results suggest that the A optimal MBDoE is slightly better than factorial DoE for estimating model parameters . The parameter estimates from each experimental design approach are used to solve a model based optimization problem . The results indicate that model based optimization from the model with parameter estimates obtained by the A optimal design gives a significantly better estimate of the optimal process conditions than factorial DoE .
