 Supercapacitors are promising energy storage devices with high power density and long cycle life while the key challenge in the application is the fabrication of electrode materials with high surface area good conductivity and high stability . Heterostructures consisting of binary chemical compositions could achieve superior electrochemical performances by creating abundant heterointerfaces with more reaction active sites which could enhance the surface reaction kinetics and improve the conductivity . Meanwhile hollow microspheres with complex internal architecture have been widely studied in advanced energy storage devices due to their high specific surface area fast transportation of the electrolyte and prominent structural stability . Herein we propose a feasible synthetic method of heterogeneous Mn
