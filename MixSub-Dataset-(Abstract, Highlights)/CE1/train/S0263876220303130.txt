 Microfluidics is recognized as a powerful tool to perform series of experiments with high efficiency and low reagent consumption . Micromixers are known to be a very important part of the integrated microfluidic systems . The present work investigates the mixing enhancement of microfluids using a micromixer through a passive method . New type of baffles based on topology optimization are presented to augment the advection part of the mixing . Numerical simulation is carried out using Comsol Multiphysics software . The results are verified using experimental findings collected from a manufactured sample of the designed micromixer . The demonstrated geometry causes the entire mixing to take place at a short time and the length of a microchannel . The mixing quality was declined by increasing Reynolds number from Re 0.25 . In addition the mixing mechanism in this range is a pure diffusion . Consequently an increase of the Reynolds number results in lower residence time and mixing index . By increasing the Reynolds number the mixing index can be improved . The formation of vortexes behind the designed baffles is the main proof for the enhanced mixing .
