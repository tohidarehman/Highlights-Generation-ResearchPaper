 The use of microreactors in catalytic processes offers new possibilities for studying and optimizing many mass and photon transfer limited reactions . In this study we propose a scalable computational fluid dynamics model for the prediction of photocatalytic degradation of a model pollutant using immobilized N doped TiO

@highlight Photocatalytic degradation of 4 nitrophenol in microreactor under solar irradiation.
