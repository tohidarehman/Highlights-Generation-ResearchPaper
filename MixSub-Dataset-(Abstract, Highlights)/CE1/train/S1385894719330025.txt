 In the present study graphene oxide intercalated layered double hydroxide based adsorbent was synthesized for effective and selective adsorption of lead . Graphene oxide was intercalated in a controlled manner in the interlayer space of magnesium aluminium layered double hydroxide which enhanced the adsorption capacity by 20 compared to pristine LDH . Effect of metal ion ratio on GO intercalation was observed . The developed nano powder was immobilized in polyacrylonitrile beads by a single step mussel inspired phase inversion in dopamine solution . Elongated macro voids accelerated the lead adsorption kinetics remarkably . Phase inversion in dopamine eliminated the leaching of the nanoparticles from beads . The GO intercalated LDH and the nanoparticles immobilized beads showed lead adsorption capacity of 1062mg g and 209mg g respectively at 323K and pH 5.8 . Adsorption isotherm showed the best fitting with Langmuir model and kinetics followed a pseudo second order rate equation . Lead adsorption was not affected significantly by the presence of other cations like Ca
