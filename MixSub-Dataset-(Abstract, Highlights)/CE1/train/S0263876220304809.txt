 Statins are a group of drugs used for lowering cholesterol levels in the human bloodstream to prevent cardiovascular diseases and its synthesis is a challenge because of chemical and stereochemical requirements . In this work a multi enzyme one pot sequential strategy was employed to obtain lactonized statin side chain precursor and was compared to the two pot process . The enzymatic production of this valuable product is rarely examined comparing to the traditional chemical methods . The examined cascade consisted of two consecutive reactions lactol production by the 2 deoxyribose 5 phosphate aldolase catalysed double aldol addition of acetaldehyde and chloroacetaldehyde and its oxidation by the NAD dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase . NADH oxidase was employed for the coenzyme regeneration . The insight in all reactions of the system was performed by enzyme kinetic and stability studies . Based on these data the mathematical models were developed and validated in a batch reactor . The oxidation was carried out using both purified and crude lactol obtained in the DERA catalysed reaction . Better process metrics and greater stability of the AlDH was observed in one pot system thus demonstrating an additional benefit in favor of running multi enzymatic processes .
