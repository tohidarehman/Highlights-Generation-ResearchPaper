 Recently the researches about graphene materials as efficient adsorbents have been promoted from two dimension to three dimension . Compared with 2D graphene materials 3D graphene based macrostructures not only preserve the original properties of constituent monomers but also possess new collective physiochemical properties making them more attractive as versatile adsorbents in sample preparation . In this review we will innovatively summarize the recently published various kinds of 3D graphene based adsorbents from the angles of material type . Furthermore we will discuss their applications for removing of various water pollutants . At last the challenges and future outlook of 3D graphene based adsorbents will also be discussed .
