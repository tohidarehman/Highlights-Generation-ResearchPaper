 Sepsis and implant related bacterial infections are mainly caused by Gram positive bacteria accompanied with the notorious drug resistance and biofilms formation . Although the recently concerned photothermal therapy shows good performance in killing of planktonic bacteria and removal of biofilms the issue of potential thermal damage to normal tissue is urgent to be solved due to the non targeting to bacteria . Here we constructed a chiral glutamic acid functionalized gold nanobipyramids for enhanced PTT against bacterial and biofilms infections based on both chemical and physical interactions with bacteria . Specifically the conjugation of
