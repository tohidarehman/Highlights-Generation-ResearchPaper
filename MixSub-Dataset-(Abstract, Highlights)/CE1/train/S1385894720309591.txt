 Reversible modulated upconversion luminescence exhibits an application potential as the photo switch fingerprint acquisition anti counterfeiting and optical storage devices . It is found that the photochromism and thermochromism could be applied to modify the upconversion luminescence . However the electrochromism induced reversible upconversion luminescence modulation was not reported . Here the WO
