 In the present study a phosphorylated polyacrylonitrile fiber adsorbent was rapidly prepared with microwave assisted method and further applied to capture U ions from aqueous solution . FTIR and SEM EDS characterizations confirmed the satisfactory grafting of phosphonic group on the surface of PAN fiber and the integrities of fiber were well preserved . The results indicated that MW assisted method exhibited much higher efficiency during the modification process in terms of shorter reaction time and higher phosphonic content as compared to conventional heating method . The physical property of the modified fiber was well maintained according to TGA DTA results . The kinetic and isothermal adsorption experiments confirmed that the uptake process of PAN
