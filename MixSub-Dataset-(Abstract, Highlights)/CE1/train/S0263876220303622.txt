 Magnetic Fe Cu materials were prepared by the sol gel method and characterized by X ray Diffraction BrunauerEmmettTeller Scanning Electron Microscopy equipped with Energy Dispersive X ray spectroscopy and Vibrating Sample Magnetometer . These materials were applied for the removal of pyridine under the ultraviolet irradiation in the Fenton like system . The influences of different parameters such as the molar ratio of Fe and Cu catalyst dosages H

@highlight The catalyst M 40 has magnetic properties and can be reused.
@highlight Range of pH action of the Fenton like system can be broadened by used the M 40 .
@highlight The removal efficiency of pyridine was more than 99 within 30
@highlight None
@highlight min.
@highlight Removal mechanism includes catalytic oxidation direct oxidation and adsorption.
