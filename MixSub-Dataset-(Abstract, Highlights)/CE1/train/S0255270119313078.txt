 Dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid is one of the significant anionic surfactants that can be used as a cleaning agent in the daily chemical industry or chemical oil displacing agents in tertiary oil recovery . The sulfonation of dodecylbenzene is the predominant route to fabricate DBSA . In this paper we introduce a continuous process and a cyclic process in

@highlight Liquid SO
@highlight is used to synthesize Dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid DBSA in microreaction systems.
@highlight Continuous process and cyclic process are developed to optimize the routine of dodecylbenzene DDB sulfonation.
@highlight The residence time of the reactants in the continuous reactor can be as low as 2.5s.
@highlight The microreactor can effectively control the reaction temperature and reduce the generation of by products.
@highlight The Ratio of SO
@highlight to DDB decreases to 1.03 1 thereby reducing the pressure of spent acid treatment.
