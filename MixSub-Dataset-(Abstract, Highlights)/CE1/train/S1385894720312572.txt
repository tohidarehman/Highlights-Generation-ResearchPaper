 High latent heat no leakage and recyclable are the comprehensive properties of phase change materials . In this study which was inspired by the structures of orange and pomegranate a facile strategy via a self template method was adopted to prepare form stable phase change materials for the first time . Utilising poly spherulite crystals as templates the cross linked polymer was prepared as a supporting material by in situ polyaddition . The bionic vesicle structure microstructures were investigated by parallel optical stereo microscope and scanning electron microscope . The results suggest that a vesicle like structure is formed in the prepared PEG CPA FSPCMs . Compared with the FSPCMs prepared by interpenetrating cross linked network method the FSPCMs prepared by self template method has higher PEG loading value . Especially when PEG 20K with a larger spherulite diameter was used as a template to prepare PEG 20K CPA FSPCMs the loading value was as high as 900 . Moreover in a process attributed to the regeneration of various types of hydrogen bonds ionic bonds and transesterification the recyclable CPA enables the PEG 20K CPA FSPCMs to possess good thermally reversible reusability .
