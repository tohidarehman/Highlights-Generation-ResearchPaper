 The aim of the present study is to optimize the process factors in the degradation and separation of amoxicillin by simultaneous combination of Fenton and nanofiltration processes as well as to investigate the fouling of membrane samples . For this purpose the Fenton Fe based catalysts i.e . goethite and maleate ferroxane are incorporated in the structure of polyacrylonitrile film . A Central Composite Design in response surface methodology was used to optimize AMX separation and degradation . The amounts of H
