 Earth abundant and environmental friendly ceria with excellent redox ability rich surface oxygen vacancies and high oxygen storage capacity was wildly used as catalysts for NH

@highlight CeO
@highlight  HAT owns enhanced oxygen vacancies and Brnsted acidity due to defect riched nano ceria and Al OH riched HAT.
@highlight CeO
@highlight  HAT inhibits NH
@highlight over oxidation via an occupation release of oxygen vacancies v
@highlight  and hydroxyls OH .
@highlight Both Eley Rideal and Langmuir Hinshelwood mechanisms exist in the NH
@highlight  SCR reaction over CeO
@highlight  HAT.
@highlight CeO
@highlight  HAT has renewable activity after SO
@highlight  H
@highlight O treatment as Brnsted acidity increasing via CeO
@highlight sulfuration.
