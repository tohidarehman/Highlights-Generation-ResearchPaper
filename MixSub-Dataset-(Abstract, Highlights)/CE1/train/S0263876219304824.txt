 Simulations of two phase flow in a pipe are among the widely discussed topics however with the increased understanding of multiphase flow in pipes the application of computational fluid dynamics in other complex flow geometries involved in oilfield operations is becoming more common . This study is aimed to investigate and better understand two phase flow characteristics in the annulus using computational fluid dynamics and experimental approaches . The experimental study included two sets of five tests with increasing superficial gas velocity 9.247.2
