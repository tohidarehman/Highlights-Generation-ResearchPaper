 CO is a main component of syngas produced by the thermal gasification of biomass . The biological conversion of sole CO into medium chain carboxylates has attracted considerable attention although the process has a low efficiency . The present study demonstrated a process to achieve efficient MCCs production from short chain carboxylates namely acetate and n butyrate with CO as electron donor . Results demonstrated that n butyrate as an electron acceptor was superior to acetate and the control . The highest n caproate concentration was obtained in reactor 160B while it can reach only 2.7 and 0mM in reactors 80A and C respectively . The lag phase for n caproate production with n butyrate as electron acceptor was significantly lower than that with acetate or control . The microbial community composition of chain elongation bioreactors showed that

@highlight N butyrate was more suitable for MCCs production than acetate with CO as electron donor.
@highlight The highest n caproate concentration was obtained at 160mM n butyrate.
@highlight was responsible for performing chain elongation.
@highlight A thermodynamic model showed the superiority of n caproate production from n butyrate.
