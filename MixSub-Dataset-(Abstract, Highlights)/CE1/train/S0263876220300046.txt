 Solubility is as a key chemical and physical property . Solubility prediction methods are applied in diverse fields including preparation synthesis and modifications of materials . To overcome the shortcomings of existing solubility prediction methods taking the mass transfer of two phase system as an example a solubility prediction model based on the diffusion theory and hybrid artificial intelligence method was proposed in this paper . An improved double population chaotic accelerated particle swarm optimization algorithm combined diffusion theory was developed according to the particle evolution utilizing diffusion energy . The developed algorithm was applied in the training of parameters of the radial basis function artificial neural network and then a model for predicting solubility was developed . The experimental results of supercritical carbon dioxide solubility in 8 polymers were consistent with the predicted values by the model indicating the high prediction accuracy . The average relative deviation squared correlation coefficient and root mean square error were respectively 0.0036 0.9970 and 0.0152 displaying its higher comprehensive performance . The model may also be applied in other physicochemical fields .
