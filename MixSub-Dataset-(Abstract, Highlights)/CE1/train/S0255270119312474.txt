 The objective of this work is to optimize an efficient green technique for the extraction of phenolics from grape pomace . Two extraction techniques ultrasound and microwave assisted extraction have been used . In ultrasound extraction temperature solvent type amplitude and solvent solid ratio were the factors investigated . In the case of microwave extraction the effects of solvent type solvent solid ratio and power were studied . In addition the effect of pomace moisture content was studied under the optimum conditions . Another objective was to study the enhancement of the optimum procedure by enzymatic pretreatment using two enzymes cellulase and pectinase under different conditions . The optimum extraction yield was achieved using ultrasound extraction at 56C a solvent solid ratio of 8mL g an amplitude of 34 and a time of 20min with 53 v v ethanol after pretreatment with cellulase at a concentration of 4 w w time of 240min and water pomace ratio of 2mL g. Furthermore in order to obtain phenolics in a purified form adsorption was carried out with zeolite .
