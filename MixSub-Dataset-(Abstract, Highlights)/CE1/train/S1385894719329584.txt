 Biocompatible stimuli responsive intelligent and efficient drug delivery systems are essential for effectively suppressing cancer and reducing toxic side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs . Herein two strategies have been employed to develop a

@highlight Two functional polymer DOX bioconjugates based nano aggregates NAs were prepared.
@highlight NAs displayed pH and enzyme responsive features and had excellent biocompatibility.
@highlight NAs entered into 4T1 cells through multiple endocytosis pathways.
@highlight NAs induced apoptosis by disrupting mitochondria function and actin cytoskeletons.
@highlight PEGylation for NA improved anti tumor efficacy on 4T1 tumor bearing mice.
