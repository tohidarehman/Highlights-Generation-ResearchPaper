 The free deoxyribonucleic acid cassette harboring antibiotic resistance gene in drinking water has been linked with impaired public health . To prevent the problem of antibiotic resistance we have synthesized a CeO

@highlight CeO
@highlight was synthesized from the self combustion propagation protocol.
@highlight CeO
@highlight is a promising adsorbent for the removal of DNA harboring ARGs from tap water.
@highlight Free DNA solution showed a high buffering effect during adsorption reaction.
@highlight Initial free DNA concentration and pH greatly influenced the reaction.
@highlight Phosphate and nitrate were unbeneficial during the adsorption process.
@highlight Adsorption mechanism is governed by electrostatic force of attraction.
