 Three novel persulfate activators Fe based metal organic frameworks were synthesized for the degradation of sulfamethoxazole . The degradation experiment results showed that all the FeMOFs could effectively activate persulfate and degrade more than 97 SMX within 180min with higher than 77 persulfate decomposition efficiencies . It was found by Mssbauer spectra that the variation of organic ligands for synthesis have an influence on the content of Fe of these MOFs thus resulted in the order of activation capacities Fe Fe Fe . It was demonstrated that the activation of persulfate was mainly ascribed to the heterogeneous process that accomplished by surface bounded Fe acted as the main active site to provided electrons for persulfate or dissolved oxygen . EPR and molecular probe studies confirmed the coexistence of SO

@highlight Fe II MOFs are synthesized via hydrothermal self assembled coordination.
@highlight Fe II MOFs exhibit diverse active sites and electron donating properties.
@highlight Fe II acts as an effective electron donor for both persulfate and dioxygen.
@highlight Direct electron transfer to SMX molecule by the attack of SO
@highlight was proposed.
