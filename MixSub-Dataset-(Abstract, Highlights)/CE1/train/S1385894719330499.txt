 Removing gaseous formaldehyde using photocatalyst oxidation is of great interest . Herein a photocatalytic fuel cell with a rotating photoanode was proposed for gaseous HCHO degradation with the features of efficient absorption fast oxidation and humidity less sensitivity . The results indicated that the as fabricated rotating PFC system can facilitate the absorption of gaseous HCHO in the thin liquid film formed on the upper anode surface and have an efficient separation of the photoinduced electron hole pairs on the TiO

@highlight A rotating PFC system with high capacity for gaseous HCHO adsorption was proposed.
@highlight The rotating PFC system displayed an excellent gaseous HCHO degradation capacity.
@highlight The system exhibited less sensitive on ambient humidity.
@highlight Degradation of gaseous HCHO was concurrently achieved with energy recovery.
@highlight A liquid film air purifier was designed and a good performance was obtained.
