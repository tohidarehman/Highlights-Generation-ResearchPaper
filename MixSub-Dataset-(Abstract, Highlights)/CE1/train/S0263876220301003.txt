 To clear the swirling flow pneumatic conveying performance for blocky fuel particles particularly for lump coal particles a side inlet guide vane swirling generator was developed and employed to study the efficiency and stability of lump coal particles in swirling flow pneumatic conveying . In total 32 pilot scale tests for different conditions including different airflow rates solid mass flow rates and swirling intensities were conducted in this paper . The efficiency and stability of lump coal particles in swirling flow pneumatic conveying are thoroughly discussed by considering the static pressure loss and pressure fluctuation standard deviation . The pressure characteristics for different conveying stages and frequency spectrum constituents of the static pressure are also discussed . The results show that the swirling flow has better energy preservation characteristics and conveying performance in proper conditions . Four main factors contribute to the static pressure fluctuation in three different frequency bands . The results also show that a low mean gas velocity with a medium swirling intensity and a high mean gas velocity with a weak swirling intensity can improve the conveying stability . The swirling flow is more stable at the front of the pipeline meanwhile the axial flow is better in the second half .
