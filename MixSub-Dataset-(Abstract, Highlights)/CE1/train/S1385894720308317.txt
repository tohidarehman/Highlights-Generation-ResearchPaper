 The lack of carbon source in the denitrification process with low C N wastewater is the main factor limiting the denitrification efficiency in constructed wetlands . However the traditional method of adding liquid carbon source is often costly and facing the risk of secondary pollution . This study attempted to solve this problem by adding woodchips sustained release carbon sources as part of the substrate together with the dewatered alum sludge as the main wetland substrate to the baffle subsurface flow constructed wetland . The effects of woodchips on denitrification capacity effluent COD and nitrogen transfer and transformation were studied . Results showed that the removal rates of ammonia nitrogen NH

@highlight Woodchips substrates supplement the carbon source for denitrification.
@highlight The COD release rate and sustainability of woodchips are variable.
@highlight Woodchips reduced the ORP of CW enhancing the denitrification of annamox.
@highlight The combined substrates realized the simultaneous denitrification and dephosphorization.
