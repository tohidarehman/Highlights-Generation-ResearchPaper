 How to design and synthesize interfacial engineered materials that have efficient surface passivation and electron extraction properties is an important problem in the field of optoelectronic materials . Herein a simple naphthalene imide dimer namely 2FBT2NDI is developed by Stille coupling reaction with a high yield and it is used as interface engineering material for inverted perovskite solar cells . Owing to the existence of intermolecular interactions between MAPbI

@highlight A naphthalene imide dimer was developed and used as an interfacial material.
@highlight 2FBT2NDI layer achieves efficient surface passivation and electron extraction.
@highlight The modified PSCs show superior photovoltaic performance 20.1 .
@highlight 2FBT2NDI could be used to obtain commercializable high performance PSCs.
