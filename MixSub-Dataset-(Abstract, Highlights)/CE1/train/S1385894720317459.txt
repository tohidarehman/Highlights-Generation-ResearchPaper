 Diabetics face multiple long term health complications and diabetic foot ulcers affect approximately 1520 of the diabetic population . The high disability rate of these patients results in substantial mental burden and economic pressure to the individuals as well as the societies . Here we report a therapeutic integrin binding pro survival peptide engineered silk fibroin nanosheet that can regulate angiogenesis and promote diabetic ulcer healing . The nanosheet with thickness less than 100nm is highly transparent and flexible and it can firmly adhere to the biological tissue surfaces in underwater environment . The presence of integrin binding pro survival peptide in the nanosheet significantly upregulates the expression of angiogenesis genes and proteins of human umbilical vein endothelial cells . In the diabetic mouse model the peptide engineered nanosheet reveals significant acceleration of wound closure epithelialization and granulation tissue formation . These findings suggest that this functional nanosheet could be a promising therapeutic candidate for complicated diabetic ulcer healing .
