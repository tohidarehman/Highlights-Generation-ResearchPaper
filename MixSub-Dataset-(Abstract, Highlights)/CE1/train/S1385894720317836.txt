 Reprocessing of waste plastic has been extensively studied . Herein a facile and efficient method for solving the plastic recycling crisis was developed using micro wave assisted hydrolysis of poly into terephthalic acid . Previously developed acid or base catalysts are soluble in reaction media and difficult to separate after the reaction . ZSM 5 based zeolites which are simply recoverable and facilely re generable catalysts with Brnsted and Lewis acidic sites were used herein as an acidic catalyst for the PET hydrolysis reaction . Controlling the Brnsted and Lewis acidic site concentration in the ZSM 5 zeolite by changing the Si Al ratio of the zeolite framework and counter ion species was applied . The reaction kinetics and activation energy of the PET hydrolysis reaction in the presence of the developed catalyst were studied and compared with catalyst free conditions . Based on this investigation the correlation between Brnsted and Lewis acidic sites in ZSM 5 based catalysts and PET depolymerization yield was identified .
