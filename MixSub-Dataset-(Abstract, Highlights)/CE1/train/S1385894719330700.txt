 The challenges for preparing metal single atoms catalysts are facile synthesis approaches and the suitable supports with strong coordination to stabilize MSAs . Herein we reported a facile strategy to synthesize the Ru single atoms through the dynamic transformation from clusters to single atoms by combining the electrospun technology and NH

@highlight Ru SAs were
@highlight synthesized by the dynamic transformation from clusters.
@highlight The formation of RuNC bonds plays an important role for anchoring the Ru SAs.
@highlight The transformation can be controlled by the treatment time and temperatures.
@highlight Ru SAs exhibit superior HER activity with overpotential of 34mV 20mAcm
