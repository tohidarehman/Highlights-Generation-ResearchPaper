 For the preparation of high performance thermoset based electromagnetic interference shielding materials at low filler loading a simple and practical method is still absent . Herein the Epoxy Polyether sulfone Multi walled Carbon Nanotubes composites were prepared by ultrasonic treatment and dichloromethane assisted dispersion . The selective localization of MWCNTs in EP phase prevented the interruption of phase continuity due to the increase of interfacial tension in the early stage of reaction induced phase separation resulting in co continuous structure in the cured EP PES blends . Therefore reliable mechanical properties and satisfactory EMI shielding performance can be obtained at low MWCNT loading . The EP PES

@highlight Co continuous conductive network in epoxy composites was in situ constructed.
@highlight The co continuous morphology was obtained in an unbalanced component ratio.
@highlight Satisfactory mechanical properties and EMI shielding performance were obtained.
