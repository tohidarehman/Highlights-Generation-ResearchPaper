 Shell side falling film flow is extremely important for the heat transfer performance of spiral wound heat exchangers used in liquefied process of natural gas . In this paper 3 D simulations using hydrocarbon as the testing fluid are conducted to study the fluid flow characteristic of heat exchanger with curved egg shaped tube . The effects of different

@highlight 3 D simulations of falling film flow around curved egg shaped tubes are conducted.
@highlight The influence of
@highlight and inter tube spacing on falling film flow are examined.
@highlight The average film thickness firstly increases and then decreases as the increase of
@highlight Film thickness of basin zone is thinner than the prediction results of circular tube.
