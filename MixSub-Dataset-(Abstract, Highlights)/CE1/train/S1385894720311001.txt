 Environmentally friendly organic adsorbents with strong stability magnetic property and great adsorption capacity for heavy metals have obtained great attention recently . We developed the citric acid and Fe

@highlight The MSB had the adsorption capacities of 33mgg
@highlight for Cd and 117mgg
@highlight for Pb.
@highlight The adsorption of Cd and Pb by MSB was attributed to increased carboxyl and Fe3O4.
@highlight The presence of Pb decreased the removal rate of Cd by 5.123.1 by MSB.
@highlight Calcium and Mg decreased the removal rates of Cd by 8.415.3 and Pb by 3.76.8 .
@highlight The MSB can be used for Cd and Pb removal in aqueous systems for at least 3 cycles.
