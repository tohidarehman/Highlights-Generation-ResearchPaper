 Dehydrofluorination is the major process for the production of fluorinated monomers and treatment of synthetic greenhouse gases . It is usually catalyzed by the Lewis acids such as AlF

@highlight AlF
@highlight particles are confined in quasi MOF structures MIL 101 with NH
@highlight AlF
@highlight as the precursor.
@highlight AlF
@highlight is stabilized by the confinement and interaction with CUS of Cr in quasi MOF.
@highlight Large amounts of 4 fold coordinated Al in AlF
@highlight are achieved due to the interaction.
@highlight Reaction rate of confined AlF
@highlight is about 9 times higher than that of supported AlF
@highlight It provides a potential strategy for preparation of metal fluoride Lewis acid catalysts.
