 The production of hydrogen from the photoreforming of methanol was essayed using an anatase based system having Pt nanoparticles and a Zr doped anatase high surface area support . The production of hydrogen was quantitatively analyzed using the quantum efficiency parameter under UV and visible illumination conditions . The study showed that a 2.5mol . of Zr renders an outstanding material for the fruitful use of sunlight as a green source of energy of the process . The outstanding promotion of activity orginated by Zr doping of the anatase structure was studied using in situ infrared photoluminescence and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies . The multitechnique spectroscopic investigation of the reaction mechanism demonstrates that this occurs through a complex reforming plus water gas shift path . The study also unveils that optoelectronic properties of the solids derived from Zr incorporation drive activity of the system by controlling light absorption and mainly charge carrier recombination and interaction with the reactant molecules .
