 A novel multifunctional material of MOF derived porous carbon coated lanthanum oxide had been successfully synthesized by hydrothermal calcination method which used in the simultaneous removal of butylparaben and As . For the single contaminant system the degradation rate of BPB could reach 98 and retain a high removal efficiency in a wide pH range of 39 which covered the most wastewater . In contrast the removal rate of As reached 90 in the pH of 3 and still 70 of the As can be removed in the pH of 9 . For the BPB As binary system the presence of As had no obvious impact on the degradation rate of BPB . However the removal rate of As was suppressed at the presence of BPB because of the competitive reaction of radicals between BPB and As . O

@highlight A multifunctional material of La MOF 900 had been synthesized via calcining La MOF.
@highlight La MOF 900 can remove BPB and As III by combining AOPs and adsorption.
@highlight La MOF 900 exhibited a high removal rate of BPB and As III from pH 3 to 9.
