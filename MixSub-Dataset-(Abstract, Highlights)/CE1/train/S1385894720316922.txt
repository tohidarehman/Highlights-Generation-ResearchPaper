 Amorphous metal boron alloys have attracted extensive interest in catalytic reactions because a large number of randomly oriented bonds constitute a glass like structure with abundant defects and unsaturated surface atoms which are catalytically active . However the synthesis of non precious amorphous metal boron with a multilevel structure remains a challenging task . Here ultra long mesoporous cobalt boron amorphous alloy nanochains are firstly synthesized by using the soft templating approach with the assistance of a magnetic field . Owing to the high surface area and the unique behavior of Co within the Co B alloy mesoporous CoB nanochains show superior activity and selectivity in liquid phase cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation in cinnamyl alcohol . This work opens an avenue for the exploration of mesoporous amorphous metal alloys towards liquid phase selective hydrogenation reaction .
