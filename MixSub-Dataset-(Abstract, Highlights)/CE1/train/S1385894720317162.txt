 Advanced electromagnetic wave absorbing materials with low cost lightweight high absorption efficiency and wide absorption frequency are extremely desirable for solving electromagnetic radiation . Herein an excellent microwave absorber composed of NiCo

@highlight 3D NiCo
@highlight  C hybrid composites were successfully constructed for the first time.
@highlight The optimal
@highlight of NiCo
@highlight  C reaches 64.74dB with the maximum EAB of 5.26GHz.
@highlight The enhancement is attributed to the matched impedance and improved loss ability.
@highlight The attenuation mechanism was discussed according to the characterization results.
