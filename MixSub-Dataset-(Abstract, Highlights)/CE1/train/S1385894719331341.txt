 The limited gas production of Al metal oxide based thermites due to lack of gas elements greatly hinders its practical application . By contrast energetic coordination polymers are rich in gas elements from organic ligands and have the potential to rapidly decompose into corresponding metal oxides with a large amount of heat output . In this work a novel high performance energetic material based on Al ECPs is presented . Al ECPs binary energetic composites have enhanced heat release pressure production and combustion performance owing to the contribution of the father ECPs thermal decomposition reaction and the son metal oxides thermite reaction with nano Al .
