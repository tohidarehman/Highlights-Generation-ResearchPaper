 Mercury contamination poses a serious threat to the ecological system and human health . Yet removal of mercury at parts per billion level in surface water is difficult to achieve . This study developed a Mg

@highlight FeS is soldered onto Mg
@highlight Al LDH via concurrent surface complexation and surface adsorption.
@highlight Sigmodial Langmuir isotherm model perfectly simulates sorption isotherm data with a
@highlight of 116.96mg g.
@highlight Mercury is removed through chemical precipitation ion exchange and surface complexation.
@highlight The composite effectively removes Hg at ppb level under typical DO pH and coexisting metals.
@highlight The composite and the immobilized Hg demonstrates long term stabilities over six months.
