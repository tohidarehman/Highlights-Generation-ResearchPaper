 Over the past few decades extensive usage of electronic devices have led to the ubiquitous occurrence of electromagnetic waves which have posed a significant hazard to human health and surrounding environment . Most of the currently developed electromagnetic wave absorption materials present serious drawbacks and it is highly desired to develop effective strategies to address these problems . Herein we fabricated a sea cucumber like hollow structured fibrous composite based on facile chemical polymerization and fast microwave calcination . The formation of multi shell hybrid structure exhibited excellent electromagnetic wave absorption performance . Specifically the composite sample showed a minimum reflection loss R

@highlight A sea cucumber like hollow structured fibrous composite was finally obtained.
@highlight The facile microwave assisted strategy was developed to fabricate the sample.
@highlight It exhibited the optimum absorption with a reflection loss value of 41.4dB.
@highlight This represents an alternative approach to design novel absorption materials.
