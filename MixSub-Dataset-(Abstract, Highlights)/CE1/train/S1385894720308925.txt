 Stretchable conductive and skin friendly materials are highly desired due to their enormous potential in flexible wearable electronic devices biosensors and so forth . Herein a novel type of hydrogels was prepared

@highlight A nanocomposite multi network PAni PAAm GOCS hydrogel was facilely prepared.
@highlight The morphology of PAni nanofibers and conductivity of hydrogel were successfully regulated.
@highlight The hydrogel exhibited excellent mechanical strength strain sensitivity and skin affinity.
