 In recent years researchers have combined various drugs to target different phases of impaired diabetic wound healing . Often in such cases the drug that aims to regulate the early phases may be released in the later healing processes or the drug intended to activate the later processes may be released in the early phases this can lead to side effects . Therefore a one drug delivery system that can modulate multiple phases of wound healing is expected to provide a new alternative treatment . In the present study we simultaneously incorporated free thrombin and Th loaded liposomes into a photocrosslinkable gelatin derivative hydrogel Th

@highlight Thrombin hydrogel targeting multiple phases of wound healing was designed.
@highlight The hydrogen bonding enhanced the mechanical property of hydrogel.
@highlight Thrombin promotes wound healing via the phosphorylation of SMAD3 Ser204 .
