 Butanol is an alternative fuel with characteristics competitive to petroleum based fuels . Compared with ethanol butanol shows less miscibility flammability and corrosion while potentially replacing gasoline in car engines without modifications . However the production cost of butanol from renewables feedstock i.e . bio butanol through fermentation remains high . This is mainly due to the low yield of butanol in fermentation . The conventional recovery of butanol by distillation is an energy intensive operation that has greatly restricted the industrial production of bio butanol . This work studies ten hybrid and intensified configurations based on the liquid liquid extraction and dividing wall columns to purify the butanol to the fuel grade . The study analyzes sustainability based on green metrics including the inherent safety and control properties using singular value decomposition analysis . The results indicate that as long as the process is highly intensified the sustainability and the inherent safety are improved and not necessarily the control properties . This is primarily due to the loss in the degrees of freedom in intensified processes .
