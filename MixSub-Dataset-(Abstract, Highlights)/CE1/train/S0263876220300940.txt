 The thermal decomposition of ethyl acetate was experimentally studied in a newly designed fast pyrolysis set up . The results were compared to theoretical calculations and literature values in order to proof the experimental concept . The reaction was carried out in a free fall tubular reactor with a residence time of 0.15 s. The identification and quantification of products stream composition was performed online using a GC TCD FID . First an overview of the reaction rate at feed volumes of 0.25 0.50 and 0.75 mL was obtained at reaction temperature between 400 to 600 C in intervals of 50 C. As a result mass transfer limitation for feeds larger than 0.5 mL were identified . For the second approach a constant feed volume of 0.25 mL and temperatures between 420 to 550 C were investigated . Using the experimental results a global kinetic model is proposed for the thermal decomposition of ethyl acetate into ethylene and acetic acid through a first order unimolecular reaction . Also theoretical calculations were performed at B97XD 6 311 G level . A concerted mechanism through a six membered transition state was identified in the reaction path . The theoretical and experimental activation energy values lie within the literature values between 193 and 213 kJ mol .

@highlight Proof of concept realized with a target liquid molecule.
@highlight Theoretical calulations at the DFT wB9tXD 6311 G d p identified a six membered transition state.
@highlight Experimental and theoretical parameters were in good agreement with literature values.
@highlight The pyrolysis of more model compounds will help unravel the kinetic of complex samples.
