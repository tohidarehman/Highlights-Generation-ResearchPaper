 Roasting pre treatment is a necessary process for recovering pyrolusite and carbonaceous gold ore . In order to reduce energy consumption and make full use of the carbon component in carbonaceous gold ore the gold ore was used as the reductant in pyrolusite processing . Based on the fluidized roasting coupling technology the roasting process of reducing pyrolusite with carbonaceous gold ore was investigated . Co recovery of manganese from pyrolusite and gold from carbonaceous gold ore was achieved . The results indicated that the optimum leaching efficiency of 99.31 for manganese and 97.43 for gold could be attained under the conditions that the mass ratio of carbonaceous gold ore to pyrolusite was 2 3 the co roasting temperature was 1073.15 K the roasting time was 30 min .

@highlight The fluidized roasting coupling technology is efficient.
@highlight The carbonaceous gold ore was used as the reductant in pyrolusite processing.
@highlight The optimum leaching efficiency of 99.31 for Mn and 97.43 for Au was attained.
