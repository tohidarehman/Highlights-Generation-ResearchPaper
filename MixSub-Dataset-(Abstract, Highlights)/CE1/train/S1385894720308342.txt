 Colloidal nanocrystals can offer exquisite control of physical and chemical properties for technological applications by tuning their sizes shapes and crystal forms . Herein a convenient phase transfer route was presented to controllably prepare transparent dispersions of monodispersed ZrO

@highlight Monodisperse ZrO
@highlight nanocrystals were controllably prepared by a phase transfer route.
@highlight The as prepared ZrO
@highlight nanocrystals have tunable shapes crystal forms and sizes.
@highlight DFT calculation was used to study the root causes of underpinning growth mechanisms.
