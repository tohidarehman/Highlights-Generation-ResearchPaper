 Pressure release equipment for the formation of microbubbles is an important part of any DAF system . In this study 3D printing was employed to produce new nozzles followed by testing to find the optimum pressure and flowrate . The flowrate through the nozzle affected both the empty bed residence time of the saturator and also the nucleation of bubbles . With the increase of flow rate the total number of bubbles was seen to increase . This is a significant observation meaning that the enhanced precipitation of bubbles outweighs the reduced EBRT . This fact can improve equipment sizing and reduce CAPEX . Meanwhile DAF is a technology that can help extend membrane life and reduce operational issues in seawater reverse osmosis . So for further validation a full scale DAF was built and tested for SWRO pretreatment on the coast of the Persian Gulf . The system was tested with without coagulation as well as with without filtration media embedded inside the DAF tank . The results showed that the use of coagulation alongside DAF reduced the turbidity by more than 60 while using a DAF with embedded filtration could reduce the turbidity to less than 1 NTU . In comparison to common media filters the proposed setup showed better performance .

@highlight New pressure release nozzles for DAF have been 3D printed.
@highlight The saturator pressure and nozzle flow rate have been studied.
@highlight The system has been tested in a full scale SWRO desalination plant.
@highlight Employing filtration within the DAF tank results in excellent water quality.
@highlight SDI and NTU measurements of treated water are as per required RO standards.
