 Self healing and self repairing coatings are stimuli responsive materials which are of crucial importance in developing advanced smart systems . However a few has been attempted to unveil the association between the microstructure and properties of self healing organic coatings . Herein silane coupled cellulose functionalized halloysite nanotubes epoxy nanocomposite coatings showing vitrimer like behavior were developed and their crosslinking thermal mechanical and self healing behaviors were discussed . Nanocomposites with variable pristine HNT and HNT C contents were prepared where epoxy HNT C took

@highlight Developed cellulose functionalized halloysite nanotube HNT C nanoparticles.
@highlight Prepared and cured epoxy HNT C nanocomposites varying HNT C content and heating rate.
@highlight Heat release increased from 129 for epoxy to 456J g more than 3 fold for epoxy HNT C.
@highlight exceptionally increased from 75C for the neat epoxy to 142C for epoxy HNT C system.
@highlight Spontaneous self healing behavior was observed for
@highlight cured epoxy HNT C systems.
