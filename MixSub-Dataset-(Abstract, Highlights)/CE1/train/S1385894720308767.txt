 Polyether especially poly has attracted extensive attention in polymer electrolytes since 1973 due to the superior coordination ability with alkali metal ions . However the ionic conductivity of linear polyether is suppressed by the inherent effortless crystallizability . Here we synthesized hyperbranched polyether for composite polymer electrolytes with an ionic conductivity of 5.710

@highlight Copolyether PMH9 is synthesized via cationic ring opening polymerization.
@highlight Hyperbranched pendants break the ordered arrangement of linear polyether.
@highlight Plasticizing effect of TFSI
@highlight anion on polyether is revealed.
@highlight Composite polymer electrolyte shows a high ionic conductivity at room temperature.
@highlight All solid state polymer Na battery exhibits good cycling stability.
