 To facilitate the formation of bicomponent heterostructure here a novel strategy of surface group mediated nucleation reaction is developed to prepare carbon dots embedded BiPO

@highlight A green and energy efficient method of boosting heterostructure formation is presented.
@highlight CDs BiPO
@highlight heterostructure shows excellent light absorption and photocatalytic activity.
@highlight CDs not only act as electron donors but as trapping agent of photogenerated holes.
@highlight The photoinduced electrons from the heterostructure can activate nitro compounds.
