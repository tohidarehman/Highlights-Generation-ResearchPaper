 Previous studies have shown that introducing of an extra transition metal into the monometallic nitrogen doped carbon could benefit oxygen adsorption further weaken the O O bond energy and thus promote the electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction . Up to now the bimetallic nitrogen doped carbons were mostly prepared by direct pyrolysis of in situ mixed precursors or pre formed bimetal organic frameworks sub micro sized products with encapsulated metal particles were commonly formed leading to lower utilization of the metal atoms and less active sites density of the catalysts . In this paper surface anchored iron cobalt nitrogen doped carbon hollow nanospheres were properly designed by boiling the monodispersed polypyrrole nanospheres in Fe Co ions involved molten salt . Even a trace amount of Fe Co atoms were anchored on the nitrogen doped carbon hollow nanospheres the onset potential half wave potential and limiting current density could reach to 0.950V 0.841V and 6.898mA cm

@highlight Molten salt method could promote the utilization of metal atoms.
@highlight Surface modification of nanospheres could sharply increase the active site density.
@highlight Bimetallic anchorage could balance the activity and stability of the catalyst.
@highlight The catalyst could deliver high onset potential 0.950V and limiting current density 6.898mA cm
