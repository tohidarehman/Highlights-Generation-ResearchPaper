 In this study purification of a benzene lean gas stream over unimodal and bimodal silica based mixed metal oxides was investigated for the purpose of understanding the effects of secondary metal oxide and support pore structure on the adsorption capacities and kinetics . The unimodal silica fell in the borderline of micropores and mesopores i.e . they consisted of large micropores and small mesopores with large surface area while the bimodal silica consisted of large micropores small mesopores and large mesopores with large mesopore volume . The titania and zirconia mixed metal oxides showed reduced surface area and pore volume as a result of partial blockage of the pores however they exhibited improved adsorption behavior relative to the bare silica . Equilibrium adsorption measurements revealed unimodal adsorbents are superior to their bimodal analogues by exhibiting higher benzene vapor uptake with capacities reaching 10.05 11.71 and 11.25mmol g for SiO
