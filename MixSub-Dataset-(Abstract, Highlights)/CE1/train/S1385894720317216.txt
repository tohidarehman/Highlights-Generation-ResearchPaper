 Achieving the artificial supramolecular polymer with excellent low temperature self healing capability has been a new topic of great significance in soft robotic actuators and smart coating . Nevertheless the production of robust polymer with decent low temperature self healing ability is severely impeded by its high crosslink density and low dynamic crosslink bond . Here we report a design strategy that both low crosslink density and high dynamic crosslink bonds are introduced into polyurea networks to achieve a tough and low temperature healable supramolecular system of polypropyleneglycol polydimethylsiloxane Zn . Incorporating the long PPG segments into linear PDMS chains endows the resulting polymer with relatively low crosslink density allowing fast polymer chains movement to unite fractured surfaces . Moreover the dynamic characteristics and self healing capability of the supramolecular network were effectively enhanced by combining the unique dynamic exchange feature of weak Zn urethane coordination bonds and low temperature inhibition dissociation effect of hydrogen bonds . As a result the representative sample of PPG PDMS Zn 0.5 polymer displays a robust tensile strength of 0.98MPa and a high self healing efficiency of 97 at 20C and these features have rarely been achieved in the previously reported materials . With these promising characters such kind of supramolecular polymers can find wide applications in fields of anti icing and winter anti frosting paints and antarctic pole exploration as well .
