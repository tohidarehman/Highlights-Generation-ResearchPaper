 A novel and simple strategy for one pot preparation of supramolecular reduced graphene oxide hybrid material based on pillararenes was developed by the redox reaction between graphene oxide and hydrazide pillararene in aqueous solution . In this process no additional reducing agents needed to be added and no extra modification steps were required after reducing GO . The few layer RGO HP5A hybrids fabricated could be dispersed in the water easily and stably . When applied to supercapacitors this nanocomposite showed a remarkable specific capacitance 331 Fg

@highlight Hydrazide pillar 5 arene HP5A served as the reducing agent and stabilizer.
@highlight RGO HP5A composite exhibited excellent water dispersibility and few layer property.
@highlight RGO HP5A 2 3 showed a high initial specific capacitance and great rate capability.
@highlight The composite had many binding sites for further optimization.
