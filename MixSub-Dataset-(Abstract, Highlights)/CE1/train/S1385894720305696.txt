 The study examines the interaction of process conditions of a mechanochemical process in a planetary ball mill . The investigated Knoevenagel condensation of vanillin and barbituric acid exhibits sigmoidal feedback kinetics under solvent free conditions . The temperature development in the non cooled chamber increases the reaction velocity along the process . In contrast to mere grinding processes that are determined by the stressing intensity the mechanochemical process is thus mainly dependent on the power input which is connected to the heating rate . Consequently significantly different temperatures are obtained by the time of full conversion depending on the process parameters . Finally lowest energy demands are reached at shortest reaction times for the Knoevenagel condensation in a planetary ball mill . However a thermal treatment of educt powders under steady mixing but without particle refinement do not result in a sufficient yield .
