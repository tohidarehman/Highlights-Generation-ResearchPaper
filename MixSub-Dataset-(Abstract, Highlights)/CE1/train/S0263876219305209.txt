 Brazil is the largest producer of sugarcane ethanol in the world . Among the technologies that aim to improve the process second generation ethanol is one of the most promising . Although still in development it is a consensus that this process must be integrated into the production of first generation ethanol . Most of the work on this subject is involved in evaluating the steady state process . However the knowledge of the process dynamics plays an important role on the operational efficiency and control . In this work multiple effect evaporation is addressed . A dynamic phenomenological model of this step was developed in EMSO process simulator . A stream of glucose syrup is mixed with sugarcane juice stream at the entrance of the system and simulations were performed to analyze the integrated system dynamics . Step disturbances were applied in the sugar concentration volumetric flow rate and temperature of the juice individually and simultaneously . Glucose syrup concentration and flow rate was also disturbed . PI PID controllers were tested in order to control the system and the model consistency was verified in Aspen Dynamics . The analysis suggests that an adequate control system at the liquid and vapor output of each vessel can not be achieved using only classical controllers .

@highlight The coupling of the first and second generation ethanol process is attractive.
@highlight Multi effect evaporators dynamics in integrated process is analyzed in EMSO.
@highlight Disturbance in general lead to a loss in sugar concentration.
@highlight Last effects dynamics far from linear and classical control is not suitable.
@highlight EMSO presents advantages when compared to other commercial simulators.
