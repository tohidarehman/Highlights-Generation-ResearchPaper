 Three dimensional few layer graphite framework shows great potential in various fields such as energy storage and electrocatalysts owing to their porous structure superior electronic conductivity and good structural mechanical stability . In this work 3D hollow few layer graphite framework is fabricated by a temperature driven dynamic catalytic strategy . The in situ generated Ni nanoparticles serve as a catalyst to promote the graphitization of carbon source . By optimizing the activating temperature the initial small Ni nanoparticles gradually aggregate and grow into larger ones during which they act as a dynamic catalyst to induce the construction of the 3D few layer graphite framework along their aggregation paths . When demonstrated as the anode in Li ion battery the as prepared 3D few layer graphite framework exhibits excellent electrochemical performance . The present synthetic strategy potentially represents a general method that can be extended to the construction of other carbon based architectures for diverse applications .
