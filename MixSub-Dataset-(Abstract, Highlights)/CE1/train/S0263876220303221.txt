 The selection of a proper diluent should be based on several criteria such as the distribution ratio phase disengagement time cost safety and environmental impact of the process . The effect of different diluents on the solvent extraction of Nd by the neutral extractant tri

@highlight Aliphatic diluents provided higher extraction efficiencies than aromatic diluents.
@highlight Free extractant concentration is reduced in aromatic diluents.
@highlight Phase disengagement times were relatively fast with aromatic diluents.
@highlight No extraction differences between diluents at highly concentrated nitrate feed.
