 Compared to the traditional chemical reduction method a green and efficient strategy was successfully applied to regulate the surface heterogeneity of graphene oxide . In this work different kinds of amino acids were used to reduce and modify GO . The reduction and adsorption disparities of amino acids contributed to the difference of structural heterogeneity in terms of density thermal tolerance and disorder of the oxygen containing groups of GO . The modification also resulted in discrepancies in surface properties of the GO samples such as hydrophobicity and surface charge . The functionalized GO was employed as a carrier for the immobilization of lipase from

@highlight Graphene oxide was reduced and modified by different kinds of amino acids.
@highlight The structure heterogeneity of oxygen containing groups on GO was regulated.
@highlight Relative activity of lipase on functionalized GO had the maximum increase of 47 .
@highlight The relative activity was 19.21 folds more than that of commercial TLIM.
@highlight The increase was mainly related to its orientation and slight conformational change.
