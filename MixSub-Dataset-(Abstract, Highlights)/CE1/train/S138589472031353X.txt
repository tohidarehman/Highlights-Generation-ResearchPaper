 Preparation method is of importance for development and application of polymers . Herein we proposed a continuous flow strategy for the preparation of polyimide precursors through solution polymerization in microreactors for the first time . The polymerization time was significantly reduced from several hours in a batch reactor to twenty minutes in a microreactor . Lower temperature more appropriate molar ratio of monomers and longer residence time in the polymerization process resulted in polys with higher molecular weights . Moreover the relationship between the molecular weight and the residence time was used to discuss the polymerization kinetics . Meanwhile the rapid preparation of polys from pyromellitic dianhydride 4 4 diphthalic anhydride benzophenone 3 3 4 4 tetracarboxylic dianhydride 4 4 oxydiphthalic dianhydride or cyclobutane tetracarboxylic dianhydride was achieved in the microreactor . In particular the number average molecular weight of the PAA prepared by BTDA and 2 2 bis 4 4 diaminodiphenyl ether reached 36.3kg mol at the polymerization time of 19.6min . This work demonstrated that microreactors would provide a promising and efficient pathway to prepare polyimide precursors with high molecular weights .
