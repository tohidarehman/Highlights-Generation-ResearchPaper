 This study proposes a high efficiency natural gas hydrate storage method involving the formation of NGH in a water oil emulsion with the addition of suitable thermodynamic additives . First the CH

@highlight NGH production by using the water diesel CP emulsion was proposed 
@highlight CP substantially increased formation rate and gas uptake of hydrate in w o emulsion 
@highlight The NGH hydrate diesel slurry formed from w o CP emulsion showed good flowability 
@highlight A continuous NGH crystals production process was proposed.
