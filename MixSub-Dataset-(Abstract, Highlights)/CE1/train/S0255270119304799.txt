 As environmental protection standards have improved the reduction of sulfur contained in crude oil and the realization of energy efficient gasoline desulfurization have become popular research topics . In this study the optimal conditions for ultrasonic assisted oxidative desulfurization of gasoline and crude oil were investigated the effects of ultrasonic and simple oxidative desulfurization were compared and the mechanism of the ultrasonic effect was verified . The desulfurization effects were analyzed according to the response surface methodology under different ultrasonic power levels irradiation times and oxidant amounts . The maximal desulfurization rate of gasoline was achieved with an ultrasonic power of 400 W irradiation time of 7 min and oxidant amount of 8 mL . Meanwhile the optimal desulfurization effect for crude oil was achieved with an ultrasonic power of 700 W irradiation time of 10 min and oxidant amount of 10 mL . The results of the comparison experiments showed that ultrasonic treatment enhanced processing and that ultrasonic assisted oxidative desulfurization was more effective for crude oil than for gasoline . The results of this study provide valuable reference information for the application of ultrasonic treatment in oil desulfurization .

@highlight The cavitation effect can generate radicals and strengthen the oxidation process.
@highlight Crude oil was desulfurized more than gasoline with ultrasonic treatment.
@highlight The significant factors for crude oil are the oxidant amount and ultrasonic power.
