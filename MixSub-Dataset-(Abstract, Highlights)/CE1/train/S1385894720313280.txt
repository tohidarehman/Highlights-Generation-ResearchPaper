 The creation of thermostable flame retardant mechanically robust bioplastics is highly desirable in the industry as one sustainable alternative to traditional petroleum based plastics . Unfortunately to date there lacks an effective strategy to endow commercial bioplastics such as polylactide with such desired integrated performances . Herein we have demonstrated the fabrication of a novel MXene phenyl phosphonic diaminohexane nanohybrid

@highlight Novel layered MXene PPDA 6 was rationally designed and synthesized.
@highlight The addition of 1.0wt of MXene PPDA 6 hybrid significantly increases both thermal stability and flame retardancy of PLA.
@highlight The MXene PPDA 6 hybrid can improve the toughness of PLA.
