 Carbone capture by absorptionregeneration technology is a well known process . However the development and utilization of new solvents remains crucial to lower its energy consumption . Therefore an accurate thermodynamic modeling is essential for the process simulation and optimization . This work focuses on the thermodynamic modeling of CO

@highlight CO
@highlight absorption into aqueous solutions of DEEA MAPA and their mixtures.
@highlight eNRTL modeling for DEEA MAPA and DEEA MAPA based systems was developed.
@highlight Model developed in Aspen Plus by adding species in the database.
@highlight This work can be used for CO
@highlight absorptionregeneration process simulation.
