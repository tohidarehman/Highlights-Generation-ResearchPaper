 Controlled release of pesticide is highly desirable for improving efficacy and reducing side effects . Hydrophobic hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions have been widely investigated to control the release of pesticides . However metal coordination bonding is yet to be fully explored for controlled release of pesticides . In this study copper ions Cu
