 Carboxylated nanocellulose hold great application potential and research value in environmental remediation owing to its eco friendly nature high specific surface area high density of functional groups and abundant reserves properties . In present work a new type of cellulose nanofibers with high aspect ratio and high density of carboxyl groups were prepared by directly thermo oxidizing natural wasted pomelo peel with H

@highlight Cellulose nanofiber based environmental repairing materials were prepared by hydrogen peroxide.
@highlight POCNF PEI has excellent Cu adsorption properties with maximum adsorption capacity of 74mg g.
@highlight POCNF PEI has excellent MG adsorption ability with maximum adsorption capacity of 530mg g.
@highlight POCNF PEI can be recycled four times with larger adsorption capacity of 6572mg g.
