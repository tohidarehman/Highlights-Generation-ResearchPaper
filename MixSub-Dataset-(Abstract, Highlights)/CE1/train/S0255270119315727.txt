 Innovative heat elimination technologies from the radiator are needed for weight reduction in an automotive vehicle to increase the overall performance . The fluids used nowadays are based on a combination of distilled water and ethylene glycol and also using nanofluids for improving heat transfer performance has been increased within the last couple of years . The use of aluminum oxide Al

@highlight Hybrid nanofluids Al

@highlight Effect of milling nanoparticles Al
@highlight with SiC on heat transfer was analysed.
@highlight Increase in Nu number of 8.98 and 23.4 for 0.4 and 0.8 is recorded.
@highlight Increase in heat loss was achieved for Al
