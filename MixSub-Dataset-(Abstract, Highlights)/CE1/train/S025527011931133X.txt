 Single cell oils have been considered as potential replacers of plant and animal oils and are mainly produced by yeasts molds and algae . Oleaginous yeasts have taken special attention due to the similarity of their metabolism with that of higher plants and the numerous genetic tools available for their modification . However a special need has been reported for efficient cell disruption technology due to the rigidity of their cell wall compared to other biological ones . This makes the conventional maceration for oil recovery usually incomplete . Several mechanical and non mechanical cell disruption technologies have been reported in the literature and are summarized in this review . A special focus is given for bead milling high pressure homogenization ultrasound and microwave assisted extraction . Their advantages and limitations as well as the future potential strategies for oil recovery from oleaginous yeasts are discussed .

@highlight Emerging technologies as alternatives for lipid extraction from oleaginous yeasts.
@highlight Reduced energy consumption of emerging technologies compared to conventional ones.
@highlight Bead milling and high pressure homogenization are the most efficient techniques.
