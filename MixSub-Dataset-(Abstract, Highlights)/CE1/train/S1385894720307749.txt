 In this experimental study using 5 5 diallyl 2 2 dihydroxy 3 3 dimethoxybiphenyl the activity kinetics and mechanisms in aqueous solution were investigated for the delignification of ClO

@highlight 5 5 diallyl 2 2 dihydroxy 3 3 dimethoxybiphenyl DDD is synthesized.
@highlight Differential ultravioletvisible is used to determine the DDD concentration.
@highlight DDD reacting with ClO
@highlight bleaching is a second order reaction at pH 3.42.
@highlight Activation energy is calculated as 141.58kJmol
@highlight by Arrhenius equation.
