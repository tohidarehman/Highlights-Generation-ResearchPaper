 In current solar unit mirrors with involve of parabolic secondary reflector has been employed to enhance the absorbed radiation flux . The optical efficiency with involve of modified secondary reflector augments about 21 . The absorbed flux profile was added in energy equations as source term and three dimensional turbulent flows have been analyzed . Bottom of the pipe facing with mirrors has greatest radiation flux and its value is 7500W m

@highlight Heat transfer intensification of nanofluid within a Solar LFR was investigated.
@highlight Mirrors with involve of parabolic secondary reflector has been employed.
@highlight With selection of nanomaterial higher thermal performances was obtained.
@highlight For Re 8000 T
@highlight  298.15 
@highlight augments about 1.47 with growth of fin length.
@highlight Although growth of T
@highlight offers lower thermal performance.
