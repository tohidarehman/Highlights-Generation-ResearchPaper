 The low carrier mobility and poor photocorrosion stability severely restrict the application of cupric oxide as a photocathode in photoelectrochemical water splitting . To resolve the above issues we have designed and synthesized a novel as well as highly efficient NiO CuO MoS

@highlight NiO CuO MoS
@highlight composite was prepared as photocathode for PEC water splitting.
@highlight The NiO as hole transfer cocatalyst to promote the transport of photoinduced holes to the substrate.
@highlight The MoS
@highlight can also construct p n heterojunction with CuO to inhibit the recombination of electron hole pairs.
@highlight The MoS
@highlight serves as electron transport cocatalyst to drive photogenerated electrons to the electrode electrolyte interface.
@highlight NiO CuO MoS
@highlight photocathode exhibits a high photocurrent density and photocorrosion stability.
