 In the present study hydrodynamic parameters of micro nanoparticles in a conical spouted bed were investigated using experimental and computational fluid dynamics techniques . The EulerianEulerian approach in conjunction with the kinetic theory of granular flow has been used and the effects of solid wall boundary condition parameters such specularity coefficient

@highlight Influence of drag models and solid wall boundary conditions are considered.
@highlight The RUC model predicts the pressure drop values more accurately.
@highlight The CFD model suitably predicts the behavior of the spouting regime.
@highlight Choice of drag models can significantly affect the hydrodynamics of fluidization.
