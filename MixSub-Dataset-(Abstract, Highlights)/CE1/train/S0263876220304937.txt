 The leaching kinetics of antimony from refractory gold ore in alkaline sodium sulfide was investigated under ultrasound . The influence of factors such as stirring speed temperature the concentration of sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide and particle size was studied . The leaching kinetics has also been studied under convention and ultrasound . The experimental data are consistent with the shrinkage core model and the leaching rate is controlled by surface chemical reaction for both ultrasonic and the conventional method . Ultrasound increases the leaching rate of antimony from 81.2 to 93.1 . It can be seen that the rate constant
