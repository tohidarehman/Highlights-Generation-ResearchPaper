 The contents of this article are based on the results of discussions the corresponding author has had since 2015 with the co authors who are members of academia and industry in Europe on the scope and significance of chemical and biochemical engineering as a discipline . The result is a multi layered view of chemical and biochemical engineering where the inner layer deals with the fundamental principles and their application the middle layer deals with consolidation and expansion of the principles through a combination of science and engineering leading to the development of sustainable technologies and the outer layer deals with integration of knowledge and collaboration with other disciplines to achieve a more sustainable society . Through this multi layered view several important issues with respect to education research and practice are highlighted together with current and future challenges and opportunities .
