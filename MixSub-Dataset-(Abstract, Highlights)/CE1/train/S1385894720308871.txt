 The preparation of dynamic networks from lignin with multipurpose and multifunctional practical applications is highly desirable but still challenging . In this study the combination of a grafting from reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization and dynamic chemistry was utilized to synthesize lignin based dynamic networks . Vanillin a derived chemical from lignin was used as a building block to realize the structural reorganization of lignin

@highlight Lignin based dynamic networks were synthesized
@highlight RAFT polymerization.
@highlight Renewable monomers were used to realize the grafting polymerization.
@highlight Dynamic networks were recyclable and exhibit an UV adsorption property.
@highlight Star structures enable the adhesive with milder self healing conditions.
@highlight Antifungal property was observed for Schiff base network.
