 Coatings that are transparent wear resistant flexible and anti smudge may be used on foldable touchscreens for example . However there have been only few reports on such coatings . This paper reports such a coating . The coating is prepared from the thermal curing of cycloaliphatic epoxy functionalized oligosiloxanes with PEMA

@highlight An inexpensive and easy coating fabrication process was developed by thermal curing of CEOS with PEMA 
@highlight  PDMS.
@highlight The transparent and omniphobic coating exhibits superior flexibility.
@highlight The coating possesses the highest pencil hardness of 9H.
