 Methane partial oxidation by a catalytic membrane reactor is a promising process by integration of oxygen separation and catalytic reaction to produce syngas an important feedstock for downstream processes . However high methane conversion and syngas yield require high temperature operation due to dry steam reforming involvement which leads to high energy consumption and poor catalyst stability . In this study a novel asymmetric membrane reactor incorporated with a catalyst layer of enriched oxygen vacancy was designed for direct partial oxidation of methane to syngas . A composite of Sm

@highlight Asymmetric membrane reactor achieved high syngas yield at reduced temperature.
