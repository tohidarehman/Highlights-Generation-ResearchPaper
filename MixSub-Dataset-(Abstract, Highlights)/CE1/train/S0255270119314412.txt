 Process intensification via flow and ultrasound can make crystallization much more efficient economic reproducible and safe . However successful application requires obtaining substantial knowledge on the effect of these techniques on process parameters and product properties . Investigation of such effects on polymorphism is still limited . In this work batch and flow anti solvent crystallization of o aminobenzoic acid was conducted in silent and sonicated conditions . A new type of continuous flow sono crystallizer was also demonstrated . In batch experiments form I nucleated at low anti solvent volume and form II at high anti solvent volume . However differences in mixing led to a significant change in the nucleated polymorph in flow experiments where concomitant nucleation of form II and III was observed for all cases . Ultrasound did not affect the polymorph in either systems but did enhance the process by reducing induction time and increasing yield . Ultrasound in flow with a residence time of mere 2.5 s provided a yield of nearly 50 which was 2.4 times more than silent conditions . Ultrasound can be considered as a useful technique for continuous production of metastable polymorphs as it provides high yield at low residence time thus alleviating risk of solvent mediated transformation .
