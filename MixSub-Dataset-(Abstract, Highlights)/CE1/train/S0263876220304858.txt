 A case study highlighting the risk of generating undesired hydrate polymorph following seeded distillative crystallization of an active pharmaceutical ingredient from aqueous alcoholic solution and a strategy to overcome the issue is presented . The API salt had two known crystalline forms the desired anhydrate Form A and hydrate Form B . Importance of water content at the time of seeding to minimize the risk of precipitation of From B is emphasized . A novel approach termed distillative pathway diagram was developed to assess the risk of generation of Form B at larger scales . The application of this diagram to determine process parameters to address form issues during distillative crystallization is explained . Given the likely risk of Form B precipitation predicted by DPD an alternate non aqueous antisolvent crystallization process was developed that provided both form and particle size control .
