 It is highly desirable to construct advanced adsorbents with superb adsorption and visual detectivity of arsenate from complex environmental systems . In this work a novel kind of iron alkoxide for simultaneous sorptive removal and colorimetric detection of arsenate from environmental water is reported . This adsorbent displays a three dimensional flower like structure with a specific surface area calculated as 93.13m

@highlight Three dimensional flower like multifunctional adsorbents were prepared.
@highlight Simultaneous sorptive removal and colorimetric detection of arsenate was realized.
@highlight High adsorption capacity of iron alkoxide towards arsenate was obtained.
@highlight Sensitive and selective detection towards arsenate using iron alkoxide was achieved.
