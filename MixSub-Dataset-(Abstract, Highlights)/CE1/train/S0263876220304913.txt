 The traditional method of separating bismuth rich melt produced from the fire smelting of bismuth slags has some imperfections of the complicated operation low recovery rate of metals and harmful to the environment and human health . As a result of these concerns a green method for extraction of Bi and Pb from the bismuth rich melt by super gravity has been proposed in this study . The extraction mechanism of Bi and Pb was discussed in detail . And influences of the super gravity field on the separation of bismuth rich melt were investigated . It can be noted that the Bi solid was difficult to be separated from the liquid phase under a normal gravity field . In contrast after centrifugal filtration with optimum conditions of

@highlight The migration velocity of the Bi solid phase was calculated based on the Stokes law.
@highlight The micro characterization of samples obtained after super gravity separation was analyzed.
@highlight The efficient and rapid extraction of Bi and Pb from the bismuth rich melt was achieved.
