 A mathematical model based on mass and heat balance equations was developed for simulating atmospheric freeze drying of food products . When fresh fruit slices are freeze dried at temperatures far above the glass transition temperature structural deformation and melt back would occur due to the glass rubber liquid transition . Based on this observation an atmospheric freeze drying system was modeled by considering the in drying product as a uniform mixture of the rubber liquid and ice phases that could exhibit a specific vapor pressure . Temperature and moisture content dependent apparent vapor pressures of the apple slices were obtained experimentally and plotted in a diagram . Notably the apparent vapor pressure was significantly different from the vapor pressures of pure water ice at the corresponding temperatures particularly at around the glass transition curve . The simulation was implemented with the developed single zone model by applying these obtained apparent vapor pressures . This approach could predict drying kinetics with reasonable accuracy and simplified equations . The parameters applied in this simulation were further confirmed to be applicable to various operating conditions .
