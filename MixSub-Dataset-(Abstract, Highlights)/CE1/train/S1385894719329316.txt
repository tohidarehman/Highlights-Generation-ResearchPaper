 Lithium metal has been regarded as the most promising anode material for next generation lithium batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and low potential . However uncontrolled dendrite growth during cycling has remained a big challenge resulting in poor capacity retention and safety issue . Herein an ultralight hollow 3D carbon skeleton was fabricated from soybean oil through a facile chemical vapor deposition method which was subsequently coated with copper oxide layer to improving Li wettability . Molten Li can be infused into the 3D carbon host rapidly due to the interaction between copper oxide and liquid Li . The in situ formed Cu nanograins highly dispersing on the carbon skeleton play a key role in homogenizing Li nucleation . The hollow 3D structure of carbon skeleton can accommodate the volume variations of the electrode and regulate Li stripping plating behavior thus suppress the dendrite growth and dead Li formation effectively . As a result the Li composite electrode presents high areal capacity and cycle stability in both symmetric cell and Li S cell . This work provides an alternative strategy to develop high loading Li composite anodes .
