 Nowadays marine bacteria are abundant in marine ecosystems and considered to be one of the main causes of biofouling . Microbial films formed on adsorbent surfaces play a vital role in marine biofouling and lead to a decrease in uranium extraction . Therefore developing efficient antibacterial and antibiofilm sorbents for uranium enrichment is an urgent demand . In this work a novel composite nanofibrous adsorbent comprising of amidoximated polyacrylonitrile and poly methyl ether

@highlight Electrostatic bindings improve structural stability and shrinkage of nanofibers.
@highlight Excellent antibacterial and antibiofilm activities by introducing the guanidines.
@highlight Synergistic interactions of amidoxime and guanidine with uranium ions in seawater.
