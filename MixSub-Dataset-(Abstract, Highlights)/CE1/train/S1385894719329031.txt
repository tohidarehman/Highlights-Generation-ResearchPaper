 As the global population increases the environmental burden from industrial and transportation related pollution will continue to rise . Photocatalysis has been presented as a promising method of removing several environmental pollutants from the atmosphere . Within the literature there are a wide variety of approaches that have been adopted to immobilize or secure the photocatalyst onto support material . A critical review of each of the major methods of photocatalyst immobilization as well as their application to air pollution remediation is presented . Immobilization methods can include sol gel solvent deposition electrophoresis thermal spraying and chemical and physical vapour deposition . Literature presented on these methods provides a wide range of photocatalytic efficiencies for the removal of NO

@highlight Composite photocatalyst systems show the most promise for pollution remediation.
@highlight SPS and CGS techniques show the most promise for photocatalyst immobilization.
@highlight Films deposited by sol gel and TS techniques showed the highest removal rates.
@highlight General unawareness of the published ISO standards.
