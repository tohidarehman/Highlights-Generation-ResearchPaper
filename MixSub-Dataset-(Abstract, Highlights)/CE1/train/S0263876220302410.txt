 Membrane distillation traditionally utilizes low grade thermal energy to drive vapor transport through hydrophobic membrane pores for water treatment . The concurrent enhancement of water flux thermal efficiency and water productivity to achieve the global optimization of MD is still a challenge . In this work a new simulation and optimization approach is proposed by integrating theoretical heat and mass transfer models with response surface methodology to investigate the complicate interaction effects of various influencing factors on heat and mass transfer parameters including overall mass transfer coefficient feed permeate side heat transfer coefficients membrane surface temperature and temperature polarization coefficient in direct contact membrane distillation . The operating and module configuration variables show important interaction effects on enhancing the heat and mass transfer in the membrane module . The significantly elevated heat transfer coefficient on account of the combined high feed temperature short module length and high feed velocity leads to a great improvement of water flux and thermal efficiency . The ultimate global optimum conditions for the high water productivity were determined where the high levels of heat transfer coefficient 5905
