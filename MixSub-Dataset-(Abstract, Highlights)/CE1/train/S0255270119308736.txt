 The present review addresses the need for microdevices presents the basic microfluidic equations and describes the relevant numerical and experimental approaches . Various types and designs of passive and active micromixers are presented . In addition the relevant effective dimensionless or dimensional parameters and the fabrication technology for different micromixer types are introduced . Different general configurations of lamination obstacle convergence divergence and curved channel are discussed for passive micromixers . The active micromixers are categorized and described as pressure field driven acoustic field driven magnetic field driven electric field driven and thermal field driven .
