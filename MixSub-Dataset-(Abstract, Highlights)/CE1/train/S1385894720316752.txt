 Self healing conductive hydrogels as artificial skin like materials hold great potential applications in the fields of artificial intelligence soft robotics and personal healthcare . However it remained challenging to construct stimuli free self healing biomimetic hydrogels with ultra stretchability and excellent sensitivity . Herein polyaniline was coated on the surface polycarboxylic multi branched cellulose nanocrystals via templated polymerization . Afterword rod like Multi CNC PANI served as a dynamic bridge endowed those hydrogels hierarchical structure and dynamic hydrogen bond interactions doped with polyvinyl alcohol borax system . Combined with the dynamic borate ester bonds the biomimetic nanocomposite hydrogels had high breaking strength ultra stretchability rapid self healing properties adhesiveness decent biocompatibility and sensitivity . Especially the hydrogels could keep good self healing ability both in air and underwater without any stimuli and the self healing efficiency could reach up to 99.56 within 120s . This hydrogel sensor could sensitively detect and distinguish human motions including swallow fingers wrist elbow and knee joints in real time . Besides the self healed hydrogel gave detective signal with uniform and repeatable sensitivity which endowed the hydrogels mechanically adaptability and good store stability . Therefore the strategy may provide unique opportunities in designing biomimetic sensors with skin like mechanical stretchability sensitivity and self healing properties .
