 New data for pressure drop void fraction and flow pattern in a vertical riser using airsilicone oil as the system fluid are reported in this work . A differential pressure cell was used to measure the pressure drop . Also void fraction data were recorded simultaneously by an electrical capacitance tomography and wire mesh sensor . The observed flow patterns are the spherical cap bubble slug and churn flows . However only the slug flow without the presence of churn flow is seen within the transition line as predicted by the map . The characteristic probability density function derived from void fraction data was used to determine the flow patterns . A comparison between present experimental results and the airwater data reported in the literature was carried out and various levels of agreement were achieved . The PDFs obtained from the DP cell signals for spherical cap bubble and slug flows significantly differ from those derived from the ECT and WMS outputs . Current void fraction and pressure gradient results were compared with the values predicted by ten empirical correlations selected from the literature . Statistical tools such as Mean Square Error Root Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error were applied in the comparison . The Greskovich and Cooper correlation gave the least MSE RMSE and MAPE values of 0.0007908 0.013 and 3.05 respectively for slug flow .

@highlight New data for pressure drop void fraction and flow pattern in a vertical pipe using airsilicone oil are reported.
@highlight The comparison between the PDF of void fraction obtained from ECT WMS and DP cell showed good agreement for churn flow.
@highlight The PDF of void fraction from the outputs of the ECT WMS and DP cell can be used to predict churn flow with confidence.
@highlight The experimental data have good agreements with empirical correlation models.
