 Chemical product design has progressively become a more critical issue since the chemical industry is rapidly moving toward the production of consumer oriented products at low cost . This new paradigm has boosted research and developments in this emerging field . However designing a new chemical product through an integrated approach is still challenging . In particular the design of emulsified cosmetic products commonly involves the implementation of heuristics during the formulation of the product highlighting the need of implementing integrated strategies in this field . This study reviews the current status of the integrated design of emulsified cosmetic products including but not limited to property modeling manufacturing methods the key variables affecting final product quality and the current challenges in this field . This review highlights the need to perform close integration between market parameters engineering variables and business models on the one hand and systematic and standardized approaches to translate consumer needs into technical specifications on the other . Also this study presents the requirement for better accuracy of predictive models for emulsified product s physical properties for the successful integrated design of cosmetic emulsions considering different modeling frameworks such as population balance models that have the potential to improve the models prediction capabilities .
