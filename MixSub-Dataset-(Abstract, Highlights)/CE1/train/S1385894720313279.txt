 The fibrocartilaginous enthesis regeneration after rotator repair is still a major challenge . Although magnesium based alloy orthopedic implant is effective to promote fibrocartilage formation at the tendon bone interface in the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction model it was limited in the rotator cuff repair for its special anatomical structure . Herein we developed a multifunctional self healing magnesium ions quaternized chitosan Pluronic F127 hydrogels to achieve in situ and customized release of Mg

@highlight Mg QCS PF composite hydrogels mediated the sustained release of magnesium ions.
@highlight The hydrogels exhibited self healing adhesive properties and biocompatibility.
@highlight The hydrogels greatly promoted BMSCs adhesion and chondrogenic differentiation.
@highlight The hydrogels significantly increased the fibrocartilage regeneration
