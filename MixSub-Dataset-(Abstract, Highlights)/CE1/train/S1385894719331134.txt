 Capacitive Deionization is an emerging technology for brackish water desalination . Currently CDI technology lacks practical means of scaling electrodes from the laboratory to pilot plant level for pre commercial applications . With the aim of solving the scalability issues we have prepared easy to scale 3D composites using the highly conductive macrostructure of a graphite felt as electron transfer channel with the microstructure of activated carbon to furnish ionic adsorption sites . The electrochemical characterization of GF AC 1cm

@highlight A 3D composite electrode based on a GF and a microporous AC is proposed for CDI.
