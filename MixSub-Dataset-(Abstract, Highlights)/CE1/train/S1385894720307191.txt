 Chemical hydrogels have been extensively applied to the removal of heavy metal pollutants . However most of chemical hydrogels inevitably contain toxic chemical crosslinker residues which impose serious threats on the environment . Herein a novel eco friendly physically crosslinked double network hydrogel of chitosan sodium alginate calcium ion CTS SA Ca

@highlight A novel eco friendly physically crosslinked double network hydrogel was prepared.
@highlight Semi dissolution acidification solgel transition and internal gelation methods were combined.
@highlight The mechanical property of the hydrogel was significantly improved.
@highlight The hydrogel showed excellent adsorption capacities for Pb
@highlight  Cu
@highlight and Cd
@highlight The adsorption mechanism kinetics isotherms and thermodynamics were studied.
