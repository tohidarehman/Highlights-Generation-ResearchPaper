 In this work the extraction of U by tributyl phosphate is studied in small channels of different sizes operated in segmented flow . The variables analysed include the channel diameter mixture velocity 1.06 4.24 cm s

@highlight Study of solvent extraction of U VI in segmented flow using pure and diluted TBP.
@highlight Correlations for plug length and interfacial area for a wide range of conditions.
@highlight Semi empirical pressure drop model based on flow periodicity is presented.
@highlight Mass transfer coefficients and efficiency measured at different flow conditions.
@highlight CFD model is used to support experimental mass transfer coefficients.
