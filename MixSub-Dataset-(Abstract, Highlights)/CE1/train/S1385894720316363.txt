 The development of Li ion batteries for the new flexible technologies should also consider environment and safety issues . Therefore this research focused on developing an aqueous water based process for the preparation of free standing CNT free and flexible Li

@highlight Free standing and flexible electrodes were prepared with an aqueous route.
@highlight Mechanical stress on the electrode leads to better penetration of the electrolyte.
@highlight The ratio of PEG to obtain flexible electrodes depends on its molar mass.
@highlight PEG polymer chains probably act as spacers between PVA polymer chains.
@highlight The best electrochemical performances were obtained for PEG 6000 2wt .
