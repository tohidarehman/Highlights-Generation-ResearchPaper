 Owing to high safety and considerable energy density rechargeable all solid state lithium metal polymer batteries with organic inorganic composite solid state electrolytes have been recognized as one of the most promising battery systems . However 4V or above class ASSLPBs still suffer serious capacity degradation arising from the complex interface issues between the electrode and electrolyte . Herein for the first time we find the oxidation decomposition of TFSI

@highlight The real electrochemical stability of organic inorganic CSSE is confirmed by simulating the real working environment.
@highlight Capacity fading mechanisms of 4V class ASSLPBs are elucidated by systematic electrochemical testing and physical characterization.
@highlight Two targeted modification methods for 4V class ASSLPBs are proposed.
