 Sulfidized nanoscale zerovalent iron has been reported to be highly reactive towards lots of contaminants . However the effects of surface chemistry evolution and hydrophobicity on its reactivity and selectivity towards the reduction of different functional groups on contaminants are unclear . Here the reactivity and electron selectivity of aged nZVI and S nZVI in water for the denitration of chloramphenicol and dechlorination of florfenicol were investigated . The reactivity of nZVI for the denitration of CAP was greatly inhibited after sulfidation and the

@highlight Sulfidation changed the surface chemistry hydrophobicity and reactivity of nZVI.
@highlight Surface S Fe and hydrophobicity of S nZVI were correlated to its reactivity.
@highlight Sulfidation improved the anti aging property of nZVI in water.
@highlight nZVI maintained high electron efficiency for denitration after aging in water.
@highlight S nZVI maintained high electron efficiency for dechlorination after aging in water.
