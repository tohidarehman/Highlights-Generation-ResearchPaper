 Functional materials with specific wettability surfaces are valuable for many areas . Extensive applications for superwettbility have led to demand for integrating devices with flexible and multi functional . Here inspired by the super adhesive of mussels and the hierarchical structures of mosquitos compound eyes we proposed a new method to construct functional hierarchical superhydrophobic surface by self assembly of colloidal nanoparticles . The monolayer micron scaled photonic crystal film is self assembled on the surface of the liquid and deposited on the as prepared dopamine modified substrate . Then a single layer of nanoscale photonic crystal film is self assembled on the surface of the liquid and deposited on the prepared monolayer micron scale film . In addition the assembled structure is highly ordered and presents a certain structural color . When the surface is changed the liquid will be injected into the ordered structure causing the change of structure color . The hierarchical photonic crystal films with structural hydrophobic can be prepared on arbitrary intricate surfaces . Moreover we have also explored the potential use of these hierarchical films as indicators for the surface wettability . These indicate that the hierarchical films are highly versatile for different applications .
