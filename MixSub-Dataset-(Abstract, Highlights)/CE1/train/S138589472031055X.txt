 The excessive discharge of goat manure has placed a serious burden on the environment and accordingly how to transform this type of waste into functional materials is of practical significance yet remains challenging . Herein surface loaded cobalt biochar was successfully prepared for the first time by carbonizing Co impregnated goat manure waste . The Co GMC 900 exhibited excellent performance in activating peroxymonosulfate to degrade ciprofloxacin which could remove 96.5 of CIP within 30min . Additionally in the cycle experiments the Co GMC 900 presented robust stability due to the synergy of excellent magnetism inherent ellipsoid of goat manure and strengthened interactions between cobalt nanoparticles and graphitized biochar network . In the light of a series of characterization analyses carbonization temperature played a crucial role in tailoring the physicochemical properties of composites . Based on detected active species radical process SO

@highlight Goat manure was reused to synthesize catalyst Co GMC 900 for PMS activation.
@highlight Carbonization temperature greatly affected physicochemical properties of materials.
@highlight The Co GMC 900 exhibited excellent performance and stability for CIP degradation.
@highlight Both radical and non radical processes contributed to the oxidation reaction.
