 The main benefits expected from module based plant design are shortened planning periods and increased planning as well as cost estimation accuracy during early engineering phases . Most of the existing approaches require equipment module databases . However overall equipment module databases do still not yet exist . Even though these databases will be available they will most likely not contain operable equipment modules for any process task . Thus the objective of this work is to increase the accuracy of investment cost estimation without the need of equipment module databases which is exemplified for plate as well as shell and tube heat exchangers . Instead of selecting one equipment module from an existing module database for a certain process task all operable equipment modules are generated by determining design parameter combinations which are located inside the design space and thus fulfill all operating constraints . Tailor made equipment design is not needed in any step . The detailed investment cost estimates of all operable equipment modules are used to determine the range of possible investment cost . The variance of the investment cost estimates determined is equal or less than half of the error of conventional preliminary investment cost estimation in case of 54 of the industrial process tasks .

@highlight More accurate preliminary investment cost estimation based on design space approach.
@highlight Neither equipment module database nor tailor made equipment design needed.
@highlight Industrial heat exchange process tasks considered for meaningful exemplification.
@highlight Cost estimation error reduced by more than half for 54 of the process tasks.
@highlight Result independent of plate and shell and tube heat exchanger type.
