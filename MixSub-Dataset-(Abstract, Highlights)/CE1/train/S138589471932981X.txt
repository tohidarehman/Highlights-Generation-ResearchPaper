 Conductive materials have been incorporated in anaerobic bioreactors to stimulate direct interspecies electron transfer a recently discovered microbial electron sharing network . Previous studies emphasized the significance of electrocatalytic features associated with DIET while research gaps are remaining in the understanding of how different operating temperatures and substrate variation will affect those electrochemical characteristics . Consequently this study examined various electrochemical features including biomass conductivity

@highlight Carbon fibers enhanced methanogenesis rates to different extends under 2055C.
@highlight Electrocatalytic responses and microbial communities were examined.
@highlight Both were affected by substrate and temperature variation.
@highlight Electron transfer rates coincided with methanogenesis rates when fed ethanol.
@highlight The results also suggested distinct temperature dependent DIET pathways.
