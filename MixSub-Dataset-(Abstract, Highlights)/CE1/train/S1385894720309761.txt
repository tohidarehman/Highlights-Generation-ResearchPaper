 As two typical silicon source carrier the features of diatomite and Santa Barbara Amorphous 15 supported Mn based sorbents for moderate temperature flue gas desulfurization are investigated in this paper . The framework structure high mechanical strength and large density of diatomite make great contributions to the high desulfurization efficiency of diatomite supported Mn based sorbents M

@highlight The features of diatomite and SBA 15 supported Mn based desulfurizers are compared.
@highlight The unique structure of diatomite promotes the external mass transfer process.
@highlight Excessive Mn doping results in the serious self seeding nucleation of Mn
@highlight Mn
@highlight evenly spreads on the surface of SBA 15.
@highlight The modular Mn diatomite SBA sorbent is developed as well as its working mechanism.
