 Surfactant flooding a chemical enhanced oil recovery technique boosts oil production mainly through lowering oilwater interfacial tension and altering reservoir rock wettability . In the current study the performance of pure saponin a non ionic surfactant was evaluated for EOR in sandstone and carbonate reservoirs . The performance evaluation experiments were IFT by pendant drop method wettability through the use of sessile drop technique and core flood to discover the oil recovery improvement . According to IFT experiments the surfactant had a critical micelle concentration of 5

@highlight The surfactant pure saponin was assessed for EOR in sandstones and carbonates.
@highlight The evaluation experiments were IFT wettability and core flood.
@highlight The surfactant considerably decreased the value of IFT and contact angle.
@highlight Up to 8.4 of oil recovery improvement was observed after surfactant flooding.
@highlight The surfactant exhibited a salt tolerant characteristic.
