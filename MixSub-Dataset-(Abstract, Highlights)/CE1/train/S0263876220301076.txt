 In the present study MIL 101 doped with copper and nickel nano particles were successfully synthesized and applied as promising adsorbents for separation of ethylene ethane mixture . The as synthesized adsorbents were characterized using XRD N

@highlight MIL 101 successfully doped with Cu and Ni nanoparticles.
@highlight The loading effect of nanoparticles on separation of ethylene ethane was investigated.
@highlight The effect of temperature on the performance of as synthesized adsorbents were studied.
@highlight The selectivity and capacity of doped MIL 101 adsorbents enhanced toward ethylene.
@highlight MIL 101 with 6 Cu loading received maximum ethylene capacity and selectivity among other adsorbents.
