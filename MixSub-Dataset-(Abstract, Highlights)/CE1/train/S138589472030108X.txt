 In lithium sulfur batteries as a consequence of the highly complex reaction and degradation mechanisms materials and cell design have a critical impact on the performance . Subsequently Li S batteries receive significant research attention . In this report a comprehensive analysis on the effect of key factors on the battery performance namely the peak discharge capacity and the cycle life is conducted using machine learning . Data for 1660 cells from 353 papers in the literature are collected and analyzed via association rule mining . The analysis concludes that encapsulation material type and amount are critical for high capacities and enhanced cycle life . The use of structured carbons such as porous carbons or carbon nanotubes in encapsulated cathodes leads to superior battery performance . Likewise electrolyte design has a key influence on the battery performance particularly in electrolyte starved cells . The results confirm that the most promising pathway forward in Li S batteries is materials design predominantly design of encapsulation cathodes and electrolytes that succeed at low electrolyte to sulfur ratios and high sulfur loadings .

@highlight Machine learning association rule mining is performed for Li S batteries.
@highlight Impact of key materials and cell design factors on PDC and cycle life is determined.
@highlight Encapsulated Li S cathodes perform better both in terms of capacity and cyclability.
@highlight Porous carbons CNT and specialized new materials are substantially superior.
