 We propose a design procedure for the generation of the training set for Machine Learning algorithms with a specific focus on the approximation of computationally intensive first principles kinetic models in catalysis . The procedure is based on the function topology and behavior by means of the calculation of the discrete gradient and on the relative importance of the independent variables . We apply the proposed methodology to the tabulation and regression of mean field and kinetic Monte Carlo models aiming at their coupling with reactor simulations . Our tests in the context both of mean field kinetics and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations show that the procedure is able to design a dataset that requires between 60 and 80 fewer data points to achieve the same approximation accuracy than the one obtained with an evenly distributed grid . This strong reduction in the number of points results in a significant computational gain and a concomitant boost of the approximation efficiency . The Machine Learning algorithms trained with the results of the procedure are then included in both macroscopic reactor models and computational fluid dynamics simulations . First a Plug Flow Reactor is employed to carry out a direct comparison with the solution of the full first principles kinetic model . The results show an excellent agreement within 0.2 between the models . Then the CFD simulation of complex tridimensional geometry is carried out by using a tabulated kMC model for CO oxidation on Ruthenium oxide thus providing a showcase of the capability of the approach in making possible the multiscale simulation of complex chemical reactors .
