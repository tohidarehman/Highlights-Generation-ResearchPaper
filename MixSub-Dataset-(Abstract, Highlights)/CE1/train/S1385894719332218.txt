 This study reports on synergy between Dielectric Barrier Discharge plasma and calcium oxide as a catalyst for the Reverse Water Gas Shift . Any effect of the presence of the catalyst on the contribution of plasma chemistry i.e . chemical conversion in the plasma is minimized by using a fixed bed of Al

@highlight Synergy between plasma and calcium oxide for Reverse Water Gas Shift is found at low temperatures.
@highlight Kinetic description allows quantification of synergy.
@highlight Changes in plasma properties and plasma chemistry are minimized by reactor optimization.
@highlight Synergy caused by new plasma catalytic pathway with plasma activated species.
