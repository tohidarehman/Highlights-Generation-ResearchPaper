 This paper presents a process improvement of the pH swing process wherein a steelmaking slag is used as a source of calcium oxide for the mineral carbonation of CO

@highlight Experimental study on the calcium extraction from steel slag by combining wet grinding and extraction.
@highlight It is found that with the new extractive grinding method 5060 yield is reached.
@highlight Results shows that with this new method utilizes mild solvent of 1mol L NH4Cl water solvent for extraction.
@highlight This method reduces the energy requirement which makes this process suitable for industrial application.
