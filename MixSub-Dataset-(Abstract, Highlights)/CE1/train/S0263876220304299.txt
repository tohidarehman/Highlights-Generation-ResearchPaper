 A simultaneous transesterification and esterification process was applied for production of biodiesel from high acidic waste cooking oil containing 18 wt FFA using a range of heterogeneous bifunctional strontiumzincaluminium catalyst . The influence of the molar ratio of metal oxide the ethanol to waste oil molar ratio temperature and time of reaction catalyst dosage and free fatty acids in the feedstock on the conversion of biodiesel were studied . High interaction between Sr Al and Zn metal was recognised to promote catalyst performance . A high interaction and mixing of strontium aluminium and zinc oxides enhanced and increased the active sites on the surface of acid and base . The catalyst with a 2.6 1 M ratio of strontium to zinc was found to perform the best to transesterify the glycerides and esterify the fatty acid in the used oil simultaneously . The catalyst exhibited higher catalytic activity with high acidity waste cooking oil with 95.7 reaction conversion at the optimum conditions 10 1 ethanol to waste oil molar ratio 15 wt catalyst dosage and 5 h reaction time at 75 C reaction temperature . The used catalyst showed low reusability due to high leaching of strontium .

@highlight Biodiesel was successfully produced from a high acidity waste cooking oil WCO .
