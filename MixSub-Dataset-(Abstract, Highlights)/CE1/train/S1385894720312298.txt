 Achieving superior electrocatalytic activity and thermal chemical stability of cathode materials is the key to high performance and durable solid oxide fuel cells . Here we present a barium and praseodymium co substituted perovskite Bi

@highlight A novel perovskite cathode Bi
@highlight Pr
@highlight Ba
@highlight FeO
@highlight  BPBF was well developed.
@highlight The composite BPBF based cathode exhibits favorable ORR activity with low polarization ASR values.
@highlight Excellent thermal chemical stability is achieved in both pure air and 1vol CO
@highlight  containing air.
@highlight The intrinsic high acidity of Bi
@highlight and co substitution of Ba Pr enable stable high electrocatalytic activity.
