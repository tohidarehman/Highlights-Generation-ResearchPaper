 Ethyl mercaptans which commonly exist in natural gas have to be removed to a low level due to their toxic odorous and corrosive properties . Herein a novel Fe N modified active carbon catalyst was prepared for the ethyl mercaptans removal . The Fe

@highlight A novel Fe N modified active carbon for ethyl mercaptans removal was prepared.
@highlight Fe
@highlight phase is the main active site for catalytic oxidation of the ethyl mercaptans.
@highlight The strong Fe N interaction increases content and dispersion of the Fe
@highlight phase.
@highlight Sulfur capacity of the novel catalyst is nearly four times that of the activated carbon.
