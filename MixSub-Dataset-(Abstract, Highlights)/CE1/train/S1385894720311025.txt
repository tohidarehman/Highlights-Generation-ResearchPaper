 The mobility of liquid droplets is essential for microanalysis and reaction processes . Through previous efforts many materials and devices have been developed for controlling tiny droplets . Adjusting the external force drive of the droplet and the structure of the material surface are the main research direction at present but the corresponding time of some materials is longer or direction control is inflexible the direction is controllable the operation is flexible and the response speed is fast which can improve the practical application in this regard . Inspired by the anisotropic wettability of the butterfly wings we have developed a micromechanical device with integrated meshes with double different superwettability tracks which can mechanically adjust the comprehensive wettability by a rational rotating of a layer of superhydrophilic track and a layer of superhydrophobic track and further control the pinning and sliding of the droplets . The method provides a micromechanical manipulation device with a rotatable attachment which can be used to release and transfer single or multiple tiny droplets simultaneously in situ . Quick response low production cost and convenient operation methods provide the possibility for large scale production and use of droplet manipulation devices and a broad application in droplet transport drug delivery and microfluidics .
