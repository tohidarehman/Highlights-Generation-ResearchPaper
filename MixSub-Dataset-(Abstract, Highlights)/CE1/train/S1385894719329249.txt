 The current research work investigated the effective utilization of automobile shredder residue fly ash as an alternative iron source to degrade recalcitrant organic pollutants like tetracycline via a visible light driven photo Fenton like process at neutral pH . The whole photodegradation process was carried out in a fixed mode by using highly durable ASR fly ash beads as the catalyst in the photo Fenton reaction . As confirmed through several characterization techniques these beads contained hematite goethite magnetite pyrite and wustite forms of iron oxides . Moreover iron cations Fe

@highlight ASR fly ash was used as an iron source in photo Fenton degradation of Tetracycline.
@highlight Spherical ASR fly ash beads were used as recyclable catalyst in fixed bed studies.
@highlight XRD and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the presence of iron oxides on beads surface.
@highlight ASR fly ash beads contributed to dual process photocatalysis photo Fenton .
@highlight The beads were highly stable and active even after 10 recycles.
