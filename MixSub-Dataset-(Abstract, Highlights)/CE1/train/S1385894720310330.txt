 Simulated moving bed reactor increases conversion of a reversible chemical reaction by introducing continuous counter current in situ adsorptive separation of reactants and or products . Effects of temperature variance among different operating zones on the performance of a 4 column SMBR for reaction in the form of

@highlight Optimization for SMBR was done to assess effect of non isothermal operation.
@highlight Optimization problems with different temperature distributions were explored.
@highlight First time triple objective optimization was performed for SMBR processes.
@highlight Pareto optimal solutions were explained by trends of flowrate ratios 
@highlight  values .
@highlight Non isothermal operation may be used to reduce the solvent consumption.
