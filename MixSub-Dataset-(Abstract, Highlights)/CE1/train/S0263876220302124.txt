 In this work the design of experiments and response surface methodology were applied to investigate the effect of process parameters including pressure 2545

@highlight The effect of pressure temperature and time on supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of sweet paprika 
@highlight L. was determined.
@highlight Optimization of the operating variables for extraction yield carotenoid content the total content the concentration of yellow and red carotenoid and color value of extract as well as the color post extraction residue was carried out using response surface methodology RSM .
@highlight The optimal extraction conditions for achieving high content of carotenoids in the extract were 323.15
@highlight None
@highlight K 45
@highlight None
@highlight MPa and 56
@highlight None
@highlight min.
@highlight The extract yield at optimal conditions was 8.5 and recovery of carotenoids 84 .
@highlight Validation of obtained mathematical models confirmed their accuracy and usefulness.
