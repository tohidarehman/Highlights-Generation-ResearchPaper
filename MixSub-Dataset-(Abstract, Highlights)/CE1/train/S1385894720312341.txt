 4D printing as a booming additive manufacturing technology of smart material provides a new opportunity for the development of shape memory polymers . Meanwhile the diversity of SMPs structure calls for flexible and well adapted printing technology . Fused deposition modelling is one of the most versatile and cost effective methods owing to the simplicity of the technique and broad compatibility with a wide variety of materials but it fails to deal with the fabrication of shape memory networks that possess excellent structural stability as well as shape memory effect . Aiming to personalized or patient adaptable treatment devices in this work we demonstrate a UV assisted FDM 4D printing strategy to fabricate elbow protector models based on shape memory copolyester networks . First the linear unsaturated copolyesters were synthesized amongst poly was chosen as hard segment providing the material a good mechanical performance and printability the poly with strong crystallizability was employed as switching segment and a functional coupling agent contained double bonds was used to join the two segments and as the same time . This copolyester can be easily processed into filament and the
