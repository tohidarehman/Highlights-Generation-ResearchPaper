 Recently the alarming level of pharmaceuticals active compounds pollution has exerted serious threat to the environment . It is important but still a great challenge to develop an effective and efficient adsorbent for PhACs treatment due to their bioaccumulation persistence as well as potential toxicity . Here soft foam like UiO 66 polydopamine bacterial cellulose with three dimensional connected network structure and high hydrophilicity were prepared using biomass BC as scaffold . The uniform coating of UiO 66 nanoparticles with uniform size guarantees high surface area as well as active sites for the adsorption of target pollutants . Excellent adsorption performances are obtained towards aspirin 149mgg

@highlight The prepared UiO 66 PDA BC shows three dimensional nanostructure high specific surface area and high hydrophilic.
@highlight The uniform coating of UiO 66 nanoparticles present cube shape and averaged size of 50nm with uniform size distribution.
@highlight The foam like aerogel can efficiently adsorb aspirin and tetracycline hydrochloride TC and can be easily recycled.
@highlight The synergetic effect of chemical adsorption and interaction lead to higher sorption abilities.
