 A thorough understanding of the behaviour of the transition from plug to slug flow is imperative based on the fact that the transition can trigger an abrupt radial pressure variation . This can bring about major vibrations to the pipeline and also lead to big differences in pressure gradient and wall temperature . Unfortunately the transition from plug to slug flow is poorly understood due to the scarce availability of experimental data . Furthermore a considerable amount of research on the transition from plug to slug flow in the literature is based on an airwater system . In this work the transition behaviour from plug to slug flow in a horizontal pipeline was experimentally investigated using electrical capacitance tomography . Working fluids are airsilicone oil . The work was carried out over a range of liquid and gas superficial velocities of 0.050.47 m s and 0.054.7 m s respectively . Wave growth and wave characteristics mechanisms were observed to be responsible for the transition from plug to slug flow based on the obtained experimental results . Both liquid and gas superficial velocities have a major influence also on these mechanisms . The drift flux parameters for the transition from plug to slug flow was determined . A reasonably good agreement was observed from the comparison between present experimental data against hitherto published empirical models and correlations .

@highlight New experimental data on the horizontal plug to slug transition flow is reported.
@highlight Drift flux analysis is performed in horizontal plug to slug transition flow.
@highlight Good agreement between current data against existing models and correlations was confirmed.
