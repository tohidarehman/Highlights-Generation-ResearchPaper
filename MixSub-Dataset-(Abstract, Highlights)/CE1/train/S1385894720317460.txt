 The experimental specific capacity of layered double hydroxide electrode is obviously lower than theoretical specific capacity due to its ordinary interlayer spacing . Therefore getting large interlayer spacing by big size anions intercalation to improve the capacity performance becomes a important research topic . In addition the quantitative relationship between interlayer spacing and capacitance performance has not been systematically revealed . In this paper we synthetised and regulated interlayer spacing of NiMn layered double hydroxide from 7.38 to 28.41 by adding different moles sodium dodecyl sulphate as intercalating agent using one step method and defined average interlayer spacing to describe more than one interlayer spacing . We found that specific capacity in three electrode system and capacitance of hybrid capacitor device are positively correlated with the size of the average interlayer spacing in NiMn layered double hydroxide . The sample with the biggest average interlayer spacing of 28.41 obtains the highest specific capacity of 325 290 258 209mAhg
