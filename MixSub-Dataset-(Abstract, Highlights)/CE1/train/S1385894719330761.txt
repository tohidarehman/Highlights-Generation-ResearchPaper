 Battery supercapacitor hybrid devices are emerging wide application in new energy storage electric vehicles and other fields with excellent performance in energy storage and power amplifier . However the development of suitable cathode materials is far from being satisfactory and limits the performance . Here we demonstrate that the Ni
