 The aim of this work was the study of the energy efficiency of the dehydration process of cranberry juice using osmotic distillation in combination with freeze drying . To achieve this process OD was performed on a hollow fiber membrane contactor with an initial sugar content of 8Brix in the cranberry juice . This solution was concentrated to four different final concentrations with the purpose of reducing the lyophilization time obtaining a 100 dried product using as a response variable the processing time . From these obtained results and when comparing the 8Brix juice lyophilization to the process achieved by the combination of OD and freeze drying a decrease in the total process time could not be achieved for any experimental assay . However the 57Brix cranberry juice previously concentrated by OD presented an 86 decrease in the energy requirements to obtain the same dehydrated product . Finally a reduction of the energy consumption for all the experimental runs was observed in the samples concentrated by OD as the step previous to lyophilization achieving an intensification in the efficient energy use during this process maintaining the same characteristics of the final product .

@highlight Cranberry juice was successfully concentrated by OD and then dehydrated by FD.
@highlight OD coupled with FD is an energy efficient process.
@highlight FD processes of cranberry juice were adjusted with the Page and Newton models.
