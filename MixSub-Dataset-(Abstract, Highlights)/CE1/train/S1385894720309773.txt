 Contamination of aqueous environment caused by various antibiotics has attracted wide attention . It is important to find effective adsorbents for the removal of toxic compounds . Herein Ni was anchored at the surface of porous boron nitride by a facile way to enhance the adsorption performance for tetracycline . The interaction between porous BN and Ni was proved to be B O Ni bond . It is noteworthy that Ni modified porous BN shows excellent removal percentage up to 99.769 for TC which far exceeds the pristine porous BN and most other reported adsorption materials . The maximum adsorption capacity calculated from the Langmuir model is 429.582mgg

@highlight Ni II modified porous boron nitride BN was prepared and characterized.
@highlight The interaction between porous BN and Ni II was proved to be B O Ni bond.
@highlight BN Ni 3 shows dramatic removal percentage up to 99.769 for 20mg L
@highlight TC.
@highlight The adsorption followed pseudo second order kinetics and the Freundlich isotherm.
@highlight DFT calculations reveal the changed electron transfer with the existence of Ni II .
