 Scaffolds with antioxidant capability have attracted considerable interests for wound healing . For enhanced wound healing new antioxidant materials are still highly needed . In this study new antioxidant materials arginine derivatives were introduced into dopamine functionalized hyaluronic acid to develop novel hydrogels with enhanced antioxidant activity . The HA DA AD hydrogels showed greater DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging rates than the HA DA hydrogel . Moreover the HA DA AD hydrogels exhibited significantly better protection for cells against external oxidative stress and better wound healing . This study confirmed that AD could assist wound healing scaffolds to have enhanced antioxidant properties .

@highlight Enhance antioxidant activity of hydrogel is a promising way for wound healing.
@highlight The well designed hybrid hydrogel is natural and simple.
@highlight Arginine derivatives enhance the dopamine antioxidation for hyaluronic acid hydrogel.
