 There is growing evidence on the importance of the redox properties of biochar for many environmental applications . However its variability and the difficulty in controlling its redox properties could be delaying the use of biochar in those areas that involve the exchange of electrons like microbial fuel cells or contaminant degradation related to microbial electron shuttling . To help with these issues we produced a wide range of biochars showing different redox capacities through a variety of strategies . These include optimizing production and processing parameters feedstock selection preloading biomass with redox active metals and post pyrolysis treatments . A modified Hummers method was the most efficient treatment increasing the electron donating capacity from 0.244mmol e

@highlight A variety of approaches were tested to enhance the redox properties of biochar.
@highlight Post pyrolysis modification was able to triplicate the EEC of the original biochar.
@highlight Surface area pH and conductivity can also be tuned by selecting the right method.
@highlight Biochar with an acceptable conductivity and EEC was produced for electron shuttling.
@highlight Tailored designer biochars can be produced to target specific applications.
