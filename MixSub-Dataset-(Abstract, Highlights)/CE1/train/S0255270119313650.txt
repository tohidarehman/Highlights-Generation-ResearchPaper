 As a new type of separation device supersonic separator has received more and more attention in many areas . However the interaction between boundary layer and shock wave in supersonic section results in the reverse pressure gradient and makes the boundary layer thicken which form a so called second throat that reduces the actual flow area and causes the fluid to be chocked . A novel cylinder drainage structure with larger drainage area was developed . When shock wave occurs the high pressure will make more fluid enter into the openings on cylinder drainage structure which is equivalent to increase the flow capacity . Therefore the shock wave is weakened and the total pressure loss is reduced . Moreover the prediction model of discrete phase coupling verified by experiments was adopted in order to predict the trajectory of droplets and separation efficiency for supersonic separator . The results show that with the increase of droplet size the separation efficiency increases gradually and the particle diameter of 24m is sensitive to the separation . The droplets trajectory is more clear and regular in the nozzle with reflux channel and cylindrical drainage structure .
