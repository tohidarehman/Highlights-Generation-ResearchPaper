 Formation of satellite droplets during drop formation or breakup leads to an increment of polydispersity of emulsion and runs contrary to the original intention of microfluidics . Thus more attention is needed to shed light on the mechanism of satellite droplets formation to alleviate polydispersity . In this work we studied the satellite droplet formation process in microfluidic flow focusing junction and T junction with capillary number

@highlight The thinning kinetics of liquid filament are presented and explained.
@highlight The final slow shrinking stage facilitates the formation of satellite droplets.
@highlight The size of satellite droplets increased with the increase of capillary number.
