 Internal concentration polarization is a significant problem in Forward osmosis membranes which reduces the water flux . In order to mitigate the ICP phenomenon rice bran and wood sawdust particles were selected as natural green pore formers and incorporated into the polyethersulfone matrix to fabricate mixed matrix membranes . Fabricated MMMs were used as the porous support layer to make thin film composite FO membranes . Firstly the water uptake experiment was performed to evaluate the water adsorption capacity of the RB and WSD particles . Furthermore all samples were characterized by FTIR FESEM AFM XPS DLS static contact angle and tensile strength . Also performance tests in reverse osmosis and the FO units were performed to evaluate the fabricated membranes . The results showed that the use of RB and WSD particles dramatically reduced the structural parameter in all MMMs resulting in lower ICP effects and high water flux . Due to the softer structure smaller size and more water uptake the RB based TFC membranes recorded better results . The TFC RB 5 was the best membrane with a water flux of about 65.71L m

@highlight TFC membranes supported on RB and WSD based MMMs were fabricated for FO process.
@highlight Incorporation of both RB and WSD particles in the TFC SL resulted in a dramatic decrease in structural parameters.
@highlight Control of the DICP phenomenon was achieved with the use of RB and WSD particles.
@highlight The positive impact of using the RB and WSD particles on Caspian seawater desalination was evident.
@highlight These valuable results achieved at a highly low cost and in a simple modifying method.
