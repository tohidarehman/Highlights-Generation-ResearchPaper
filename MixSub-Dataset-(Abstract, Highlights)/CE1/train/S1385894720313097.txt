 To overcome the drawback that the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors tends to deteriorate at high working temperatures due to exothermic redox reactions during the chargedischarge process we designed and fabricated a novel type of polyaniline carbon nanotubes functionalized hierarchical phase change microcapsules as a self thermoregulatory microelectrode system . In this system a layer by layer shell configuration was constructed by fabricating a SiO

@highlight A novel self thermoregulatory microelectrode system was designed for supercapacitors.
@highlight The system was constructed by PANi CNTs functionalized phase change microcapsules.
@highlight The system has a high latent heat storage capacity and good thermal regulation effectiveness.
@highlight The system exhibits the improved supercapacitor performance and cycle stability.
@highlight This work offers an innovative strategy for design of high performance electrode materials.
