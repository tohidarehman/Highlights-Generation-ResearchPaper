 UV nanoimprinting lithography has the merits of high throughput and resolution low cost of manufacture and room temperature operation and thus finds wide applications in various fields . Herein a novel disulfide bond containing photoresist for UV nanoimprint lithography was designed and prepared based on the disulfide compound 2 2 dithiodiethanol diacrylate isobornyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate . The addition of DTDA could obviously enhance the double bond conversion polymerization rate 19 s

@highlight A disulfide bond containing UV NIL photoresist is prepared.
@highlight The photoresist has extremely low volume shrinkage 0.93 .
@highlight The photoresist has an excellent degradation ability in the presence of tributyl phosphine.
@highlight The photoresist manifested an outstanding pattern transfer ability.
@highlight The photoresist exhibits good photopolymerization mechanical and thermal performance.
