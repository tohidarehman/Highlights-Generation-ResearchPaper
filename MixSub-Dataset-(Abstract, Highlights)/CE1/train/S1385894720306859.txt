 Herein large conjugated core anthracene with an innate bipolar property was employed to construct multifunctional organic electronic materials . Delicate manipulating molecules via combining anthracene core and large periphery groups two asymmetric anthracene derivatives namely 4 10 4 9

@highlight High efficiency asymmetric anthracene derivatives as multifunctional deep blue materials for non doped homogeneous OLEDs.
@highlight Addressing the contradiction of efficiency color gamut and structure complexity of devices.
@highlight The outstanding homogenous OLED with a narrow band deep blue emission and extremely low roll off of 4.8 at 5000cdm
