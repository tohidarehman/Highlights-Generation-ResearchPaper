 Semicontinuous distillation is a new separation technology for distilling multicomponent mixtures . This process was designed using design methodologies with heuristic components that evolved over 20 years . However the fundamental philosophy of these design methodologies which involves guessing checking and then using a black box optimization procedure to find the values of the design variables to meet some performance criteria has not changed . Mainly to address the problem of having a heuristic simulation termination criterion in the black box optimization phase the single shooting method for semicontinuous distillation design was proposed in this study . We envision that this is a first step in the transformation of the semicontinuous distillation design process for obtaining optimal designs . We demonstrate the application of this method using two case studies which involve the separation of hexane heptane and octane .

@highlight Addressed problems with the previous procedures used to find the system s limit cycle.
@highlight The shooting method was applied for precisely finding the system s limit cycle.
@highlight A precursor to the development of a systematic design procedure for optimal design.
