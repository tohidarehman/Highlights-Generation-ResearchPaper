 A separated gasification chemical looping combustion system has been operated auto thermally which has high combustion performances and is beneficial for the lifetime of oxygen carrier . In this work the performances of SG CLC were compared with in situ gasification CLC in a two stage reactor system . The iG CLC has more favorable solid conversion than that of SG CLC namely the conversion of iG CLC reached 97.81 after 10min while that of SG CLC was 88.31 at 1050C . When the oxygen ratio

@highlight The performances of iG CLC and SG CLC were compared.
@highlight The SG CLC under auto thermal condition showed high combustion performances.
@highlight The SG CLC is beneficial to lengthen the lifetime of oxygen carrier.
