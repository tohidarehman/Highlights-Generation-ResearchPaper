 Super amphiphobic surfaces are limited either by the specific micro morphologies which are difficult to fabricate on particular substrates or by the liquid repellent ability which is confined to liquids with surface tension higher than about 24mNm

@highlight Magnetic super amphiphobic nanoparticles with core shell structures were prepared.
@highlight Super amphiphobic surfaces can repel liquids with surface tension below 20mNm
@highlight Water organic marbles were formed based on the super amphiphobic nanoparticles.
@highlight Microdroplets directed transportation and miniature reactor were achieved.
