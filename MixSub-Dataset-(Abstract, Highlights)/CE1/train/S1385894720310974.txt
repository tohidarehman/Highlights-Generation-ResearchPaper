 We present a novel procedure for surface modification of boehmite nanoparticles via tanning inspired coating . The impact of tannic acid coated boehmite as a nanofiller on preparation of nanocomposite membranes were evaluated in terms of wettability permeability membrane morphology and fouling resistance capability . The surface morphology and chemical structure of TA BM PES blend membranes were investigated by SEM AFM measurement of contact angle and pore structure FTIR and XRD analysis . Both of surface hydrophilicity and permeation flux of pure water improved significantly with incorporating of TA BM nanofiller . The SEM image exhibited the wider finger like pore of TA BM PES embedded membranes compared to bare PES membrane . The AFM image analysis indicated that the roughness parameters of membranes reduced remarkably in presence of TA BM nanostructures . In order to assessment of nanofiltration performance the removal capability of Direct Red 16 and licorice dye was studied . The results revealed that the TA BM embedded membranes possessed superior dye removal capability in comparison of bare membrane . The antifouling performance tests of membranes studied by protein rejection . It was shown that the best antifouling performance was belonged to 0.5wt TA BM PES blend membrane FRR 96.4 R
