 Flexible polyvinylidene fluoride films with various heterogeneous alternating multilayer structure containing high aligned graphene nanosheets and Ni nanochains were designed for electromagnetic interference shielding and heat dissipation applications . Because of the unique structure and highly aligned nanofillers effective electron and phonon conductive paths were formed in HAMS films with optimal electrical and thermal conductivity of 76.8 S m and 8.96W mK respectively . Combining the high electrical conductivity and the synergetic electromagnetic loss as well as multi level electromagnetic multireflection the optimal HAMS film with thickness of 0.5mm exhibits a high EMI shielding effectiveness of 43.3dB showing 98.6 increment compared to homogeneous film which can further improve to 51.4dB when increasing the thickness to 0.7mm . Simultaneously the highly concentrated and aligned graphene in alternating layers can contribute to the significant improvement in in plane thermal conductivity of HAMS films with 14.3 and 1200 increment comparing to the homogeneous film and pure PVDF respectively . Considering the outstanding performance and high efficiency stacking hot pressing preparation technique HAMS films with alternating aligned graphene Ni nanochain layers present a huge potential in practical large scale application as advanced EMI protection and thermal management materials .
