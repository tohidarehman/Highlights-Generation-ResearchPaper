 In this work a novel jet electro absorber is presented as an efficient process that combines absorption and electro oxidation for the treatment of gaseous pollutants . This system based on the Venturi effect enhances the absorption of vapor wastes in absence of a mechanical compressor . It has been tested with a model organochlorine compound perchloroethylene that it is widely used as solvent and easily promoted to the gas phase because of its high vapor pressure . Results confirmed that the target compound can be absorbed into the electrolytic solutions proposed being the efficiency highly influenced by the electrolyte absorbent composition . Opposite to it was expected it was also confirmed that the electrolysis does not mineralize the compound but it promotes mainly the transformation of the raw pollutant into refractory products . Also it was determined the paramount influence on the perchloroethylene removal pathway of the bubble size produced by jet absorbers with different throat width even modifying the products distribution . A gaseous intermediate phosgene and carbon tetrachloride are promoted in the electro oxidation treatments with

@highlight Jet electro absorption can be applied to remove volatile compounds.
@highlight Higher concentrations were absorbed using methanol as solvent.
@highlight Bubble size controlled by the throat width modifies the absorption behavior.
@highlight Final products depend on current density tested.
@highlight No mineralization but transformation of perchloroethylene into other products.
