 Creating coal based new materials and finding their new applications are important for sustainable chemistry and engineering of coals . Here we prepared a new kind of coal derived three dimensional graphitic porous carbon for form stable composite phase change materials . The ultrathin graphitic walls of this material enhanced thermal conductivity and shape stability . This hierarchical porous material exhibits a specific surface area of 1351m

@highlight Graphitic porous carbon with hierarchical porosity and ultrathin graphitic walls was prepared from coal.
@highlight The porous carbon was developed as supporter of form stable phase change materials for thermal storage.
@highlight High thermal storage capacity was obtained even higher than theoretical value.
@highlight Enhanced thermal conductivity and high shape stability were obtained for the composite PCMs.
