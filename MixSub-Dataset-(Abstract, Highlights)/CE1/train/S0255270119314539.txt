 Congo red is a highly toxic diazoic dye used in textile industries . In this work the decolorization of Congo red was performed using hydrodynamic cavitation individually and in combination with H

@highlight HC in combination with Fentons reagent results in 70 decolorization of Congo red.
@highlight Effects of parameters and interactions are investigated using RSM.
@highlight Synergistic coefficient and yield efficiency of the combined process are determined.
@highlight Tank in series model with two tanks almost fits the HC reactor.
