 The potential nuclear industry applications of Th make its separation from rare earth elements and U a task of great importance . Herein materials based on phosphorodiamidate functionalized silica were synthesized for efficient capture of Th from acidic solutions and subjected to in depth characterization . SBA 15 O DMAP prepared by oxidation grafting possessed the largest specific surface area pore volume and grafted group density as well as abundant oxygenated groups featuring a high Th sorption capacity rapid sorption kinetics and excellent selectivity . The sorption of Th by SBA 15 O DMAP was found to be monolayer type chemical endothermic and spontaneous . In 0.011M HNO

@highlight Th IV adsorbents based on phosphorodiamidate functionalized silica are presented.
@highlight High Th sorption performance and selectivity are observed in 0.011M HNO
@highlight Trace Th separation from excess U and extraction of Th from monazite are achieved.
