 The use of biogas as feedstock for hydrogen production was widely proposed in the literature in the last years as a strategy to reduce anthropogenic carbon emissions . However its lower heating value compared to natural gas hampers the revamping of existing reforming plants . The use of composite carbon molecular sieve membranes for biogas upgrading CO

@highlight Carbon membranes have been investigated experimentally for biogas upgrading.
@highlight The performance of carbon membranes exceeds the Robeson limit of polymeric membranes.
@highlight The economics of biogas upgrading with carbon membranes have been evaluated.
@highlight Carbon membranes can be installed in existing reforming plants for H
