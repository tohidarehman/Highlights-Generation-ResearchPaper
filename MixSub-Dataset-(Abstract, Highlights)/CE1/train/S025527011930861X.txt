 Current policies lead the design of chemical processes towards a sustainability environment . In the downstream process research the Dividing Wall Columns are well known for their capabilities of saving energy . Those policies demand continuous improvement . Many authors highlight metrics to define a sustainable process the energetic saving greenhouse gas emissions safety and the controllability of the process thus avoiding waste materials with negative impacts on the environment and the safety of the environment . The Quaternary Dividing Wall Column is currently a not so well explored option since its architecture and dynamic properties are not completely studied as of yet . In this study a set of Quaternary Dividing Wall Columns was designed and tested in many performance indexes energy requirement environmental impact Inherent Safety and dynamic properties . The interesting approach of this proposal is that many of the conventional thermal couplings are substituted for Liquid Splits whose implementation improves the performance indexes already mentioned . In this work several quaternary DWC with a liquid split are presented in order to know the implication of implementing a liquid split . As a result the schemes with Liquid Splits showed better performance indexes and could be prospected as good alternatives in a framework of sustainable processes .

@highlight The dynamic behavior of quaternary DWC may be improved by applying liquid splits.
@highlight The Energy requirement is comparable between schemes with and without liquid splits.
@highlight The Inclusion of liquid splits in DWC affects the inherent safety and other indexes.
