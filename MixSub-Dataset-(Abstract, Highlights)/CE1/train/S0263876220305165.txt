 In the Selective Catalytic Reduction system of a diesel engine the decomposition of urea will produce the reducing agent NH

@highlight A detailed urea decomposition mechanism was used in simulation.
@highlight Studied the relationship between temperature and substances in the liquid film.
@highlight Different mixers lead to different mass and location of deposit.
@highlight The injection parameters of a low turbulent system affected the deposits location.
