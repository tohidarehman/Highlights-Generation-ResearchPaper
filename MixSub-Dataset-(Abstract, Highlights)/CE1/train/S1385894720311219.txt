 In this study we investigated the dynamic characteristics of bubbles in a vibrated airflow force field and the mechanism under which the vibration energy restrains the bubble motion in the bubble fluidization state using digital image processing and signal analysis . Through a comparative analysis of the pressure drop signal and the bubble characteristic images the results show that the bubble coalescence causes a sudden peak value of the pressure drop signal and fracturing causes a decrease of the pressure drop signal . When the bed is fully fluidized the high amplitude pressure drop signal is mainly distributed in the range of 012Hz and the amplitude range is 4801354Pa . During the violent bubbling of bed the amplitude of pressure drop signal in the frequency range of 012Hz decreases and the frequency band of the high amplitude pressure drop signal shifts to a high frequency band . The introduction of vibration energy significantly influences on the dynamic behavior of bubbles and when the vibration frequency is
