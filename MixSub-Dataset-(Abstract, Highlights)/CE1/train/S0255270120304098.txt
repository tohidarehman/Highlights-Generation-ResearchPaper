 Polymer flooding has been widely used for enhancing the on shore oil recovery . However this method is greatly restricted for offshore application because of the large space occupation and low polymer dissolution rate in traditional batch stirred tank reactor . A rapid and continuous polymer dissolution approach via Higee intensification is firstly proposed . Study of this approach is investigated by partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide dissolution testing in rotating packed bed . The effects of different operation parameters including rotational speed packing thickness liquid flow rate and temperature of the dissolution performance are experimentally studied . The basic physical property rheological property and stability testing results show that the quality of the as obtained polymer solution is basically equivalent or slightly superior to that obtained by traditional STR method . The core flooding test of the polymer solution obtained by Higee technique exhibits nearly one percent higher improved oil recovery than that of the STR approach . Moreover a 3 month pilot test 30 m
