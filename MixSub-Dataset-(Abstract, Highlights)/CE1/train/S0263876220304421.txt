 To improve the xanthogenic acidification efficiency of chitosan a novel chitosan based adsorbent with strong chelating ability was prepared by using maleic anhydride as the connecting bridge for the first time . Some characterization methods such that scanning electron microscope nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy X ray photoelectron spectroscopy and thermogravimetric were employed to analysis the structure of copolymers and verify the successful synthesis of XMCTS . Comparative study found that the introduction of maleic anhydride increased the graft rate and acid stability of XMCTS . Impact of dosage pH contact time initial concentration and temperature on adsorption performance were explored . Compared with CTS XMCTS showed better adsorption performance reaching a maximum of 201.43
