 Effective removal of ammonia from air at room temperature is rarely reported by photocatalysis PEC or PEC MFC but realized by a Sn doped V

@highlight Catalyst activity of V
@highlight is increased by optimal Sn doping.
@highlight Average NH
@highlight removal rate in PEC and PEC MFC is about 4 and 8 times PC.
@highlight Oxygen vacancies generate active species for NH
@highlight decomposition.
@highlight High surface area and rich pores caused fast NH
@highlight adsorption.
