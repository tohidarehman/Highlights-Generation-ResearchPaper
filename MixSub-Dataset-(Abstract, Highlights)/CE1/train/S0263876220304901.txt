 This study proposes a new design of milli or micro mixers based on the split intersect recombine principle . The vascular flow topology mimics the respiratory or circulatory architectures existing in nature including tree like bifurcated networks and meshed flow circuit . Special focus is given to the enhancement of mixing performance by fluid collisions and flow deviations at the intersections of the meshed circuit . To do that an optical tracer is added in one of the fluids to be mixed and its progression is monitored and recorded by a high definition CCD camera . The mixing efficiency of the meshed circuit is then characterized by the evolution of the tracer s local concentration profiles based on the Beer Lambert absorption . Experimental results obtained show that compared to straight channels the mixing performance can be improved by about 20 owing to the numerous flow intersections in the meshed circuit . Moreover the viscosity difference between two fluids to be mixed has a positive effect on the mixing performance by augmenting the chance of flow deviation from one stream into another at the crossroads . An optimum performance can be noticed in the form of a plateau of the estimated shear stress .
