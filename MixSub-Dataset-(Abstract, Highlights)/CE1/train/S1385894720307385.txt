 With the rapid development of novel electrodes towards electrochemical capacitors new materials with reasonable compositions and unique structures are intensively studied in order to achieve a high energy density . NiCo

@highlight Core shell structures with NiCo
@highlight as core show high performances for supercapacitors.
@highlight The shell materials are comprehensively reviewed in this work.
@highlight The mass loading of shell materials and the shape of NiCo
@highlight are important for performances.
