 A large number of physical applications such as electrical circuits chemical processes and multibody systems can be accurately described by a set of differential algebraic equations . For instance sustainable water desalination techniques such as membrane distillation is an example of a chemical process that is described by DAEs . Optimal control strategies such as economic model predictive control has many operational advantages for chemical applications . However constructing EMPC schemes for a general class of nonlinear DAEs systems while ensuring closed loop stability and recursive feasibility is an open research challenge that has not been considered . Motivated by the above considerations this note introduces a Lyapunov based economic model predictive control design that can economically operate nonlinear descriptor systems while satisfying input and states constraints . To guarantee closed loop stability and recursive feasibility of the proposed control design a Lyapunov based control law is introduced to characterize the stability region at which the LEMPC can maximize the process economics . Finally a chemical batch process modeled by nonlinear differential algebraic equations is utilized to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework .
