 Few studies have reported on the detail of the mass production process of nanofiltration membranes and modules due to technical confidentiality . This work presents a procedure of fabrication of NF membranes and modules on the pilot scale . Thin film composite NF flat sheet membranes of 300 mm width were continuously fabricated via custom designed equipment . The fabrication parameters and their effects on NF performance were systematically investigated . The optimized conditions parameters were achieved for excellent NF modules performance . The modules show over 75 L m
