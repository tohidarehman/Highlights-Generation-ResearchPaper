 Polyethylene glycol containing solid solid phase change materials based on conventional chemical cross linking avoid the leakage of the materials in the phase transition processes but they can not be reprocessed due to their permanent cross linking network giving rise to non recyclability of the materials . In this paper we prepared a PEG containing solid solid PCM based on dynamic ferric ion cross linking which is in solid state even at 90 . Moreover it can be reprocessed in an acidic solution at room temperature because of the dynamic ion cross linking network . This solid solid PCM has excellent thermal energy storage capacity and thermal stability and its chemical structure thermal property crystallinity and thermal stability are all unchanged after reprocess displaying constant performance for thermal energy storage .
