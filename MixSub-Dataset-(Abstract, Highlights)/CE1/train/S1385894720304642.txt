 Mechanoluminescence is the luminescence responses to mechanical stimuli and offers a variety of significant applications in lighting anticounterfeiting sensors and imaging . At present the only efficient ML materials are sulphides and trap controlled oxides . In this paper we report the ultra strong green ML of a new Lu

@highlight LuAG PDMS elastomer shows ultra strong green ML.
@highlight ML of elastomer does not require any pre irradiation.
@highlight ML of elastomer can be stimulated thousands of times due to self recoverable.
@highlight ML of elastomer is irrelevant to the traps and piezoelectricity of structures.
