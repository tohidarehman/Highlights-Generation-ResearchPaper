 Widespread application of islet transplantation as a cure for type 1 Diabetes Mellitus patients is limited mainly due to the need for life long immunosuppression associated with serious side effects . Immunoisolation by encapsulation of islets in semi permeable membranes may overcome this issue as it allows for transplantation potentially obviating the need for immunosuppressive drug therapy .
