 Black phosphorus is a new two dimensional material with attractive nanoscale chemical and physical properties . Herein black phosphorus dotted with silver nanoparticles was synthesized via a facile and in suit chemical reduction approach without reductant . The tribological properties of as prepared Ag BP nanocomposite as lubricant additive in poly alpha olefin based oil were investigated by a ball on disc tribometer . The results demonstrate that the oil dispersed with trace amount of Ag BP nanoadditives shows excellent lubricating performance for the steel steel contact . The friction coefficient and wear rate of the oil dispersed with 0.075wt Ag BP nanoadditives are reduced by 73.4 and 92.0 respectively as compared to the based PAO6 oil . The possible friction reducing and anti wear mechanisms of Ag BP nanoadditives in oil are illustrated by analyzing the wear scar surfaces . During scratching the Ag BP nanomaterials serves not only as a friction reducing and anti wear additive but also as a catalyst to decompose the based PAO oil for forming a carbon based tribofilm under ambient condition that further reduces the friction and wear . The findings here provide a novel insight into the design of lubricant additive incorporated in base oil and suggests a new potential application of black phosphorus in lubrication and tribology .

@highlight Black phosphorus dotted with Ag nanoparticles is synthesized by a facial and in suit chemical reduction approach.
@highlight The nanocomposite of Ag BP is an excellent lubricant additive achieving ultralow friction and excellent wear resistance.
@highlight Ag BP can act as a catalyst to decompose the base PAO oil forming a carbon based tribofilm during rubbing process.
@highlight The formed tribofilm consisting of BP and amorphous carbon corresponds to the superior lubricating ability of Ag BP.
