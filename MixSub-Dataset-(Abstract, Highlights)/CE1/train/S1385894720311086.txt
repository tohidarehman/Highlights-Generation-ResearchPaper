 After cow manure undergoes anaerobic fermentation process it still contains several pollutants such as nitrogen phosphorus and organic matter . If not treated properly these pollutants would cause secondary pollution . Membrane aerated biofilm reactor has been widely used to handle the wastewater with high concentration contaminants . In this study MABR was utilized to treat the cow manure anaerobic fermentation effluence . In order to avoid incomplete biofilm being affected by high concentration of CMAFE a gradient dilution of CMAFE was employed . The removal rates of NH

@highlight MABR was employed to the treatment of CMAFE.
@highlight The gradual dilution was adopted to avoid the biofilm affected seriously CMAFE.
@highlight Inner and outer biofilm in MABR was investigated.
@highlight RDA was adopted to investigate the relationship among environmental variables bacteria and pollutants removal.
