 Phase change materials can store and release great amount of thermal energy during the phase change and thus have broad application prospects in thermal energy management waste heat recovery building energy conservation and other fields . However the before and after state changes of PCMs are often accompanied by liquid leakage thus severely limiting their application . Introducing supporting materials can solve this leakage problem but at the expense of phase change enthalpy and service life . Herein a novel comb like structural phase change composite with high latent heat was designed by using poly chain which tightly intertwines with a comb like structural phase change supporting material under induced dipole force due to structural compatibility . This material can achieve shape stability and obtain high phase change enthalpies . Furthermore the composite does not show phase separation due to the good compatibility and its phase change temperatures and enthalpies can be adjusted by regulating the content and molecular weight of the loaded PEG .
