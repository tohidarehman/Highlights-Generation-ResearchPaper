 Lithium metal is considered as the ultimate anode for next generation rechargeable batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity and low electrochemical potential . However the commercial application of lithium anode is hampered by its dendritic growth during the charging process resulted from the unstable lithium electrolyte interface . Herein we demonstrate the formation of a hybrid protective layer consists of Li

@highlight The hybrid artificial protective layer is fabricated by a facile method.
@highlight Uniform plating of modified Li is confirmed by
@highlight optical microscopy study.
@highlight The modified Li anode realizes long term stable cycling with minimal polarization.
@highlight The modified anode exhibits much improved performance in full battery.
