 A chitosanboehmite film with excellent acid resistance for effective Pb removal was successfully synthesized via a facile solgel method . The composite corresponding boehmite and CS films were characterized by XRD ATR FT IR TG SEM and XPS . The static adsorption experiment showed that their adsorption well matched the pseudo second order model on chemisorption adsorption and the modified Langmuir model on homogenously surface for monolayer adsorption . Especially the composite film with cross linking mass ratio of 1 1 did not dissolve after shaking in an acidic solution of pH

@highlight CSboehmite film was prepared via cross linking of the boehmite and chitosan sols.
@highlight The film shows excellent acid resistance and adsorption affinity for Pb II .
@highlight Adsorption performance of the film was hardly affected by the coexisting cations.
@highlight Its adsorption mechanism mainly involved complexation and chemical precipitation.
