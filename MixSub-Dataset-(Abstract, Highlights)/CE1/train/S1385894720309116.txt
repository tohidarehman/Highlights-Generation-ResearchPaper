 Fabrication of functional superhydrophobic materials with stimuli responsive driving ability for the growing fields such as electric switch and liquid manipulation still remains mysterious and challenging . In this work a stimuli responsive superhydrophobic film is fabricated by integrating a bottom porous poly layer a sandwiched cross linkable poly layer and a top carbon

@highlight A novel stimuli responsive superhydrophobic film driven by solvent is reported.
@highlight The SSF exhibits fast large scale reliable bending actuation for the swelling discrepancy.
@highlight The SSF is successfully applied in biomimetic device electric switch and water manipulation.
@highlight The SSF based actuators can stably work even under wet and humid conditions.
