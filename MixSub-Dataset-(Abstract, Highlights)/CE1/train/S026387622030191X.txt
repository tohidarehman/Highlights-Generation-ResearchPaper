 Remediation of toxic hazardous substances from wastewaters using cost effective and influential adsorbents is very expedient outlook for particularly actual applications . With this respect a novel and efficient adsorbent was successfully synthesized by in situ interfacial polymerization of magnetite loaded palygorskite clay with poly . The adsorption performance of the synthesized PC g p in the uptake of hexavalent uranium ions was investigated in a batch system . The adsorbent was chemically and morphologically characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope Energy Dispersive X Ray Spectroscopy techniques . Factorial design analysis was applied to optimize the experimental parameters involved in U removal from aqueous solution . The adsorption isotherm was better modeled by non linear Langmuir model . The PC g p showed excellent removal performance with an adsorption capacity of 275.8
