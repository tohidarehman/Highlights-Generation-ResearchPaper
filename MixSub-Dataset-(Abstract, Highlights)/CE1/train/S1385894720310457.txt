 Multiphase flow in nanoporous media is ubiquitous in geophysics physical chemistry and bioengineering . The underlying mechanisms of two phase flow are of great importance in the prediction of water and oil flow in shale nanoporous media . In this work we use molecular dynamic simulations to investigate a laminar type oilwater two phase flow in quartz nanopores . We find that in nanochannels due to liquidliquid slip the enhancement in oil phase flow may not be neglected . As water film thickness and pore size increase such enhancement decreases gradually . According to MD results a new hydrodynamic flow model considering fluid distributions heterogeneous fluid properties liquid wall interaction and liquidliquid slip is proposed and compared to MD results and other hydrodynamic flow models . While previous hydrodynamic flow models generally underestimate oil phase flow in a laminar type OW2PF in quartz nanopores our model shows an excellent agreement with MD simulations for a wide range of pore sizes . Our work could shed some lights into flow mechanism of a laminar type OW2PF in nanoporous media and provide insights into flow modeling development in shale oil exploitation .
