 MgO CaO nanorods were synthesized using a diatomite substrate under the microwave irradiation . The synthesized composite exhibits well developed rod like morphology with 112.8m

@highlight MgO CaO composite of nanorod shape was synthesized as a basic heterogeneous catalyst.
@highlight It was used in the transesterification of castor oil by normal stirring and sonication mixing.
@highlight The best yield by normal mixing is 96.2 after 75min and 98.8 by sonication mixing after 60min.
@highlight The sonication mixing reduce greatly the time methanol content temperature and catalyst mass.
@highlight The catalyst is of high reusability and the products match the international standards.
