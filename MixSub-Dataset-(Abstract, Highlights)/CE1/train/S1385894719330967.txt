 Peroxymonosulfate based advanced oxidation processes are promising tools for wastewater treatment . However the production of high efficient PMS activator from low cost material still needs further improvement for practical application . Herein we reported a series of sludge derived biochar as catalysts for PMS activation and subsequent degradation of organic pollutants such as acid orange 7 rhodamine B methylene blue methyl orange and their combination . Chemical treatment e.g . NH

@highlight Sludge derived biochar was prepared by using various thermal chemical treatments.
@highlight As synthesized biochar used as a catalyst for PMS activation and organics oxidation.
@highlight The catalyst was efficient in degrading organic pollutants by PMS activation.
@highlight Non radical oxidation processes governed by pyridinic N was the dominant mechanism.
@highlight Pyrrolic N activated C and large surface area favor pollutants adsorption.
