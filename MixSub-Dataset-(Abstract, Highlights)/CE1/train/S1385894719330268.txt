 A distinctive catalyst R N Fe was synthesized by anchoring iron phthalocyanine covalently on chloromethylated polystyrene beads which were pre functionalized by 4 aminopyridine . Herein pyridyl groups grafted on resins act as the axial fifth ligands to coordinate with FePc molecules . The obtained catalyst was characterized using N

@highlight FePc molecules was successfully immobilized on polystyrene resins to obtain a bioinspired catalyst.
