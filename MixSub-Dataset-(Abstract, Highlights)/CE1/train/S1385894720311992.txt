 High energy density remains difficult to achieve using current lithium ion capacitors because of the mismatch of kinetics between the capacitor type cathode and battery type anode . To enhance the kinetic match a graphene aerogel supported LiNbO

@highlight A novel anode LiNbO
@highlight @GA is configured for LICs.
@highlight BCNNT cathode is successfully matched to the anode with enhanced kinetics.
@highlight The LIC exhibits excellent performance with high energy density of 148Whkg
@highlight Kinetics analyses provide insight into cation anion storage behaviors.
