 Fine manipulation of fluid flows at the microscale has a tremendous impact on mass transport phenomena of chemical and biological processes inside microfluidic platforms . Fluid mixing in the laminar flow regime at low Reynolds number is poorly effective due to the inherently slow diffusive mechanism . As a strategy to enhance mixing and prompt mass transport here we focus on polyelectrolyte multilayer capsules embodying a catalytic polyoxometalate as microobjects to create elastic turbulence and as micromotors to generate chaotic flows by fuel fed propulsions .
