 In the paper Purolite S957 was used to determine the most effective conditions for the separation of La and Ni ions from acidic solutions . Preliminary studies of the sorption of La Ce Nd Fe Ni Co Cu and Zn mixture were carried out . The sorption process efficiency depends on the HNO

@highlight Sorption abilities of Purolite S957 towards rare earth and heavy metals especially La III and Ni II ions were studied.
@highlight ATR FT IR Raman and XPS spectroscopy were applied for characterizing metal binding.
@highlight Kinetic and isotherm parameters were determined for La III and Ni II recovery.
@highlight Thermodynamic and desorption studies were also presented.
@highlight The research shows high potential of ion exchanger in the recovery of rare earth elements from waste solutions.
