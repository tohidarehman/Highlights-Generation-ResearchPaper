 A Rotating Microchannel Extractor is described in this work . To evaluate accurately the working capability of the RME extraction of chromium from aqueous phase to an organic phase is selected as the experiment system . At low flow rate the effect of microextraction in RME is the same as conducting 7.3 stage cross flow batch extraction which is higher than the reported results . Various factors such as the width of fluid region number of vertical stripes on inner rotor rotational inner rotor speed and volumetric flow rate that could change the extraction efficiency and volumetric mass transfer coefficient

@highlight A rotating inner rotor is introduced into the microchannel to generate turbulence.
@highlight The centrifugal force and interfacial tension can avoid emulsification.
@highlight The extraction in the RME has the same effect as 7.3 stage cross flow extractions.
@highlight Volumetric mass transfer coefficient in RME is higher than conventional ones.
