 Bacterial reproduction in fabric has been a threat to human health for centuries . Although several self cleaning fabrics have been tried serious drawbacks such as complex manufacturing high price and low durability seriously limit their applications . Herein a functional composite fabric composed by polyacrylonitrile and polymer carbon nitride was prepared by facile electrospinning and high pressure steam methods . This PAN PCN fabrics not only show filtration capacity as high as that of commercial filters but also exhibits outstanding photocatalytic disinfection performance .

@highlight Polymeric carbon nitride nanosheets were loaded on polyacrylonitrile fabrics.
@highlight The functional fabrics were efficient for water filtration and disinfection.
@highlight The fabrics were easy separated from water avoiding photocatalyst residue.
@highlight The portable fabrics were promising to achieve clean water outdoor.
