 It is of great significance to develop versatile and cost effective point of care testing systems for simultaneous quantitation of multiple analytes on site . This work reports on 1 the customized electrodes which exhibit good analytical performance for simultaneous detection of Cd

@highlight A quantitative POCT system is developed for simultaneous detection of multiple metal ions.
@highlight The system consists of a hand held electrochemical analyzer a smartphone and a customized SPCE.
@highlight The customized SPCE was prepared by successive modification of SPCE with rGO the SMOF and PEI.
@highlight Smartphones installed with APP DHMI can realize two way communication with electrochemical analyzer.
@highlight Quantitation results of this POCT system correlate well with ICP MS measurements.
