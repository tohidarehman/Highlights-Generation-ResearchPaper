 Although graphene oxide is widely used as an antibacterial agent its efficacy still needs to be improved . In this work we present a novel medical dressing that improves antibacterial effect and promotes wound healing . Poly graphene oxide citicoline sodium lanthanum films were prepared by the solution intercalation method for usage in wound dressing applications . GO was modified by zwitterionic citicoline to improve the dispersibility of water based polymers while providing La

@highlight PVA GO CDPC La film was prepared by the solution intercalation method.
@highlight PVA GO CDPC La film could absorb wound exudate while keeping the wound moist and improved antibacterial properties.
@highlight PVA GO CDPC La film could be considered as a potential wound dressing material.
