 Permanganate based ISCO has been commonly utilized to remediate chlorinated ethenes DNAPLs but the treatment is seriously hindered by the formation of MnO

@highlight Organic chelators have low compatibility with permanganate.
@highlight Polyphosphate based chelators are more compatible with permanganate.
@highlight Pyrophosphoric acid stabilized Mn III and proactively retarded MnO
@highlight precipitation.
@highlight Stabilization of Mn III significantly improved permanganate delivery.
@highlight Oxidation efficiency of trichlorethene liquid was substantially increased.
