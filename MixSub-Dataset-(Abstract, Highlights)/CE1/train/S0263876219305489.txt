 Microwave chemistry applications have been investigated for more than three decades . Contrary to common cavity based microwave applicators the traveling wave microwave reactor has the potential to enable the process scale up a better coupling of microwave energy with microwave susceptible catalysts and consequently highly uniform microwave heating . In this work the engineering challenges entailed with the design of a traveling wave microwave waveguide are explained and appropriate solutions developed . A new traveling wave microwave reactor with a coaxial waveguide structure is presented . Simulation results show that there is no standing wave generated along the structure . Furthermore in order to keep the impedance matching and minimize the microwave reflections while the reactor is loaded with catalyst samples new reactors loading patterns are introduced . Simulation results showed that for the proposed method microwave susceptible catalytic fixed bed could interact more efficiently with microwave energy and produce a uniform heating profile .
