 Solid state supercapacitors hold great promise in the application in portable and wearable electronic devices due to their great progress in electrochemical performance and fabrication technique in recent years . However in consideration of increasingly harsh requirements toward electronic devices in miniaturization and operational security the management of thermal generation and dissipation in SSC devices which have been rarely considered at present are very worthwhile to be investigated . In this work flexible solid state supercapacitors are assembled by rationally designed electrodes which are fabricated layer by layer by using of an electrochemically exfoliated graphene nanosheet film a porous metallic Ni layer and a NiMnLDH pseudocapacitive material layer . The ultrathin NiMnLDH nanosheets and the porous metallic Ni layer ensure high electrochemical performance for the NiMnLDH Ni EG electrodes 2110.4 mF cm
