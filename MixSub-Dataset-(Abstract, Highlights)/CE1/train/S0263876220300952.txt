 Gaussian process regression is one of the most important data analytic tools in modelling processes . It has attracted increasing interest in chemical engineering applications due to its superior performance in dealing with complex modelling problems such as high dimensional and nonlinear data . However traditional GPR has the main limitation in that it considers an independent identically distributed noise at every sample point . Modern chemical processes typically have a more complex data structure and noise properties . The assumption of i.i.d . noise is not realistic . Thus there is a growing interest in solving a heteroscedastic noise problem that does not satisfy the i.i.d . condition . The most common heteroscedastic noise is the noise with varying variance . This paper proposes a novel machine learning variance prediction method to solve the heteroskedastic GPR problem . By considering not only the input dependent noise variance but also the input output dependent noise variance a regression model based on support vector regression and extreme learning machine method is proposed for both noise variance prediction and smoothing . Compared with the existing weighted Gaussian process regression of the literature the proposed method not only expands the use of W GPR but also improves the prediction performance of heteroscedastic GPR models . Finally the proposed algorithm is verified by two numerical examples and tested in a real polyester polymerization process . The results all demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach .
