 Structured catalyst supports and structured reactors offer interesting features to address heat and mass transport challenges in catalytic processes . The present work addresses the unique role of so called interpenetrating periodic open cellular structures as a geometrically flexible system enabling

@highlight Investigation of a completely new class of catalyst support structures the interPOCS.
@highlight Geometrical characterization specific surface area and porosity of interPOCS.
@highlight Experimental investigation and modelling of pressure drop in interPOCS as a function of the structures offset.
@highlight Pressure drop can be changed by 45 via maximum offset change.
@highlight interPOCS offer
@highlight flow adjustment for dynamic and flexible continuous flow operations.
