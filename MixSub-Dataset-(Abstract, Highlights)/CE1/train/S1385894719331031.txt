 Formation of heterojunctions with other light absorbing semiconductors is one of the attractive approaches to realize efficient silicon based solar water splitting . As one of the promising candidates for heterojunction with silicon InAs compound semiconductor has two major advantages of narrow bandgap and high electron mobility . However the integration of Si with InAs is challenging due to several physical issues . Here we successfully demonstrate the integration of InAs nanowires and p Si via a catalyst free nanowire growth method . The presence of InAs NWs effectively improved the photoelectrochemical activities of the Si photocathode in neutral pH condition . The longer NWs are more advantageous for the proton reduction at the photoelectrode electrolyte interface since the InAs NWs act like a highway for photogenerated electrons due to their excellent electron mobility . The TiO
