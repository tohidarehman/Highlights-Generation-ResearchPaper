 In the present study the co pyrolysis of mahua seeds and waste thermocol blends was performed at 450600C . The obtained co pyrolysis oil was characterized for physicochemical properties and its suitability as an alternative fuel . The performance emission and combustion characteristics of six different CPO diesel blends were also assessed at various engine loads . The experimental results indicated a maximum pyrolysis oil yield of 99.6 for waste thermocol pyrolytic oil and 74.2 for CPO at 525C . The physicochemical characterization specified that CPO has a specific gravity kinematic viscosity and calorific value of 0.91mLg
