 Since the introduction of ionic liquids in 1914 there has been a growing interest in this class of materials because of their unique properties . Ionic liquids are organic salts melting below 100 C and are generally non volatile and nonflammable . By combination of different anions and cations a large number of ionic liquids can be synthesized . The extraordinary characteristics of ILs and the possibility of synthesizing large number of ILs make them as an appropriate medium for various chemical processes and applications . In this review first we give a brief overview on IL important physical properties and then we look into different IL applications considering recent studies and findings and the future prospects of using IL in each application . This review gives a reader a complete knowledge about various ILs application all together . In addition it reveals the areas of application which will grow in future and can gain industrial importance . ILs applications in separation processes lignocelluloses pretreatment enhanced oil recovery biocatalytic reactions lubrication and electrochemistry are discussed .
