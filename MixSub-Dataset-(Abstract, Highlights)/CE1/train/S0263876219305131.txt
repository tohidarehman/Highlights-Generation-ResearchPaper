 A bench scale spouted fluidised bed reactor was used to investigate the combustion kinetics of pulverised woody biomass under air and oxy fuel atmospheres . Bed temperatures were in the range of 9231073

@highlight Air and oxy fuel combustion kinetics using pulverised woody biomass were investigated in a spouted fluidised bed reactor.
@highlight The spouted fluidised bed reactor results agreed well with a reaction controlled shrinking core model.
@highlight The reaction was approximately zeroth order with respect to O
@highlight concentration under both air and oxy fuel conditions.
@highlight Oxy fuel conditions increased the rate of combustion by 37.5 .
