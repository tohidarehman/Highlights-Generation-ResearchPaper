 To convert solar energy into storable chemical fuel hydrogen via water splitting it is highly required to develop efficient low cost and stable HER catalysts and systems . For practical application the HER catalysts can work in low alkaline or neutral reaction systems . However in these reaction systems water dissociation into proton is a rate determining step which can be overcome by loading metal oxide or hydroxides onto the HER catalysts . Ni

@highlight as a novel HER catalyst in alkaline system.
@highlight Intercalated borate enhances electro and photo catalytic HER activity and stability of the composite.
@highlight Interlayer borate improves proton transport from Ni OH 
@highlight to Ni B and stabilizes Ni OH 
@highlight This work provides new insights for design new composite HER catalysts at alkalinity.
