 The pH switchable UiO 66 were engineered via in situ amino acids doping for the highly selective adsorption of anionic dyes . Three AA doped samples i.e . UiO 66 V UiO 66 T and UiO 66 Y have fabricated hierarchical structure and endowed NH

@highlight pH switchable UiO 66s were fabricated via three amino acids.
@highlight Asymmetric carboxylic coordination expanded pore size with NH
@highlight surface in UiO 66.
@highlight UiO 66 Y realized 1.9 times higher adsorption uptake for SY than pristine sample.
@highlight UiO 66 Y exhibited 10 times higher selectivity 390 for SY MB than pristine one.
@highlight UiO 66 Y realizes self ad desorption for 6 consecutive recycling via pH switch.
