 A facilitated transport enantio separation mechanism was proposed in this study and verified with an enantio selective thin film composite membrane . The polysulfone membrane substrate was first fabricated at the optimized conditions and the chiral selector CD was then incorporated into the selective layer by mixing with the MPD monomer for interfacial polymerization . Racemic tryptophan was employed as the model selectant and inversed enantio selectivities 1.55 and 0.6 were observed from two different operation mode driven by concentration gradient and pressure gradient respectively . The facilitated transport separation mechanism was demonstrated by the concentration driven mode . The effects of other influencing factors including racemic feed concentration CD concentration and pressure were also investigated .

@highlight A facilitated transport mode is proposed for membrane enantio separation.
@highlight A thin film composite membrane is prepared to verify the proposed mechanism.
@highlight The reversed selectivity is obtained from the concentration and pressure driven separation modes.
