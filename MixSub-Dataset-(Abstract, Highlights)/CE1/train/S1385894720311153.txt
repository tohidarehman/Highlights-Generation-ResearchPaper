 Hierarchical anisotropic superparticles derived from the controlled assembly of individual plasmonic nanoparticles have been recognized as promising building blocks for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy nanosensors . Thus the protocols that precisely control the near field coupling of individual plasmonic nanoparticles and the diffusion of highly diluted analytes to the plasmonic surface are of great interests . Herein we have synthesized a series of aromatic amphiphilic block copolymers named as polyarylene ether nitrile containing a hydrophobic backbone of aromatic moieties with hydrophilic sulfonate carboxyl and cyano groups in the side chain . Next the surfactant stabilized water in oil reverse emulsion is constructed to induce the confined self assembly of amPEN leading to the formation of functional micro reactors for the
