 The design factors of fountain confined conical spouted beds have been assessed in order to determine their best combination for scaling up and enhancing fine particle retention . The results evidence that the length of the confiner and the height of the draft tube entrainment zone are the key design factors causing the highest entrainment reduction . Thus the optimum confiner length is within the range of 2 3 times the bed surface diameter and the desirable height of the entrainment zone is approximately 1 2 times the tube diameter . This study also concludes that the best system for attaining high stability with minimum elutriation is the one equipped with an open sided draft tube with an aperture ratio of around 20 .

@highlight The fountain confiner is essential for scaling up conical spouted beds.
@highlight The confiner length should be approximately 2 3 times the bed surface diameter.
@highlight As the confiner is longer particle entrainment is lower.
