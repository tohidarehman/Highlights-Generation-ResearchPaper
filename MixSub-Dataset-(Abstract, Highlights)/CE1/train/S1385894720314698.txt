 Multifunctional ceramic membranes have evolved to be among the most promising means of removing refractory organic pollutants . The aims of this study were to develop a ceramic membrane by coating iron oxychloride via a coupling agent and to evaluate its potential photocatalytic activation and antifouling performance . Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy spectra of the photo Fenton membrane revealed the successful incorporation of FeOCl in the materials developed . The reaction kinetics degradation mechanism antifouling performance and stability of the membrane were thoroughly investigated using nitrobenzene as a model pollutant . The experimental results showed that the degradation rate of NB and antifouling ability of the membrane significantly enhanced due to the photo Fenton reaction on the surface of the membrane . From quenching experiments we determined that the main reactive species produced in the coupling system were hydroxyl radicals
