 Gasliquid separation is widely used in various fields . And the centrifugal separator has been witnessed as a worldwide popularity owing to its small size and high efficiency . However the uncertainty of the inlet flow pattern limits the wide application of centrifugal separators . In this paper a new gasliquid separator combining gravity separation and centrifugal separation was proposed for complex and unstable two phase flow . In this study the performance of the separator under different liquid flow rates with wide gas volume fraction range from 5 to 90 was investigated experimentally and the phenomena occurred in the separator were also analyzed . The results show that the separator can keep high efficiency separation in multiple flow patterns as long as the liquid level in the downcomer is at a reasonable position . Meanwhile the lowest and highest allowed liquid levels were defined and measured by the pressure difference and a ruler . Furthermore the bubble column in the downcomer was analyzed .

@highlight A new gasliquid separator was proposed and its separation performance was test.
@highlight The separator keeps high efficiency facing the gas volume fraction range from 5 to 90 .
@highlight The allowed liquid levels were acquired when the separator kept high efficiency.
@highlight The change of the allowed liquid levels caused by the bubble column was discussed.
