 We proposed a HiGee fundamentally different from the present day HiGees . A separated two phase flow prevails in the proposed HiGee in contrast to an interpenetrated flow in other HiGees . It comprises of a rotating disc placed in the middle of two stationary discs which are enclosed in a casing . The liquid flows as a thin film on both sides of the rotating disc . The gas fed into the casing of the unit is in a converging spiral flow counter current to the liquid flow through the two narrow channels formed between the rotating disc and stationary discs . We validated the efficacy of the proposed HiGee .

@highlight Proposed a HiGee that differs fundamentally from present day HiGees.
@highlight Akin to spinning disk technology.
@highlight Separated two phase flow prevails against the interpenetrated flow in other HiGees.
@highlight For simple and heat integrated absorption and distillation systems.
