 Conductive structured catalysts offer significant potential for the intensification of gas solid catalytic processes owing to their enhanced heat transfer properties . A major drawback is the limited catalyst inventory . Recently packed foams were proposed to overcome the catalyst inventory limitation . The effectiveness of this concept was proven at lab scale for intensified reactors filled with small catalyst particles . When adopting commercial foams and industrial scale catalyst pellets however poor packing efficiencies are expected limiting the potential of this concept .
