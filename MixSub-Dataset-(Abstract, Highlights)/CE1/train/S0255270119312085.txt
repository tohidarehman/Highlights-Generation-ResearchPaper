 Separation of components of light cycle oil into aromatic rich and nonaromatic rich fractions is the essential step for upgrading LCO to produce benzene toluene xylene enriched fraction and high quality diesel . In this work extractive separation of model LCO which contains 70wt tetralin and 30wt dodecane was performed using deep eutectic solvent as the extractant and water as the anti extractant . Tetrabutylphosphonium bromide and levulic acid at a molar ratio of 1 4 was determined as the extractant due to its high and stable performance during extraction and regeneration processes . The liquid liquid equilibrium data of ternary systems involving TBPB LA were then experimentally determined and fitted using non random two liquid model . The continuous extraction process was simulated and optimized high mass purity and high recovery ratio were achieved .
