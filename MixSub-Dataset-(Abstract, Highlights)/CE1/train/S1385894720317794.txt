 Hg pollution to aqueous system poses hazardous effect to human health . The design of new adsorbent with enhanced adsorption selectivity and capacity is a great challenge for the decontamination of aqueous Hg . Herein Schiff base decorated PAMAM dendrimer magnetic Fe

@highlight Schiff base functionalized PAMAM dendrimer magnetic Fe
@highlight composite were synthesized.
@highlight The as prepared adsorbents exhibits excellent adsorption selectivity for Hg II .
@highlight The adsorbents display good reusability and can be reused for several cycles.
@highlight Adsorption mechanism was revealed based on experiment and DFT calculation.
