 Membrane reactors as promising technology for pursuing the Process Intensification Strategy in various chemical processes were reviewed in the field of steam reforming of methane and liquid hydrocarbons for sustainable hydrogen production . A summary of the advantages and disadvantages of each considered process was presented . Drawbacks and current issues of the traditional reactors in fuel processing processes which can be overcome using membrane reactors were also described .

@highlight The membrane reactors combine simultaneously reaction and H
@highlight separation.
@highlight Membrane reactors operate at milder conditions than the traditional reactors.
@highlight Pd based membrane reactors allow high grade H
@highlight recovery.
