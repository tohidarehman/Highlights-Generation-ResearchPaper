 Few layer of phosphorene is considered to be a promising sensing material due to its unique structure and extraordinary physiochemical properties . However further applications are extremely restricted due to chemical degradation of phosphorene nanosheets in ambient oxygen and moisture . Here we prepared anthraquinone nanowire decorated phosphorene through anti solvent crystallization of AQ during liquid exfoliation of black phosphorus and demonstrated that the sensing stability of AQNW P significantly improved compared with bare phosphorene . Interestingly a remarkable sensitivity increase was observed for AQNW P during aging . An enhancement mechanism for the sensitivity increase based on oxygen defects was proposed and further validated by the experimental characterization of the surface chemical state . The sensing performance of AQNW P was experimentally investigated and compared with that of bare P and other widely investigated two dimensional materials including graphene and MXene and the results demonstrated that AQNW P is superior in all aspects including sensitivity selectivity and sensing speed . These findings could guide future exploration in extending the stability of phosphorene based sensing platform and provide a comprehensive understanding of the sensing behavior of phosphorene or its derivative onto aging .
