 The conventional polymers are non degradable and exhibit many hazardous effects on the environment . Due to their bio incompatibility and accumulation in nature there is a need to produce environment friendly biodegradable polymers . Polyhydroxybutyrate is one of the biodegradable biopolymers produced by a microorganism
