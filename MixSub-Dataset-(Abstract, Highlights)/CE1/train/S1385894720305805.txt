 Flexible and efficient electromagnetic interference shielding materials are urgently needed to satisfy the requirements for electromagnetic protection with the rapid popularization of wearable and the second generation of flexible electronic technology . Herein lightweight and flexible silicone rubber silver plated hollow glass microspheres EMI shielding composite foam with gradient structure was prepared through supercritical carbon dioxide scCO

@highlight Lightweight and flexible silicone rubber foams with gradient structure were firstly prepared.
@highlight The shielding network of composite foam was enhanced through density induced effect.
@highlight The conductivity of the composite foam can reach up to 279.3 S m at 0.51vol Ag.
@highlight The composite foam displays an EMI SE of 30.5dB at thickness of only 0.7mm.
@highlight The silicon rubber foams present excellent EMI SE stability after 1000 bending.
