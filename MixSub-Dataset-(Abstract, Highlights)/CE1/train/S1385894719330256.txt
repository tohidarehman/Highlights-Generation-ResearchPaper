 Adsorption using monolithic adsorbents is an attractive emerging technology for water treatment but it still remains a great challenge to facilely combine microscopically a well developed surface functionality with a macroscopic architecture . In this work we reported a simple low cost and effective method for constructing uniform coating of crosslinked polyethyleneimine on monolithic melamine sponge through pre modification with polydopamine followed by a rotary evaporation driven crosslinkingsurface deposition process . Due to the amine groups rich surface and highly open porous structure the resulting monolithic adsorbent

@highlight Crosslinked polyethyleneimines were nearly perfectly coated on melamine sponge.
@highlight The present method was simple cost saving and suitable for scalable production.
@highlight The resulting
@highlight  MS exhibited excellent structural flexibility and stability.
@highlight  MS was highly efficient for batch and column adsorption of Pb II and AR18.
@highlight  MS was a reusable adsorbent and the adsorption mechanism was elucidated.
