 Using solid biomass wastes as feedstocks for industrial generation of renewable energy is appealing to meet company s energy demands with environmental awareness however maintain continuous feeding of wastes to reactors remains a challenge in processing . In this study the performance of a non mechanical spouted bed feeder was evaluated for handling dry and moist spent coffee ground powders to a circulating fluidized bed reactor . A comprehensive experimental study was carried out to investigate the effects of operating variables and air inlet nozzle configuration on the solids circulation rates and pressure profiles . Using a convergent nozzle at the air inlet improved feeding stability compared to a conventional orifice air inlet . The circulation rates could be varied from 3.0

@highlight Stable powder feeding was attained with a non mechanical spouted bed SB device.
@highlight Effects of operating variables inlet configuration on SB performance were evaluated.
@highlight Feeder performance was affected by powders flowability attributes.
@highlight Solids circulation rate could be monitored through simple pressure measurements.
@highlight SB was a more flexible feeder for handling waste biomass powders than L valve.
