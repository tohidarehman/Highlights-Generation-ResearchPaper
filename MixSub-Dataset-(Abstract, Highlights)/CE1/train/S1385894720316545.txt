 Triboelectric nanogenerator is a novel energy harvester technology which attracted a great deal of attention in the area of self powering electronic devices due to its high output power density . In this investigation zinc oxide nanowires were incorporated into the electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride and nylon 11 nanofibers to construct new TENGs based on PVDF ZnO NWs nylon ZnO NWs . This study showed that ZnO NWs were aligned along the fiber axis during electrospinning . The cooperative and mutual alignment of polymer chains with ZnO NWs were also achieved in the fibers because of electrospinning which promoted formation of the highly polar crystalline

@highlight A new TENGs based on PVDF ZnO NWs nylon ZnO NWs was constructed with highly polar crystalline phase by electrospinning.
@highlight The maximum power density of ZnO NWs incorporated PVDF nylon 11 triboelectric nanogenerator reached as high as 3.0W m
@highlight A potent and sustainable power source for portable electronic devices was demonstrated.
