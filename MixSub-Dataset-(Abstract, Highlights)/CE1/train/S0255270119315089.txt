 This study focusses on the regeneration of spent activated carbon sourced from a wastewater treatment facility using both conventional and microwave reactors with similar reaction parameters . The active carbon was characterized by iodine and methylene blue adsorption as a measure of micro and mesoporosity . The process parameters were adjusted to identify the influence of intensifying operating parameter on the effectiveness of the regeneration process . Optimal activity was observed in the sample regenerated at 600C for 2h in CO

@highlight Microwave heating enhanced porosity restoration in spent active carbon.
@highlight Partial gasification of spent active carbon enhanced adsorbates removal from active sites.
@highlight Optimal regeneration was detected in microwave reactors under CO
@highlight atmosphere.
@highlight Inert atmosphere promoted blockage of pores by pyrolysed adsorbates hindering regeneration.
