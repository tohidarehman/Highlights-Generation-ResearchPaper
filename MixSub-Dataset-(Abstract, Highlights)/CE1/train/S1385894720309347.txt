 Traditional solid state fermentation processes can give fluctuating product quality and quantity due to difficulties in control and scale up . This paper describes an engineering study of an industrial scale anaerobic solid state fermentation process for Chinese liquor

@highlight Mathematical models can describe the industrial anaerobic solid state fermentation.
@highlight The models describe product concentrations and predict temperature.
@highlight The models predict overheating in large fermenters and at higher soil temperatures.
@highlight Our findings can be useful to improve traditional anaerobic solid state fermentations.
