 Developing efficient nonprecious metal electrocatalysts is urgently needed to promote the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction . Transition metals based layered double hydroxides have been considered as highly active OER catalysts while low conductivity and limited active site exposures hinder their further applications . Herein CoNi LDH Ti

@highlight CoNi LDH Ti
@highlight is obtained by using Ti
@highlight  NF as support to load CoNi LDH via electrodeposition.
@highlight CoNi LDH Ti
@highlight displays prominent OER activity and durability in alkaline electrolyte.
@highlight Binding strength of intermediates is optimized by strong interaction of CoNi LDH and Ti
