 It will be interesting and yet challenging to develop a near infrared laser trigger phototheranostics agent for multimodal imaging guided synergistic phototherapy . In addition the mechanisms of phototheranostics agent or in combination with NIR for tumor therapy remain unclear . Herein we fabricate porous Co

@highlight The pCo
@highlight NPs are fabricated using a hydrothermal process followed by calcination treatment.

@highlight NPs have a potential to be MR PA imaging agents.
@highlight The pCo
@highlight NPs demonstrate synergistic photothermal photodynamic therapy of tumor without obvious side effects.
@highlight The pCo
@highlight NPs can suppress tumor metastasis via inhibiting EMT pathway.
@highlight The pCo
@highlight NPs NIR can kill tumor cells via inducing DNA damage.
