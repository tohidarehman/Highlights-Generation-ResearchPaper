 Here we describe the development and testing of a hybrid system that combines microbial electrolysis and reverse electrodialysis to benefit energy production from seawater . A tubular continuous flow microbial electrolysis cell was used prior to RED to remove multivalent ions Ca

@highlight An MEC was integrated into RED for energy producing seawater pretreatment.
@highlight A hybrid MEC RED process harvested energy in the forms of hydrogen and electricity.
@highlight A tubular continuous MEC removed Ca
@highlight and Mg
@highlight with efficiencies of 84 and 99 .
@highlight 26 more power was produced with pretreated seawater compared to untreated seawater.
