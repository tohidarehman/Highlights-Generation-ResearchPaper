 The most critical bottleneck of Si anode materials is an inevitable cracking and pulverization of Si nanostructure during electrochemical cycling process resulting in a significant loss of electrical contact and rapid capacity fading . The low temperature thermolytic grafting process at 360400C was employed to produce a conformal carbon coating on a bundle like porous silicon prepared by silver assisted chemical etching . During the thermolytic grafting process polystyrene infiltrated in the por Si was depolymerized into styrenic carbon fragments rich of phenyl moieties . The styrenic carbon fragments were subsequently grafted uniformly on the por Si surface as an ultrathin carbonaceous film of 5nm which was confirmed by transmission electronic microscope X ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy . The polystyrene grafted por Si

@highlight Styrenic carbon fragments were grafted on the porous silicon por Si particles via thermolysis of polystyrene.
@highlight The Si C grafted species rich of phenyl moieties were uniformly coated on the por Si surface.
@highlight Ultrathin carbonaceous coating prevents the rapid pulverization of Si nanostructure as a strong passivation layer.
@highlight Thermolytically grafted por Si plays as an excellent lithium storage anode material.
