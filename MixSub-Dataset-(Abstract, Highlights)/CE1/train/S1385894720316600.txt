 Designing and exploring a simple novel and smart synthetic concept to fabricate highly efficient and dual function electrode material at an optimum cost for green energy harvesters has been a long standing challenge . Herein for the first time we investigated a simple and smart concept to fabricate dual function vapor solid phase grown copper oxide nanowires Cu

@highlight A smart synthetic concept was employed to fabricate the CuOx
@highlight electrode.
@highlight The resulting CuOx
@highlight electrode exhibits a specific capacity of 331.6mAh g.
@highlight An asymmetric device shows a high energy density of 49.8wh kg.
@highlight The CuOx
@highlight electrode exhibits high catalytic activity for OER.
