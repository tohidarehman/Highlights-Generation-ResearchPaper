 The reaction mechanisms for liquid glycerol decomposition in the presence of cold plasma were studied experimentally and mathematically . Glycerol decomposition primarily proceeds via two routes dehydration to acetol and cracking to methanol cation radicals and glycolaldehyde . In a N

@highlight Glycerol deoxygenation is initiated by radicals in the presence of highly energetic electrons.
@highlight Product distribution is turntable by changing carrier gas and plasma power.
@highlight Rapid conversion of glycerol within seconds at atmospheric conditions.
@highlight The process can be successfully modelled using a kinetic model under both carrier gases with a high degree of accuracy.
