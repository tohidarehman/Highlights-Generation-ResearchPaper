 The phase equilibria of hydrate are necessary to study the gas control production from marine sediments . Considering the abundance of chloride salts in the ocean the phase equilibrium conditions of CH

@highlight Equilibrium data of CH
@highlight hydrate in chloride salt solutions are detected by the isochoric method.
@highlight The Chen Guo model coupled with Hu Lee Sum correlation are used for hydrate prediction.
@highlight The reliability of the experimental data is validated by three thermodynamic consistency criteria.
@highlight The proposed model is successfully verified by the experimental data.
