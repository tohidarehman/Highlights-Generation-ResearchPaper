 Recently biochar has been frequently used to degrade organic contaminants in advanced oxidation processes . In this study Mn doped magnetic biochar was prepared to activate persulfate for the degradation of tetracycline . The activation of PS by MMBC was affected by the doping amount of Mn pyrolysis temperature and residence time . The degree of defects and the formation of metal oxides of MMBC were mainly affected by the pyrolysis temperature . The removal efficiency of TC reached 93 which was much higher than that of the original BC . Electron spin resonance and quenching results showed that SO
