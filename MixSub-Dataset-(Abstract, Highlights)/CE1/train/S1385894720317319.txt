 In this study kinetic behavior of sulfamethoxazole degradation in Fe tetrapolyphosphate Air system was investigated which was susceptible to Fe dosage Fe TPP molar ratio and pH value . Intermediate

@highlight Oxygen activation induced by Fe II was greatly enhanced by tetrapolyphosphate.
@highlight and H
@highlight were the key precursors responsible for the production of
@highlight OH.
@highlight The dominant oxidant was
@highlight OH but not Fe IV based on multiple lines of evidence.
@highlight A mechanism based kinetic model was developed.
@highlight Pollutants removal and rate constants of key reactions were predicted by the model.
