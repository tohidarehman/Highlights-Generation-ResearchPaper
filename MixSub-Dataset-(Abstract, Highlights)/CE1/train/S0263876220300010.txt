 Biorefineries are meant to play a key role as regards both the complementation of energy sources and the integral exploitation of biomass . Wood residues left over from industrialisation have a high potential to obtain numerous bio based products . The aim of this work was to obtain high quality and high purity lignin as well as a solid product rich in carbohydrates with not more than 10 ODW of the remaining acid insoluble lignin . To achieve this goal a soda ethanosolv process was optimised for the delignification of washed black carob tree sawdust using a central composite experimental design afterwards the time of reaction was adjusted . The optimum process and 58 42 EtOH H

@highlight Delignification of washed black carob tree sawdust was optimized.
@highlight Mild ethanosolv process additivated with soda Soda ethanosolv process was used.
@highlight The reaction time was adjusted to achieve a delignification of WBCTS less than 10 ODW.
@highlight Optimal delignification point was 19.9 NaOH 58 42 ethanol water proportion during 80 min.
@highlight Pretreated solid rich in carbohydrates and high quality lignin were obtained.
