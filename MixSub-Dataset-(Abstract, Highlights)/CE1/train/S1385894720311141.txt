 Metallic lithium is considered as the optimal anode material for the high energydensity rechargeable lithium based battery . However the commercial application of Li metal anode is plagued by uncontrollable dendrites growth and unstable SEI layer derived from the nonuniform nucleation and undesired deposition process . Herein a hybrid 3D porous Ni foam current collector decorated by nanostructured lithiophilic layer of interconnected NiF

@highlight NiF
@highlight @Ni foam was prepared via a succinct fluorination strategy.
@highlight LiF enriched SEI layer can be in situ formed through the reaction between NiF
@highlight and Li .
@highlight @NF composite anodes exhibit excellent stability in both symmetry battery and full cell.
