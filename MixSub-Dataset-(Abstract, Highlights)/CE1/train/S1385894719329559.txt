 Pseudo capacitive materials have attracted great attention as electrode materials for supercapacitor owing to their high specific capacitance high energy densities and high rate capability . However performances of pseudo capacitive materials as transparent flexible supercapacitors are limited due to their non transparent characteristics and brittleness in nature . Herein we report a scalable low cost and opto electrochemical tunable high performance core shell Co
