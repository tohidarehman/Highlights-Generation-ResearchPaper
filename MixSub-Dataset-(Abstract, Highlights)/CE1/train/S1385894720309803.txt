 Among the novel system configurations that remove organic matter and nitrogen simultaneously the structured bed reactor with recirculation and intermittent aeration can be mentioned . Studies addressing the SBRRIA have shown high efficiency of organic matter and nitrogen removal as well as low sludge production . However operational parameters such as the recirculation rate intermittent aeration time and airflow are not fully established . Therefore this research aimed to evaluate the effect of these three parameters on the mixing characteristics of an SBRRIA adopting established hydrodynamic models also proposing a new flow model for the reactor . Hydrodynamic tests were performed using sodium chloride as a tracer and the variables were the recirculation rate intermittent aeration time and airflow . Results showed that the reactor presented a plug flow behavior when the aeration was turned off and behaved as a completely stirred reactor when the aeration was turned on . Traditional models were not sufficient to explain the flow of the SBRRIA resulting in the development of a simplified programming pseudo code to adequately represent the flow in the reactor . The tested airflow and recirculation rates did not affect the mixing behavior in the SBRRIA . These observations represent a significant advance in SBRRIA studies as they show that energy consumption could be optimized making the system even more advantageous by saving electrical energy up to 75 due to pumping .

@highlight The hydrodynamic characteristic of SBRRIA were tested.
@highlight The SBRRIA can operate without recirculation flow.
@highlight The intermittent aeration promotes mixture in the reactor.
@highlight The proposal of the new operational condition can save electrical energy.
