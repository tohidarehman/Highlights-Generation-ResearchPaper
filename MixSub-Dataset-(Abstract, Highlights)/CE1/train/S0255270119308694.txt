 Micro mixers due to their vast applications in different fields have been of great interest to the researchers in recent years . In this study a transient two dimensional solver was developed in the open source code OpenFOAM to simulate electrothermal effect in a micro mixer . Then as the first step the obtained mixing quality and fluid velocity of three different geometries with various electrode arrangements were compared . According to the results the micromixer with a trapezoidal chamber and a circular cavity has the highest mixing and pumping efficiency . Then in the selected micromixer the effect of different parameters was studied such as voltage electrode heating electrical conductivity and size of electrode installed on the cavity and channel . The results showed that in some phase differences increasing the voltage improves the quality of mixing and in others it has an inverse effect . In addition it is found that increasing size of electrodes in the cavity decreases the fluid velocity and increases the mixing quality . Finally by increasing voltage on different electrodes a remarkable micro mixer with a mixing quality of 99 and an average fluid velocity of 64 m s was obtained .

@highlight Trapezoidal chamber with circular cavity lead the best mixing and pumping quality.
@highlight Increasing voltage in some phase differences decreases the mixing quality.
@highlight Phase difference of type b lead to the highest quality of mixing and pumping.
@highlight By heating e2 electrodes considerable mixing quality and velocity can be achieved.
@highlight Longer electrode decreases the fluid velocity and increases the mixing quality.
