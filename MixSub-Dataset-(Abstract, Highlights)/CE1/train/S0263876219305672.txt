 A general theoretical framework for investigating the rheological behavior of powder undergoing electric current assisted consolidation is proposed in this work . The most relevant phenomena occurring during ECAS process are taken into account . Consolidating powders are assumed to behave as a viscous fluid . Specifically powder viscosity is expressed by the BirdCarreauYasudas model which includes the power law creep description typically adopted in the ECAS modeling literature . The proposed stress strain constitutive law allows one avoiding
