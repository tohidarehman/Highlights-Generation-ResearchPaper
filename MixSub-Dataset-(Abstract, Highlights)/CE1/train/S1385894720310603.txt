 The exploration of bifunctional catalysts to produce both hydrogen and oxygen will accelerate the progress of overall water splitting . This paper introduces a facile method to fabricate bifunctional photocatalysts toward the water splitting by doping nano CdS with S vacancies on

@highlight has both water reduction oxidation catalytic activities.
@highlight makes the S vacancy in CdS an effective electron trap.
@highlight Schottky junction acts as a pump for transfer of photo generated carriers.
@highlight p n junction of the catalyst reduce the recombination of electrons and holes.
@highlight The structure of catalyst extends the life of the photogenerated electrons and holes.
