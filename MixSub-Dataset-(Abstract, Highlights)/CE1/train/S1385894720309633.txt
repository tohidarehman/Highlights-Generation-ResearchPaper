 The excessive use of coumarins and their derivatives is becoming an ecological concern due to their toxicity towards different organisms . One of the possible ways of their removal is the advanced oxidation processes . The oxidative breakdown of 4 hydroxycoumarin and its two derivatives induced by a very powerful oxidizer hydroxyl radical HO

@highlight The hydrogen atom abstraction radical addition mechanism was examined.
@highlight The radical adduct formation followed by hydrogen atom abstraction was proposed.
@highlight The decomposition of coumarins induced by HO
@highlight was analyzed by EPR and DFT approach.
@highlight Rate constants of mentioned reactions were obtained by the Transition State Theory.
@highlight Ecotoxicity study showed that products were less toxic than analyzed coumarins.
