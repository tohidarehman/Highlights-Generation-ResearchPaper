 Depletion of phosphate ore is one of the important resource crises in the world . The exploration of the transfer regularity of mineral impurities to liquid in the digestion process of phosphate rock is of great significance to the production of agricultural fertilizer . In this paper the reaction kinetics experiments of iron and aluminum compounds in phosphate ore particles were carried out in the range of temperature 5070

@highlight Kinetic digestion experiments of Fe and Al mineral impurities of phosphate rock.
@highlight Novel negative temperature effect in the kinetic system below a critical point.
@highlight The mechanism cased by coupling of chemical reaction phase change and diffusion.
@highlight The theoretical model fitting experimental data satisfactorily.
@highlight Percolation transition under threshold in fractal structure.
