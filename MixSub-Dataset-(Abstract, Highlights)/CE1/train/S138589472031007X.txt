 2 Methylisoborneol a major cause of taste and odor in drinking water tends to combine with the coexisting dissolved organic matter resulting in the altering of the physico chemical properties of 2 MIB and its corresponding migration and removal behaviors during water treatment . In this study dialysis and ultrafiltration were set up to differentiate bound and free 2 MIB and the binding of different types of DOMs to 2 MIB was investigated . At 298K the Freundlich constants K

@highlight Binding of 2 MIB with five types of dissolved organic matter DOM was firstly studied.
@highlight Dialysis and ultrafiltration were set up and compared to differentiate bound and free 2 MIB.
@highlight The combination ability followed the order NOM HEL BSA CMC SA.
@highlight The binding mechanism was proposed based on thermodynamics models.
@highlight The major interactions of DOM and 2 MIB were mostly van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding.
