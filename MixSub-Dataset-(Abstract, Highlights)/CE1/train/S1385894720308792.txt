 Bacteria infected wounds and antibiotics abuse have become significant burdens to patients and medical systems . Thus designing a non antibiotic dependent multifunctional wound dressing for treating bacteria infected wounds is urgently desired . Herein a series of conductive self healing and adhesive nanocomposite hydrogels with a remarkable photothermal antibacterial property based on N carboxyethyl chitosan and benzaldehyde terminated Pluronic F127 carbon nanotubes were developed and their great potential as agents for photothermal therapy of infected wounds was demonstrated

@highlight A series of conductive adhesive self healing nanocomposite hydrogels were synthesized.
@highlight These hydrogels showed remarkable
@highlight photothermal antibacterial property.
@highlight The hydrogels exhibited good hemostatic property and biodegradability.
@highlight The hydrogels showed excellent treatment effect for infected wound via photothermal therapy.
