 The work aims to evaluate the sonophotocatalytic treatment as an intensification process for removing pollutants such as azo dyes from water and wastewater . Four photocatalysts were prepared TiO

@highlight The degradation of two azo dyes was intensified by the sonophotocatalytic process.
@highlight Ag graphene oxide TiO
@highlight systems were tested in the sonophotocatalytic process.
@highlight The highest intensification of the degradation was obtained using 1000 kHz and UV.
