 Developing an efficient earth abundant catalyst able to accelerate oxygen evolution reaction is crucial for realizing the scalable application of electrochemical water splitting . Spinel transition metal oxides represent a promising catalyst for this reaction but to data their catalytic performance is still further improved to satisfy the practical application . Being different from previous nanostructure engineering and hybridization strategy herein we reported an anion cation co substitution activation of CoMoO

@highlight An anion cation co substitution activation of CoMoO
@highlight for OER is developed.
@highlight The co substitution leads to the improvement of catalytic activity.
@highlight The co substituted catalyst can afford 10 mA cm
@highlight at an overpotential of 263 mV.
