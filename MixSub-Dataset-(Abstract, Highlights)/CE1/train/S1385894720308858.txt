 Lanthanide based supramolecular hydrogels are a new category of smart optical materials which are promising for applications in chemistry sensors bioimaging agents and light emitting devices . Herein we report a supramolecular hydrogel with tunable and responsive luminescence which is based on the assembly of Ln and deoxyguanosine . ESI TOF MS NMR FTIR PXRD and simulation results verify the formation of dG Ln hydrogels . dG Tb hydrogel emits strong green luminescence while dG Eu hydrogel is nonluminous when Tb is co doped into dG Eu surprisingly we find that co doped dG Tb Eu hydrogel displays tunable luminescence from green orange to red by simply regulating the stoichiometric ratio of Tb and Eu . A cascade luminescence resonance energy transfer mechanism is proposed in this co doped system which is confirmed by luminescence decay curves and emission spectra . Subsequently luminescence switch is designed based on reversible responsiveness of hydrogel upon Ag
