 Removal of persistent organic compounds from aqueous solutions is generally achieved using adsorbent like activated carbon but it suffers from limited adsorption capacity due to low surface area . This paper describes a pioneering work on the adsorption of an organic pollutant 2 chlorophenol by two MOFs with high surface area and water stability MIL 101 and its amino derivative MIL 101 NH

@highlight High surface area by MOFs is not an indication of high adsorption capacity.
@highlight Access of pollutant to available adsorption sites requires good interaction with the adsorbent.
@highlight Removal of 2 CP by MOF can be higher than activated carbon when subjected to repeated ethanol washing.
