 Well designed structures with sufficient electroactive sites are vital for pseudocapacitive materials to yield high performances . Herein we propose a facile electrochemical activation strategy to synthesize Ni Co oxyhydroxides nanoflowers decorated with N S co doped carbon fragments . The applied voltage can rapidly induce significant structural transformation of pristine Ni Co sulfides particles into Ni Co OOH nanoflowers . Moreover this evolution process endows the thin nanoflakes with abundant pores . Benefiting from the massively exposed active sites rich mixed valences of bimetals and high speed electron ion transport pathways the Ni Co OOH NSCF exhibits an excellent capacity of 237mAhg

@highlight A facile activation strategy realizes the phase and structural self reconstruction of transition metal materials.
