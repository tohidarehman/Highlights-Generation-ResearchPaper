 Metal free carbonaceous materials have increasingly attracted worldwide attention owing to their unprecedented properties in catalytic elimination of environmental pollutants in water . Nevertheless the surface functionality dependent catalytic efficacy and activation mechanism for ferrate Fe

@highlight Carbonaceous solid induced enhancement in oxidation of pharmaceuticals by ferrate.
@highlight Carbonyl groups at surfaces of hydrochar and graphene oxide involve in enhancement.
@highlight Magnitude of enhanced oxidation depends on moieties of micropollutant.
@highlight Increased amounts of generated Fe
@highlight  Fe
@highlight result in increased oxidation.
@highlight Hydrochar has superior reusability in activating Fe
@highlight to oxidize micropollutant.
