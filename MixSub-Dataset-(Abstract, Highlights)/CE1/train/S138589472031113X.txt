 Zwitterionic super hydrophilic polymers showed fascinating prospects because of their excellent biocompatibility and antifouling characteristics . However their commercial development and the application in different fields were limited by their tedious preparation process unsatisfactory reproducibility and performance . In this study a rapid fabrication approach based on a sole monomer system ethyl

@highlight Zwitterionic super hydrophilic polymer is rapid fabrication via sole monomer system.
@highlight The preparation strategy turns out to be very simple time saving and reproducible.
@highlight The polymer combines the advantages of phospholipid layer and hydrophilic material.
@highlight It exhibits excellent enrichment capacity for
@highlight  glycopeptides or C reactive protein.
@highlight Binding sites of the polymer and C reactive protein are explore for the first time.
