 The electrochemical properties of graphene based supercapacitor electrode materials are closely related to their architecture and chemical nature . Herein the siloxene reduced graphene oxide composite hydrogel with modified three dimensional hierarchical architecture and increased oxygen containing functional groups are developed via intercalating small amount of layered siloxene between the reduced graphene oxide sheets by a one step hydrothermal process . Siloxene serves as the spacers to form a three dimensional structure with graphene resulting in increased specific surface area . More importantly siloxene is used to modify the surface chemical nature of graphene sheets by introducing additional oxygen containing functional groups . The abundant oxygen containing functional groups on SGH contribute to the pseudocapacitance and improve the wettability . Consequently the proposed SGH exhibits a high specific capacitance of 520 F g
