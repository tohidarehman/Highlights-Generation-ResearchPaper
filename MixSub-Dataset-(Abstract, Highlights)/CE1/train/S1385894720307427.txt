 Photocatalysis refers to an environmental friendly technology it is capable of converting scattered and intermittent solar energy into hydrogen energy exhibiting high energy density . CdS acts as a prominent photocatalyst . For its obstinate photocorrosion however the application of CdS in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions has been severely limited . In the present study it was reported for the first time that by coating a Zn anchored carbon layer on CdS

@highlight CdS modified by a Zn anchored carbon layer was firstly synthesized.
@highlight Obtained materials work as outstanding photocatalyst for H
@highlight production.
@highlight Zn containing carbon layer improves the separation efficiency and transfer rate of photogenic carriers on the surface of CdS.
@highlight Obtained materials may provide potential candidate for PEC and other promising applications.
