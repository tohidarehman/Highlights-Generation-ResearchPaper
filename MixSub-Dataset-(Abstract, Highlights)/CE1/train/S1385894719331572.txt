 In the present study we developed an intelligent coating for the corrosion protection of mild steel . A novel hybrid hydrogel of

@highlight A novel hybrid hydrogel of
@highlight  PEI was synthesized by one pot synthesis method.
@highlight The releasing rate of
@highlight  PEI rises upon external pH values due to its pH sensitivity.
@highlight The smart coating based on
@highlight  PEI can provide strong corrosion protection.
