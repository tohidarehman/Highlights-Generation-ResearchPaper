 All solid state lithium sulfur batteries show increasing potential for practical applications in portable electronic devices and electric vehicles due to their high energy density low cost and environmental friendliness . However the large interface impedance of solid state lithium sulfur batteries leads to low capacity and short cycle life . In this study a hierarchical design of sandwiched NASICON type Li

@highlight High performance sandwich structured SPE LATP SPE electrolyte was prepared.
@highlight SPAN anode was successfully applied to all solid state lithium sulfur batteries.
@highlight The SPAN SPE LATP SPE Li batteries exhibited excellent electrochemical performance.
@highlight Interface reaction between LATP and lithium anode was suppressed.
