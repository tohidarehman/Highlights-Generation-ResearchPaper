 This paper focuses on the conceptual design of a quenching system to separate the water produced in a glycerol based acrylic acid production process . In the glycerol based process acrylic acid is produced through fermentation and dehydration and a large amount of water is generated . Thus an effective way to separate water from acrylic acid is essential . We investigate a process scheme for quenching systems that separates the water generated from these reactions . The liquidliquid extraction process is applied to separate water for high purity acrylic acid production . The selection of the solvent in extraction process is important so we compared several representative solvents then results is that toluene is the most suitable solvent . As a result a conceptual design using toluene as a solvent was suggested and the proposed process using a quenching system to separate the water in two steps was investigated . The sensitivity analysis and economic assessment of the proposed process resulted in a 46.0 wt reduction in the total flowrate of the subsequent processes and reductions in the capital and operating costs by 52.0 and 39.3 respectively .

@highlight We present a process for effectively separating water from dehydration in the glycerol based acrylic acid production process.
@highlight The two step water separation process is proposed by using toluene as a solvent to the quenching system.
@highlight The proposed quenching system can reduce the total flowrate of the subsequent water separation process by removing water.
@highlight It can be verified through an economic assessment of capital and operating cost savings.
