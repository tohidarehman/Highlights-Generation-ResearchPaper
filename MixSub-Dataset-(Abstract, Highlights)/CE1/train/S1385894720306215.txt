 Exogenous insulin administration is still the most used treatment for diabetes however type 2 diabetes with the characteristics of insulin resistance accounts for the vast majority proportion of diabetic population which makes insulin function failure . Currently many efforts have been devoted to insulin delivery with nanomedicine means whereas the treatment of insulin resistance in T2D using nanotechnology strategy is rarely reported . In this study we transformed a plant derived natural insulin sensitizer into biocompatible nano transport system where the natural insulin sensitizer oleanolic acid was conjugated onto natural polymer polygalacturonic acid to form self assembled micelles as oral administrated nanomedcine for insulin resistance treatment in T2D .

@highlight An oral administrated nanomedicine for insulin resistance treatment was developed.
@highlight All components are derived from plants possessing low cost and biodegradability.
@highlight OA PGA OA can overcome gastrointestinal barriers and alleviate insulin resistance.
@highlight Molecular mechanism was mediated by promoting IRS 1 PI3K AKT signaling pathway.
