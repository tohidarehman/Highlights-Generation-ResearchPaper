 Gemcitabine an analogue of deoxycytidine has potent antitumor activities against various solid tumors and is an excellent radiosensitizer as well . However Gem has a very short half life making it difficult to achieve the long term synergies between chemotherapy and radiotherapy . Herein we developed a long acting Gem delivery system using a palmityl modified Gem derivative as the drug and an injectable and thermosensitive hydrogel as the vehicle and then combined with multiple radiation therapy for the synergistic treatment of tumors . The thermosensitive hydrogel that exhibited a temperature responsive solgel transition was composed of two poly

@highlight A long acting delivery system was developed based on Gem derivative and thermogel.
@highlight The sustained release of Gem played a dual role in chemoradiotherapy.
@highlight The delivery system achieved synergistically enhanced chemoradiotherapy effect.
