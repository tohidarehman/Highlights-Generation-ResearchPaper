 In situ chemical oxidation can be used to remediate soils contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons . However typical oxidation systems are limited by the acidic environment needed for Fenton reactions cost and soil effects of activated persulfate and large pores required for ozone or selected oxidation by permanganate . Chlorine dioxide ClO

@highlight The study investigates the removal of PAHs in contaminated soil using ClO
@highlight Increasing the ClO
@highlight concentration increases the PAH degradation rate.
@highlight The removal of PAHs was significantly decreased at higher soil pH values pH 7 .
@highlight Oxygenation ring rupture and Cl substitution products of PAHs were obtained.
@highlight Mechanism involves direct oxidation by ClO
@highlight and indirect oxidation by HOCl and
@highlight OH.
