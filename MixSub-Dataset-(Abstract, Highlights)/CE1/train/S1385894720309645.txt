 Vanadium and chromium co exist commonly with elevated levels in groundwater at vanadium smelting sites . While bioremediation has been recognized promising for this co contamination treatment in aquifer interactions during vanadium and chromium bio reductions under autotrophic condition remain largely unknown . In this study efficient reductions of V and Cr from synthetic groundwater were realized simultaneously in a continuous flow autotrophic sulfur based biosystem with more than 85 overall removals under hydrochemical and hydrodynamic fluctuations during 276 d operation . Soluble Cr was reduced to insoluble Cr preferentially while reduction of soluble V to insoluble V was easily inhibited . Elemental sulfur was bio oxidized to sulfate . Analyses of carbon isotope microbial community and metabolic pathway revealed the synergetic mechanisms . Autotrophs e.g .

@highlight V V and Cr VI are simultaneously reduced in a autotrophic S 0 based biosystem.
@highlight Cr VI is reduced preferentially while reduction of V V is easily inhabited.
@highlight Reactive products of V V Cr VI and S 0 are V IV Cr III and sulfate in turn.
@highlight Carbon isotope and microbial analyses reveal the synergetic mechanisms.
