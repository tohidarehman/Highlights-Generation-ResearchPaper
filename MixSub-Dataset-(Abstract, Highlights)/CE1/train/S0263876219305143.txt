 This work demonstrates the suitability of spinach extract as a bio catalyser for the photo catalysed synthesis of silver nanoparticles on polyimide and polyetherimide and their suitability as a seed layer for the formation of conductive micro track after plating . The study reveals that the extract can accelerate the reaction rates of the photo patterning process by an order of magnitude when applied on materials for flexible electronics and 3D printing . The two main components of the extract that can act as photo catalysers chlorophylls and plasmatic salts have been individually studied by energy dispersive X rays UV Vis spectroscopy and X ray Diffraction . A simple and well defined method for extraction of chlorophyll A from fresh spinach at 120
