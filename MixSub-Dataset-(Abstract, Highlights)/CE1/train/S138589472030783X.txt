 The further development of the chemical looping air separation technology is hindered by the required high redox temperature . Improving the thermodynamic properties of oxides by elemental composition is an effective way to decrease the reduction temperature of oxygen carrier . In this paper a Cu Mn composite oxygen carrier was prepared by the addition of Mn

@highlight The Cu Mn composite oxygen carrier with relatively low reaction temperature is constructed.
@highlight The reactivity and oxygen transport capacity of this oxygen carrier are determined.
@highlight The thermodynamic data including
@highlight and
@highlight of the redox reaction are obtained.
@highlight The redox kinetic models of the Cu Mn composite oxygen carrier were established.
