 Volatile organic compounds have seriously affected the natural environment and human health and adsorption is one of the most effective method for controlling VOCs pollution . In this work the NH

@highlight The NH
@highlight HF
@highlight  etched NaY zeolite with intracrystalline mesoporosity was obtained.
@highlight The large size mesopores disappeared to form the surfactant templated mesopores.
@highlight The mechanism of the surfactant templating process was elucidated.
@highlight The intracrystalline mesoporosity efficiently adsorbed the toluene molecules.
