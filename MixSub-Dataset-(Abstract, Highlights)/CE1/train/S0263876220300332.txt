 In this work different tubular solid foam packed beds were experimentally investigated under air flow in order to determine the effective conductivity and wall to bed heat transfer coefficient . Several foam types with different material namely silicon carbide and alumina and cell density were tested . Foam samples were experimentally studied using different air flow rates and wall temperatures ranging between 200 and 500

@highlight Thermal performance of silicon carbide and alumina foams was experimentally studied.
@highlight Silicon carbide foams show a slightly better thermal performance than alumina foams.
@highlight For both foams radial heat transport is limited by the wall contact resistance.
@highlight A ChiltonColburn correlation was developed for the wall heat transfer coefficients.
@highlight Foam permeabilities were estimated from pressure drop data.
