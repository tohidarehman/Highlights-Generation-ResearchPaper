 Discharged tetracycline seriously threatens human health and environmental safety . Herein we developed a novel 3D flower on sheet structure of Zr metal organic framework adsorbent with the assistant of N S co doped carbon dots as heterogeneous nucleation for selective and effective removal of TC residue from contaminated water . Functional groups of UiO 67 NSC acts as a tentacle to identify TC molecules and TC adsorbed NSC can be separated easily by incorporating in UiO 67 structure . Hierarchical UiO 67 NSC exhibited excellent recognition performance with a wide sensitive range and low detection limit for TC . Particularly vertically oriented 2D nanosheets in UiO 67 NSC alleviate the diffusion barrier and enhance mass transfer between adsorption sites and TC molecules endowing it with an ability that can improve the TC adsorption capacity of parent UiO 67 to 427.35mg g. UiO 67 NSC with 0D structure has no significant toxic effect on human cells which demonstrate the prepared hybrid structure is safety in practical application . Our data indicate the great potential of UiO 67 NSC as an innocuous bifunctional smart adsorbent for the effective detection and removal of TC residues and we not only provide a rational design of advanced metal organic framework based hierarchical adsorbents but also shed light on an available method to toxic antibiotic residue recognition and water remediation .
