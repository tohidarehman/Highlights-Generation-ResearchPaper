 The present study aimed to propose a general model for absorption with a non elementary chemical reaction . The modeling of the system was conducted within the stagnant liquid film surrounding bubbles in the bubble column reactor . The finite difference method was used to solve the governing differential equations . The model was solved for the general reaction orders of components with a general boundary condition . Therefore it includes all kinetic regimes based on the film theory and is capable of predicting the absorption system with a complex reversible or irreversible chemical reaction . Further the effects of different parameters such as the equilibrium constant the concentration of components and chemical reaction orders on the absorption enhancement were investigated . The results indicated that the initial concentration and reaction order of components can significantly influence the absorption enhancement . Finally In order to validate the model the results were compared with those of the previous studies .
