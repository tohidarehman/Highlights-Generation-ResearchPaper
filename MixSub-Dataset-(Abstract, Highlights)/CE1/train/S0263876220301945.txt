 A water dispersible granule formulation is a dry solid formulation containing active ingredients intended to be diluted dispersed in water prior to application . If the co formulants are properly selected WGs typically have desirable physical and chemical stability . In addition storage and transport of dry formulations are inherently easier than liquid formulation types . WG formulations of agricultural products offer the added advantage of low dust and safer handling compared to wettable powders .

@highlight Dome and basket paste extrusion can influence final product characteristics.
@highlight Not all formulations can be extruded using both basket and dome techniques.
@highlight Formulation composition generally influences performance more than extrusion type.
@highlight The preferred extrusion method should be considered during formulation development.
