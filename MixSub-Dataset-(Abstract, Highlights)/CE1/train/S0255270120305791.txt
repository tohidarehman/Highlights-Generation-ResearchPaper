 The emissions of volatile organic compounds produced in many chemical and manufacturing sectors are strictly regulated . Regenerative thermal oxidizers which employ ceramic masses for heat recovery in a cyclic operation mode represent a promising technology enabling process intensification by providing both high efficiencies of VOC removal and energy savings . This study advances a modeling framework which combines a 1 D transient model with 3 D CFD simulations to assist the design of 3 canister RTOs focusing on the fluid dynamics thermal and chemical behavior at different instants within the operational cycles . The analysis shows how different inlet outlet purge configurations affect the efficiency of VOC removal which shows a minimum when the central canister is the outlet as corroborated by experimental data and the analysis of the gas residence time . Some critical conditions of flow and temperature uniformity are investigated showing that a random packing can be inserted underneath each monolithic block to ensure gas uniformity with only a limited increase in pressure drops . The approach and results reported point towards the establishment of robust criteria for RTO intensification .
