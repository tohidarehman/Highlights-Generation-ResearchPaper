 The direct synthesis of dimethyl ether from synthesis gas via methanol as an intermediate is a promising option for implementation of the Power to X concept involving the storage of renewable electrical energy via hydrogen or synthesis gas in synthetic fuels or chemicals . The STD reaction shifts the equilibrium conversion dictated by thermodynamics to higher values compared to methanol synthesis alone at given conditions . Notwithstanding proper catalyst materials and a suitable configuration have to be found that would support high CO conversion as well as high DME selectivity . In this work different catalyst configurations obtained by combining CuO ZnO Al

@highlight Particulate and planar catalyst configurations are modelled for the STD reaction.
@highlight A crystallite pore network model is adapted to describe the catalytic configurations.
@highlight For the different configurations the accordant optimum catalyst ratio is presented.
@highlight Porosity in structured catalysts strongly effects CO conversion and DME selectivity.
@highlight Best performance by hybrid configurations of close proximity and planar double layer.
