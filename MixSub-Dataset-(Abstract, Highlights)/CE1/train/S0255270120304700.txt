 Particle design in recent years has attempted to overcome solubility limitations in drug development . In this work the particle microstructures of itraconazole were designed by a supercritical anti solvent process with or without hydroxypropyl methylcellulose as the dispersing material where the processing microstructure solubility relationship was investigated . The results showed that ITZ particles with different shapes and crystal forms were obtained which enhanced the ITZ solubility from 4.4g mL to 108.5g mL . For the optimal sample ITZ crystal transformed into amorphous state resulting in high solubility and fast dissolution rate . Moreover hydrogen bond interaction was formed between HPMC and ITZ which could hinder the recrystallization of dissolved ITZ resulting in its complete dissolution . Also the production efficiency was increased to 38.5mg ITZ min which laid a foundation for the scale up . These results show the great potential of SAS process on the particle design of poorly soluble drugs for solubility enhancement .
