 This paper addresses the current lack of a scalable process for the extraction of hairy pectins to upcycle biomasses by describing the design methodology building and testing of a continuous microwave assisted process for potato waste pectin extraction . Hairy pectins have been shown to present prebiotic activity . Conventional pectin extraction methods are not suitable to produce them as they lead to degradation of hairy regions in part due to long heating times . Microwave heating is considered an alternative due to its selective and rapid heating . The 2kW single mode system developed in this study achieved good temperature control of 2.5C and a stable target temperature in 1 min processing time at a feed flow rate of 250mLmin

@highlight A scalable continuous and green hairy pectin extraction process developed.
@highlight Microwave Assisted Extraction successfully implemented in continuous operation.
@highlight Improved starch reduction achieved by sieving procedure.
