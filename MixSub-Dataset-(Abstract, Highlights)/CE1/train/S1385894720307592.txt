 The continuous release of antibiotics in soil environment poses a serious threat for soil and water quality and consequently human health . However research efforts focused on the effective remediation of antibiotic polluted soil are still very limited . In this study a nanosecond pulsed dielectric barrier discharge plasma system was used for the first time to remediate soil contaminated by ciprofloxacin which is one of the most widely used persistent and genotoxic antibiotics . Various cold atmospheric plasma operating parameters were investigated and optimized . The optimal moisture content and air flow rate were determined at 5 and 1.0 L min

@highlight Nanosecond pulsed DBD was used for the first time to degrade ciprofloxacin in soil.
@highlight Very fast and complete degradation of ciprofloxacin in soil by nsp DBD plasma.
@highlight Significantly high energy efficiency of nsp DBD for soil remediation.
@highlight Degradation pathway of ciprofloxacin was consistent with singlet oxygen involvement.
@highlight DBD based degradation of ciprofloxacin in soil imitates its in vivo metabolic profile.
