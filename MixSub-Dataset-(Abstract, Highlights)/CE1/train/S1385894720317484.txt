 As extracellular matrix mimics dynamic biointerfaces with reversible ligand presentation have shown great significance in the field of biology and medicine . However current systems are trapped in the monotony of bioactivity which makes it hard to mimic the multipotential of natural ECM . In this work we reported a dynamic biomaterial interface with optional and diversified bioactivities by the combination of reversible catechol boronate and bioorthogonal click chemistry . Due to the specificity and thoroughness of bioorthogonal reaction different types of biomolecules including small molecular saccharide macromolecular peptides and DNA aptamers could be on demand and reversible binding on biomaterial interfaces through sugar sensitive catechol boronate interactions . In this design the obtained dynamic biointerface showed biocompatible sugar responsiveness and enabled reversible presentation of diversified bioactivities exhibiting the multipotential to manipulate a variety of cell biomaterial interactions . Cell capture release experiments confirmed our dynamic biointerface could reversibly and selectively bind different cancer cells and even the bacterial microorganism . In short apart from the original significance in ECM mimicking the optional and diversified bioactivities on our developed dynamic biointerface will also show promising prospects in biomedical science in particular the cell isolation area for diagnostics and therapeutics .
