 Elevated chromium concentrations in drinking water or ground water can pose a public health concern . In this study layered double hydroxides isethionate assisted covalent and electrostatic co crosslinked cationic hydrogel was prepared as a potential adsorbent for Cr removal from aqueous solution . The scanning electron microscopy and X ray diffraction results indicated that the LDH ise sheets were exfoliated and crosslinked with the 3 propyltrimethylaminium chloride polymer chains . The adsorption of Cr onto the CH LDH ise was highly pH dependent and the removal efficiency by CH LDH ise composites was much higher than the CH . The adsorption kinetic followed a pseudo second order and reached equilibrium within 2h . The corresponding maximum Cr adsorption capacity of CH LDH ise was 408.4mg g at the equilibrium concentration of 364.4mg L. The enhanced adsorption of Cr was also achieved in the presence of competing anions including Cl

@highlight CH LDH ise exhibits high Cr VI adsorption capacity of 408.4mgCr g.
@highlight CH LDH ise shows wide pH applicability 311 with enhanced Cr VI selectivity.
@highlight The co cross linked CH LDH ise improved the surface area and hydrophobicity.
@highlight The column adsorption capacity of CH LDH ise was 2250 BV.
@highlight Cr VI adsorbed mechanisms were electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bond effect.
