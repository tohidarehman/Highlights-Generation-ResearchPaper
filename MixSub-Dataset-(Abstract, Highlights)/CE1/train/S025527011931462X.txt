 Recovery of rare earth elements i.e . neodymium dysprosium and praseodymium from waste permanent magnet leach liquor has been investigated using solvent extraction followed by hollow fiber supported liquid membrane . In the solvent extraction studies optimum parameters have been obtained for 1 mol L D2EHPA at pH 2 and 2 mol L nitric acid for stripping agent . In the HFSLM system the best percentage achieved at 90 minutes for neodymium dysprosium and praseodymium was 58.62 98.46 and 85.59 as well as for the recovery 63.13 15.21 and 56.29 respectively . In this study the optimum transport rate was achieved at 90 minutes the transport of rare earths ion follows the order was Nd Pr Dy . The highest transport and permeability coefficient of rare earths ion was achieved by neodymium with values of 0.0083 min

@highlight Solvent extraction and HFSLM was applied to REEs recovery from WPMS leach liquor.
@highlight The optimum parameters were achieved 1 M D2EHPA in isopar L at pH 2.
@highlight 2 mol L nitric acid as optimum parameters of stripping agent.
@highlight In the HFSLM system the optimum transport rate was obtained at 90 min.
@highlight Separation REEs and iron were successfully demonstrated using HFSLM system.
