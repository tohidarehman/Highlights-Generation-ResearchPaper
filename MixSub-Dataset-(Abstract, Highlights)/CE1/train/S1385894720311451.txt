 are often employed to enhance the stability of iron oxides oxygen carriers but the reactivity is compromised for the dilution of the active phase . Here we report several iron oxides supported by ionic conducting gadolinium doped cerium oxides for efficient chemical looping hydrogen production . The results show that GDC support can simultaneously improve redox stability and activity . Specifically the produced Fe

@highlight The effect of different supports is compared.
@highlight GDC support improves oxide ion diffusion in the bulk.
@highlight Enhanced chemical looping water splitting performance is obtained by Fe
@highlight  GDC 30.
