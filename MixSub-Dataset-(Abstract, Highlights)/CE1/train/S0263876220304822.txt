 Deep eutectic solvents have been proposed as solvents for biomass delignification . This paper describes a conceptual process design for the delignification of

@highlight A conceptual process is proposed for biomass delignification using DES.
@highlight The heat consumption of the process was optimized using experiments.
@highlight The process has a heat duty of 7.9
@highlight None
@highlight GJ t pulp 28 less than the kraft process.
@highlight The process offers possibilities for the valorization of lignin byproducts.
