 Wearable electronics and smart garments have attracted increasing attention due to their potential application in health care monitoring artificial intelligence soft robotics etc . However designing robust and flexible wearable electronics that can shield electromagnetic waves and work in all weather environment or even harsh conditions remains a challenge . Herein superhydrophobic and multi responsive fabric composites with outstanding electro photo thermal effect and excellent electromagnetic interference shielding performance are fabricated by decoration of conductive Ag nanoparticles onto the oxygen plasma treated polypropylene fabric followed by multiple spray coating with a mixture of Fe

@highlight A superhydrophobic and multi responsive fabric composite was prepared.
@highlight The EMI shielding performance could reach to 56.1dB in the X band.
@highlight The absorption ratio of electromagnetic waves could account for 30 .
@highlight The fabric composite exhibited outstanding electro photo thermal effect.
