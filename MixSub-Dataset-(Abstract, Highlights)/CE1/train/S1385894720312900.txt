 This work reports the influence of the gas diffusion layer and cell assembly mode on the ethanol revalorization through the electro reforming process focusing on hydrogen and value added organics products distribution . All essays were conducted in a Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis Cell of 5cm

@highlight Influence of three MEA configurations on ethanol electro reforming was studied.
@highlight MEA configurations were conformed varying the GDL type and the assembly mode.
@highlight Porous titanium GDL exhibited higher mass transfer limitations and lower activity.
@highlight Carbon paper architectures showed the best electrochemical performance.
@highlight Carbon paper not assembly layout provided the highest selectivity towards acetic acid.
