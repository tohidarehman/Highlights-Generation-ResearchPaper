 To solve the problems that energy consumed excessively temperature fluctuated largely in the pyrolysis process and pyrolysis by products can not be used a novel heating system was designed for pyrolysis which used liquefied petroleum gas and non condensable gas to combust simultaneously . The PLC microcontroller utilized the negative feedback to control the pyrolysis temperature within the required temperature range . The experiment apparatus was built to obtain the heating system s temperature rising curve product yield and input consumption energy changes . The results showed that the heating system basically satisfied the pyrolysis conditions . The yield of liquid pyrolysis oil was 58.2 which was an energy balance but also the most economical point . At this time the production of NG could provide thermal energy for the heating system to the utmost extent . The thermal energy balance analysis was carried out finding that the pyrolysis temperature of 500 was an ideal condition where the combustion gas replacement ratio was 76.2 . Our studies have provided a new design pattern of the heating system for biomass fast pyrolysis with experiment research .
