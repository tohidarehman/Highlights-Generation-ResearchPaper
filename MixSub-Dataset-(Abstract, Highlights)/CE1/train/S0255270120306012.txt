 This paper presents a new approach defined as hazard process stream index . This index intends to improve hazard identification in the early stages of a process design project . The main objective was to intensify biofuels and bioproducts production processes which involve handling flammable aqueous mixtures and combustible materials . The information to estimate this index was obtained from simulation software and public database . The index calculated the hazard of every single process stream using as input data the pressure molar flow density heat of combustion and flash point . Two case studies validated the reliability of HPSI . The first one was the supercritical biodiesel production process and the second one was an intensified purification train from a biobutanol production process . The case studies were analyzed through HPSI and process stream index . The HPSI efficiently identifies the hazardous process streams in both case studies .

@highlight A methodology to improve the process safety from an early design stage is presented.
@highlight A simple way to identify hazardous equipment and process streams is proposed.
@highlight The strategy is suitable to assess biofuels production in non conventional and intensified processes.
