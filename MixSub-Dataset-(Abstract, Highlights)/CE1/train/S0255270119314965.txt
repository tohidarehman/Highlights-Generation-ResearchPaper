 The enhanced potassium leaching mechanism of phosphorus potassium associated ore with sodium dodecyl sulfate was systematically elucidated and attributed to the combined effects such as the wetting adsorption dispersion and permeation actions . First the formation of the adsorption film with 1.25g L

@highlight Effect of sodium dodecyl sulfate on leaching solution surface tensions and specific viscosities was determined.
