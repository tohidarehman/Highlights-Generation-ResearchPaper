 Fluidization is an effective method to better help the transfer and conversion of fuel particles . In this study intensification of the fluidization performances of polypropylene was experimentally investigated by using microwave absorbent . The fluidization performances of polypropylene were initially presented and the effects of microwave absorbent particle size mass ratio of SiC to PP and fluidization velocity on the co fluidization performances were studied and presented . The results showed that the PP load significantly increased the initial bed height whereas slightly increased the critical fluidization velocity and bed expansion ratio . Adding microwave absorbent can effectively improve the fluidization performance of PP particles . The smaller SiC particles had better fluidization performances than the larger ones . The mass ratio of silicon carbide to polypropylene decreased the critical fluidization velocity . Fluidization velocity significantly affected the co fluidization performance . For the co fluidization of polypropylene and silicon carbide in the designed fluidized bed the recommended fluidization parameters were the particle size of silicon carbide of 0.251 mm the mass ratio of silicon carbide to polypropylene of 3 2 and the fluidization velocity of 0.66 m s .
