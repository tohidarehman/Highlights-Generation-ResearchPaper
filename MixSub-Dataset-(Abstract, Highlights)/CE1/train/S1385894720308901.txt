 The degradation characteristics of four typical structures of lactam antibiotics were studied during the synergistic oxidation mechanism of persulfate and mesoporous g C

@highlight The MCN PS synergistic action on the lactam antibiotics degradation is proposed.
@highlight SUL exhibits a peak degradation rate at pH 4 during the MCN PMS oxidation.
@highlight A novel pH dependent oxidation channel for SUL was firstly explored.
@highlight The protonated PS induces electron transfer on SUL generating SUL O SO
@highlight H at pH 4.
@highlight The oxidation pathways of SUL were investigated via DFT and HPLC TOF MS MS.
