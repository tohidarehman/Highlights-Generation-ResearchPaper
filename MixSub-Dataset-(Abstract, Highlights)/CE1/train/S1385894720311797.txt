 Lithium metal batteries have attracted remarkable attention because of their high theoretic specific capacity and low redox potential . However the issues including uncontrollable dendritic formation and the highly reactive nature of Li anodes hinder the practical application of lithium metal batteries . Herein LiAl layered double hydroxide modified separators LiAl

@highlight LiAl LDH nanoflakes is used to modify the PP membrane for Li metal batteries.
@highlight Homogeneous interfacial Li flux is regulated through the modified PP separator.
@highlight Ultra stable battery cycling performance is achieved with the modified PP separator.
