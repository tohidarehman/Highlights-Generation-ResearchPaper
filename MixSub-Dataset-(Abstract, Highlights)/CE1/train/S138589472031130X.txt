 Metal biochar composite is considered as a promising alternative for future carbocatalysis in environmental decontamination . Nevertheless unavoidable metal leaching impedes its scaling up application and remains an environmental concern in the present scientific progress . Herein a hierarchical Fe biochar derived from cellulose was fabricated

@highlight Tartaric acid was accommodated on hierarchical Fe biochar as electron shuttle.
@highlight Introduction of tartaric acid could mitigate the Fe leaching of biochar composite.
@highlight CO C C redox cycle promoted a two phase mechanism in the peroxymonosulfate activation.
@highlight Improved catalyst recyclability of Fe biochar composite enhanced its environmental sustainability.
