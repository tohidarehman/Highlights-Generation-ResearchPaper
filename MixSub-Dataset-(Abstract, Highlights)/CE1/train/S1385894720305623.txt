 Separator plays a key background role in maintaining excellent ionic flux and avoiding the subject of internal short circuit faults which is thought as the key part of lithium ion battery . Hence the characteristics of prominent thermal stability eminent electrolyte affinity and laudable mechanical strength are of vital importance to guarantee energy density and security for lithium ion cells . In this study a natty poly based gel membrane with multi level nanofibers was resoundingly prepared for the first time through blend electrospinning of manganese dioxide MnO

@highlight A novel multilevel structured MnO
@highlight  assisted PVDF HFP PMIA based GPE is prepared.
@highlight The GPE shows reduced aperture increased porosity and electrolyte uptake.
@highlight The GPE has sufficient active sites and short diffusion channels for Li
@highlight migration.
@highlight The GPE shows excellent thermal and mechanical properties to ensure battery safety.
@highlight Lithium ion cells with the GPE show high ionic conductivity and cycle stability.
