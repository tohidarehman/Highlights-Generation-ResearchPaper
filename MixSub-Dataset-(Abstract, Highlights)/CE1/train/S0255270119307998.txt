 The factors affecting a precoating filtration process and its regulation are studied through lab scale and pilot scale tests combined with surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy . In the classic filtration process the diatomite filter aids are introduced for precoating to regulate the specific resistance of the filter cake during the filtration process . This approach solves the fast termination of filtration caused by the rapid increase of the specific resistance of filter cake in classic filtration process . Moreover surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy is introduced to detect the trajectory of the filter particles moving with the filtrate in different precoating . The key factors such as median particle size thickness and suspension mass concentration of precoating in the filter aids are determined using lab scale and pilot scale tests . This study provides a foundation for industrial application of precoating filtration processes .
