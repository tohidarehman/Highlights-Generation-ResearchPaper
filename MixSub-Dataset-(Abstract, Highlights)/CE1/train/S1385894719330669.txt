 Nickel cobalt sulfides are deemed as promising electrode materials for energy storage devices due to their rich redox active sites as well as superior conductivity . Herein we report P doped

@highlight assemblies are prepared through facile one step solvothermal route and a subsequent phosphorization process.
@highlight The as obtained product as electrode material shows a specific capacity of 1026 C g
@highlight at current density of 1Ag
@highlight An asymmetric supercapacitor delivers an energy density of 131.40 Wh kg
@highlight at 1355.37Wkg
@highlight The superior electrochemical performance could be attributed to their unique spatial architectures and synergistic effect.
