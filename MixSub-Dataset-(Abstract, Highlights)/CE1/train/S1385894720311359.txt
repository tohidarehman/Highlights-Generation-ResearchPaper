 A hydrogen recycling electrochemical system can be used for energy efficient removal of TAN from wastewater . When a current is applied a concentration gradient of cations builds up between catholyte and feed solution . When no current is applied cations Na

@highlight Hydrogen recycling electrochemical system was used for ammonium removal.
@highlight Exploiting Donnan Dialysis for ammonia recovery via cation exchange with ammonium.
@highlight In continuous operation Donnan Dialysis did not clearly affect ammonium removal.
@highlight In batch operation Donnan Dialysis increased the ammonium removal by 10 .
@highlight The system was more energy efficient compared to previous studies.
