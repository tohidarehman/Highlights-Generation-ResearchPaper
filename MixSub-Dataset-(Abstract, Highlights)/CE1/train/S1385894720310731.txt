 Malignant bone tumors have caused great obstacles and serious illnesses for tumor recurrence and difficulty in reconstructing and repairing large defects after tumorectomy . Additionally long term efficacy satisfactory biocompatibility and excellent properties for anti tumor agents are necessary in the biomedical field . To solve these problems a novel idea has been proposed on building an integrative anti tumor bone repairing scaffold by covering photothermal therapy composite MoS

@highlight Integrative treatment anti tumor bone repair BGM scaffolds were fabricated.
@highlight BGM can retain MoS
@highlight for 60days implying its photothermal ability.
@highlight BGM can reduce MNNG HOS viability and inhibit tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.
@highlight BGM stimulate differentiation of rBMSCs upregulate osteogenetic genes expression.
@highlight The BGM scaffolds can promote bone tissues repairing in rat calvarial defects.
