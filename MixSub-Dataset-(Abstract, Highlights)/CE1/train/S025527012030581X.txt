 Different PPSU nanofiltration fibers were used for the first time as a potential fiber for saline water desalination by forward osmosis . The characteristics of fibers such as their surface structure cross sectional structure and thickness were measured using a SEM and an AFM with fiber porosity also measured . The effects of the PPSU amount and operating conditions on the performance of water transport were investigated . The structural parameter displayed small values for three PPSU fibers due to their high porosity and because the fiber was less thick which corresponded well to their performance . The prepared PPSU fiber tested under the FO process displayed high water fluxes utilizing 3.0M NaCl as the draw solution . High salt rejection for all PPSU FO fibers was obtained and the salt reverse fluxes were preserved below 7.30 6.58 and 3.89 gMH for PPSU 25 29 and 30wt . respectively . Increasing the PPSU amounts led to decreasing the specific reverse salt flux . The PPSU NF hollow fibers prepared in this work are eligible FO membranes for water desalination .
