 Solid oxide fuel cell provides a new method for clean and efficient conversion and utilization of hydrocarbon fuels due to its high fuel flexibility . The utilization of biogas fuel through direct internal reforming allows for a simplification of the SOFC system since no external reformer appears strictly necessary . Despite its considerable convenience and potential at present direct internal dry reforming is still not considered as a competitive process for commercial application which is limited by the reaction difficulty and high risk of carbon deposition . To address the problem in this study conventional Ni yttrium stabilized zirconia anodes of SOFCs are modified by two methods i.e . Ce

@highlight Conventional Ni YSZ anodes were modified by infiltration and a catalytic layer.
@highlight Detailed comparison between the modified cells and the bare cell was made.
@highlight The GDC infiltration on anode is beneficial only in certain cases.
@highlight Enhancement of cell performance and stability was achieved by the catalytic layer.
