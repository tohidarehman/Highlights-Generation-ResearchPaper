 This study investigates the interfacial stability of emulsion liquid membrane for phenols removal through the introduction of blended surfactant in the formulation of liquid membranes . The stability was studied in terms of emulsion breakage time and droplets size distribution . The components used in ELM were a mixture of palm oil and kerosene as a diluent sorbitan monooleate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate as a surfactants and sodium hydroxide as a stripping agent . Parameters such as hydrophilic lipophilic value mixed surfactant concentration homogenizer speed emulsification time and organic to internal ratio were evaluated . Results show that stable emulsion was formed at HLB 5 3 of blended surfactant 8000rpm of homogenizer speed 3min of emulsification time and 3 1 O I ratio . 83.4 of phenol were extracted under these conditions without any emulsion breakage or swelling . Thus Span 80 and Tween 80 mixture has high potential as surfactant and is capable to increase the stability of emulsion .

@highlight Utilization of blended surfactant in green emulsion liquid membrane formulation.
@highlight Palm oil has a high potential as a green solvent in the ELM formulation.
@highlight Optimization of process parameters to produce a stable emulsion.
@highlight An amount of 83.4 of phenol extraction was achieved while retaining the emulsion stability.
