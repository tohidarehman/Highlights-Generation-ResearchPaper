 Today bioplastics are recognised as sustainable alternatives and one of the solutions to the crisis of petro based plastics . The next generation polymer poly has gained great popularity since it is associated with significant reduction of energy use and GHG emissions as well as with superior barrier properties . This drop in polymer is a promising 100 bio based alternative to its petro based counterpart poly . PEF can be effectively synthesised by polymerisation between 2 5 furandicarboxylic acid and ethylene glycol which represent biomass derived building blocks . These bio building blocks are an important commodity and platform chemicals that can be used for a variety of applications including the synthesis of PEF . This review covers recent progress in the production of novel bio building blocks for the preparation of PEF . Among various synthesis methods we reviewed the catalytic conversion of biomass derived hydroxylmethylfurfural into FDCA and the biological route from biomass feedstock into EG . In addition we covered recent progress in the synthesis of HMF from biomass since a reliable supply of HMF is important for the synthesis of FDCA . Finally research goals and challenges for future development of bio building blocks production were proposed .

@highlight Current progress in the catalytic conversion of bio based HMF into FDCA are reviewed.
