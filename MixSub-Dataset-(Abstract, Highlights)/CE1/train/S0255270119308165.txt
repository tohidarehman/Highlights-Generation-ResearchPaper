 Dicetyl peroxydicarbonate is a solid peroxide which is conventionally synthesized in a two phase batch or semi continuous reactors and contains usually 58wt . impurities . The present study aimed to use a flow focusing microreactor to prepare a highly pure dicetyl peroxydicarbonate from the reaction of cetyl chloroformate and hydrogen peroxide . The clogging problem of the microreactor with solid peroxide particles was solved by selecting an appropriate reaction temperature enabling the synthesis of this peroxide with very high yield and assay in a very short time and safe conditions . The product was characterized by using

@highlight Feasibility of using a microreactor for the synthesis of a solid peroxide was shown.
@highlight Effect of surfactant and co solvent concentrations on the yield was studied.
@highlight Optimum conditions for the production of dicetyl peroxydicarbonate were determined.
@highlight Dicetyl peroxydicarbonate with a very high purity was synthesized in a microreactor.
@highlight Response surface method was used to study and optimize formulation and process parameters.
