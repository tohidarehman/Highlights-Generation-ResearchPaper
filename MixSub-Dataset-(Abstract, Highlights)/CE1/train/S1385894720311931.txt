 Remote temperature sensing in biological media is used to monitor intracellular evolutionary process reliably and is potentially applied in the field of diagnostics and therapeutics . Ideally such nanothermometers should be functional in biological optical transparency windows across a wide range of broad absorption and emission bands strong luminescence and larger Stokes shift . Here this is achieved via using NIR to NIR transition metal Cr
