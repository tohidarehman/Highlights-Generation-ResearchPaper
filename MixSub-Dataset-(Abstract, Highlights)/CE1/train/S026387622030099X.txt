 Sodium sulfate wastewater is a kind of coal tar processing effluent containing highly concentrated phenol . Owing to its high toxicity phenol pose a serious threat to the natural environment and human health . In this paper a novel ternary extractant tributylphosphane diethyl carbonate cyclohexane was utilized to extract phenol from the wastewater . The combination of 20 TBP 20 DEC and 60 cyclohexane yielded a high extraction efficiency of 99.79 under the suggested conditions . Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis illustrates that the extraction of phenol was enabled by intermolecular hydrogen bonding with both TBP and DEC . The stripping of phenol from the phenol loaded extractant was carried out using an alkali solution realizing the recovery of phenol resource and the regeneration of extractant . The stripping efficiency reached 96.29 when using 1 mol L NaOH solution under certain conditions . Additionally the pH response analysis shows that the stripping process could be divided into four stages and more than 8 min of contact time leaded to the hydrolysis of the DEC . The ultra high phenol recovery up to 99.78 was achieved from the actual wastewater via a two stage extraction and back extraction .
