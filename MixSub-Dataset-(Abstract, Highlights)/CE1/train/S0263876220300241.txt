 This study explicates the preparation of ethyl acetate via esterification of acetic acid and ethanol over brnsted acid ionic liquid HSO

@highlight  BMIM HSO
@highlight was a high catalytic activity catalyst for preparation of ethyl acetate.
@highlight NIH and IH kinetic models were used to deal with the experimental data.
@highlight The NIH model was found with a better fit of the experimental data than IH model.
@highlight  BMIM HSO
@highlight showed great application in reactive distillation RD simulation process.
@highlight RD process simulation results agreed well with the experimental data.
