 In this study the HCl absorption performance of cheap natural soda ash loaded on a honeycomb support as a hot gas cleanup method was investigated by using flow type fixed bed reactor . The honeycomb supported soda ash improved the HCl absorption extent significantly at the 1 ppm breakthrough time compared to the result without the support thus the use of the support was justified . The HCl removal performance of the honeycomb supported soda ash depended significantly on temperature 300600

@highlight The honeycomb supported soda ash showed high HCl absorption performance.
@highlight The absorption extent at 1 ppm breakthrough time was maximized at 500
@highlight None
@highlight C.
@highlight This absorption extent increased as the HCl concentration in the supplied gas decreased.
@highlight No change in the HCl absorption extent was observed for Na
@highlight CO
@highlight loading amount.
