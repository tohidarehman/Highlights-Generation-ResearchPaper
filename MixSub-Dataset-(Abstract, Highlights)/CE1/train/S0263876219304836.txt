 Graphene based materials have emerged as promising candidates as adsorbents for water treatment . The high surface area low production costs large porosities and robustness makes them excellent materials for adsorption studies and removal of toxic compounds such as pesticides dyes aromatic polar and non polar compounds nitro compounds halogenated compounds antibiotics etc . from aqueous solutions . In recent years there have been many structural modifications in the 2 D graphene sheet for synthesizing superior materials such as graphene metal composites metal oxide composites bio composites hydrogels etc . for improving the structural properties and widen its applications . In this review we have incorporated the examples from both experimental and density functional theory studies for water remediation by removal of toxic organic pollutants using graphene based materials from the recent literature and have further outlined the challenges and future perspectives in this direction .
