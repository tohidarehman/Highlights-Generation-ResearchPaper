 In this study secondary pyrolysis oil based drilling cuttings ash was used to remediate chromium contaminated soil . The effects of the OBCDA sp mesh OBCDA sp dosage and soil moisture content on the removal of Cr were investigated . Subsequently a kinetic experiment was conducted where the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models both fitted well on OBDCA sp with the adsorption process of Cr in soil . The change of the chromium form indicated that the addition of OBCDA sp transformed Cr from an effective state to a stable form reducing its mobility and bioavailability . X ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis were used to verify the potential mechanism of Cr removal Ba Fe S and P elements in OBCDA sp were observed to play a significant role in the reduction of Cr . The results from this study indicate that OBCDA sp could be an emergent and promising alternative for the remediation of Cr contaminated soil .
