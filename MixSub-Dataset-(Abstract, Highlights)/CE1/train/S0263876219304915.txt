 ZnO based catalysts impregnated with the metals Ag and Pd were synthesized for the photocatalytic degradation of two reactive dyes RB 19 and RB 21 in the textile effluents using an annular UV photoreactor . Among three synthesized catalysts only the ZnO catalyst preserved the photodegradation of the dyes in the effluents . The density mean particle diameter surface area and porosity of the ZnO catalyst were 5550

@highlight ZnO ZnO Ag and ZnO Pd were synthesized for photodegradation of textile effluents.
@highlight ZnO Ag and ZnO Pd degraded pure dye but they did not degrade dyes in real effluents.
@highlight ZnO degraded 100 of RB 19 and 91 of RB 21 during 5.8
@highlight None
@highlight h in the real effluents.
@highlight The photocatalytic process was successfully modeled using the mass conservation law.
@highlight Decreasing the dye concentration and catalyst size increased the degradation.
