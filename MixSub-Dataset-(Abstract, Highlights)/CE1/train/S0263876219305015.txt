 In this study nanofiltration membrane process was combined with Fenton reaction by incorporating Fe based nanoparticles i.e . goethite and maleate ferroxane in the structure of polyacrylonitrile film to improve the antifouling property and filtration performance of the membrane for amoxicillin removal . The relation between the microstructure of the resulted composite with the antifouling properties and membrane performance is extensively investigated . It was found that by NF FT combined process foulants could be degraded and the AMX separation efficiency enhanced by 92.3 and 86.3 for PAN Mf and PAN Goe membranes respectively . The permeate fluxes were also increased to 1.4 and 1.2 times of NF membrane filtration alone respectively . Due to degradation of foulants the combined NF FT process exhibited better antifouling properties including flux recovery ratio of 97.3 and 96.2 for PAN Mf and PAN Goe respectively . The ratio of irreversible fouling to reversible fouling for NF FT was lower than individual membrane process . Furthermore the four cycles of AMX rejection indicated the good stability and reusability of Fe based NPs in composite membranes with FT reaction . Consequently this research proves the successful combination of FT and NF membrane processes .
