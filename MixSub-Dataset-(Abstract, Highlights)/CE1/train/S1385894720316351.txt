 Boosting the catalytic ability of nickel sulfide is vital to its further application as a class of promising non noble catalysts for energy environmental applications . In light of the varied structure phase and heteroatom doping effect of nickel sulfide herein we demonstrated the excellent catalysis performance for varied reactions catalyzed by nickel sulfide with N doping and heterostructure construction . Different from the usually used corrosive precursors amidinothiourea and thioacetamide were used as S and N source for the catalysts fabrication and N atom was doped into the catalysts simultaneously during the sulfuration process . The spectroscopic probing and microscopic observation clearly showed the heterogeneous structure and interface formation . Benefiting from the large surface area N doping induced electronic effect and interfacial coupling and synergistic effect between NiS and NiS
