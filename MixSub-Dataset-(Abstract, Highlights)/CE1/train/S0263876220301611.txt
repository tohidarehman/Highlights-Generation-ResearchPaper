 The PES nanofiltration membranes incorporated with hydrophilic para hydroxybenzoate alumoxane filler were prepared with enhanced pure water flux dye removal and antifouling property . The fabricated membranes were characterized in terms of average pore radius porosity surface roughness water contact angle active layer thickness and zeta potential . The surface roughness of the nanofiltration membranes decreased and the surface hydrophilicity of the nanofiltration membranes increased with the increase of the PHBA content . According to nanofiltration experiments the highest pure water flux of the PES membranes incorporated with PHBA reached up to 80.47 kg m

@highlight The P PHBA membranes were prepared by incorporating para hydroxybenzoate alumoxane PHBA filler into PES membranes.
@highlight The P PHBA membranes possessed more populated micro voids higher porosity and hydrophilicity than PES.
@highlight The P PHBA membranes showed high dye Direct Red 16 and for Methylene Blue rejection.
@highlight The P PHBA membranes exhibited more permeation flux and outstanding antifouling behavior.
