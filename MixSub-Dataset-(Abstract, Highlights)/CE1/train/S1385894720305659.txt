 Little information can be obtained about the effect of soil type on the degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls in the pyrophosphate chelated Fenton like reaction that has been proven as a promising means for soil remediation . Thus red soil paddy soil fluvo aquic soil and black soil were chosen as representative soils located in different regions of China to systematically investigate effects of soil type on the degradation efficiency and initial rate constant

@highlight PCB removal in four soils was different at the Fe PP ratio of 2 1 or 1 2 except 1 1.
@highlight The initial rate constant 
@highlight  of PCBs showed an order of RS BS PS FS.
@highlight The soluble Fe
@highlight and availability of H
@highlight among four soils controlled
@highlight values.
@highlight SOM and carbonate caused diverse availability of H
@highlight among four soils.
@highlight Soil constituents controlled soluble Fe
@highlight through adsorption and hydrolysis pathways.
