 A novel biological graphene aerogel was fabricated by using bacteria in waste activated sludge as cross linker and ionic dye as surface charge modification reagent . Through rheological measurement and electron microscopy this AS BGA was confirmed an elastic porous structure with packing bacteria inside graphene oxide sheets . A variety of chemical elemental analysis demonstrated that GO was reduced by the bacteria to reduced graphene oxide alongside the gelation process . Further methylene blue methyl orange and Congo red were used to alter GOs surface charge owing to the electrostatic and stacking effect . Accordingly the surface electronic properties of the AS BGA prepared by the functionalized GO exhibited a consistent change i.e . electronegativity was enhanced by anionic MO and CR meanwhile neutralized by cationic MB . Thereby the adsorption capacity of the AS BGA with the optimal functionalization conditions through MO was increased 1.24 fold higher than the unfunctionalized one . Furthermore the raw material and energy consumption related to the synthesis of AS BGA was analyzed by the life cycle assessment method . This study points to the reuse of the excess bacteria and organic compounds to derive adsorbents for sustainable wastewater treatment by exploiting graphene materials in an exquisite way .
