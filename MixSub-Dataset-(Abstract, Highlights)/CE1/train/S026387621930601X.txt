 This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of adsorbed toluene removal using a coaxial cylindrical dielectric barrier discharge reactor packed with a hybrid material catalyst M 13X Al

@highlight Hybrid catalysis were used for adsorbed toluene removal by non thermal plasma.
@highlight The toluene mineralization fit with the pseudo second order kinetic model.
@highlight The model determined by
@highlight and
@highlight is expressed as 
@highlight The reliability of the kinetic model was verified.
