 Introduction of pulsations to the classical bubble columns makes it possible to reduce the size and velocity of flowing gas bubbles and to obtain nearly spherical shape . As a result gas hold up and interfacial area are increased which obviously has an effect on the intensification of mass transfer .

@highlight Liquid pulsations at resonance frequencies caused an increase of gas hold up.
@highlight Liquid pulsations at resonance frequencies caused an increase of mass transfer.
@highlight Static aerator provides higher values of gas hold up comparing to pulsed aerator.
@highlight Volumetric mass transfer coefficient was higher when the static aerator was used.
