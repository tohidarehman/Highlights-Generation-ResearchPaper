 The efficient depolymerization of technical lignin to produce high quality and phenolic monomer rich bio oil is challenging owing to the inherent recalcitrant structure of lignin . In addition the phenolic fragments formed during lignin depolymerization are highly reactive and easily undergo rapid repolymerization to yield undesired heavy oils or char . In the present work we report a new hybrid catalyst of Ru C combined with MgO ZrO

@highlight A novel hybrid catalyst of Ru CMgOZrO
@highlight for effective depolymerization of lignin is proposed.
@highlight Ru C mainly catalyzes the reductive depolymerization of lignin to smaller phenols.
@highlight The role of MgO ZrO
@highlight is to suppress recondensation of reactive phenolic fragments.
@highlight The efficiency of the integrated catalyst is highly dependent on the basicity of MgO ZrO
@highlight High calorific 35MJ kg and monophenol rich 32 bio oil is produced with a high yield 80 .
