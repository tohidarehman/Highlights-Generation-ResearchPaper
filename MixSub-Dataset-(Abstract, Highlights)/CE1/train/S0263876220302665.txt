 This paper deals with the extraction from a meniscus of water droplets of small size into an immiscible insulating liquid by the use of a multistage voltage pulse . A previous study on a particular oil established that this EHD Drop on demand technique allows producing droplets of size smaller or much smaller than the needle diameter . The case of a dielectric liquid characterized by a rather high value of the water oil interfacial tension is considered here . It is shown that by adequately modifying the shape and level of the multistage voltage pulse droplets are produced with a diameter ranging over a large interval . It was expected that the short enough pulse duration would give electrically neutral droplets in practice it is found that the droplets carry minute but nonzero charges . An explanation is given for the charging mechanism and other changes of the pulse shape allow to further minimize the droplets charge . Finally having in mind the possibility to investigate experimentally the electrocoalescence of two close drops results are presented concerning the injection of two successive droplets .
