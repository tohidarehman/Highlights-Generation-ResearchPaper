 A rotating packed bed reactor with excellent mass transfer performance can be applied for catalytic reactions . However the structure of catalyst particles randomly inside the rotor of the RPB reactor was easily deformed under the centrifugal field . In this work a cordierite monolithic catalyst with high mechanical strength was prepared aiming to be used in the RPB reactor for hydrogenation . The acid pretreatment and Al

@highlight The pretreatment conditions of cordierite were investigated.
@highlight Cordierite monolithic catalyst was employed in the RPB reactor for the first time.
@highlight The mechanical strength of cordierite was very high under the centrifugal field.
@highlight The STY in the RPB reactor was 9.2 times higher than that in the FBR.
