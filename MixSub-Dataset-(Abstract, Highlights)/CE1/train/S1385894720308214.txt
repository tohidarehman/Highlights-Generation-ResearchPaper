 The performance of trichloroethene degradation was significantly improved with the addition of FeS in nanoscale calcium peroxide environment and the enhancement of HO

@highlight FeS significantly enhanced HO
@highlight generation and TCE degradation.
@highlight The synergistic activation mechanism of Fe II FeS was investigated.
@highlight HO
@highlight was the primary ROSs in nCP Fe II FeS system.
@highlight Effective degradation of TCE in actual groundwater was achieved.
