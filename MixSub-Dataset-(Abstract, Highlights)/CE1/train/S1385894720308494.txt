 A double dielectric barrier discharge plasma reactor was used for the remediation of simulated contaminated soil by a mixture of two three and four rings PAHs i.e . naphthalene phenanthrene and pyrene . Various influencing parameters such as peak to peak applied voltage soil moisture oxygen to nitrogen ratio O

@highlight DDBD plasma was proved to remediate PAHs mixture contaminated soil.
@highlight Influential parameters of DDBD plasma for PAHs mixture remediation was evaluated.
@highlight Optimum level of soil moisture content enhances PAHs remediation.
@highlight High oxygen content in DDBD plasma effectively removed PAHs contaminated soil.
