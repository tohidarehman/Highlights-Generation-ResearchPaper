 Downstream separation in the oxidative coupling of methane is a major technical challenge limiting the industrial implementation of ethylene production from natural gas . This work focuses on the assessment of different thermally coupled cryogenic distillation schemes for the separation of OCM effluent gases . The composition of the feed gas was defined according to an experimentally validated OCM effluent stream previously treated for H
