 Hypoxia inducible factor 1 plays a critical role in tumor development and chemotherapy resistance and suppression of HIF 1 has emerged as a captivating antitumor approach . To efficiently silence HIF 1 in deep hypoxic tumors we herein developed a versatile small interfering RNA delivery system that could overcome multiple physiological barriers . The system is comprised of an Fe

@highlight The magnetic nanocluster possessed both superior magnetization and superparamagnetism.
@highlight The chimeric membrane integrated diverse membrane functions remedying the defects from single membrane.
@highlight The enzymolysis by hyaluronidase was strengthened through membrane fluidity.
@highlight The silence of HIF 1 not only inhibited tumor growth but also ameliorated chemoresistance.
