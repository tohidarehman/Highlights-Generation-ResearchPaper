 Self healing is an indispensable property of the next generation wearable electronic devices . However it is a hugely difficult problem to achieve good self healing abilities and good elastic properties at different conditions . Herein we report a self healing substrate from commercially available methyl vinyl silicone rubber that has been cross linked through metal ligand coordinate bonds . The strain sensor was then assembled by coating nanostructured conductive layer film and silver film onto the self healing elastomeric substrate . The resulting flexible sensors show a desirable healing efficiency under both high temperatures and underwater conditions . Notably the healed strain sensors can still precisely capture diverse human activities such as large limb movements and minute physiological activities . The self healing strain sensors demonstrated in this study will push forward the design and application of stretchable and flexible electronic devices .
