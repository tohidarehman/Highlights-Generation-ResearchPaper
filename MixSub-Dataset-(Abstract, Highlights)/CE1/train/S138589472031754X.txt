 A one step and controllable strategy to prepare all polymer hybrid electret fibers is reported based on the coupling of polystyrene and polyvinylidene fluoride in electric response . The complementary dielectric properties between PS and PVDF generate dual system electret charges within PS PVDF fibers thereby improving the electret effect . The bi component all polymer electret fibers show enhanced electret property and structural continuity contributing to a N95 protective respirator with high filtration efficiency low air resistance and long service life . The fabrication of all polymer electret fibers solves the challenge of nanoparticle toxicity for existing polymer nanoparticle electret fibers .

@highlight A new method to enhance electret property without using nanoparticles is reported.
@highlight All polymer electret PS PVDF fibers without nanotoxicity are prepared.
@highlight Novel theory describing the electret mechanisms of electrospinning is proposed.
@highlight The resultant electret fibers show competitive air filtration performance.
