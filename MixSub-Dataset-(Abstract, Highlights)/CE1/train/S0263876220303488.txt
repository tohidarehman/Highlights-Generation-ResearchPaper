 This paper presents a novel approach using sulfonated polyethersulfone zeolitic imidazolate framework porous nanocomposite substrate to enhance the salt rejection and water flux of forward osmosis membrane . The effect of SPES ZIF 8 substrate on FO membrane properties containing morphologies hydrophilicity water permeability and salt rejection were investigated and completely discussed . Based on the obtained results the selectivity and permeability of thin film nanocomposite FO membranes can be improved simultaneously through adjusting the both hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics . But these two results is achieved in two different processes and with reverse impacts . After the sulfonation process and using the more hydrophilic polymer instead of the neat PES the porosity and consequently the water flux was increased . Because of more hydrophilicity of SPES which reduces the cross linking degree of the corresponding polyamide layer the salt rejection was reduced . In contrast after the incorporation of ZIF 8 into the SPES substrate the salt rejection was increased due to the hydrophobic nature of these nanoparticles . In terms of both salt rejection and water flux the sulfonated TFN membrane with 0.5 ZIF 8 NPs showed the improved results comparing with the bare Thin film composite membrane . Furthermore the best result for the ratio of reverse salt flux to water flux J

@highlight PES was highly sulfonated to enhance the hydrophilicity and porosity.
@highlight The sulfonation process have increased the water flux J
@highlight  .
@highlight The incorporation of ZIF 8 with sulfonated PES has decreased reverse salt flux.
@highlight The ICP was decreased with decreasing the S value as a result of both modification processes.
