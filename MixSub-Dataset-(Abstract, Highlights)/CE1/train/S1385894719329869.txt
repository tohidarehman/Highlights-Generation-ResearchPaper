 By now magnetic porous carbon based composites have almost dominated recent development of electromagnetic wave absorbers . Herein we report on the fabrication of magnetic carbon foams via in situ polymerization of iron acetylacetonate

@highlight Magnetic porous graphitic carbon based foams are synthesized.
@highlight Ultralight EMW absorbers with strong capacity broad frequency and thin thickness.
@highlight The mechanism of the EMW absorption behavior has been discussed in depth.
@highlight Effect of internal cell wall thickness on EMW absorption behavior is investigated.
@highlight Effective adsorption from C to Ku band is achieved via adjusting absorber thickness.
