 In this study polyhydroxyalkanoates production integrated with the via nitrite nitrogen removal from anaerobic reject water was investigated at pilot scale under long term period . The pilot plant was located in Carbonera wastewater treatment plant and comprised the following units i rotating belt dynamic filter for the recovery of cellulosic primary sludge ii fermentation unit for the production of volatile fatty acids iii ultrafiltration unit for solid liquid separation of the fermented sludge iv nitritation sequencing batch reactor for the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite v selection SBR where aerobic feast and anoxic famine conditions were established to select PHA accumulating biomass and vi an accumulation SBR were intracellular PHA content was maximized through the feed on demand strategy . Results showed that around 80 of the influent ammonia was efficiently removed by the system when both N SBR and S SBR operated with volumetric nitrogen loading rate of 1.641.72 kgN m

@highlight Sidestream PHA production was integrated with the treatment of anaerobic reject water.
@highlight PHA represents up to 17.5 of the total COD recovered.
@highlight Potential sidestream PHA production from municipal wastewater was 1.2 kgPHA PE year.
@highlight The integrated PHA production in WWTPs allows a potential revenue of 2.25.9 PE year.
