 Global greenhouse gas emanations from fossil fuel combusting for power generation alone contribute 9.795 gigatonnes in 2014 . There is a tremendous focus on global carbon capture researchers to cut down these emissions significantly . Chemical absorption is widely used and the use of monoethanolamine was generally preferred . However MEA solutions were not without problems . For example equipment deterioration due to O

@highlight Using pulsed mode megasonics carbon rich solvent regeneration can be done at low temperature 45C .
@highlight The colour of the solution after 1h of megasonics regeneration did not change significantly indicating that minimal solvent degradation.
@highlight 1h thermal treatment of 30wt MEA lost its capacity by 11.68 whereas 1h of megasonication lost only 3.15 .
@highlight Similar regeneration energy 20.2KJ mol.CO
@highlight  was obtained for conventional and pulsed mode megasonics with 3.5 times lower nominal power input.
