 Silica gel was modified using 3 mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane and used as an adsorbent for the recovery of gold from a thiosulfate solution based on the hard and soft acids and bases theory . The interfacial properties of the mercaptopropyl functionalised silica gel and its performance for the adsorption of gold from a thiosulfate solution were examined . An optimized modification procedure was determined to produce a MPSG mercapto group content of 1.1mmolg

@highlight Recovery of gold I from thiosulfate leaching solution by using silica gel.
@highlight Mercapto modified silica gel has good adsorption capacity for gold at a weakly basic environment.
@highlight Au adsorption onto modified silica gel involves interchange between SH and Au S
@highlight The charge of Au I decreased due to charge transfer from the ligand.
