 In this study composite CoMgFe LDO catalyst was synthesized from layered double hydroxides precursor and tested as a heterogeneous catalyst to activate peroxymonosulfate for carbamazepine degradation . X ray powder diffraction scanning electron microscope energy dispersive spectrometer and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize CoMgFe LDO . CoMgFe LDO exhibited much better catalytic performance than the control catalysts . Operational parameters of CoMgFe LDO dosage PMS dosage initial solution pH and initial CBZ concentration on the degradation efficiency were investigated . Complete removal of 5mg L CBZ was achieved with 20mg L CoMgFe LDO and 0.2mM PMS at pH 5.8 in 20min reaction time . Meanwhile the inorganic anions effects in the CoMgFe LDO PMS system for CBZ removal and the catalytic stability were also studied . The radical scavenging experiments confirmed that both SO
