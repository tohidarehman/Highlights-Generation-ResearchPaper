 This paper reports the pressure drop through a monolith for turbulent and laminar flow . A computational model of a monolith channel together with the open sections before and after it is used . Simulations at several channel Reynolds numbers and assuming laminar and turbulent flow approaching the substrate are considered . Reynolds average Navier Stokes and large eddy simulation are used as flow models in the cases with turbulence . The resulting pressure drop power spectrum and flow regime are analysed . RANS predicts a decay of the turbulence as the flow approaches the substrate a small fraction of the turbulence effectively entering the channels to decay rapidly then steady flow from that point . On the other hand LES predicts a total dissipation of the turbulence before the flow enters the channels however the flow remains unsteady along the entire substrate in a sort of pulsating regime . Despite the significant differences in the flow regime both models predict a marginal influence of the upstream turbulence on the total pressure drop . The dominating frequencies of the pulsating flow inside the channels were found to be comparable to the ratio of the channel velocity over the channel diameter therefore to the channel Reynolds number .
