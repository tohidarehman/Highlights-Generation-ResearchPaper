 Over the last decade two dimensional graphene has brought new impetus in environmental photocatalysis mainly benefiting from their unique physicochemical and photoelectric structural properties . Numbers of researchers have spared no effort to utilize visible light induced GR based composites as catalyst platform to generate reactive species in photocatalytic oxidation technology . Herein a comprehensive overview is presented on recent achievements of the construction and water related applications of these photocatalysts for persistent organic pollutants removal . A brief introduction of synthesis strategies is introduced for GR and its derivatives . Roles of GR as supports flexible substrates and co catalysts in composites are specifically pointed out with experimental studies . Most importantly shortcomings appeared in visible light photocatalysis and relative solutions by using GR species are clearly investigated . Based on the current research status special attention has been paid to their promising applications on removing typical POPs such as phenols antibiotics pharmaceuticals and dyes . Also challenges and prospects are discussed for future developments in this field . This paper enriches the knowledge to deeply understand the catalytic performances and mechanisms of GR based photocatalysts and bring better perspectives for researchers in this field .
