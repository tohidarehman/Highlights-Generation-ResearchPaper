 The mass transfer limitation of conventional transesterification reaction is the reason for reaction time extension and separation prolongation . In the present work an electric field was used to overcome the mass transfer limit through barrier discharge . The ring electrode attached to a glass cylinder and the rod electrode inside the glass cylinder was applied to reduce surface tension between methanol and soybean oil to speed up the reaction process . The 220V AC was provided to the variable voltage transformer to create a high voltage electric field and accelerate the transesterification reaction . The results show that the optimal conditions for the transesterification process were 1 catalyst 6 1M ratio of methanol oil agitation speed of 600rpm the reaction time of 30min at different reaction temperatures . The maximum yield obtained after purification was 95.72 . In addition the kinetic study of the transesterification reaction was adequately explored in terms of a pseudo first order reaction with an activation energy of 14.35 kJ

@highlight A barrier discharge of the electric field was helpful to overcome mass transfer limit.
