 High performance flexible energy storage is highly desirable for portable electronic devices . We report herein a facile strategy in precisely anchoring redox juglone onto carbon nanotubes and interweaving with bacterial cellulose nanofibers as stretchable nonwoven porous membrane . The chemical bonding of juglone on CNTs greatly enhanced charge transfer of the composites via smooth electron hopping between pendant organic molecules along the CNTs conductive highway . The optimal composite J
