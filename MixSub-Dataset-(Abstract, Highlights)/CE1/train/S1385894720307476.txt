 Oxygen carriers based on geopolymer composites with enhanced thermal and mechanical stability have been synthesized and been proposed for chemical looping combustion with oxygen uncoupling . Geopolymer synthesis belongs to green chemistry and ensures chemical and mechanical properties similar to those of high temperature sintering . Suitable metal oxides such as combinations of Cu Mn and Fe oxides have been used as active fillers in geopolymer matrices . Thermogravimetric analysis conducted at 900C pointed out the excellent performance of the CuO based oxygen carrier and the overall performance trend of CuO CuMn oxides MnFe oxides . The performance of the CuO based material around 1.0 wt . of transferred O

@highlight Oxygen carriers OCs based on geopolymer and metal oxides were synthesized for CLOU.
@highlight OCs were tested by TGA at 700 900C in alternating inert and oxidizing atmospheres.
@highlight CuO based OC showed better CLOU performances 1 wt. carrying capacity .
@highlight Results were confirmed in fluidized bed reactor with high rate index.
@highlight OCs highlighted a good mechanical resistance from attrition and crushing tests.
