 To study the long term effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on traditional denitrification and phosphorus removal process different concentrations of PAHs were added into two sequencing batch reactors . Experimental results demonstrated that NAP and PHE had a positive influence on denitrification performance and that the total nitrogen efficiency was 79.59 with effluent less than 15mg L. However phosphorus removal performance began to deteriorate with 0.1mg NAP L and 0.2mg PHE L. Microbial community analysis revealed that phosphorus accumulating organisms were enriched in the NAP system compared to the PHE and blank test which led to a reduction in PO

@highlight The naphthalene NAP and phenanthrene PHE were first introduced into the denitrification and phosphorus removal system.
@highlight NAP and PHE could enhance the nitrogen removal.
@highlight The higher concentration of NAP and PHE deteriorated PO
@highlight  P removal.
@highlight Several functional bacteria were enriched in the SBR with NAP and PHE addition.
@highlight PHE could be degraded easily in the SBRs comparing with NAP.
