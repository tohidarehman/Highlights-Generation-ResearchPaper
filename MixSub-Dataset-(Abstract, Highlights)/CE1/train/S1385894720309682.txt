 The quest for high efficiency and earth abundant electrocatalysts replacing precious metals for water splitting is actively pursued for the future of hydrogen economy to wean us off the dependency on fossil fuel . Herein a moderate catalyst is constructed

@highlight Scalable synthesis of phosphide phosphorene heterostructures is demonstrated.
@highlight Tuneable valence modulation of Co P bonding and Co
@highlight  Co
@highlight couple can be achieved.
@highlight Water electrolysis at a low operation
@highlight at 1.666V with good stability can be realized.
@highlight Interface boosted water dissociation is studied by first principle calculation.
