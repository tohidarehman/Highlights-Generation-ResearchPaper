 Reverse osmosis is commonly used to concentrate solutions in food preparation and environmental applications among others . Limitations on the applied pressure which must be higher than the osmotic pressure of the feed solution determine the concentration that can be achieved by RO . Recently an osmotically assisted reverse osmosis system that can be operated even with low applied pressure has been suggested as a new concentration process . In this study we performed concentration tests on a multistage OARO system that used two types of hollow fiber membrane modules made from cellulose triacetate with different numbers of HFs . Water permeated through the membrane and the concentration increased as it progressed through the modules even when using concentrated NaCl solutions with low applied pressures . The concentration increased in each of ten stages in a multistage concentration test . Water flux and concentration ratio were strongly influenced by the internal concentration polarization in the modules .

@highlight Two types of hollow fiber HF membrane modules with different numbers of HFs were used.
@highlight Feed solution was concentrated by the OARO process even using highly concentrated NaCl solutions and low applied pressures.
@highlight A multistage system produced a higher degree of concentration as compared with a single stage system.
@highlight Water flux and concentration ratio were influenced by the internal concentration polarization in the modules.
