 Quinoline a refractory organic pollutant in coking wastewater will harm human health and the environment if discharged directly . However if recycled it has considerable economic value . To realise the efficient and selective adsorption of quinoline from coking wastewater a novel magnetic surface molecularly imprinted polymer was prepared for the specific removal and recycling of quinoline using magnetic carbon nanospheres as a carrier quinoline as a template molecule and acrylamide as a functional monomer . The key preparation conditions were systematically optimised . The structure morphology and adsorption behaviours of SMIP MCNSs were investigated in detail . With an imprinted layer thickness of approximately 9nm SMIP MCNSs exhibits favourable magnetic responsivity good adsorption performance and reusability . Owing to the existence of imprinted cavities for an initial quinoline concentration of 50mg L

@highlight A magnetic carbon nanosphere based SMIP was prepared.
@highlight SMIP achieves the high selective adsorption of quinoline in water.
@highlight SMIP can be easily separated from liquid phase by magnetic field.
@highlight Performance of SMIP was proved by both adsorption capacity and PC.
