 Monoethylene glycol is a desiccant widely used in the Oil and Gas and Sugar Cane Alcohol industries and generates a large volume of MEG water mixture effluent . This original study explores the use of a new pilot scale distillation system for separating MEG from a MEG water mixture . The distillation tests were performed with a single tube falling film distillation column assisted by a thermosyphon system operating at atmospheric pressure . The results attained high MEG contents with a MEG loading of 66.00 yielding a MEG separation of 88.61 . Additionally a distillation arrangement with two single tube falling film distillation columns in series was able to reach values of separation similar to those used by companies in the Oil and Gas sector while operating at atmospheric pressure . It was also found that Destubcal Technology leads to a 46.93 reduction of the energy required and is more compact than a conventional industrial distillation column .

@highlight Falling film distillation integrated is offered for recovering MEG.
@highlight Effects of various inputs conditions on separation performance are studied.
@highlight Intensified falling film distillation was compared with the conventional process.
@highlight Energy consumption was by 47 in comparison to the conventional distillation.
