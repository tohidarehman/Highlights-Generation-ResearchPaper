 Aggregation induced emission photosensitizers with strong photosensitization perform well in efficient tumor photodynamic therapy . However small molecule AIE PSs will cause cytotoxicity of normal cells for the lack of targeting . Researchers used nanocarriers to improve the targeting of photosensitizers and reduce toxic side effects on normal tissues which would also bring about the safety problems of nanocarriers . In this study we developed a novel pH responsive carrier free AIE nano photosensitizer self assembled by amphiphilic AIE photosensitizer . This carrier free AIE NPS overcomed the safety problems of nanocarriers and the protonation and deprotonation of carboxyl groups of HD APNNA endowed the AIE NPS pH responsibility . Meanwhile The ROS production efficiency of AIE NPS is as high as 56.7 which is superior to the commonly used photosensitizers in clinic . As a result the AIE NPS showed a remarkable photodynamic therapeutic effect in vitro under white light 50mWcm
