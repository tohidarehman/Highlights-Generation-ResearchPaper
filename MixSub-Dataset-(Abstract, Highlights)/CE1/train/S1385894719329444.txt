 Low lithium ionic conductivity of the solid state electrolyte and large interface resistance have hampered the application of all solid state lithium batteries . Although various methods have been proposed to address these challenge a high efficient method still needs for all solid state batteries . For the first time that Pyrite FeS

@highlight The crystallization degree in the designed electrolyte was evaluated by solid state NMR.
@highlight The cathode doped electrolyte strategy reduced cathode electrolyte interfacial resistance.
@highlight The fabricated all solid state batteries presented higher initial capacity and better cycling stability.
