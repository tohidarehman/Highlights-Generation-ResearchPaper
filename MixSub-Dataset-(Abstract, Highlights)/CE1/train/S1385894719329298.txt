 Mercury emission derived from natural gas exploitation metal sintering coal gasification and combustion gold mining etc . has posed great threaten to the environment and human beings due to its volatility mobility toxicity and bioaccumulation in ecosystem and food chains . Adsorption using carbon materials is regarded as one of the most promising techniques for mercury emission control due to its simple equipment convenient operation high removing efficacy less secondary pollution etc . This review comments the new research progress of elemental mercury capture by novel carbon based sorbents in recent five years particularly emerging carbon materials such as bio chars graphene and graphene oxide carbon nanotubes and nanofibers carbon spheres carbon aerogels metal organic frameworks and graphitic carbon nitrides . The mercury removal performances and reaction mechanisms of diverse carbon based sorbents along with their merits and drawbacks are fully discussed which aims to strengthen the understanding of this emerging research topic and outline future research directions for the development of sustainable recyclable and cost effective carbon based mercury sorbents .
