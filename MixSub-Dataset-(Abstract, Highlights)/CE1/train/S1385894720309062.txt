 The hydrodeoxygenation reaction kinetics of lignin monomer model compound eugenol was systematically investigated over various commercially available catalysts typically used for lignin valorisation by hydrotreatment . The role of noble metals Pt Pd Rh Ru and non noble Ni and Cu on C was investigated in the previous studies while the present work is focused on the support Al
