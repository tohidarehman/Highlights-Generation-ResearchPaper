 Solid waste containing heavy metals halogens and other hazardous substances can cause harm to humans and environment . It is a central issue that how to treat solid waste effectively and harmlessly . Hydrothermal technology is a prominent method to treat solid waste and has attracting worldwide attentions . In the hydrothermal reaction water acts as a reaction medium which is clean and environmentally friendly . The high temperature and high pressure environment prompt various reactions occurring quickly and efficiently . The closed environment of the hydrothermal reactor is conducive to avoid secondary pollution . In this paper the concept and principle of hydrothermal technology are introduced and the applications on the treatment of solid waste are summarized from three angles of reduction detoxification and recycling . At the end of the paper we look forward to the future development of the hydrothermal technology applied on the solid waste treatment .

@highlight Hydrothermal technology is an environmentally friendly method used in the solid waste treatment.
@highlight This review completely covers the application from the respects of reduction detoxification and recycling.
@highlight This review proposes the future development of hydrothermal technology especially used in hazardous wastes.
