 The selective conversion of veratryl alcohol a model compound of lignin to produce veratraldehyde was investigated in a simple light driven system consisting of photosynthetic pigment chlorophyllin and VA. Irradiation experiments and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis indicated that light in the wavelength range of 310420nm induced the efficient conversion of veratryl alcohol to veratraldehyde . Results from differential pulse voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry indicated that light enhanced the two reduction peaks of chlorophyllin and boosted the photocurrent from 2.7 to 3.8A cm

@highlight Light induced selective conversion of VA to veratraldehyde by chlorophyllin.
@highlight Light enhanced reduction peaks of chlorophyllin and photoelectron transfer.
@highlight was produced via one electron reduction of triplet chlorophyllin.
@highlight play a leading role in the conversion of VA to veratraldehyde.
