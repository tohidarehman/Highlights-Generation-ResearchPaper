 Perfluorooctanoic acid is a widely used perfluorinated compound that causes hazards to human health and environment which is difficult to be removed by biological degradation . In this work we demonstrate a highly efficient PFOA degradation process integrated from photocatalysis ozonation and electrocatalysis with rGO BiOCl nanocomposites as catalysts . The PFOA removal ratio in 3h reaches unprecedentedly 95.4 superior to photocatalytic ozonation and photoelectro peroxone process . The mechanism of the enhanced catalytic activities has been detailedly investigated which lies in synergistic effects of photo generated hole h

@highlight A combined photo electrocatalytic ozonation is developed to remove PFOA up to 95.4 .
@highlight Synergistic effects of h
@highlight and

@highlight The novel rGO BiOCl catalysts offer high E
@highlight and effective charge carrier separation.
@highlight The degradation intermediates are identified and quantified to unravel the mechanism.
