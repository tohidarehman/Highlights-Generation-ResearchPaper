 Supercapacitors have emerged as appealing alternatives to rechargeable energy storage devices in renewable energy generation and storage systems due to their ultra high power characteristics . However their broad applications are hindered by their low energy density characteristic . Therefore the designs of electrodes with high rate and high specific capacitance and electrolytes with wide potential window are extremely crucial . A novel coreshell heterostructure TiNb
