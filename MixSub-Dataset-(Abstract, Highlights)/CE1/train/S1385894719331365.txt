 Two dimensional porous carbon materials are very promising for energy storage conversion due to their unique microstructure reasonable pore structure and excellent electrochemical properties . A green and facile in situ carbonization technique is innovated to prepare a unique porous lignin derived carbon quasi nanosheets with rational pore distribution large surface area and excellent conductivity . The lignosulfonate zinc oxalate composite was firstly self assembled by hydrophobic bond of the amphiphilic structure in lignosulfonate using ethanol water solvent without the need to use any toxic material followed by co pyrolysis at a high temperature with gas exfoliation and in situ templating of zinc oxalate . The resulting PLC exhibits a very high specific capacitance of 320F g at 1.0 A g and long cycling stability . In addition when assembling into symmetric supercapacitors in PVA KOH gel electrolytes PLC also shows a high specific capacitance of 274F g at 0.5 A g with excellent rate capability and a high specific energy density . These excellent electrochemical performances indicate that the as prepared PLC should hold great promise for the energy storage devices opening a new path for the preparation of advanced carbon electrode material and high value added utilization of biomass .
