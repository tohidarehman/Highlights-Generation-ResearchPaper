 This study aims to the industrial scale development of Bauxite Residue leaching for Scandium recovery by optimizing a hydrometallurgy method and taking account appropriate design concepts for process intensification . Approaching the design issue either by adapting arithmetic methods or using related software showed inconsistent convergence which is caused by the process particularities and non conventional characteristics . Seeking also for process economic viability typical cost based objective functions showed to deviate from optima with a real economic sense . To deal with both challenges necessary modeling simplification for advanced Leaching with Mineral Acids was made coupled with commercial economics and profit based objective functions . Under the design aspect additional constraints were introduced for the Pregnant Leach Solution that were arisen from the subsequent Resin ion eXchange and the avoiding of colloidal silica gel formation . The optimized leaching resulted to the highest possible solids to liquid ratio molarity for RX complying PLS and temperature for acceptable e.g .
