 A highly integrated process aiming electrical and heating power supply is proposed . Ethanol water and air at atmospheric conditions are considered as feedstocks . Main focus is put in process intensification through the use of parallel plate and membrane reactors allowing the combination of different process operations within the units . The electric power is generated by means of a PEM fuel cell which is fed with pure hydrogen produced by ethanol steam reforming with subsequent purification . Appropriate thermal integration is achieved both in the parallel plate units as well as in the membrane reactor . The high temperature of the streams exiting the reformer allows preheating the air to the combustion sections and the sweep gas to the membrane reactor improving the process integration and achieving an electrical production of 2.5kW . In addition a hot water stream is used to produce the cogeneration heat increasing the total thermal efficiency up to 56.3 .
