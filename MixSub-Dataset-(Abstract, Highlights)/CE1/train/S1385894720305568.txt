 In this paper the 2D high nitrogen triaminoguanidine glyoxal polymer has been used to dope HMX crystals . Various constraint TAGP doped HMX crystals with higher density and better stability have been obtained due to strong constraint interactions between dopant and HMX molecules . The structure and thermal reactivity properties of qy HMX are unexpectedly largely affected by a slight change in the way of co crystallization precipitation under the same precursor conditions . In particular the density of qy HMX could be largely changed in the range of 0.94gcm

@highlight A variety of novel hybrid qy HMX crystals with different structure have been prepared and evaluated.
@highlight The kinetics models governing the rate limiting thermolysis reactions are obtained.
@highlight The structure and thermal reactivity properties of qy HMX and corresponding mechanism are clarified.
