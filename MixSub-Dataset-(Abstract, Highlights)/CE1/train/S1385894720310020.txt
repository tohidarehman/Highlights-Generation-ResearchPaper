 Although an efficient charge transport is essential to high performance perovskite solar cells the serious charge trapping in perovskite films is still a barrier to improve the efficiency of PSCs . To overcome this issue we efficiently suppress the charge trapping by using polar compound materials to reduce defects and improve the match of work functions in PSCs . 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate BF

@highlight 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate is used to form an interfacial dipole layer.
@highlight Interfacial dipole layer decreases the surface potential of electron transport layers.
@highlight Triphenylphosphine oxide passivated the defects of perovskite films.
@highlight Power conversion efficiency of PSCs is improved from 18.7 to 21.1
