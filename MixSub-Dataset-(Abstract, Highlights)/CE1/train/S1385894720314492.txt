 Hydrogen evolution reaction on commercial precious metal catalysts in acid solution is a robust process but in alkaline media suffers from limitations in HER activity and stability because of the sluggish kinetics of water dissociation step on noble metal catalysts . Here carbon fiber supported porous nickel phosphide nanosheets have been used to decorate ruthenium nanoclusters

@highlight A facile electrodeposition process is used to decorate Ru NCs on P Ni
@highlight P NSs.
@highlight A well synergistic interaction between metallic Ni
@highlight P and Ru is clarified.
@highlight The
@highlight P Ru enables highly efficient and long stability towards alkaline HER.
