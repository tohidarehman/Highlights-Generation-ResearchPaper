 Mechanically durable superhydrophobic surfaces on cotton fabrics were fabricated by binding polystyrene nanoparticles onto fibers with aluminum phosphate followed by coating with polydimethylsiloxane as low surface energy substance . Decoration of nanoparticles roughened the fabric surface and coating with AP made stable the roughening structures . The as prepared fabric surfaces not only showed excellent stability to acid alkali salt organic solvent and UV irradiation but also could maintain their superhydrophobicity after abrasion of 2000 or laundering of 35 cycles . The combination of inorganic adhesives AP and organic PDMS greatly enhanced the mechanical stability of the superhydrophobicty of the cotton substrate . Meanwhile the obtained superhydrophobic fabrics showed excellent self cleaning property .
