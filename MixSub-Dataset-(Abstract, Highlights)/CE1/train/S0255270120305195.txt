 The present study investigates the intensification of gas dispersion in non Newtonian fluids using a coaxial mixer comprised of two pitched blade impellers and an anchor . The gas holdup was assessed for this aerated coaxial mixing system via electrical resistance tomography and computational fluid dynamics . The investigation aimed to find the effects of the impellers speed fluid rheology impeller pumping direction rotational mode and gas flow rate on the aeration efficiency of the coaxial mixers . It was found that the downward pumping and co rotating mode of the impellers resulted in having the highest gas holdup . Moreover the anchor speed of 10 rpm generated the highest gas holdup in downward pumping mode at a constant specific power consumption under all the aeration rates . In upward pumping system the CFD simulations confirmed the results of experiment showing that the anchor rotation deteriorated the gas circulation inside the tank resulting in a lower gas holdup compared to that achieved without anchor . The superiority of the downward pumping and co rotating mode was demonstrated by comparing the efficiency of different configurations in terms of gas holdup per specific power consumption . Empirical correlations for the gas holdup were developed for the configuration with the highest efficiency .
