 SnTe is an emerging lead free IVVI thermoelectric compound but the high hole concentration low Seebeck coefficient and high thermal conductivity limit its thermoelectric performance . In this work we investigated the effect of

@highlight  type AgBiSe
@highlight can effectively neutralize the excessive hole in
@highlight  type SnTe.
@highlight Moderate AgBiSe
@highlight alloying leds to valence band convergence effect.
@highlight is decreased by enhanced phonon scattering of point defect and nanoprecipitate.
@highlight Multiple effects of AgBiSe
@highlight alloying synergistically yield a
@highlight of 1.02.
