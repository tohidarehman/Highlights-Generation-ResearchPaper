 Catalytic denitrification is a promising technology for the removal of nitrate through its reduction by a reducing agent with the assistance of a catalyst . In this work the modification of the silica catalyst support surface with amino groups was found to effectively enhance both nitrate reduction activity and nitrogen selectivity of Pd

@highlight The silica catalyst support surface was modified with amino groups.
@highlight Pd
@highlight Cu
@highlight alloy bimetallic nanocatalyst was active for catalytic denitrification.
@highlight Enhanced nitrate nitrite reduction efficiency and N
@highlight selectivity were achieved.
@highlight In situ buffering effect was from amino groups to adsorb CO
@highlight to neutralize
@highlight OH group.
@highlight Recyclability was enhanced by hindering copper oxidation during catalyst collection.
