 Improving the conductivity stability of flexible conductors has a positive impact on the working performance and service life of portable electronic devices . However designing a conductor material with both conductivity stable and flexible performance is still not an easy task because of the conductive network damage under large deformation or high humidity conditions . Here we surmount this challenge by developing an interfacial assembly encapsulation integration strategy for the construction of flexible transparent and conductivity stable film . Under the synergistic effect of coordination complexation and hydrogen bonding silver nanowires are sandwiched encapsulated by regenerated cellulose film and poly poly nanosheets . The resulting hybrid film has a robust interfacial structure and prominently stable properties . Even when subjected to harsh condition such as a high moisture environment of 90 relative humidity and 65C temperature for up to 60days repeated bending for 500 times peeling over 400 times or soaking in water for 30days the film still exhibits a high and stable conductivity better than most previously reported values for AgNWs based films . With this strategy as base we demonstrate a flexible transparent and biocompatible strain to electricity sensor with high working stability and performance .
