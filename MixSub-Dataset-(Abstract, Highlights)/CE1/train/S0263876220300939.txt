 The consumption of vegetable oils has increased in recent years due to their nutraceutical properties . There is growing scientific research interest in the development of innovative efficient and sustainable extraction techniques capable of separating lipid fractions from vegetal matrices . In this study we introduce an innovative technique for extracting lipids from bilberry seeds that uses Norflurane a hydrofluorocarbon as the solvent under subcritical conditions . Preliminary extraction experiments were carried out using bilberry seeds in the waste material from the bilberry drupe valorization process . Different granulometric bilberry fractions were selected suitably crushed and sized prior to extraction . An extraction efficiency of 91 of the total lipid content was obtained for the ground fraction with grains 450710 m in size . The main fatty acids present in the lipid extracts were oleic linoleic and linolenic acids . The ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids was determined to be 11.63 with a 6 3 ratio of 1.06 .

@highlight The extraction process proposed uses Norflurane solvent under subcritical conditions.
@highlight Extraction experiments allowed an oil recovery from waste bilberry seeds.
@highlight Seeds must be grinded to improve the contact between solvent and the oily seeds.
@highlight Bilberry extracts showed a 6 3 ratio close to the optimal biological unit value.
