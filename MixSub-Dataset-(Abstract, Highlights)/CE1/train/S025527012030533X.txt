 The process of dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons has attracted a great interest due to the growing demand for monomers for main organic synthesis . Among them ethylene propylene and styrene occupy the leading positions . The efficiency of the dehydrogenation process was numerously shown to be significantly improved by the use of catalytic membrane reactors . Hydrogen elimination from the reaction zone shifts the equilibrium towards products thus increasing their yields . At the same time the amount of parallel by side reactions and consequently by side products can be varied substantially . In the present work the processes of ethane propane and ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in catalytic membrane reactors are theoretically compared in terms of efficiency and productivity . A two dimensional non isothermal stationary mathematical model of the catalytic membrane reactor was applied to perform the study . The reactor comprises inner hydrogen permeable tubes with a loaded dehydrogenation catalyst and outer tube . The shell compartment is filled with another catalyst for oxidation of flux hydrogen . It is evident that the heavier is a hydrocarbon the higher amount of by products is formed . Since the contribution of the coke formation process is being increased along with temperature diminishing of the reactor temperature by oxidation of flux hydrogen allows enhancing the target products yield .

@highlight The process of the hydrocarbons dehydrogenation in the membrane reactor is simulated.
@highlight The effectiveness of the process is estimated depending on the hydrocarbons nature.
@highlight The temperature profile along the reactor length is analyzed.
@highlight The heat released from the hydrogen oxidation compensates the heat consumption.
