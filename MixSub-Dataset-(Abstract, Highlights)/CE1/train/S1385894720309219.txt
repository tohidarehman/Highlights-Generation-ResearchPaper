 Alignment of anisotropic thermo conductive filler involving in plane or out of plane orientation is a significant strategy to extend thermal management applications of polymer materials while the impact of the anisotropic thermal conductivity on thermal management performance is still lack of thoroughgoing study . Herein a gradually thinning and re assembling method is reported to fabricate in plane and out of plane orientated polypropylene graphite and PP graphene composites whose anisotropy could reach 8.37 and directional thermal conductivity achieves more than 4W m K. Based on this a visualized study supported by infrared imaging and finite simulation analysis was carried out to investigate their thermal management performance for different applications . Results demonstrate that merely pursuing high directional thermal conductivity does not necessarily achieve optimal thermal management effect it is equally important to customize oriented structure according to application scenarios . Our out of plane orientated polymer composites are proved beneficial to quick heat dispassion along vertical direction making it perfect candidates as parallel thermal interface materials . However when applied to scenarios where heat is generated from localized regions this structure inevitably causes overheat due to the restricted heat flux while the in plane orientated composites show much better performance .

@highlight A thinning then reassemble strategy was reported to make anisotropic composites.
@highlight Their thermal management performance was evaluated through a visualized study.
@highlight High anisotropic thermal conductivity doesnt equal to good thermal management effect.
