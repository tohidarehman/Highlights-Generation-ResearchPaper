 In recent years ion exchange membranes with monovalent ion perm selectivity are highly desirable . Here two strategies were adopted simultaneously to prepare anion exchange membranes with excellent monovalent anion perm selectivity . One is to adjust membranes hydrophobicity by grafting single long chain tertiary amines of different alkyl chain lengths

@highlight Two strategies were adopted simultaneously to prepare the anion exchange membranes with excellent monovalent anion perm selectivity.
@highlight Tertiary amines of different alkyl chain lengths were grafted onto bromomethylated poly phenylene oxide backbones.
@highlight The membranes hydrophobicity was adjusted by changing the tertiary amine content and alkyl chain length.
@highlight Post treatments were used to regulate the membranes compactness.
