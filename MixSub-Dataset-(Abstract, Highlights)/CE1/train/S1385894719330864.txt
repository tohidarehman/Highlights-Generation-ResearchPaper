 The repair of chronic rotator cuff injury primarily depends on surgery to biomechanically strengthen the connection between the tendon and bone . There are numerous studies on tendon to bone healing to promote bone regeneration or collagen reconstruction in tendons . However chronic rotator cuff injuries are often associated with fat infiltration and few studies have taken this aspect into account let alone overcome the two challenges of bone healing and fat infiltration at the same time . Here inspired by the structure of cowpea

@highlight A novel bi lineage nanofiber mat for rotator cuff tissue repair was fabricated.
@highlight Li
@highlight @MSNs PEUU nanofibers mats showed high biocompatibility.
@highlight The mats also showed matched mechanical properties.
@highlight The fabricated mats inhibit of fat infiltration of the mats.
@highlight Improvement of tendon to bone healing of rotator cuff was also effective.
