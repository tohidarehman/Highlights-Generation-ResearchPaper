 Stabilizing the lithium anode while inhibiting the shuttle effect to achieve stable circulation under high sulfur loading is an inevitable problem for the commercialization of lithium sulfur batteries . A low cost of raw materials and a simple synthesis are also important prerequisites for product commercialization . In this paper zinc sulfide nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen doped 3D carbon nanosheets are proposed as modified separator materials . During high temperature carbonization of the carbon materials a zinc sulphide phase transition occurs resulting in an anion vacancy S

@highlight Zinc sulfide can catalyze the transformation of polysulfide.
@highlight The anion vacancy produced by the phase transition of zinc sulfide is helpful to capture polysulfide.
@highlight Carbon nanosheet skeleton is beneficial to the reuse of active substances.
@highlight ZnS NCNS can accommodate a cathode with high areal loading.
