 Biorefinery design problems that consider processing and supply chain together are generally large scale mixed integer linear programs that are computationally difficult to solve . This work considers one such large scale problem and proposes a solution method to solve it efficiently . The proposed method utilizes the Dantzig Wolfe decomposition framework and a novel heuristic to simplify the original problem . This simplification is done using the sub problem solutions obtained within the Dantzig Wolfe decomposition iterations . The resulting simplified problem can be easily solved using standard procedures to obtain the final solution for the original problem . The proposed method is observed to be up to 92 faster than the standard CPLEX MILP solver and can solve large scale problems which are not solvable using standard approaches . A large scale biorefinery design problem for the production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass in Maharashtra India is solved . For an ethanol demand of 20 million kg month the minimum ethanol cost was determined to be INR 47.4 per litre . This method enables the formulation of more comprehensive biorefinery design models and can be employed on similarly structured large MILP problems in other fields .
