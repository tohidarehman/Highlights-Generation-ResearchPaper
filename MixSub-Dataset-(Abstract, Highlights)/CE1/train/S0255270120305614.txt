 Pervaporation separation of acetone butanol ethanol aqueous mixture was studied to recover butanol . Polyphenylsulfone supported polydimethylsiloxane coated membranes were developed with polyvinylpyrrolidone additive and with two fumed silica fillers Aerosil R202 treated with polydimethylsiloxane and Aerosil R972 treated with dimethyldichlorosilane . Membranes were prepared with fillers in each layer of the membrane in both layers and without any filler to investigate the effect of the fillers on the membrane performance . Furthermore the effect of the thickness of each membrane layer was investigated . An increase in PDMS layer thickness promotes separation factor and suppresses flux while an increase in the PPSU layer thickness has an inverse effect . After pervaporation tests at various operating conditions the best PV performance was achieved with the membranes including R972 particles in the support layer . In the concentration range of 2 5 BuOH of feed the average separation factor increased from 7.6 to 30.6 and the average flux increased from 300 to 536g.m

@highlight Fumed silica incorporated PPSU PDMS composite membranes for butanol recovery.
@highlight R972 and R202 particles were used as fillers in each layer of the membranes.
@highlight Inclusion of R972 in PPSU layers enhanced the membrane performance in pervaporation.
