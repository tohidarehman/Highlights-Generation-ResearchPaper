 Membrane contactor is a technology that intensifies conventional absorption column . However liquid to gas ratios of membrane contactor in existing reports are much higher compared to CO

@highlight Deep CO
@highlight removal using high pressure membrane contactor was proven able to reduce CO
@highlight content to 0.005 mol level meeting requirement for atural Gas process.
@highlight Liquid phase mass transfer resistance was the highest compared to membrane phase and gas phase showing that liquid was the bottleneck for mass transfer.
@highlight High liquid velocity was favored for better liquid phase mass transfer resulted in high L G ratio in deep CO
@highlight removal using membrane contactor.
@highlight Liquid flow rate reduction could not reduce L G effectively as this led to more reduction in CO flux than L G.
@highlight Membrane module length increase was able to achieve 70 reduction in L G with only 16 reduction in flux offering lower energy consumption compared to conventional packed column in LNG process.
