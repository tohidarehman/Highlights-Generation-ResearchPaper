 Unilateral and bilateral substitution compounds named 4 methyl phenol and 4 methyl phenol have been synthesized basing on the preparation of copolymer . The morphology images show that the target molecules can aggregate and organize spontaneously in sulfuric acid solution at room temperature with the formation of spherical or ellipsoidal nano copolymers . And the effects of structure of synthesized compounds on copper corrosion inhibition are analyzed . The XPS study indicates that the organization of copolymers on the copper surface is mainly forced by the chemical adsorption that is the N heteroatom contained lone pair electrons can give electrons to the vacant orbital of copper as a result of forming the adsorbed protection layer . The electrochemical tests suggest that target copolymers show excellent corrosion protection performance for copper in 0.5M H

@highlight Two unilateral and bilateral substitution targets IMP DIMP were synthesized successfully.
@highlight Self aggregate nano copolymer was obtained in sulfuric acid solution.
@highlight The aggregates could self assemble on copper surface.
@highlight Target copolymer layer showed excellent corrosion protection performance.
@highlight The DIMPs had better corrosion inhibition efficiency than IMPs.
