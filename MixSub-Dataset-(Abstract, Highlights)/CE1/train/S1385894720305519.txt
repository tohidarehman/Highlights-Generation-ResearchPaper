 Convenient integration of high purity graphene film on industrial sized silicon wafer is highly desired for on chip electronics such as pulse energy harvesting capacitors . However current graphene materials usually need costly additional purification procedures to remove metallic impurities before use . Herein a purification integration technique is explored for graphene oxide by using the reverse migrations of metal ions and negatively charged GO sheets in water under electric fields and corresponding films are successfully deposited on 6 inch anodic silicon wafers in one step . Nearly 90 of metallic impurities could be removed for the electric field purified reduced graphene oxide film with the content of Cr as low as 10ppm . Owing to the high purity and the robust interface contact to silicon substrates the EPGF as capacitor electrodes delivered the minimal self discharging current of 0.11A and the highest working frequency of 18420.7Hz for graphene capacitors reported to date as well as maintaining normal areal capacitance . In contrast to the common strategy by increasing ion rate this study focuses on the improvement of electron rate by optimizing electronic interface contact which provides new insights for fabricating kilohertz graphene capacitors .
