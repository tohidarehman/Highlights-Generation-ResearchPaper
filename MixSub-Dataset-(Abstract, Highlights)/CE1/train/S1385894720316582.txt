 Artificial enzyme mimics have recently emerged as alternative biocatalysts for overcoming the intrinsic fragility of natural enzyme in practical applications . However current researches regarding mimetic enzymes are still confined to very few reaction types with artificial oxidoreductases as dominance . Herein inspired by nature we designed and fabricated a range of Zn Triazole coordination polymers that presented similar coordination structures with the active site of natural carbonic anhydrase . These synthesized compounds exhibited inherently mimetic function with natural CA for catalyzing the hydrolysis of

@highlight ZnTazs were designed and fabricated inspired by the geometric structure of natural CA.
