 Transition metals to activate peroxymonosulfate has promising prospect to remove emerging organic contaminants among which copper is an alternative because of its relatively high regulated concentration in drinking water and wide use of organic copper pesticide . Cu shows good performance on the activation of PMS while Cu is reported to have no ability to activate PMS which is the most stable valent in natural environment . In this study degradation of bisphenol A by Cu PMS process was significantly enhanced with involvement EGCG because Cu was transformed to Cu and chelated by EGCG . Batch experiments were conducted to investigate the impacts of Cu EGCG and PMS concentration and co existing components including natural organic matters alkalinity and chloride ion . The impacts of solution pH and dissolved oxygen on BPA degradation were also evaluated to interpret the roles of Cu and superoxide radical in Cu EGCG PMS process and the generated concentration of Cu was determined . Possible generation pathway of Cu were also proposed . By quenching experiment and electron paramagnetic resonance analysis hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical in Cu EGCG PMS process were confirmed to be main contributors for BPA degradation . Furthermore transformation products of BPA were identified and their respective eco toxicities were calculated . This work aims to unravel the interaction of EGCG and Cu and provide a deep insight to the copper conversion in the presence of EGCG and PMS .

@highlight Cu I showed better performance than Fe II to activate peroxymonosulfate.
@highlight EGCG can accelerate copper conversion from Cu II to Cu I .
@highlight play an important role during BPA degradation in Cu II EGCG PMS process.
@highlight SO
@highlight  HO
@highlight  and Cu III are main contributor to BPA degradation in this process.
