 Seeking effective strategy to design multifunctional materials for pollutant removal and solar fuel production is of great significance for solving the worldwide environment and energy problems . In this work two dimensional porous graphite like carbon nitride p g C

@highlight 2D p g C
@highlight NSs were hybridized with 3D hierarchical TiO
@highlight MFs via hydrothermal route.
@highlight 2D p g C
@highlight exhibits extraordinarily selective adsorption towards anionic dye.
@highlight TiO
@highlight  p g C
@highlight HAs show enhanced photocatalytic TC degradation and CO
@highlight reduction.
@highlight Porous nanostructure heterojunction and C vacancy cause the boosted photoactivity.
