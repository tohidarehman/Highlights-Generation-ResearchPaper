 In recent years metal free carbocatalysis and persulfate based advanced oxidation processes have appealed much attention due to the high efficiency and environmental sustainability . This study aimed to investigate catalytic performance of carbon nanofibers on persulfate for removal of 2 4 dichlorophenol and elucidate the intrinsic mechanism of PS activation . Singlet oxygen

@highlight generation was the dominant pathway for nonradical activation of PS using CNF.
@highlight Defective edges and vacancies were respectively favorable to electron transfer and PS adsorption.
@highlight Higher state density and lower work function led to a lower electron excitation energy barrier.
