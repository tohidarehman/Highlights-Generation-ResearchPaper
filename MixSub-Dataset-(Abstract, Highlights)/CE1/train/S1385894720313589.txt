 This study elucidates volatile fatty acids accumulation reasons during organic solid wastes degradation via kinetics and thermodynamics assessments of degradation mechanisms of representative VFA under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions . Acetate exhibited the highest maximum microbial specific growth rates of 0.18 d

@highlight The effects of temperature on the methanogenic mechanism of VFAs were investigated.
@highlight Kinetics and thermodynamics of VFAs degradation processes were compared.
@highlight Propionate showed self inhibition with increasing concentration.
@highlight Thermodynamic barrier was more obvious under thermophilic conditions.
