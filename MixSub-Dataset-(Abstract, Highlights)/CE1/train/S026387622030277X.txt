 The use of deep eutectic solvents as green solvents could solve at least some of the environmental problems associated with the chemical and petrochemical industry . This paper investigates the applicability of DES made of choline chloride and propylene glycol in a molar ratio of 1 3 for the removal of sulfur and nitrogen compounds from hydrocarbon mixtures . Extraction experiments were performed in quasi three component systems quasi seven component model systems and real fuel systems . All the experiments confirmed better solubility of pyridine and nitrogen compounds in the investigated DES indicating its potential use as a denitrification agent . The basic application physico chemical properties of the investigated DES were determined . Its applicability in multistage extraction processes was confirmed its extraction capacity was determined and the ability of its regeneration by evaporation was demonstrated . Liquidliquid equilibria in investigated quasi three component systems were described successfully by UNIQUAC activity coefficient model .
