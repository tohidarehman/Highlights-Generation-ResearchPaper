 Synthesizing high efficient oxygen reduction reaction catalyst is crucial for electrochemical technologies such as fuel cells . Herein we proposed a covalent organic polymers derived carbon with cobalt oxides incorporation as ORR electrocatalysts for fuel cells . The Co N C COPs was demonstrated to possess sufficient active sites and uniformly dispersed cobalt and nitrogen elements . The as prepared Co N C COPs at 800C showed the best ORR catalytic activity with a half wave potential and limiting current density 3.99mAcm

@highlight Facile synthesis of cobalt oxides incorporated covalent organic frameworks.
@highlight High catalytic activity poison tolerance and good durability of Co N C COPs.
@highlight Co N C COPs prepared at 800C exhibited the best ORR catalytic activity.
@highlight Power output of Co N C COPs cathode is similar to Pt C cathode in MFC and DFFC.
