 It is challenging to simultaneously improve the toughness and self healing ability of thermoplastic polyurethane due to mutually exclusive dependence on chain motion and hard phase . In this work a novel poly was synthesized by using 2 6 diamimopyridine and cystamine as chain extenders and subsequently complexed with Zn

@highlight 2 6 Diaminopyridine and cystamine based self healable PUU elastomers.
@highlight Hard phase is significantly influenced by formation of coordinative bonds.
@highlight Loosely packed hard segments facilitate self healability and toughening.
@highlight Coordinative bonds restricting chain dislocation contributes to toughening.
@highlight A self repairable and robust sensor with high sensitivity is explored.
