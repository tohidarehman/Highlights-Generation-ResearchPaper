 Sand is the most used filter adsorbent material in a drinking water treatment plant or household purpose filters . However sand poses challenge for the micropollutant removal in presence of metals natural organic matter total organic carbon ammonia and other macro pollutants . In this study sand was coated using laboratory synthesized graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide to enhance its surface properties in terms of hydrophobicity roughness and specific surface area 6 times higher for GO rGO as compared to 5.5m

@highlight Sand used as the filter media could only remove 20 MC LR during adsorption phase.
@highlight Bioaugmentation of rGO coated sand enhanced the MC LR removal by 45 .
@highlight GO coated sand showed a specific surface area of 33.8m
@highlight  g uncoated sand 5.5m
@highlight  g .
@highlight pi pi interaction and presence of C O C functional group enhanced the MC LR removal.
