 Polysulfone ultrafiltration membrane was modified by novel nanoporous SBA 16 COOH during the membrane preparation via the phase inversion . The pure water flux and bovine serum albumin flux were measured at 2 bar and the membranes antifouling behavior were analyzed . The membranes showed higher water flux after SBA 16 COOH addition up to 2 wt and after that the flux slightly decreased which is attributed to the aggregation of SBA 16 COOH particles at the higher concentrations . SBA 16 COOH addition improved the surface hydrophilicity and led to elongated finger like pores within the membranes cross section structure . The water flux after BSA flux was still higher than the one before BSA thereby SBA 16 COOH addition resulted in better antifouling properties . In terms of BSA rejection the nanocomposite SBA 16 COOH based membranes outperform the pristine PSf membrane with rejection values up to 98.9 . The water contact angle confirmed the enhanced hydrophilicity of the membranes surface due to
