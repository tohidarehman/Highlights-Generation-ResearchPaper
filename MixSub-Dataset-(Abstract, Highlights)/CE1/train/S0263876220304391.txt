 In this study two machine learning based regression models are developed to predict diameters of single bubbles in a bubble column reactor based on wire mesh sensor measurement . Both Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression and a regression tree algorithm are used to predict bubble diameter with supervised learning techniques . Measurements are carried out in a DN150 column filled with deionized water and air as the continuous phase while WMS passage of single bubbles is investigated . A novel method for definition of different labels characterizing the passing bubble is introduced . Based on the defined labels Machine Learning regression models are developed to predict bubble sizes . Methods for dimensionality reduction are applied allowing for an investigation of each labels influence on model prediction quality . Both regression models perform similar or better than well established approaches to calculate bubble diameter based on WMS measurement . As a highlight it is shown that bubble diameters even below the sensors spatial resolution can be predicted with an accuracy of 13 using the regression tree model which is about 1 3 of the conventionally assumed measurement uncertainty at bubble diameters below the sensors spatial resolution .
