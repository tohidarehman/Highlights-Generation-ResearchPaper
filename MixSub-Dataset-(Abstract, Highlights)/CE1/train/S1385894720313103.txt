 Smart devices based on paper based composite materials are attracting increasing attention for applications in wearable and flexible energy storage and strain sensors due to their outstanding flexibility and light weight properties . Although the paper materials are modified by various methods to overcome the shortcomings of poor conductivity and obtain various smart properties the functionalized paper based materials generally have poor swelling mechanical strength and cycle stability in the electrochemical process which seriously affects the application of paper based devices in energy storage . Herein for the first time a new class of symmetrical integrated smart paper based supercapacitors with binder free was fabricated by incorporating vitrimer into original paper with pencil drawing loading polyaniline nanofibers . The resultant

@highlight A smart integrated bifunctional paper based device is fabricated.
