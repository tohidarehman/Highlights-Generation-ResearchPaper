 This work explores the ignition mechanism of silicon based thermites and it is supposed that the phase change of silica SiO

@highlight The combustion behavior and ignition mechanism of several Si based thermites were investigated.
@highlight The incorporation of Ti nanoparticles reduced the ignition temperature of Si KClO
@highlight The enhanced reactivity of Si KClO
@highlight has been shown via adding Ti nanoparticles.
@highlight The combustion efficiency of Si Ti KClO
@highlight has been improved compared to Si KClO
