 Permanganate bisulfite process is a novel advanced oxidation process for degradation of micro pollutants in water wastewater treatment . The abatements of iopamidol metribuzin and phenol by the PM BS process after 15s were 65 99 and 99 respectively while no obvious abatements were observed with PM or BS alone . These accelerated degradations by the PM BS process were attributed to the formations of Mn sulfur radical SO

@highlight DO governed removal of micro pollutants in PM BS process.
@highlight Formed Mn III SO
@highlight and HO
@highlight contributed to the accelerated degradation.
@highlight Mn III is the oxidation product of Mn II by SO
@highlight Actual DO consumption in the presence of micro pollutants is proposed 1.5 PM
