 Compartment models are widely used to capture typical hydrodynamic features of systems generally having low computational cost . The main building blocks of the CMs are the continuous stirred tank reactor and plug flow reactor models . In this study the hydrodynamics of two laboratory scale continuously oscillated baffled crystallizer systems were investigated the commercially available DN15 and a scaled down version known as the DN6 . CM structures were identified based on residence time distribution measurements by direct fitting method for both the DN6 and DN15 systems which showed superior performance compared to the traditional tank in series CM structure determination . To attain a more accurate CM calibration the piston and pump flowrates obtained by the typical peristaltic pump configurations were thoroughly analyzed .
