 In this study the impact of multi jet structure on the gas solid flow in a three dimensional integral multi jet spout fluidized bed was investigated using both numerical and experimental methods . Particle Image Velocimetry was applied to analyze the difference made by integral multi jet to the movement of particles in a 152 mm diametered spouted bed . The Eulerian Eulerian approach was adopted . Compared with the conventional spouted bed the addition of the side jet facilitates particles to generate a substantial amount of secondary eddies and the movement of particles can be effectively enhanced in the cross section of the multi jet spout fluidized bed . When the number of side jets approached N 18 the particle concentration in the annulus region was shown to to be extremely low . Considering the pressure drop of the spouted bed the comprehensive optimum number of side jet of spouted bed was set to N 24 . Besides there existed an optimum side jet diameter D 4mm at which the side jet exerted the optimal fluidizing effect on the gas solid two phase flow in the multi jet spout fluidized bed . The distribution structure of the side jets with lower density upper sparseness and symmetry contributed to the local fluidization of the inlet gas in the dead zone and Case D demonstrated the full fluidizing effect on the particles in the multi jet spout fluidized bed .
