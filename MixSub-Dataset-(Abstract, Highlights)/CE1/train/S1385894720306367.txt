 Oxygen anion intercalation type supercapacitors are promising charge storage devices . In this study by taking advantage of the capability of selective exsolution of elements from perovskite lattice a nanoparticles modified perovskite composite is developed as new perovskite based electrode for supercapacitor with further improved performance that allow the energy storage via two different mechanisms i.e . Faradaic surface redox pseudocapacitance and oxygen anion intercalation pseudocapacitance . The derived supercapacitor shows high power density and energy density and no surface activation process and stable performance . Specifically perovskite oxides with the nominal composition of Sr
