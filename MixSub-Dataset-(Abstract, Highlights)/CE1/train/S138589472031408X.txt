 Black phosphorus are shining for its promising properties . Due to the instability and agglomeration problem the surface coordination strategy is a key point in practical applications . Herein a ruthenium sulfonate ligand is synthesized to coordinate black phosphorus nanosheets . By virtue of Ru P coordination the lone pair electrons in BP are occupied thus the RuL

@highlight Black phosphorene was successfully coordinated by a ruthenium sulfonate ligand.
@highlight Excellent stability in environment was obtained.
@highlight Dramatically improved flame retardant efficiency was achieved.
@highlight Significantly enhanced thermal conductivity with small amount.
