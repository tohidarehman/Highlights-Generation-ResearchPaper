 In this study food waste was added into source diverted blackwater to enhance biomethane production using an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor at 35C . Increasing amount of FW was introduced into the BW according to the BW FW volatile solids mixing ratios ranging from 1 0.3 to 1 1.5 . The optimal biomethane recovery efficiency was achieved when BW FW VS mixing ratio was 1 1 corresponding to an organic loading rate of 10.0 kg chemical oxygen demand m

@highlight Bioenergy recovery from blackwater is promoted by co digestion with food waste.
@highlight Co digestion achieved highest CH
@highlight production of 2.42 L L d reported to date.
@highlight Co substrate increased CH
@highlight yield and hydrolysis by 40 and 86 over blackwater only.
@highlight Food waste stimulated microbial activities on both hydrolysis and methanogenesis.
