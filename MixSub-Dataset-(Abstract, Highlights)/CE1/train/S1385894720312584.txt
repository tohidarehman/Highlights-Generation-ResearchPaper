 Gas injection as a method for natural gas hydrate exploitation has attracted much attention because of its advantages of low energy consumption and non destructive characteristics . The gas recovery can be significantly enhanced by adding small molecule gases such as N

@highlight  H
@highlight did not enter the CH
@highlight hydrate cages and participate in the hydrate formation.
@highlight The addition of small molecule gases made the CH
@highlight hydrate become more unstable.
@highlight has a more significant effect on the decomposition of CH
@highlight hydrate than N
@highlight There exists larger diffusion coefficient of H
@highlight in hydrate phase than that of N
