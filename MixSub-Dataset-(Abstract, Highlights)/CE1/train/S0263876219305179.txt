 The luminescent solar concentrator based photomicroreactor is a novel technology applied to the synthesis of chemicals coupling the advantages of sunlight modulation concentration and microflow chemistry . In this work a virtual model of this device based on computational fluid dynamics was implemented . The CFD model was developed considering a kinetic law that takes into account the effect of light intensity on the reaction performance for the 4
