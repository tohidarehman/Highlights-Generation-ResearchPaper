 Potassium ion batteries have been considered as promising candidates for large scale energy storage due to their high operating voltage and low cost . Nevertheless the inferior cycling stability and rate capability of cathode materials hinder their practical applications . Herein we synthesized P3 type K

@highlight P3 type KMNCO microspheres has been synthesized by solvent thermal method.
@highlight The hierarchical structure of S KMNCO can facilitate potassium ion transport.
@highlight The hierarchical structure of S KMNCO can withstand high stress during cycling.
@highlight S KMNCO shows better rate capability and cycling stability.
@highlight S KMNCO exhibits higher volumetric energy density.
