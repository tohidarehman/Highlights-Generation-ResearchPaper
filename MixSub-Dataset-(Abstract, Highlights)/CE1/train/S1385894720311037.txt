 Two dimensional MXene as an important member of the emerging 2D nanomaterials has received much attention in recent years especially in energy related fields . Unfortunately the controllable synthesis of high purity MXenes in a scalable way is still a challenge due to the usual utilization of hazardous etching agents . It is highly desired that a simple controllable and effective approach is available for producing MXene in a green manner . In this work an innovative thermal reduction strategy is proposed for the fabrication of MXenes from the corresponding sulfur containing MAX phases in which the weakly bonded S atoms react with hydrogen to form a volatile gas and leave 2D graphene like Ti
