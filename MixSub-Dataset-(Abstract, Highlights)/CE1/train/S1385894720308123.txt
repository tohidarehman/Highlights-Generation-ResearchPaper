 Developing bio based absorbents with high removal capacity towards heavy metals is one of the key strategies to manage water pollution worldwide . Robust cellulose aerogel beads with high amine content were prepared by cross linking polyethylenimine to cellulose nanofibrils using 3 glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane . The mass ratio between PEI and GPTMS crosslinking mechanism morphologies elemental compositions total amine contents mechanical strengths as well as the adsorption capacity and kinetic of the aerogel beads were investigated . Small CGP beads possessed several desirable characteristics such as high amine group content large maximum Cu adsorption capacity very fast adsorption rate high shape recovery robust mechanical strength and they could be regenerated and reused .

@highlight One pot synthesis of cross linked aerogel beads.
@highlight Efficient adsorption of copper ions by the beads.
@highlight Mechanical testing confirmed beads were robust.
@highlight Aerogel beads could be regenerated and recycled.
