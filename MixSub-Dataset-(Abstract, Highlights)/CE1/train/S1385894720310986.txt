 Tremendous interests have been aroused in exploring efficient and readily prepared barcode particles with information coding and specific identification features for biomedical analytical applications . Here we propose a novel type of barcode for optical encoding and fluorescence enhancement via depositing quantum dots on natural pollens intermediated by a polyelectrolyte layer . The exquisite prickly surface morphology and an intrinsic high surface to volume ratio of the pollens resulted in a fluorescence enhancement due to which a much lower detection limit was reached . Besides the easily tunable fluorescence peak and intensity of QDs and the repeatable deposition process allowed for the generation of coding combinations for the simultaneous determination of multiple targets . These features endow the QD coated pollens extraordinary barcodes for applications in multiplexed bioassays .
