 A graphite felt electrode with electrode aeration was used for the Electro Fenton treatment of dimethyl phthalate wastewater . At pH 3.0 removal efficiencies of 200mg L DMP and solution TOC by EA were 50.0 and 55.4 higher than solution aeration respectively . At pH 4.0 and 5.5 EA showed 36.456.1 and 9.435.7 higher removal for 2050mg L DMP and TOC than SA respectively . High effective degradation performance of EA was attributed to the enhanced mass transfer of O

@highlight GF EA showed significantly the enhanced Electro Fenton performance.
@highlight The in situ collection of iron sludge by EA for reuse avoided its disposal.
@highlight EA regenerated the poisoning electrode at large air flux.
@highlight EA significantly enhanced the mass transfer of system.
