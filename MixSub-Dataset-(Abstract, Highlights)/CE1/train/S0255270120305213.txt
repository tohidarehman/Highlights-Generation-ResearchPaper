 Dioctyl phthalate is a widely used efficient plasticizer with great stability to heat and ultraviolet light as well as the compatibility to use with PVCs resin . In this work the process intensification of reactive extraction strategy is proposed to promote DOP synthesis in a biphasic system with the halogen free deep eutectic solvent as dual solvent catalyst . First the bifunctional effects of DES which consists of imidazole and

@highlight Reactive extraction concept was proposed to synthesize DOP using bifunctional DES.
@highlight The reaction kinetics were investigated to obtain the activity based PH model.
@highlight The activity coefficients and LLE were calculated by COSMO RS.
@highlight The schematic of multi stage reactive extraction was developed.
