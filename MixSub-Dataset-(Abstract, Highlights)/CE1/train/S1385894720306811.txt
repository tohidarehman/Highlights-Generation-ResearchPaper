 We present a new strategy for improving the electrochromic properties of single layered ion gels for electrochromic devices by incorporating octa hexyl viologen substituted polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane . Newly synthesized OHV POSS was included in ion gel compositions containing a poly copolymer and ionic liquid to produce a freestanding film . When applied in single layered ECDs due to high ionic conductivity and fast charge transfer the OHV POSS film exhibited outstanding electrochromic performances with low redox potentials at 1.1V high transmittance changes of 56.1 and a moderate coloration efficiency of 124.1cm
