 The ecological and human health threats brought by emerging pollutants are increasingly serious . Development of efficient removal methods is urgent . Herein seven deep eutectic solvents composed by quaternary ammonium salts and lactic acid or glycolic acid were synthesized and used to regulate magnetic Fe

@highlight A new strategy for regulating MUiO 66 NH
@highlight by DESs was proposed.
@highlight A green adsorption PPCPs method based on DES MUiO 66 NH
@highlight adsorbents was established.
@highlight The selectivity of DES MUiO 66 NH
@highlight toward PPCPs was determined by the structures of DESs.
@highlight The regulatory mechanism of DESs on PPCPs adsorption was explored.
