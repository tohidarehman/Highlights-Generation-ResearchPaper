 The heat integrated distillation column has great advantage in energy saving but its complex dynamics make the control design difficult . A sensitive stage temperature control scheme with adaptively corrected set points is proposed for the high purity control of a heat integrated distillation column . First to guarantee the rationality of the set point correction the temperature profile movement situation mainly including the functions of the temperature profile and its moving velocity is developed to describe the dynamics of the system . The temperature profile function expresses the shape of the stage temperature distribution and the moving velocity of the temperature profile denotes the changes of the profile position . Then a modified principal component analysis method is used to select the temperature measurement locations and the profile parameters in the profile function are estimated based on the selected measurements . Finally a control scheme with corrected set points is proposed based on the estimate and the profile movement and comparative simulation results show the validity of this control scheme .

@highlight The temperature profile movement is investigated to describe the dynamics of the HIDiC.
@highlight The profile parameters are estimated based on the measurements selected by a combination of PCA and relative distribution.
@highlight A control scheme with corrected set points is proposed based on the estimate and the profile movement.
