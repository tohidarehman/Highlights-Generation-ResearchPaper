 The effect of droplet conductivity on electrocoalescence phenomena is studied experimentally for droplet in oil system in an anchored drop setup . Phase diagrams representing the coalescence non coalescence behaviour under DC electric field are constructed for three different droplet conductivities . Variation in droplet conductivity and separation distance between droplets do not influence critical electrocapillary number . The critical electrocapillary number varies with oil viscosity . Non coalescence is not observed for low conductivity 1.5

@highlight Regimes in phase diagrams exhibiting the behaviour of oppositely charged anchored droplet in oil systems change with droplet conductivity.
@highlight Non coalescence mechanism for oppositely charged anchored droplet in air systems changes with droplet conductivity.
@highlight The critical electrocapillary number for oppositely charged anchored droplets in oil system is not influenced by change in droplet conductivity.
@highlight Variation in oil viscosity has no influence on non coalescence mechanism.
@highlight Droplet splitting is suppressed by high viscosity oil.
