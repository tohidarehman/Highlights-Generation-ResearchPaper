 Microbubbles have received great interest in the flotation of fine particles . A membrane distributor is developed to generate microbubbles for the flotation of fine apatite particles . Massive microbubbles are continuously formed under the shear flow in the membrane tube . Compared with a Venturi tube the membrane distributor achieves better performance in P

@highlight Microbubbles generated by membrane intensify the flotation of fine apatite particles.
@highlight CFD simulations are performed to reveal the effect of inclined plates.
@highlight The apatite recovery is enhanced by the inclined plates.
