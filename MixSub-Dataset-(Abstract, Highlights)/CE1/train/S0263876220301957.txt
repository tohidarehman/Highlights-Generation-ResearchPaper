 Iron ore tailing as a solid waste has attracted attention worldwide owing to the potential safety hazards and waste of resources . However few studies focused on exploiting the structural characteristics of IOT . IOT is a special silicate mineral mixture composed of for example quartz anorthite microcline and clinochlore which contain adjustable silica tetrahedron structures . In our research Mn

@highlight A functional value added utilization method of iron ore tailing IOT was proposed.
@highlight Manganese silicate MS composites were first synthesized by solid waste IOT.
@highlight The structure transformation from IOT to MS composites was researched.
@highlight The target of using waste to treat waste was achieved.
