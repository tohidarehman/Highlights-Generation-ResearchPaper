 The amphiphilic copolymer polystyrene maleic anhydride 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate was synthesized for the first time in this study and used as a linker to graft zwitterionic sulfobetaine methacrylate in order to enhance the hydrophilicity and anti adsorption ability of polyvinylidene difluoride membranes . This amphiphile linker is composed of a hydrophobic extremity i.e . the SMA copolymer and a hydrophilic extremity i.e . the HEA . The SMA HEA linker was first dispersed into the PVDF matrix via the blending method and the hydrophobic polystyrene of SMA was adsorbed into the PVDF membrane via hydrophobichydrophobic interaction . The SBMA was then grafted onto the expanded HEA via free radical polymerization . The functional groups morphologies and hydrophilicity of the amphiphile modified PVDF membranes were analyzed by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy field emission scanning electron microscopy and water contact angle measurements . The PVDF membrane modified with the SMA HEA amphiphile linker showed significant enhancement in hydrophilicity as the WCA decreased from 135.0 to 45.0 and the protein adsorption of the modified membrane decreased from 112.5 to 33.3
