 Removal of thorium ions from aquatic media using high effective adsorbents is a very convenient viewpoint for the management of environmental pollutants . With this respect this study is aimed to facile synthesize carbon nanofiber modified polymer as a novel material for ultra adsorption of thorium from aquatic media . The prepared CNF ETA TMC composite polymer adsorbent was characterized by FTIR and SEM EDX techniques . The effective experimental parameters on the adsorption performance were optimized with factorial design analysis . The Langmuir modeling results showed that the CNF ETA TMC ultra removal adsorption capacity of 867.9 mg g
