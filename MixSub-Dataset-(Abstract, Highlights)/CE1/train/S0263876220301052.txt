 Polymeric membranes are widely applied in water and wastewater treatment . During membrane filtration membrane hydrophilicity is essential for both membrane flux and fouling resistance and sufficient mechanical strength is also critical for enduring various operational condition . In the last 10 years mussel inspired chemicals have become a promising strategy for membrane modification due to their universality and versatility . Simply immersing membranes into a basic dopamine solution can induce a hydrophilic PDA layer on the membrane surface . Both the mechanical properties and the hydrophilicity of polymeric membranes are altered via this adhesion procedure . This review aims to expand the general vision on controlling PDA based hydrophilic modification including influential factors of dopamine self polymerization and the deposition behavior on different types of membranes . In addition advanced dopamine based hydrophilic modification is also reviewed where PDA serves as a filler or an intermediate layer to optimize the membrane separation performance . Finally some critical unsolved challenges are discussed and possible directions of further research on mussel inspired PDA modification of polymeric membranes are proposed .
