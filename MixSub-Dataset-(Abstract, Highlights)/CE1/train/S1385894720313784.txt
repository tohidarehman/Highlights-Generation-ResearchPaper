 Recovering lithium from natural sources such as seawater is a sustainable alternative to meet its high demands . Li recovery from seawater must be enhanced to attain economic efficiency . In this work the potential of enhancing Li recovery from seawater by acid treated manganese oxide ion sieve is evaluated by increasing Li concentration in seawater using direct contact membrane distillation and reducing competitive ions . DCMD achieved enhanced water recovery upon pre treatment with oxalic acid compared to caustic soda ash and without pre treatment . Caustic soda ash required Na addition in alkaline condition for Ca removal while oxalic acid removed Ca in acidic condition without any inorganic ion addition . The low ion concentration in acidic condition upon oxalic acid pre treatment enabled DCMD to concentrate seawater to high levels increasing Li concentration by 7 times . In Li solution HMO achieved a maximum adsorptive capacity Langmuir Q

@highlight Oxalic acid efficiently removed Ca from seawater without any added ion residues.
@highlight MD obtained 8690 water recovery and concentrated Li with oxalic acid seawater.
@highlight In seawater Li uptake by H form manganese oxide sieve HMO was reduced due to Mg.
@highlight HMO maintained high Li uptake in seawater upon Mg removal in alkaline condition.
@highlight Seawater treatment in stages recovered water Li and other resources Ca and Mg.
