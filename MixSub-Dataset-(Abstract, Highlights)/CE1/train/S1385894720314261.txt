 The preparation of surface enhanced Raman scattering substrate with both structural stability and SERS activity under extreme pH conditions faces several problems including tedious preparation time consuming processes high cost and the need for professional equipment and personnel . Herein a facile preparation protocol for a large scale nanoarray film substrate was developed for multi purpose SERS sensing . Through a simple self assembly process under specific conditions well ordered highly sensitive structurally tunable acid alkali resistant and disposable

@highlight Tunable structural
@highlight coralloid nanoarrays for multi purpose SERS sensing is proposed.
@highlight Synthesized nanoarrays show excellent sensitivity and reproducibility as SERS substrate.
@highlight The nanoarrays maintain its original morphology and SERS activity over a wide pH range.
