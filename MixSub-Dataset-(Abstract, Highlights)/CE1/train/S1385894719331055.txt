 The work presented that by regulating the proportion between cobalt and 2 methylimidazole in distilled water a series of Co based imidazolate framework compounds with diverse shapes were synthesized at ambient temperature . The morphology and structural characteristics of the compounds were surveyed by scanning electron microscope energy disperse spectra powder X ray diffraction and N
