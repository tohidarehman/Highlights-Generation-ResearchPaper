 Ionic liquid based polymer inclusion membranes are an environmentally benign separation technology . PIMs are especially suitable for separation of dilute substances but their application is hindered by their relatively low permeability rate . In this paper a novel ionic liquid based PIM system integrated with an electroplating unit was developed to improve the permeability of gold from aurocyanide solutions . Under the optimal conditions 98.6 of gold was transported and more than 96.4 of gold was simultaneously deposited on the copper cathode . The gold transport rate was considerably enhanced with in situ electrodeposition of gold in the stripping phase . With a constant voltage of 1.50
