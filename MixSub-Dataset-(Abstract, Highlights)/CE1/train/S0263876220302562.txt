 This work was undertaken to determine whether thermodynamic calculations can predict the amount and composition of ash produced by combustion of nickel hyperaccumulator plants in the context of agromining . To this end three HA plants containing about 1

@highlight The combustion of nickel hyperaccumulator plants for agromining is investigated.
