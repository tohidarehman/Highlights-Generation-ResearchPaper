 In this paper the desulfurization of a model diesel fuel containing thiophene and or benzothiophene using an electrochemical membrane reactor was studied using commercial Nafion and synthesized sulfonated poly ether ether ketone with the same 40

@highlight Fabrication and performance assessment of electrocatalytic membrane ECMR using membrane electrode assembly made of Nafion and synthesized SPEEK integrated with carbon supported electrocatalyst.
@highlight Examination of ECMR regarding ionic conductivity and ion exchange capacity and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
@highlight Disclose the hydrogenation and or direct desulfurization mechanism of benzothiophene and thiophene in electroreduction using the ECMR.
@highlight Finding appropriate current density for benzothiophene and thiophene with respect to the maximum desulfurization efficiency and yield of products.
