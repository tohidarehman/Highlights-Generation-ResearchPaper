 Catalytic oxidation of methane is critical for exhaust after treatment systems where cold start emissions and lean combustion still pose serious challenges . In this work the effect of support materials on the complete catalytic oxidation of methane over palladium is studied in dry and wet conditions . A series of metal oxides CeO

@highlight Development of active and stabile Pd catalyst supported on Zr and Ce promoted SiO
@highlight for lean methane oxidation.
@highlight Addition of Zr and Ce induces the dispersion and reducibility of active PdOx species.
@highlight The promoted catalyst remained active for 35h of time on stream in aggressive conditions.
@highlight The Catalyst composition wt of 1.0 Pd Zr
@highlight Ce
@highlight  n Si
