 A mathematical model of coupled momentum and mass transfer including thermal degradation of trans resveratrol from grape cane powder was developed . The experimental results which were used for model validation were based on a solid liquid extraction study which was previously conducted using a semi continuous pressurized low polarity water column extraction system . During extraction the system is considered to work under isothermal and steady state conditions regarding heat and momentum transfer . Verification of those assumptions is also obtained by the simulation of related time dependent physics . The used mathematical models are based on macroscopic porous medium approach with volume averaged physical properties . The resulting equations were solved using Finite Element Method by COMSOL Multiphysics version 5.3a . The model enables the prediction of the temperature distribution at pre heating period and concentration and degradation of trans resveratrol in the column . The model can also simulate the changes in temperature and ratio of ethanol in the aqueous extraction solvent .

@highlight A model consisting of heat mass momentum transfer with thermal degradation is developed for a semi continuous PLPW system.
