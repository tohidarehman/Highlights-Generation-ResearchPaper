 The side reactor concept comprising a non reactive column coupled with side reactors is proposed for the synthesis of ethylene glycol by ethylene oxide hydration . Parallel isothermal continuous stirred tank reactors are employed and the combinations of the reactors and the column are cautiously examined . A preliminary analysis of the operating conditions for the reaction and separation and the detailed SRC configurations are performed to generate the suggested values or ranges for their further optimization . The decisive variables are subsequently optimized by a sequential design procedure . The significant effects of the key decision variables on the trade off between the reaction cost and the separation cost are well investigated . The reactorseparation unit configured with a total liquid withdrawn and recycled back to the column stage below demonstrates better system performance . Furthermore the reaction at elevated temperature conductive for reaction and the separation occurring at the distillation temperature range of 106204C gives out improved economic performance . Flexibility in the operating conditions in SRC makes it a competitive alternative to the RD process for EG production .
