 Immunotherapy has been a promising candidate for cancer treatment . The combination of photothermal therapy and immunotherapy have shown to cause tumor ablation and induce host immune response . However this strategy is often hampered by a limited immune response and undesirable immunosuppression . In this work we developed an immunologically modified nanoplatform using ovalbumin coated PEGylated MnFe

@highlight Immunologically modified MnFe
@highlight NPs were constructed for combined PTT and immunotherapy.
@highlight The MnFe
@highlight NPs elicited strong immune responses

@highlight The MnFe
@highlight NPs based PTT effectively inhibited tumor growth and lung metastases.
@highlight The feasible mechanism for combined PTT and immunotherapy was clearly described.
@highlight The MnFe
@highlight NPs showed as a desirable MR contrast agent for tumor imaging.
