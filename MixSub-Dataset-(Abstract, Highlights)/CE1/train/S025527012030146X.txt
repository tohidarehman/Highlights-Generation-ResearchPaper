 Blast furnace slag is a typical main by product of iron making and possesses a large amount of sensible heat from the blast furnace which accounts for nearly 30 of the total energy consumption of the steel industry . The waste heat recovery is of great significance for energy savings and emissions reduction for the iron and steel industry . The moving bed reactor is the most effective dry waste heat recovery device and plays a key heat recovery role in industries across the world . Further achieving higher recovery rates with the moving bed reactor is persistently being pursued . In this study the flow pattern of the granulated slag and heat transfer were numerically simulated by the discrete element method . The effects of initial granulated slag temperature number of heat exchange tubes and tube arrangement in flow and heat transfer are analyzed in detail . The results clearly demonstrate that heat transfer process is intensified as the initial temperature of the slag decreases and the number of heat exchange tube increases . Moreover when the heat exchange tubes are staggered the intensified heat transfer effect is more effective .
