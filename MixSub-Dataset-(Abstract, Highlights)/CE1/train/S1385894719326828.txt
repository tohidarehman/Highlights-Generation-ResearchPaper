 Micro fine particles or micro fine powdered zeolite were deposited on hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride membrane to enhance gravity driven ultrafiltration performances . A distinct flux attenuation and permeate quality difference were observed between pristine and deposited membrne systems . The results indicated that both MFPAC PVDF and MFPZ PVDF membranes exhibited a high pure fluxes a gentle flux downward trend and a high stable permeate flux compared to the pristine PVDF membrane . Additional compared to the pristine membrane the deposited membrane systems exhibited a significantly enhanced removal of TOC NH

@highlight The deposited layers improved the removal of contaminants and membrane permeability.
@highlight The micro fine particles enhanced the hydrophilicity of membrane surfaces.
@highlight The micro fine particles decreased adhesion free energy between membrane surfaces and foulants.
@highlight The micro fine particles influenced on the biofilm structures.
