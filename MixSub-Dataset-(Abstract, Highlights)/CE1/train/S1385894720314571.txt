 In this study we designed a novel three dimensional Boron doped diamond anode by the regulation of ordered pore structures with BDD as the functional unit from the viewpoint of ordered structures with functional units enabling the prepared three dimensional interpenetrating network ordered structure 3D BDD electrodes possess the privileges of large specific surface area and high mass transfer rate . The electrochemical oxidation degradation experiment showed the prepared 3D porous ordered structure BDD anode with optimized OSFU could achieve almost 100 decolorization efficiency and 77.71 TOC removal for high concentrated 100mg L
