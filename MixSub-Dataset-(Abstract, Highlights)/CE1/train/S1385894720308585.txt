 This work deals with the degradation of three emerging contaminants in water under simulated solar light using different catalysts of TiO

@highlight TiO
@highlight  AC heterostructures were prepared by different synthesis methods.
@highlight Microwave assisted heterostructure was the most photoactive.
@highlight Ibuprofen was the most easily removed.
@highlight Degradation pathways for acetaminophen ibuprofen and antipyrine were proposed.
@highlight In pharmaceuticals mixture the highest and fastest mineralization occurred at pH 7.
