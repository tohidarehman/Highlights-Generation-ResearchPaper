 In this study a series of Mn based catalysts with different oxidative states crystal structures and morphologies was applied to activate peroxymonosulfate for the degradation of atrazine . Among them MnO

@highlight The generation of Mn III and Mn II is crucial for peroxymonosulfate activation 
@highlight Multiple reactive species including radicals and non radical were involved 
@highlight The formation of BrO
@highlight is inhibited in MnO
@highlight nanowires peroxymonosulfate process 
@highlight Sixteen intermediates were detected during the degradation of atrazine.
