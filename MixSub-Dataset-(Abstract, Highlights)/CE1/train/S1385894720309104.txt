 A high solid anaerobic membrane bioreactor treating food waste was continuously operated to investigate AnMBR performance and membrane fouling behavior . The optimal methane yield of 0.570.08 L CH

@highlight A high methane yield of 0.57 L CH
@highlight  g VS
@highlight was achieved by the AnMBR in treating FW.
@highlight Organic pore blocking played the dominant role in membrane fouling at low F R ratios.
@highlight The cake layer governed the fouling when F R ratio increased.
