 Iron oxidizing supported autotrophic denitrification AD is a promising process for low carbon water treatment . Organic carbon has been a common pollutant associated with nitrogen pollution . However its interaction with Fe AD remains unclear . In this study influence characteristics and mechanism of OC on Fe AD were investigated . Fe AD was established based on iron scraps and iron carbon micro electrolysis . The results showed that the OC free ME ISs AD obtained denitrification load of 0.1910.028kgN m

@highlight Novel characteristics and mechanism of Fe 0 AD with organic carbon were revealed.
@highlight Optimum dosage 1.0mgCOD mgTN enhanced Fe 0 AD and reduced N
@highlight O NO
@highlight accumulation.
@highlight Bioconversion of iron compounds was enhanced and Fe 0 passivation of was reduced.
@highlight  Fe
@highlight  based autotrophic denitrifiers and genes napA nirK nosZ were enriched.
@highlight NaAC was more efficient in enhancing the Fe 0 AD process than glucose and EtOH.
