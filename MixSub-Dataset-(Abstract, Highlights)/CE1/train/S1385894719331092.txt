 Triazine based framework is an attractive organic polymer with microporous structure and high nitrogen content that could retard the shuttle of polysulfides for high performance lithium sulfur batteries . However insight into the role of conjugated donor of triazine based polymer in immobilizing and catalyzing polysulfides is still deficient . Here two homologous conjugated buildings of triazine unit combining with perylene and spirobifluorene were reasonably synthesized through one pot Suzuki Miyaura coupling reaction with a high yield of 92 and served as the polysulfides immobilizer and catalyst to achieve high performance Li S batteries . Compared with the counterpart of CTP 2 the fully conjugated CTP 1 modified separator possesses a higher ionic conductivity and Li

@highlight Triazine based polymers functionalized as polysulfide immobilizer and catalyst.
@highlight Donor as electron reservoir was grafted to enhance the ability of triazine polymer.
@highlight The charge transfer between triazine unit and lithium polysulfides was improved.
@highlight The resultant Li S batteries present excellent electrochemical performance.
