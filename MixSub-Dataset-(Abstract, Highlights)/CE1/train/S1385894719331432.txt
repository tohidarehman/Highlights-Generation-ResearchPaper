 In order to improve the quality of syngas and regulate the deposited coke co gasification of biomass and polyethylene wastes without and with steam were investigated in a bench scale fixed bed reactor where the feedstock was pyrolyzed at the temperature of 600C followed by catalytic reforming at 800C over Ni Al

@highlight The plastic biomass ratio were studied in co gasification of biomass and plastics.
@highlight Syngas quality and natures of deposited coke was studied on Ni Al
@highlight catalyst.
@highlight 50 of plastic ratio had remarkable synergy on syngas and deposited coke production.
@highlight of CNT in deposited coke was produced during co gasification.
