 Extracellular polymeric substance of anaerobic ammonium oxidation sludge plays an important role in resisting the toxicity when treating heavy metal containing wastewater . Understanding the interaction mechanism between EPS and heavy metal is essential for stable and optimal operation of such technology . In this work the identification and preferential response of the binding sites as well as the binding thermodynamic and the conformational changes of EPS to Cu

@highlight Binding of anammox EPS with Cu
@highlight was endothermic and entropy increased.
@highlight Carboxyl groups of proteins were preferentially responded to Cu
@highlight The protein in EPS changed into loose structure after combining with Cu
