 Decontamination and recovery of uranium from radioactive wastewater is vital to sustainable nuclear power production and reclamation of radioactive waste . As a promising technology of water treatment capacitive deionization for adsorption of U started to attract attention . Herein for the first time a floriform WO

@highlight Floriform WO
@highlight  C electrode were developed for electrosorption of U VI from water.
@highlight The charge discharge process of WO
@highlight  C primarily belongs to capacitive controlled behavior.
@highlight WO
@highlight  C electrodes achieve a maximum U VI electrosorption capacity of 449.9mgg
@highlight at 1.2V.
@highlight Electrosorption of U VI is credited to synergistic effect of EDLs and pseudocapacitance from WO
@highlight  C.
