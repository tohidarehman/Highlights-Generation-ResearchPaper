 spacer as well as its substituted groups could take part in tuning the properties of molecules such as optical absorption molecular configuration film morphology and charge transport . In the paper 3 4 dihexoxythiophene regarded as spacer was used to design the D A D type conjugated polymer poly 4 7 bis 5 2 3 dihydrothieno 3 4

@highlight 3 4 Dihexoxythiophene as spacer is used to design D A D type polymer.
@highlight The 46 optical contrast is one of the highest values in neutral green polymers.
@highlight The energy storage state could be monitored by appearance color of polymer.
