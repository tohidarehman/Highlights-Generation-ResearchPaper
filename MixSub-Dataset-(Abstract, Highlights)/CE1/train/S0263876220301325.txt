 Batch chemical and biochemical plants play an important role in the process industries . They are characterised by hybrid dynamics as well as complex sequences and decision logic in the case of shared resources . This is challenging from a modelling and simulation perspective both in terms of numerical algorithms as well as implementability and scalability maintainability within software environments . In this work it is shown that it is possible to model complex plantwide batch processes at reasonably high performance accuracy and practicability in MATLAB Simulink using the StateFlow toolbox . To this end useful implementation guidelines are presented and a complex example batch process is modelled . As focus lies on the implementability of complex batch control logic the model is limited to mass balances . The simulation results are evaluated and carefully visualised indicating the MATLAB s capabilities for analysis of such systems .
