 The absorption and solubility of pure ethane and ethylene gases were investigated in an experimental pressure decay setup where a small amount of silver nanoparticles was added to pure

@highlight Ethane and ethylene absorption investigated in Ag NMP nano solvent.
@highlight Absorption performance improved up to 41 by adding nanoparticles to pure solvent.
@highlight Nanofluid reduced equilibrium time and provided better solubility than pure solvent.
@highlight The effect of nanofluid was greater for ethylene rather than ethane.
