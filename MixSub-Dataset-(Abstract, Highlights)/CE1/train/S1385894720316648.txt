 Patients who have diabetes must receive insulin administration two to three times every day via subcutaneous injection after measurement of blood glucose levels using lancet blood glucose meter with the side effects of pain and lipodystrophy . Achieving instrument free glucose biosensing and persistent glycaemic control in a painless and safe way is the ultimate goal of diabetes management . Here we report the design of a microneedles set comprising a glucose biosensing microneedle patch and an insulin delivery MP . Once in the skin the skin interstitial fluid would diffuse into GBMP from epidermis to develop colour in abnormal glucose concentration which then quantified by smartphone . Subsequently the IDMP composing of free insulin and biodegradable insulin loaded glucose responsive nanovesicles as an artificial on skin pancreas could be applied for hyperglycaemia triggered insulin release to self regulate BGLs and improve the health and quality of life for patients with type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes . In chemically induced type 1 diabetic rats the BGLs can be rapidly measured by GBMP and the BGLs can also be immediately reduced to and kept at normoglycaemic levels for up to 13h by IDMP . The whole system permits the syringe free diabetes management avoiding both hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia .

@highlight High swelling ability of microneedles MNs for skin interstitial fluid extraction.
@highlight On skin glucose detection by naked eyes or smartphone using MNs.
@highlight New polymer nanovesicles with a hyperglycaemia triggered insulin release character.
@highlight MNs are capable of on demand insulin release for long acting glycaemic control.
