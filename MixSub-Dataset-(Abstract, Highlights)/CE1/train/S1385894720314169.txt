 It is well known that single phase metal oxides can be prepared by using metal organic frameworks as sacrificial templates . In this contribution we report a facile and scalable route for the preparation of multicomponent metal oxide nanomaterials with high dispersion and tailorable chemical compositions . Specifically a series of MMONs have been prepared from the calcination of Mn BTC nanorods together with various transition metal acetylacetonate complexes

@highlight Multicomponent metal oxides with high dispersion were successfully fabricated.
@highlight Transition metal acetylacetonate complexes were firmly anchored on Mn BTC surface.
@highlight The designed catalysts exhibited excellent performance for VOCs and CO oxidation.
@highlight Mn
@highlight served as an antioxidant which was unfavorable for the oxidation reaction.
