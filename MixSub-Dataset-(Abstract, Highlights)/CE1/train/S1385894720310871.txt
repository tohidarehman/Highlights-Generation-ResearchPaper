 Norfloxacin has been extensively applied worldwide to treat various infectious diseases which is ubiquitous in the aquatic environments . In this study ionizing irradiation was used to degrade NOR in aqueous solution . The results showed that 540mg L NOR could be degraded completely at 0.44kGy . The mineralization of NOR was enhanced by 1.553.02 times in the presence of 1040mg L H

@highlight Norfloxacin could be effectively removed by ionizing radiation.
