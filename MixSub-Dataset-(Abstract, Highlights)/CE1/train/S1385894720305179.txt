 A novel continuous aerosol photopolymerization technique to coat nanoparticles that have been previously de agglomerated is presented . After de agglomeration in a jet impactor assisted fluidized bed monomer vapors are condensed onto the surface of aerosolized nanoparticles via heterogeneous condensation . Photopolymerization is initiated through exposure to UV light . To demonstrate the process titanium dioxide TiO

@highlight De agglomerated nano TiO
@highlight was coated with a PMMA like film using aerosol photopolymerization.
@highlight Presence of a PMMA like film was confirmed by TEM TGA FTIR and XPS.
@highlight Jet impactor assisted fluidized bed reduces the size of nano TiO
@highlight agglomerates.
@highlight Coated nano TiO
@highlight showed enhanced long term dispersibility in non polar media.
