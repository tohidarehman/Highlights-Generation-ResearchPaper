 Di methyl ether has been received much attention because of its key features . It can be produced from any carbon rich feedstock through the conversion of carbonaceous material to synthesis gas and then to DME via indirect or direct route .

@highlight Staging of DME synthesis reactor to stages was investigated.
@highlight Two objective functions for direct and indirect DME synthesis was considered.
@highlight Staging of the DME reactor increases the objective functions in various degrees.
@highlight The volume reduction of a two stage reactor compared to a single reactor is about 22 .
