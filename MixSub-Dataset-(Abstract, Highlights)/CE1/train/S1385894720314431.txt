 Lithium sublattice nanoparticles have recently shown to be a promising nano sized host candidate for photon upconversion of lanthanides . However it remains a challenge for the controllable synthesis of high quality lithium sublattice core shell nanostructures due to its tetragonal crystal structure in contrast to the commonly investigated hexagonal sodium sublattice counterparts . Herein we present a novel synthetic strategy of using the pre synthesized optically active seeds to guide the epitaxial growth of LiGdF

@highlight Using functional seeds for synthesis of lithium based core shell nanostructures.
@highlight Both upconverting and down shifting emissions are available through IET route.
@highlight Lithium based nanoparticles show good spectral Stark splitting feature.
@highlight Tri channel emissions are achievable for multiple anti counterfeiting identification.
