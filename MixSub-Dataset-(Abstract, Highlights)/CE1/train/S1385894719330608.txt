 Self healable and stretchable electrolytes are extremely desirable for next generation flexible energy storage devices . Nevertheless most of previously reported autonomous self healing electrolytes possess only moderate mechanical strength and recoverability as well as poor ionic conductivity and low operating voltage window . In this work a type of ionogel electrolytes is reported on the basis of a dual dynamic network composed of metal ligand Li

@highlight Self stand ionogels are designed based on a dual dynamic network.
@highlight The ionogels possess high self healing efficiency with excellent stretchability.
@highlight The ionogels own high ionic conductivity and operating voltage window.
@highlight MSCs was prepared with ionogels acting as electrolyte and substrate simultaneously.
@highlight The capacitance retention rate of MSCs reaches 98 after 5th healing process.
