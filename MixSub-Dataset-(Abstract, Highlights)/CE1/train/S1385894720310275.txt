 We present a self consistent analysis of adsorption of gases on energetically heterogeneous solids and derive expressions for the Henry constant and the isosteric heat at zero loading

@highlight Consistency between the Henry constant and the simulated isotherm at zero loading.
@highlight Differences between the thermodynamic variables for excess and absolute loadings.
@highlight Adsorption in a complex substrate is a composite of subsets.
@highlight Derivation of equations for the isotherm and the heat for a complex substrate.
