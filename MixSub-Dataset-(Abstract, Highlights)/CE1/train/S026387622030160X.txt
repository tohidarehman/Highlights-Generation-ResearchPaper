 Gas flooding is a practical secondary scenario for enhanced oil recovery . Channeling and fingering of the injected gas are the major problems facing this technique . These challenges can be mitigated by the injection of gas as foam . However foam stability influences the overall efficiency of the process which could be improved by nanoparticles . This work provides a theoretical and experimental analysis of the NPs wettability effects on foam behavior in both static and dynamic states . The treated calcite CaCO

@highlight The effect of NPs wettability on

@highlight The foam texture was more uniform in the optimal condition of wettability.
@highlight Rheological behavior of foam was less pseudo plastic for hydrophobic nanoparticles.
@highlight The rheology of foam was monitored as a function of time in the presence of NPs.
@highlight The effect of NPs wettability on STARS model s parameter was studied.
