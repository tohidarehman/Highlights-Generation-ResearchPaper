 Diabetic cataract is a kind of worrying ocular complications that eventually leads to blindness . However there are a narrow range of pharmacological interventions to enable control the progression of DC especially the eye drops based on noninvasive routes . In this work we developed a kind of strong antioxidant Pt nanoclusters coated with cell penetrating peptide conjugated dextran . The DTPNCs were dispersed in 0.1 Pluronic F127 to form eye drops which have the ability of corneal permeation . The results indicate that the presence of 0.1 Pluronic F127 resists the clearance of tear film against DTPNCs and TAT conjugated dextran contribute to the interaction and permeation with corneal barriers with the help of electrostatic interaction in vivo . More importantly the DTPNCs possess effective antioxidant capacities and can protect the lens epithelial cells against oxidative stress by eliminating ROS and impose restrictions on the crystallin glycation and crosslinking in vitro further to slow down the process of DC . We hope that our approach will provide a promising non invasive and painless treatment to DC .
