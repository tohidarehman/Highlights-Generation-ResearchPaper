 Graphene an ideal two dimensional material with high thermal conductivity is widely used in the field of thermal management . However its excellent electrical conductivity becomes an inevitable obstacle for applying in the electronic fields where electrical insulation materials are demanded . Herein the reduced graphene oxide decorated by magnesium oxide particles was used as the hybrid thermal conducting filler to prepare the high thermal conductivity and electrical insulation nanofibrillated cellulose based composite films via a facile vacuum assisted filtration and mechanical compression . In this way MgO nano particles not only reduced the interface thermal resistance between rGO and NFC but also cut the electric conductive pathways of rGO to enhance the thermal conductivity and maintain electrical insulation of the films . Simultaneously mechanical compression caused the compacted layered structure formed by vacuum filtration along the in plane direction . Thus the obtained composite film exhibited high thermal conductivity and anisotropy . The in plane and cross plane thermal conductivity reached 7.45W and 0.32W respectively when the filler content increased to 20wt along with a high thermal conductivity anisotropy of 23 and superior electrical resistivity above 10
