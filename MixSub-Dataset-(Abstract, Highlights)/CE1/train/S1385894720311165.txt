 Till date the lithium ion battery still remains the principal and most widely studied rechargeable energy storage device . However drawbacks including insufficient rate and cycling performance are hindering its further development . The aforementioned drawbacks can be attributed to the unstable interface and sluggish charge storage kinetics of electrode materials . Hence endowing electrode materials with stable interface and rapid ion electron diffusion kinetics are effective methods to solve these problems . Herein by tuning the antihunt interface a high capacity self adaptive
