 Development of a facile tool for selective detection and separation of heavy metals present in aqueous media is a demanding challenge in the chemosensing field . In this study a natural product halloysite nanotube which shows excellent dispersibility in water was selected as the scaffold to demonstrate simultaneous detection and removal of Zn ions from aqueous solution . For this purpose HNTs were rationally integrated with coumarin moieties . The nanocomposite was prepared by treating amino functionalized HNTs with 7 hydroxy 4 methyl 2 oxo 2H chromene 8 carbaldehyde to give the C

@highlight Coumarin is anchored on the halloysite surface to form a Schiff base containing product.
@highlight The addition of Zn II can trigger a turn on fluorescence in the nanosuspension.
@highlight Zn II triggered aggregation can used to remove the Zn II containing complex.
@highlight Chelating with Zn II shows high sensitivity and specificity.
