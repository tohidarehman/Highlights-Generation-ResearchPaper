 Thermally conductive composites have attracted much attention due to their application in the thermal management of electronics . But most of the thermally conductive composites exhibit poor filler dispersion and weak filler polymer interfacial interaction which would deteriorate the mechanical properties and impede the enhancement of thermal conductivity . Herein three new copolymers were synthesized through hydrosilylation reaction of poly with methyl methacrylate glycidyl methacrylate and 3 propyl methacrylate respectively . The copolymers were used to enhance the thermal conductivity and mechanical properties of Al
