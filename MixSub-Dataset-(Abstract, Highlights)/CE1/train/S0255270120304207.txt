 A second law assessment is conducted to study irreversibility values for the stream of a hybrid water based nanofluid within a microchannel heat sink fitted with secondary channels and rectangular ribs . The hybrid nanofluid has been synthesized from the graphene nanoplatelets on which the silver nanoparticles have been decorated . In the fluid part entropy generations caused by heat transfer and friction are intense in the interfaces of solid fluid whereas lower thermal entropy generation occurs in the dead zones . In the solid part thermal entropy generation in corners of the solid fluid interface is higher than other regions . The lowest thermal entropy generation happens at the front of ribs whereas the frictional entropy generation demonstrates lowest values at the heat sink central part . With the elevation of either Reynolds number or weight fraction the entropy produced by heat exchange reduces . A 7 decline in the total entropy generation happens by adding the nanoparticles with concentration of 0.1 at Re 300 while a 17 reduction in this parameter happens with elevating the Re from 100 to 500 at concentration of 0.06 . Furthermore with the growth of concentration and decrement of Re the contribution of solid to thermal entropy generation intensifies compared with the fluid .
