 Successful characterization of membranes is of paramount importance for the development and improvement of novel membranes and membrane processes . The characterization of membrane charge is key to understanding charge interactions between the process stream and the membrane and is typically represented by the surface zeta potential . In a previous paper

@highlight Laser Doppler electrophoresis was successfully applied to positively charged membranes.
@highlight Laser Doppler electrophoresis was successful for membrane charge characterization.
@highlight Results were compared to streaming potentials and found to correlate well.
@highlight The novel technique now spans the entire membrane range.
