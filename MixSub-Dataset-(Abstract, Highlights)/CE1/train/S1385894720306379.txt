 In this work remediation of a soil highly polluted with chlorinated organic compounds including chlorobenzenes hexachlorocyclohexane and heptachlorocyclohexane has been carried out using persulfate activated by alkali . The contamination was caused by wastes from lindane production . Soil samples were sieved in two fractions F and G and both were used to study the influence of the oxidant and activator concentrations C

@highlight Remediation of soil contaminated by COCs from lindane wastes was studied.
@highlight Alkaline activated persulfate was successful in the abatement of COCs in soil.
@highlight COCs in soil behave like DNAPL in the partitioning between soil and aqueous phase.
@highlight Oxidation takes place in soil and aqueous phases and transport limitations occur.
@highlight A kinetic model was developed for the chemical and physical rates in both phases.
