 Surfactant flooding a chemical enhanced oil recovery technique mainly aims at mobilizing the trapped residual oil by lowering the oil water interfacial tension . The success of a surfactant flooding operation is strongly affected by surfactant loss through its adsorption on reservoir minerals . Therefore the adsorption behavior of surfactants is of great importance and needs to be carefully investigated . The present study provides an insight into the adsorption behavior of a recently proposed surfactant namely Aerosol OT on a number of minerals including quartz sand kaolinite illite and montmorillonite under different salinities and temperatures . The examination was carried out in the form of batch experiments and the surface tension technique was implemented to determine the adsorption rate . The adsorption equilibrium data were examined through two adsorption isotherm models known as Langmuir and Freundlich . It was found that the adsorption rate increased with the increasing salinity where the highest value was observed for kaolinite 21
