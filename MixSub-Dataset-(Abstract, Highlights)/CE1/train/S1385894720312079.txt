 Activated carbons impregnated with 1 5 and 10wt triethylenediamine and quinuclidine were prepared for the removal of methyl iodide CH

@highlight CH
@highlight I adsorption in impregnated activated carbons was studied at extremely low pressure.
@highlight Contribution of chemisorption to CH
@highlight I adsorption increased with impregnant content.
@highlight Adsorption rate was more affected by chemisorbed products than by impregnant type.
@highlight CH
@highlight I reacted with first encounter amines leading to hindrance effect in micropore.
