 This work investigates the production of biochars from phosphoric acid treated spent tea residue by pyrolysis at different temperatures . The biochar morphology and chemistry were characterized via SEM FT IR XRD and BET analyses . Results showed that an increase in the pyrolysis temperature could enhance the porous structure and increase the surface area whereas it might deteriorate the surface functional groups to some extent . The produced biochar samples were employed for the adsorption of methylene blue from water . The batch adsorption process was investigated via a data based multivariate optimization approach Pareto sensitivity analysis and response surface methodology for the intensification of the process . The STR biochar produced at the pyrolysis temperature of 400 C offered the maximum MB removal of 99.26 at the optimal operating conditions of pH 9.65 initial dye concentration 81.24 mg L adsorbent dosage 0.26 g and contact time 97.92 min . Pareto sensitivity analysis revealed that the MB adsorption on STR derived biochar is strongly influenced by pH and contact time . The isothermal and kinetic studies indicated that the adsorption of MB on STR biochar is well described by the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order model respectively . The adsorption capacity of the optimal biochar was obtained to be 91.13 mg g .
