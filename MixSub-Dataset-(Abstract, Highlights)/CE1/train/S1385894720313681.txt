@highlight Impact of water on CO
@highlight adsorption was investigated by multicomponent breakthrough.
@highlight This N doped carbon retains the majority of the CO
@highlight adsorption capacity in moisture.
@highlight This work shows the possibility of this potential material for post combustion CCS.
