 Owing to the low biodegradation and highly recalcitrant nature of pesticide wastewater the conventional anaerobic treatment process is often limited with low organic removal efficiency . In this study based on the existing wastewater treatment system of a pesticide production company a pilot scale original combined system and a pilot scale enhanced combined system were designed and operated in parallel to explore the feasibility and economics of pesticide wastewater treatment . The average effluent BOD

@highlight An enhanced combined system was proposed to treat low BOD
@highlight  COD pesticide wastewater.
@highlight E HAR can effectively improve the biodegradability of wastewater.
@highlight Switched operation can reduce the negative impact of two stage anaerobic process.
@highlight Economic analysis was introduced to evaluate feasibility of enhanced combined system.
