 A promising and practicable catalyst is the key challenge for industrial perspective to promote photocatalytic nitrogen fixation . In this study a new 0D 2D heterojunction oxygen vacancy induced In

@highlight OV induced In OH 
@highlight  carbon nitride heterojunction was firstly synthesized.
@highlight The heterojunction was prepared by a facile and readily method at moderate condition.
@highlight The heterojunction showed excellent NH
@highlight generation rate to be 3.81mM h per 1g.
@highlight The trap effect of OVs on In OH 
@highlight accounts for enhancement of photocatalytic activity.
