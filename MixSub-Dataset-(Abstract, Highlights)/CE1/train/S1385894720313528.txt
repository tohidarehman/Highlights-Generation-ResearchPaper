 Incorporating inorganic thermoelectric fillers into conductive polymers is one promising strategy to develop high performance flexible thermoelectric films . However due to the relatively high interfacial contact resistance between fillers and polymers carriers tend to be scattered at the interfaces during the interfacial transports which deteriorates the electrical properties of the system and in turn leads to low energy conversion efficiency . Here a new strategy is developed to optimize interfacial carrier transports in Bi
