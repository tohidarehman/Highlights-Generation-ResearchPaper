 In this paper the conventional reactive distillation of toluene diisocyanate production process is designed and optimized by minimizing the total annual cost . In order to make the HCl content in the side stream of the reactive distillation correspond with the specifications of the CRD process a lot of energy needs to be consumed . Therefore a reactive distillation dividing wall column is comparatively proposed . The results illustrate that compared with CRD process the TAC and energy consumption of RD DWC process decreases by 40.625 and 46.038 respectively . Apart from that the RD DWC will also improve the safety of the TDI production process . During the design process the control of CCA conversion rate of reactive column is a key factor for achieving this process efficient . Furthermore a feasible control scheme is investigated . Specifically the residence time is controlled by liquid level for the reactive distillation that could obviously reduce the generation of by products . This control scheme can effectively control the process and achieve good dynamic performance when 10 flow rate and feed composition disturbances are introduced . Research on control performance is significant to develop energy saving technology for RD DWC process .

@highlight The optimization and control of TDI synthesis process were studied for the first time.
@highlight The dividing wall column can save energy consumption and improve the process safety.
@highlight The control scheme can control the residence time and respond quickly.
