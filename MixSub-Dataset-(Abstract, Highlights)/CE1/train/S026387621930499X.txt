 The maintenance repair and rehabilitation of industrial reactors are expensive and time consuming . Sudden interruptions may adversely affect the production process and may lead to harmful effects and disastrous results . Therefore lifetime prediction is extremely important to prevent catastrophic breakdowns leading to complete cessation of production . This paper aims to propose a prognosis reliable method that can be used to estimate the degradation path of a distillation column and calculate the lifetime percentage of this system . The work presents a direct monitoring approach based on the technique of adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system combined with fuzzy C means algorithm . At the beginning ANFIS is used to detect the small variations in the signal over time . Secondly a new strategy is proposed to find the system degradation path . Thirdly ANFIS is combined with FCM to predict the future path and calculate the lifetime percentage of the system . The methodology is tested on real experimental data obtained from a distillation column . Results demonstrate the validity of the proposed technique to achieve the needed objectives with a high level accuracy especially the ability to determine a more accurate Remaining Useful Life when it applied on the automated distillation process in the chemical industry .
