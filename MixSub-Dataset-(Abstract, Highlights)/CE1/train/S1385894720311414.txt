 Oxygen evolution reaction remains the bottleneck of many energy transformation and storage technologies due to the sluggish kinetics . Transition metal hydroxide nanosheets with high valent TM ions possess high intrinsic catalytic activity toward OER . Herein by taking advantage of the inductive effect this work presents a facile and universal strategy to fabricate atomic iridium incorporated TM hydroxide nanosheets as highly active OER electrocatalysts . As a representative the fabricated Ir Ni

@highlight Atomic Ir incorporated Ni OH 
@highlight nanosheet was fabricated via a facile precipitation method.
@highlight The inductive effect between Ni and Ir in Ir Ni OH 
@highlight nanosheets promotes the generation of high valent Ni.
@highlight The fabricated catalyst exhibits remarkable OER performance in 1M KOH aqueous solution.
@highlight The present method is simple and universal to synthesize other highly efficient OER electrocatalysts.
