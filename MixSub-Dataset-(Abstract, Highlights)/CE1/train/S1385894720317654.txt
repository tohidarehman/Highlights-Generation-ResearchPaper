 A novel oyster shell and lignite modified zeolite fixed bioreactor incorporated with intermittent light illumination process was developed for alleviating ammonia inhibition to improve efficiency of ammonium rich anaerobic digestion . The SEM morphology of the newly synthesized OLMZ showed porous structure and rough surface with increased BET surface area compared to unmodified zeolite . After modification with oyster shell and lignite the metal cations content in OLMZ increased significantly and the ammonia adsorption capability of OLMZ improved by 1.3 folds compared to UMZ . Thus the results suggested that OLMZ is a better adsorbent than UMZ for ammonia uptake . Furthermore the pseudo second order kinetics and the isotherm results verified the adsorption of ammonia on OLMZ was dominated by ion exchange with high affinity for ammonia uptake . As for the anaerobic digestion the light illuminated OLMZ fixed bioreactor process resulted in the highest methane yield of 37230mL g DOC
