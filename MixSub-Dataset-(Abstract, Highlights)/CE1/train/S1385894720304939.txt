 Phosphate rock is a depleting resource and wastewater a sustainable long term alternative for phosphorous mining . In modern wastewater treatment phosphate is concentrated 7500 times from wastewater into sludge as iron phosphate . Recently developed bioelectrochemical reactors enabled phosphate recovery from sewage sludge containing FeP . The integrated bioelectric process was found of much broader utility than initially elaborated . It refines all principle components of wastewater . The implementation is confronted to a number of challenges . Three pilot microbial electrolysis cells of 168 L each were constructed and installed in different municipal wastewater treatment plants . The scale up MECs generated renewable chemical base and co extracted abundant species such as Na

@highlight A novel multi compound recovery system for wastewater refining was developed.
@highlight Three 168 L microbial electrolysis cells were constructed and used in three locations.
@highlight Renewable phosphate was quantitatively recovered from digested sewage sludge.
@highlight Chemical base ammonia and other compounds were obtained from wastewater.
@highlight Struvite was analysed with new metagenomics method for microbial contaminants.
