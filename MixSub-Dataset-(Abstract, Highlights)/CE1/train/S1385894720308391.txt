 The uncontrollable dendrite formation and infinite volume expansion bring serious safety risks and short service life to high energy lithium metal batteries . Here by introducing oxygen as a type of SnO

@highlight Introducing oxygen into Sn and carbon paper composite framework improves the wettability to molten Li.
@highlight The formed Li Sn alloy has outstanding Lithiophilicity and Li
@highlight O can homogenize Li
@highlight flux.
@highlight The prepared electrode can operate without dendrite growth or volume expansion.
@highlight Ultra low voltage hysteresis 16mV is enabled for 800h in symmetric cells.
