 Microwave assisted catalytic pyrolysis of biomass is a promising technology to obtain hydrocarbon rich fuel oil . In consideration of this method HZSM 5 is currently recognized as a catalyst with a good effect . However given the small pore diameter and easy coking of HZSM 5 the catalytic upgrading of bio oil is limited to a certain extent . In this study MCM 41 and HZSM 5 were used for joint catalysis to explore the effect of catalytic temperature the ratio of two catalysts and the ratio of soybean soapstock and catalysts on the pyrolysis products . The optimal reaction conditions included the following catalytic temperature 400C MCM 41 HZSM 5 ratio 1 1 feedstock catalyst ratio 2 1 . The results showed that MCM 41 could effectively alleviate the coking of HZSM 5 and the use of both catalysts reduced the bio oil yield but effectively improved the selectivity of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in bio oil thus increasing the value of bio oil .

@highlight It integrated the in situ and ex situ catalysis into pyrolysis process.
@highlight The MCM 41 and HZSM 5 were used for joint catalysis into pyrolysis process.
@highlight The yield of coke and oxygenates was reduced significantly.
@highlight The content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in bio oil effectively increased.
