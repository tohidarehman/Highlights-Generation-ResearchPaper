 Exploring the effect of water vapor on the benzene adsorptive behavior is of practical importance and scientific interest . The presence of water vapor in the gas stream altered the breakthrough curves of benzene as well as the selectivity of carbon materials towards adsorbates . The work herein elucidated the competitive adsorption mechanism based on experimental observation and molecular simulation . At relative humidity 10 water molecules showed less effect on the benzene adsorption that benzene entered the micropores and mesopores while water molecules were primarily adsorbed in the mesopores . Since the polar water molecules presented higher affinity towards the surface functionalities these molecules preferentially occupied the adsorption site via hydrogen bonding with increased RH . Water cluster was gradually formed through water water interactions which were characteristics of pore filling . A two layer stacking of adsorbates was observed for co adsorption . The first layer was primarily composed of water molecules with the average distance of 2.99 3.19 to the surface functionalities . The second layer was primarily benzene molecules which were aggregated in T shaped displaced T shaped and parallel configurations . These molecules were separated at 4.67 6.17 from the functional groups and mainly adsorbed by water benzene interaction .

@highlight Competitive adsorption occurred for co adsorption of benzene and water vapor.
@highlight Water molecules occupied the adsorption sites to reverse selectivity to benzene.
@highlight Water molecules formed the first layer stacking around oxygen functionalities.
@highlight Benzene formed the second layer stacking via benzene water interaction.
