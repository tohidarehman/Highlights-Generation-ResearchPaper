 Poor efficiency is considered as the adverse limitation of the development of microbial fuel cells . Increasing the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction reaction for air cathode catalyst is believed to be a superior approach to improve the efficiency of MFCs . Due to the attribute of high efficient and easily achieved the broccoli like Co Ni

@highlight Co doped Ni
@highlight P was firstly tested to catalyze oxygen reduction in MFCs.
@highlight Co Ni
@highlight P hybrid with AC synergistically enhanced oxygen reduction efficiency.
@highlight The synergy of Ni with Co in bimetal phosphide was beneficial for ORR.
@highlight A MPD of 1814mWm
@highlight were achieved with Co Ni
@highlight P AC 2 98 higher than bare AC.
