 This paper presents the development and application of systematic framework to perform new and retrofit phenomena based synthesis intensification generating well known existing as well as novel intensified solutions . The fundamental pillars of this framework are generic definition expansion and use of Phenomena Building Blocks that include all possible phases identification of principle PBBs using physical property and thermodynamic insights and generation of phenomena based superstructure to systematically identify novel innovative and intensified flowsheet alternatives . The generated flowsheet options are ranked based on Enthalpy Index to identify promising candidates for detailed analysis . One of the key features of this framework that distinguishes it from preceding methods for phenomena based synthesis is that the flowsheet alternatives are synthesized from phenomena based superstructure rather than relying on a base case for phenomena and or hotspots identification and replacement of base case unit operations accordingly . That is a phenomena based superstructure is generated to directly identify intensified solutions . New phenomena their classes and systematic algorithms are developed in order to generate novel intensified solutions . These developments and systematic framework are illustrated through case study involving production of Dimethyl Ether . The results confirm that using this approach promising alternatives with novel unit operations are generated in systematic way .
