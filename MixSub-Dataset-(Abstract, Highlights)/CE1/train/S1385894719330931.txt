 An advanced energy harvesting device that can be powerful with rapid storage mechanism effective conservation intact and secure recycling presently fascinate and are increasingly developed with the proper synthesis strategy and combination of nanomaterials with complementary properties . In 2011 extensive research has led to the wide emanating family of two dimensional multi layered transition metal carbides carbonitrides and nitrides in conjunction with surface terminations namely fluorine hydroxyl or oxygen which add hydrophilicity to their surfaces these are collectively known as MXenes they are derived from a selective etching of atomically thin sheets of A element from MAX phases in the acidic solutions which contain aqueous fluoride . The gifted chemistry and unique morphology of MXenes allow us to use them for distinct applications which includes energy storage electromagnetic interference shielding anti bacterial activity nanofiltration of water reinforcements nuclear waste management and catalysis . The excellent properties inclusive of high lithium storage capacity rapid diffusion of Li and low operating voltage make the MXenes a promising electrode the macroporous Ti
