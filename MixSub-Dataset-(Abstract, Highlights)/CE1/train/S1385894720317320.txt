 The accumulation of antibiotics in the environment fosters the evolution of antibiotic resistance genes that cause adverse an ecological impact . In this study we fabricated a thermoplastic polyurethane polysulfone composite membrane with a low structural parameter and high mechanical strength using electrospinning . UiO 66 NH

@highlight Electrospun membranes increased 1.4 times of tensile strength and exhibited low S 248m after adding TPU.
@highlight UiO 66 NH
@highlight interlayer incorporated the UTFN FO membrane showed high water flux.
@highlight UTFN membrane could efficiently remove TC and TRGs simultaneously.
@highlight The co rejection mechanism of UTFN membrane was elaborated.
