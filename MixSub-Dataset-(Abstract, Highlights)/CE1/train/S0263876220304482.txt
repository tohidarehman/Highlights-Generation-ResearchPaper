 The rapidly expanding use of electronic products has led to the generation of very large quantities of waste electrical and electronic equipment . This waste essentially consists of polymeric ceramic and metallic materials with the metal fraction including noble and base metals which may be toxic . It is therefore important to recycle printed circuit boards for both economic and environmental reasons especially since this solid waste contains noble metals . Given this background the aim of the present work was to develop a hydrometallurgical route for leaching of the silver present in computer PCBs using a combination of sodium chloride and calcium hypochlorite as the lixiviants . Optimization was performed of the following independent variables pulp density calcium hypochlorite concentration sodium chloride concentration and leaching time . Multivariate experimental designs were employed consisting of a 2

@highlight Silver is leached by the chloride hypochlorite pair.
@highlight The most significant variables were pulp density and concentration of Ca ClO 
@highlight The quadratic mathematical model provided a satisfactory description of the system.
@highlight Silver was dissolved by forming complexes with chloride.
