 Hydrothermally synthesized Titanium Nanotubes are sulphonated and characterized to confirm their morphological physical and chemical characteristics . Different weight percentages of Sulphonated TNTs are introduced into Sulphonated Poly Ether Ether Ketone where the negative channels that form with the aid of sulphonic acid groups play an essential criterion for the improved proton conductivity and better water holding capacity . A tubular designed Microbial Fuel Cell of 300mL volume is fabricated to test the potentiality of the self assembled inorganic and functionalized Titanium nanotubes incorporated SPEEK membranes . SPEEK 7.5 S TNT exhibits a maximum power density of 121 mW m

@highlight Ideal selection of electrolyte that influences the electrode kinetics is crucial.

@highlight A maximum power density of 121 mW m
@highlight is recorded for SPEEK 7.5 S TNT.
@highlight Exoelectrogens facilitate direct electron transport besides bioelectrogenesis.
@highlight Gram negative bacteria predominate in power generation than the Gram positive.
