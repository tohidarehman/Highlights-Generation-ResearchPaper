 The context of this work is to explore the possibility of making bio sourced foams at high throughput in microsystems . A fundamental element for the development of new technologies based on biphasic flows in microchannels is a good characterization and knowledge of hydrodynamics . In this contribution cross slot microsystems are tested as a promoter for the formation of train of bubbles in aqueous solutions of xanthan gum . A flow chart is proposed to present the conditions allowing a dispersed flow regime i.e . the conditions guaranteeing the complete incorporation of the gas into the liquid phase and then the control of the void fraction . The foaming is studied under potential industrial conditions i.e . operating with liquid flow rates up to 24 L h. High speed imaging within the channels reveals that the mechanism of formation of bubbles is related to flow focusing . Bubbles are generated alternatively from each of the two opposite gas inlets . Using whey protein isolate to enhance foaming points out that the bubble size may be reduced along a long channel by tip streaming . The effect of the modulation of the viscosity of the liquid base is also discussed .
