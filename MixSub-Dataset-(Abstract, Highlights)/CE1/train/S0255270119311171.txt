 Transformation of pulp into regenerated lyocell fibre involves a critical step of cellulose dissolution in aqueous NMMO solution . The objective of this work is to investigate the effect of using pre swelled pulps derived from hardwood kraft sulphate and softwood kraft sulphate process on cellulose dissolution . Pre swelling at temperatures follows from 30C to 75C results in lowering of pulp crystallinity and hence was hypothesized to form a homogeneous solution with lower power consumption during the dissolution process . Experimental torque moments of the un swelled and pre swelled pulps at different temperatures were compared and correlated with the cellulose dissolution process . Further a time based morphological study of cellulose dissolution was performed with the help of a microscopic investigation method . The quality of the dissolved dope was evaluated by optical image analysis refractive index dope composition and thermal analysis . It was observed that by using pre swelled pulps homogeneous cellulose solution could be formed at lower processing temperature consuming less time and power thereby making the lyocell process more energy efficient and sustainable .
