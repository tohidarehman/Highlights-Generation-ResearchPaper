 Membrane separations for fruit juice processing have been largely investigated but membrane fouling is still a limitation to be overcome . Here the use of turbulence promoters to increase the permeate flux of purple araa fruit

@highlight Bioactive compounds from araa fruit extract were concentrated by ultrafiltration.
@highlight Turbulence promoters were designed by using by the 3D printing technology.
@highlight Velocity distributions were examined by computational fluid dynamics CFD .
@highlight Cylindrical turbulence promoters provided a flux enhancement by approximately 78 .
