 Hydrophilic molecularly imprinted polymer for effective removal of pollutants from environmental water has attracted much attention due to their high selectivity and matrix compatibility . Herein resorcinol and formaldehyde have been first proposed as the hydrophilic monomers to form water compatible molecularly imprinted resin magnetic nanomaterials Fe

@highlight A novel type of hydrophilic molecularly imprinted polymers was prepared.
@highlight Resorcinol formaldehyde resin as hydrophilic imprinted layer was first proposed.
@highlight Two step template immobilization and surface imprinting strategies were combined.
@highlight The imprinted nanomaterials have high adsorption capacity and good reusability.
@highlight Specific enrichment and detection of trace sulindac from sewage samples was achieved.
