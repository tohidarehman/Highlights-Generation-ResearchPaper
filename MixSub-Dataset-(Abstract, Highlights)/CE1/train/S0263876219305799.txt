 The rate of coalescence in an electrocoalescer which governs the residence time sensitively depends upon the electrostatic conditions as well as the electrodes arrangement . An experimental study of a cylindrical electrocoalescer vessel for two different modes of operation is reported in this work . The design of the coalescer is optimized for the residence time and water separation . To justify the experimental findings and to unravel more physical insights the single phase electrostatics is simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics software . The volume of the emulsion under the influence of 0.31.0
