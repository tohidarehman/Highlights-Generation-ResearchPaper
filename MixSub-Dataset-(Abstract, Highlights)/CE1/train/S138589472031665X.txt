 Exploring highly activity and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction is of vital importance for sustainable energy conversion processes . Herein a facile strategy is developed to synthesize Ni doped CoOOH nanosheets with poor crystallinity and 3D mesh structure which is in situ derived from the Na
