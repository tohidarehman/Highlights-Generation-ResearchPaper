 Liquid viscosity plays a major role in determining the mass transfer efficiency in distillation through its contribution to the liquid phase mass transfer coefficient interfacial area of mass transfer and vapor and liquid phase residence times . Most of the distillation efficiency correlations in the literature were developed or validated based on efficiency data at liquid viscosities less than 1.5
