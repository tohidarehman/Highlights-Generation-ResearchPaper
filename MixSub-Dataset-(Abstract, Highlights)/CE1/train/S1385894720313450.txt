 Many hydrogel scaffolds for bone regeneration do not satisfy clinical needs due to uncontrollable mechanical properties and calcium supply and a lack of outstanding osteogenic functions . Herein a novel acid responsive composite hydrogel scaffold platform was developed to provide controllable stiffness and calcium supply for enhanced bone regeneration . For this purpose pluronic F127 diacrylate was selected as the model scaffold matrix material due to its good biocompatibility and easy formulation capability . Nano CaCO
