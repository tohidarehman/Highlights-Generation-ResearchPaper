 The aim was to develop stable nanoemulsions as potential delivery systems for bioactive ingredients pharmaceutical products and nanoparticles dispersed in organic solvents . The effect of sodium alginate concentration and the type of oil oleic acid olive oil and unrefined and refined coconut oil in combination with tween 80 on the quality of nanoemulsions produced by ultrasound was evaluated . CO and OA nanoemulsions with 0.5 SA showed the lowest droplet size polydispersity index and zeta potential . After ultrasonication CO and OA nanoemulsions exhibited a reduction in droplet size polydispersity index and viscosity . Coarse emulsions showed near Newtonian behavior while the nanoemulsions exhibited Newtonian behavior . Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy did not reveal differences among SA solutions with OA and CO nanoemulsions . CO and OA nanoemulsions possessed a spherical and asymmetric branched structure respectively . Stability studies revealed that nanoemulsions may be stable upon storage for 28 days at room temperature .
