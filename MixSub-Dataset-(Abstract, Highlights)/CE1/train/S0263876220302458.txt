 This study presents a greener approach to fabricate mixed matrix membranes by introducing malachite nanoparticles synthesized from copper sulfate a toxic waste from many industrial applications into polyethersulfone membrane to remove organic matter for water reclamation . The PES MLC MMMs were characterized by XRD FTIR SEM Raman Spectroscopy Photoluminescence Spectrometry and Contact angle measurements . Results showed that the incorporation of MLC NPs into PES altered the membrane morphology and made the membrane more hydrophilic . At the optimal amount of 0.1

@highlight MLC NPs were successfully incorporated in PES membrane via H bond interaction.
@highlight The MMMs with MLC NPs of 0.1
@highlight None
@highlight wt. exhibited the best water flux and breaking strength.
@highlight Increased MLC NPs enhanced organic carbon removal rate from 20.8 to 26.3 .
@highlight Optical methods demonstrated the preferential removal of aromatic compounds by MMMs.
@highlight Enhanced aromatic fractions were removed by MMMs at increased MLC NPs.
