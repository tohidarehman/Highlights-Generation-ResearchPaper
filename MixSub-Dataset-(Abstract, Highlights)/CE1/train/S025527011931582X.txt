 This paper presents a study of the combined system of vacuum membrane distillation and mechanical vapor recompression for the treatment of sulfuric acid solution . A lab scale VMD setup with polytetrafluoroethylene microporous membranes using sulfuric acid solution as feed was used to investigate the effects of operating parameters on water production performance . The thermal efficiency in VMD process was then analyzed . Finally further investigation about the energy recovery characteristic of the proposed system were carried out by analyzing the variation laws of the vapor saturated temperature rise of the compressor . The results showed that sulfuric acid solution could be concentrated up to 50 by the VMD technology and the separation efficiency was 99.9 . However the energy requirement was still larger due to lower thermal efficiency caused by the heat loss to the environment and the absence of recovery of latent heat of vaporization . The MVR process could achieve the enhancement of energy efficiency in the VMD process by recovering the latent heat of vaporization the optimum permeate side absolute pressure under different feed concentrations was obtained which could ensure the minimum energy consumption the energy saving of 65.5 was observed in comparison with the conventional VMD system .
