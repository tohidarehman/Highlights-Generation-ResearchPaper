 This study investigated the influence of the geometry of the draft tube on the mass transfer and energy efficiency in the airlift reactor with helical sieve plate . The power consumption efficiency was 46 53 higher than the control condition by optimizing the draft tube . A set of empirical equations was used to describe the gas holdup and volumetric mass transfer coefficients corresponding to the geometry of draft tubes in the ALR HSP for the waterair system . The comparative cultivation of

@highlight The effect of draft tube geometry on the oxygen transfer in ALR HSP was investigated.
@highlight Power efficiency was improved by 46 53 by optimizing the draft tube.
@highlight The novel reactor was applied to
@highlight culture for the first time and achieved good performance.
