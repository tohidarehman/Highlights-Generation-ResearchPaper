 The integration of bioelectrochemical system into conventional anaerobic composting process can accelerate the degradation of excess dewatered sludge . However no reports have been made concerning antibiotic resistance genes profile and abundance in BESs fuelled with ES and the effect of CaO

@highlight AnC
@highlight was conducted to investigate the CaO
@highlight addition on the attenuation of ARGs.
@highlight The abundances of ARGs in AnC
@highlight at CaO
@highlight dosage of 0.4 and 0.5g gVSS were the lowest.
@highlight ARGs distribution was affected by both CaO
@highlight and bioelectrochemical assistance.
@highlight Microbial community contributed 62.8 to explain the ARGs compositions.
@highlight There were positive correlations between
@highlight G and
@highlight  and MRGs.
