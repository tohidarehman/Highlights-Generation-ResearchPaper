 Reactive oxygen species are likely to accumulate around severe bone defects which jeopardizes activities of surrounding cells and hampers new bone formation . An effective strategy to address this issue is to develop scaffolding biomaterials with both antioxidant and osteoinductive capacities . An aniline tetramer and glycine ethyl ester co substituted polyorganophosphazene was synthesized and expected to meet the demands since the AT moieties were antioxidant and the phosphorus rich phosphazene moieties were osteocompatible . Moreover the AT endowed the PATGP with conductivity to match the electrophysiology of bone tissues . By applying

@highlight An aniline tetramer and glycine ethyl ester co substituted polyorganophosphazene PATGP is synthesized.
@highlight PATGP is biodegradable and non cytotoxic for cell culture and
@highlight implantation.
@highlight PATGP is antioxidant and able to scavenge reactive oxygen species ROS .
@highlight PATGP is electroactive and rich of phosphorus element to be osteoinductive.
@highlight PATGP can induce osteogenesis more efficiently than non conductive polyorganophosphazene and polyester.
