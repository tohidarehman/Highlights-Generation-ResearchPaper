 The removal of contaminants in co solute systems is a pressing issue . Herein the adsorption capacities of magnetic biochars and activated carbon were investigated and compared for various aqueous anions including As tetracycline and NO

@highlight Magnetic biochars and magnetic activated carbon were successfully synthesized.
@highlight One step magnetic biochar showed the highest sorption capacity for As V and NO
@highlight Magnetization reduced the sorption capacity of tetracycline onto activated carbon.
@highlight Magnetic sorbents are promising materials to be applied in co contaminated environment.
