 Fenton reaction has been widely applied as a unique oxidative method in the treatment of industrial wastewater . However it generates a massive amount of Fe sludge which mostly contains other hazardous heavy metal waste that can harm the environment and humans . In this study we proposed a sustainable method to eliminate the side effect of the Fenton reaction and turn the Fenton sludge containing Cu into an efficient catalyst in the activation of peroxymonosulfate to degrade tetracycline . The existence of Cu which can increase the oxygen vacancies of the sludge is attributed to the activation efficiency compared with Fe sludge devoid of Cu . X ray diffraction and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy results show that Fe is present in the form of Fe

@highlight The recycled Fenton sludge showed a high activity for the activation of persulfate.
@highlight The existence of Cu II can increase the oxygen vacancies of the recycled sludge.
@highlight Tetracycline can be decomposed through six possible pathway processes.
@highlight The catalytic mechanism by the recycled catalyst is deciphered.
@highlight It is a cost effective and environmentally friendly way to gain active catalysts.
