 The plasmon induced interfacial charge transfer transition involves the direct electron transfer from a plasmonic metal to the acceptor state in a semiconductor . Such plasmonic decay is fostered by strong orbital coupling and mixing of electronic levels in plasmonic metals and SC . Although the effectiveness of PICTT for charge transfer has been testified its realization still remains a great challenge . Herein we employed a facile electroless reduction strategy for the in situ growth of copper nanoparticles over Cu
