 Lithium sulfur batteries are highly desirable for next generation energy storage and conversion systems because of their low cost high energy density and unparalleled specific capacity . However the sluggish redox kinetics and shuttling effect severely restrict the practical application of Li S batteries . Herein vanadium oxide nanorods were embedded in porous graphene aerogel GA VO

@highlight Vanadium oxide nanorods are successfully embedded in porous graphene aerogel.
@highlight The embedded VO
@highlight nanorods can effectively chemisorb and catalyze the LiPSs.
@highlight GA VO
@highlight  CB is prepared as a dual functional separator coating for Li S battery.
@highlight The shuttle effect is suppressed and the conversion kinetic is enhanced.
@highlight The resultant Li S batteries exhibit stable cycling behavior at high sulfur content.
