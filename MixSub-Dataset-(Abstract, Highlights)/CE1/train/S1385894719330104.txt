 Recently lithiumsulfur batteries achieve incredible research interest owing to outstanding theoretical storage capacity abundant resources economical and ecological affability . Nonetheless the real usage of LS battery obstructs by shuttling effect of soluble lithium based polysulfides that result in languid redox reactions while the vital diffusion and migration mechanism of Li and S onto TiN surface is yet a myth . Herein rational synthesis of titanium nitride nanoparticles and sulfur composite

@highlight Facile hot to cold synthesis of TiN and S nanoparticles composite as cathode materials.
@highlight DFT based calculation of diffusion barrier for TiN for Li and S.
@highlight Experimental Li S battery outstanding performances.
@highlight Short diffusion pathways charge density distribution and charge transfer attribution.
