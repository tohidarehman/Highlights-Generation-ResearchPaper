 UV filters a kind of personal care product are intractably degraded using conventional processes because of their trace concentration in the environment . The exploration of high performance stable and reusable materials for the highly efficient removal of UV filters is of great importance . In this study a series of three dimensional graphene oxide covalent triazine based frameworks aerogels prepared with different concentration ratios were designed to remove trace concentrations of benzophenone 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone and 2 hydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone from water which are regenerated by sunlight . 3D GO CTF not only adsorbs UV filters with high efficiency and capacity but can also be regenerated with an extremely high percentage recovery of 9095 in the 4th cycle . These 3D GO CTF materials exhibit switchable selectivity between the adsorption of the UV filters and regeneration of the 3D GO CTF by regulating the content of GO to function as the adsorbent and CTF for photocatalytic regeneration . Moreover the high reusability and extreme stability of the 3D GO CTF aerogels were verified over seven cycles of night day testing in a real water matrix which demonstrated their potential application in the efficient removal of micropollutants from the environment .

@highlight 3D GO CTF aerogels could effectively adsorb trace concentration of UV filters.
@highlight The spent aerogels can be regenerated by utilizing sunlight.
@highlight Regenerated 3D GO CTF remained effective for adsorption of UV filters from natural water.
@highlight Hybrid block can be easily recycled from natural water bodies.
