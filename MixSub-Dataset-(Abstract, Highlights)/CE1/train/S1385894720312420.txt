 Multi functional integrated materials used in extreme environments are gaining increased interest . In this study a binary porous SiC was fabricated by in situ synthesis in a SiC skeleton . The binary porous SiC exhibited unique features of synergistic effects of high temperature electromagnetic wave absorption mechanical and thermal insulation properties . The chemical composition evolution was characterized by transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy . Electronic structures were investigated by X ray absorption near edge structure at the C K edge . Based on a vaporsolidliquid growth mechanism a decrease in the vacancy defects and unoccupied C density of states was manifested in the binary porous SiC . Introducing the second SiC phase resulted in sharply enhanced EM wave absorption performance . The minimum reflection loss was as low as 51dB and the effective absorption bandwidth at 600C was 3.2GHz with a thickness of 2.4mm . Meanwhile the in situ grown second SiC phase substantially increased the compressive strength to 34.25MPa which was nearly 15 fold that of the porous SiC . Moreover the binary SiC showed a low thermal conductivity of 0.1572W mK . All these results indicated that the binary porous SiC system was ideal for EM wave absorption applications at extremely high temperatures .
