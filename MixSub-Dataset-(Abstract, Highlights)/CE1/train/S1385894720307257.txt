 The metal oxide facilitated transformation of polyphenols and amino acids to humic substances is an essential process in soil and compost maturing processes . The objective of this research was to examine the specific roles of MnO

@highlight First comprehensive study of the individual roles of MnO
@highlight and O
@highlight in humification.
@highlight was a major oxidant in the accumulation of humification product.
@highlight The main role of MnO
@highlight was a catalyst during the humification process.
@highlight The direct oxidation by MnO
@highlight was only limited to the transformation of FA.
