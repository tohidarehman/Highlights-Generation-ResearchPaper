 Traditional infrared radiation control materials such as metallic silver have low infrared emissivity but they are expensive dense and not compatible with absorbing performance in microwave section . Meanwhile the study of traditional absorbing materials is also limited to the synthesis and property investigation of powder materials without considering the mechanical properties thermal insulation properties corrosion resistance and other requirements required by the actual application conditions . To solve the above problems a cellulose skeleton with three dimensional structure was synthesized with polyaniline conductive polymer cladding on its surface . This aerogel could not only effectively consume the electromagnetic wave but also has great potential in thermal insulation application . The three dimensional skeleton of cellulose chitosan framework may greatly improve the conduction loss ability while polyaniline itself has a higher infrared reflectance and a lower microwave reflectance so the composite material has strong microwave loss performance and is compatible with thermal insulation . Remarkably the microwave absorption performance of the aerogel with broad

@highlight Employing cellulose as the framework to fabricate a novel sustainable microwave absorber.
@highlight The cellulose framework was enhanced by the blending with chitosan to achieve a more flexible bulk.
@highlight The loading of polyaniline PANI significantly improved the bulks thermal insulation ability.
@highlight The broad bandwidth of 6.04GHz at thickness of 1.9mm was obtained.
