 ZnO micro particles of narrow size distribution were successfully produced by the continuous hydrothermal synthesis of zinc nitrate in a coiled flow inverter reactor at different OH

@highlight CFI is a feasible technology for the narrowing of ZnO PSD.
@highlight PSD narrowing and size increase depend on mixing intensity and Zn OH 
@highlight  amount.
@highlight Nucleation limited process was determined to occur at lower OH
@highlight  Zn
@highlight  ratios.
@highlight Design strategy was developed to identify conditions that favors particle growth.
