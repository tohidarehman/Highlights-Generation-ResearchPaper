 A series of acid resistant polysulfonamide polyethersulfone composite pervaporation membranes were prepared by interfacial polymerization . The aqueous phase was a mixed solution containing m phenylenediamine and triethylenetetramine and the organic phase was a 1 3 benzenedisulfonyl chloride n hexane solution . Acid resistances of the composite membranes were assessed by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectrometer energy dispersive spectrometer and weight loss tests after being soaked in 20 wt H
