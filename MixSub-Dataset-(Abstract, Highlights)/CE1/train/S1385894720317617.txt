 With the enlarging application of thermal conductive composites in aviation field and so on not only high in plane thermal conductivity mechanical flexibility and electrical insulation but also thermal stability and fire resistance are critically desired . Although with outstanding advantages such as light weight good flexibility and processability the intrinsic flammability and high temperature intolerance are Achilles heel for most polymer based thermal conductive composites which severely hinders their application in harsh environments . To solve this issue we here proposed a facile strategy to prepare flexible all inorganic composite films inspired by the recent progress of using inorganic nanowires to prepare fire resistant paper . In this design one dimensional hydroxyapatite nanowires synthesized via solvothermal method and two dimensional boron nitride nanosheets prepared by liquid phase exfoliation were integrated together by vacuum assisted filtration to form layer structured composite films in which HAPNWs provided flexibility and BNNSs offered orientational thermal conductive pathways . When BNNSs loading content was 30wt the in plane TC value of the resultant composite film reached 6.4Wm
