 In this work the multifunctional elastomer foam with robust mechanical properties highly piezoresistive sensitivity special temperature sensitive characteristic and excellent EMI shielding property was successfully fabricated by directly introducing thermo expandable microspheres into polydimethylsiloxane multi walled carbon nanotube . It was found that the addition of EM enhanced the piezoresistivity integrating the properties of quick response excellent reliability and extraordinary stability . For example the value of I I

@highlight Multifunctional elastomer foams were achieved by thermos expandable microspheres.
@highlight Piezoresistivity of foams was improved by adding thermos expandable microspheres.
@highlight The foams showed distinguishing signal response reliability and stability.
@highlight The unfoamed composites showed NTC first and then PTC finally NTC again.
@highlight Microwave shielding was greatly improved by adding thermos expandable microspheres.
