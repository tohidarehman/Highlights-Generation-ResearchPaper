 Refined design of sustainable sorbent demands to tackle the strong dependence for additional mesoporous support and low utilization in hot coal gas desulfurization . Unlike the well established preparation of loading sorbents supported on zeolites a vacuum assisted self assemble strategy tapping into the ordered channels of walnut wood is proposed to facilely fabricate three dimensional

@highlight 3D self assembly sorbent derived by hierarchical anisotropy of walnut wood.
@highlight Highest breakthrough sulfur capacity and utilization over 8 Ce Mn 
@highlight Al
@highlight Excellent character of H
@highlight O resistance and anti interference for sorbents.
@highlight Macroporosity of vertical channel improved diffusion of H
@highlight S.
