 This manuscript describes an efficient and cost effective method to remove heavy metals of Hg and Cd in aqueous solutions via adsorption on activated carbon fibers after modification with NaOH solution . The Hg and Cd metals in the aqueous solution exist as Hg

@highlight NaOH modified activated carbon fiber removes to heavy metals cost effectively.
@highlight The NaOH modification induced abundant oxygen functional groups in micropore.
@highlight Heavy metals adsorbed by a polar oxygen functional groups and pore filling mechanism.
