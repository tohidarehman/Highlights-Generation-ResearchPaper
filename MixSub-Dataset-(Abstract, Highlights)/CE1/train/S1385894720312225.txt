 Mechanically durable superhydrophobic coatings have enormous application potential in almost all aspects of our daily lives . In this study we present a practical strategy for one step fabrication of robust superhydrophobic coatings based on evaporation driven self assembly of hydrophobic nanoparticles and wax into hierarchical structures . Depending on the solvent and coating distance spray coating a dispersion composed of alkyl silane functionalized nanoparticles and wax results in extremely water repellent surfaces with a water contact angle of 175 and a sliding angle of 3 . The formation of hierarchically structured surfaces upon evaporation of the solvent enables fabrication of fluorine free highly water repellent surfaces and provides high level of structural protection against mechanical abrasion . The coating retains its superhydrophobicity even after 1000 cycles of water spray impact 45min of water jet impact and 180cm of linear abrasion . The low cost scalable one step and fluorine free fabrication of superhydrophobic coatings that can be applied onto virtually any type of material surface with a satisfactory mechanical robustness based on eco friendly and industrially available materials presents promising avenues for practical applications .
