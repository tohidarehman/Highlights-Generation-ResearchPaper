 Discoloration events in drinking water distribution systems caused by iron oxide particles have occurred worldwide but the mechanism of organic pollutant accumulation by iron based particles in DWDSs has not yet been fully recognized . Here iron particle dominated loose deposits were collected from a real DWDS through pipe flushing . Also FeOOH based particles as an important component of deposits were grown with various coexisting substances to further simulate the influence of structure on accumulation effects . Here we found that the presence of cations including Al

@highlight Iron based particles could have various structure transformations in DWDS.
@highlight The FeOOH organic particles had higher specific area and more oxygen containing groups.
@highlight The FeOOH organic particles had stronger pollutant accumulation.
@highlight Hydrogen bonding played an important role in accumulation effects of FeOOH particles.
