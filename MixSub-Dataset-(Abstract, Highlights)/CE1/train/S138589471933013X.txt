 Titanium dioxide recently gained attention as sodium ion battery anode material . However its practical application is hindered by low specific capacity and mediocre cycling stability . Here we report for the first time nanointerface driven Na ion intercalation pseudocapacitance tuning as a strategy to substantially improve the performance of TiO

@highlight Nanointerface driven pseudocapacitance boosted Na ion storage performance.
@highlight Anatase bronze nanointerfaces resulted Na ion intercalation pseudocapacitance.
@highlight Hybrid TiO
@highlight anode exhibited 12 fold higher pseudocapacitancethan previous reports.
@highlight This strategy provides new opportunitiesto design advanced Na ion battery anodes.
