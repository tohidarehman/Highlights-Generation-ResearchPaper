 In this study the effect of the geometrical parameters of the Lateral Flow Immunoassay membrane on the performance of the pregnancy kits is investigated . Consequently a new geometry for LFI membrane is proposed based on some theoretical numerical and experimental observations in order to improve the performance of the related kits . A pregnancy kit is developed and the effect of the relocation of the test and the control lines over the membrane was studied based on the variation of the sample fluid velocity . Using Lattice Boltzmann simulation of the lateral flow within the porous media and the experimental results the fluid flow within the kit membrane was fully analyzed . Finally by focusing on the Washburn model a modified geometry for the kits membrane was suggested while the flow characteristics were studied by using numerical and experimental methods . It is concluded from the observations that in our proposed geometry the color intensity in the reaction zone of the kit is improved by 9.4 percent that can result in the reduction of antibody consumption in the kits membrane that could be a considerable saving during the production process of LFI .

@highlight An assay for detection of hCG in urine samples was developed.
