 Anaerobic co digestion of fats oils and grease with municipal wastewater sludge offers the opportunity to increase methane yields yet the impact of FOG on overall process dynamics and the associated microbial communities is not well understood . This study employed lab scale batch anaerobic co digestion assays to advance the understanding of the co digestion process through studying the dynamics of formation and consumption of intermediates along the anaerobic digestion pathway and correlating these to temporal analysis of methanogenic activity as well as end point microbial community structure . Methane production was delayed during sludge co digestion with FOG but not during digestion of sludge alone . Palmitic acid a long chain fatty acid accumulated during co digestion to concentrations above 16mM resulting in a lag in methane production . Acetate hydrogen and formate carbon and or energy sources for methanogens during methane production did not accumulate during the lag phase . Expression of the
