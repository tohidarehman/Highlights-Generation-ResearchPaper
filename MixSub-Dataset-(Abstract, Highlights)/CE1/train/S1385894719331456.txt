 Development of efficient adsorbent with low cost simple and green production process and zero secondary pollution for Cr removal in industrial applications is a great challenge for modern chemical and materials engineering . Here we developed a new strategy for preparation of porous polyacrylonitrile graphene oxide nanofibers by simple one step electrospinning of PAN GO solution in N N dimethylformamide H

@highlight PAN GO nanofibers with 5200nm pores were fabricated for efficient Cr VI removal.
@highlight BET specific surface area of the porous nanofibers was 164.210.8m
@highlight Maximum experimental adsorption capacity of Cr VI was up to 382.56.2mg g.
@highlight Reusability of the porous nanofibers was at least 20 times cycles.
@highlight Simple low cost green of one step electrospinning had great industrial potential.
