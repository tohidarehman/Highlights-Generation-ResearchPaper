 Innocuous citric acid modified wood membranes with carboxylic groups hold promise for application in water purification . In spite of this it remains challenging to make COOHs located deep inside wood cell walls due to the recalcitrant structure of the lignocellulosic materials . Herein the WMs were modified via the pretreatment with various NaOH concentrations followed by esterification with CA for tetracycline typical of antibiotics with amide carbonyl group . As NaOH concentration increased from 2 to 6 wood lignin decomposed and finally cellulosic structure began to dissolve . As a result the H bonds of hydroxyl on C3 and C6 changing to C2 and C6 made cellulose I transform to cellulose II . It facilitates the esterification between cellulose and CA to enhance the COOH content . The TC adsorption breakthrough curves showed that the x CAW had an 812 fold enhancement of the effective treatable volume with high adsorption capacity compared with raw wood . The largest amount of TC was adsorbed at pH 5 through the formation of Hbonding between the O
