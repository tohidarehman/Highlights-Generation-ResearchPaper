 Photocatalysis and ozonation have limited efficiency for the degradation of persistent pollutants as well as the mineralization of byproducts . In this work we intensify the degradation processes by using simultaneously both processes in macroporous catalytic supports under mild reaction conditions for degradation of tetracycline . The total organic carbon removal reached up to 90 after 180min of photocatalytic ozonation reaction achieving this record value using mild conditions . A comparison among processes showed the synergetic effect of photocatalysis and ozonation carried out in the macroporous support which presents a kinetics increase of 20 greater than the sum of the separated processes . About 100 of tetracycline degradation was achieved with a high total organic carbon removal . This effect is attributed to synergy with the porous structure which promote better O

@highlight High total organic carbon removal at mild process conditions.
@highlight The macroporous support acts as a static mixer enhancing the mass transfer.
@highlight Intensification by synergy among photocatalysis ozonation and the porous support.
@highlight This approach allows direct reuse avoiding further separation processes.
