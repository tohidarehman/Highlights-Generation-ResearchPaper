 In this work the use of infrared radiation as curing media to graft eugenol onto cellulose for bioactive paper obtaining is proposed with the aim to obtain a process compatible with typical processes for papermaking . Eugenol is grafted onto commercial papers using polycarboxylic acid as linking agent using infrared heating for reaction curing . The effect of different operation and design variables such as power time and distance to heat source were analyzed using an experimental design . Optimal infrared curing parameters were determined analyzing reaction degree mechanical properties and color by response surface methodology . The operation conditions were compared with laboratory pilot and industrial scale background concluding that the bioactive paper production could be adapted with the current papermaking process doing feasible scaling the bioactive paper production . The modified paper presents insectifuge and antimicrobial properties . A decrease in the biodegradability rate was observed however the biodegradable characteristic is conserved .
