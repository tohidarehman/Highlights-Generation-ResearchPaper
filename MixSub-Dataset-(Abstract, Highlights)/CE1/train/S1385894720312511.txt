 Transition metal oxides with earth abundance and high theoretical capacity have received ever growing interests as promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc ion batteries . However their semiconducting nature and poor conductivity lead to the kinetically sluggish rate and poor electrochemical reversibility . Herein a novel defect rich oxide nanowire filled graphene scrolls is introduced as a high performance cathode for ZIBs . The 1D ultrathin oxide nanowires with defective nature are enwrapped in the center of the graphene scrolls forming the core shell coaxial scrolls . Benefitting from the highly conductive graphene network and 1D structured oxide with defect rich structure the DNGS hybrid scrolls achieve fast electron ion transport high electrochemical reversibility and superior energy storage capability . For the first time the defect rich vanadate oxide V
