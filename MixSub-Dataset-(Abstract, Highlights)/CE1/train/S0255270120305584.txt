 In this work a numerical comparative study is carried out to investigate a laminar steady flow behavior of shear thinning non Newtonian fluids in three chaotic geometries Two Layer Crossing Channel Micromixer C shaped channel and serpentine channel . The process is validated for non Newtonian flow in a complex geometry which heated by a constant flux . Secondary flow structures are formed in the chosen geometries enhance significantly the fluid dynamic performances . To characterize this performance Poincar map method is presented for different geometries with various cases of fluid power law index . Thermal mixing behavior with two different inlet temperatures of shear thinning fluids in the considered geometries is performed . For various cases of fluid power law indexes the TLCCM displayed thermal mixing degree enhancement of 4284 relative to the thermal mixing degree in both C shaped and serpentine channels . The second law of thermodynamics is controlled in terms of entropy generation due to the thermal and hydrodynamic process as a function of low rates of generalized Reynolds number and power law index under the effects chaotic advection . Thereby the TLCCM configuration exhibited very important enhancement of mixing degree than that obtained in other considered geometries with minimization of friction and thermal irreversibilities .
