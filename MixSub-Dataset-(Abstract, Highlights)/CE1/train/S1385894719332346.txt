 Catalytic performance of a heterogeneous cobalt based catalyst for advanced oxidative process correlates tightly with its structure and composition . The main objective of this study is to maximize the utilization and accessibility of cobalt sites while enhancing their activity and stability through rational structural and composition designs and thus to achieve an excellent performance for heterogeneous peroxymonosulfate activation . To this end a novel CoTiO
