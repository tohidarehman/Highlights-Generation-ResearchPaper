 Highly stretchable supercapacitors are next generation energy storage systems with both high electrochemical performance and excellent mechanical properties under harsh conditions . In this study we fabricate three dimensional porous stretchable supercapacitor with wrinkled structure poly poly on a 3D porous reduced graphene oxide coated elastic substrate under pre strained conditions via a simple solution process . The stretchable supercapacitor exhibits an electrochemical energy capacity up to 82.4Fg
