 In this study rice straw biochar modified by copper oxide was successfully fabricated via a hydrothermal method and used as a catalyst for the degradation of organic pollutants by peroxydisulfate . RSBC CuO activated PDS exhibited an outstanding performance on the decomposition of phenacetin . Electron paramagnetic resonance confirmed that the reactive oxygen species included SO
