 The present study focuses on the adsorption of disperse blue 56 dyes on the surface of ZnO magnetic ZSM 5 as an effective and novel adsorbent with high adsorption capacity and magnetic separation capability . The best conditions to optimize the dye removal were obtained at adsorbent dosage 0.015 g pH 3 stirring time 15 min and initial dye concentration 10

@highlight Effects of parameters for synthesis of ZnO magnetic ZSM 5 were studied.
@highlight The ZnO magnetic ZSM 5 is efficient absorbent for adsorption of dye.
@highlight The kinetic pseudo first order was obtained.
