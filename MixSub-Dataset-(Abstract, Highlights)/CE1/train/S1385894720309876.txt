 Molecularly imprinted stir bar sorptive extraction is a powerful method for synchronously achieving rapid mixing and selective enrichment . Herein boronate affinity imprinted Janus nanosheets for stir bar sorptive extraction of

@highlight Janus nanosheets with different groups on each side were prepared.
@highlight MI SB was obtained by assemblage of NS 2 MIP with magnetic stir bar.
@highlight MI SB simplified the repair for damaged part of conventional stir bar.
@highlight This work is valuable for rapidly selective enrichment and separation catecol.
@highlight It achieves rapid mixing and selective enrichment of
@highlight  diol containing pollutants.
