 Phosphonates are environmental friendly materials and can be potentially employed to improve the removal efficiency of the clay materials . In the present work Zn Al layered double hydroxide intercalated with amino trimethylene phosphonic acid by a facile technique and employed as an adsorbent for Cu

@highlight The high adsorption capacity of A LDH is due to the metal chelating function.
@highlight The reactive sites in ATMP are firstly revealed by Multiwfn calculation.
@highlight The non covalent interactions of water clay interface are firstly presented by IGM.
@highlight IGM analysis confirmed that ATMP LDH is combined together mainly by H bond.
@highlight The reactive sites and non covalent interactions support experimental results.
