 Ever increased investigation has been focused on designing photocatalysts comprising intimately interfaced photo absorbers and co catalysts for promoting the separation of electron hole pairs and surface redox reaction . Herein we present a photocatalytic system in which the single site cobalt atom is firmly trapped and stabilized into the frameworks of porous crimped graphitic carbon nitride g C

@highlight A supramolecular anchoring strategy is reported to stabilize single atom dispersed cobalt.
