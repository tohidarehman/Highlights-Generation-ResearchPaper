 Utilizing intratumoral iron mediated Fenton reaction to induce cancer cells destruction chemodynamic therapy is an emerging tumor specific therapeutic strategy . However the CDT efficacy is severely restrained by insufficient endogenous H

@highlight pH redox dual responsive targeted supramolecular catalytic nanoreactor was designed.
@highlight Prodrug Fc CA combined ROS generator with Fenton catalyst for molecular level CDT.
@highlight Nanoreactor activated oxidative stress amplification and cascaded Fenton reaction.
@highlight Nanoreactor realized synergistic chemo chemodynamic therapy with good biosafety.
