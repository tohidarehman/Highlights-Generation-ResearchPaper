 As a means of assessing the viability of hydrate based gas separation this study examined the gas absorption performance of a flow type gasliquid contact device with static mixing . Assuming for the sake of simplification that the hydrate based gas uptake occurred as a result of pseudo gasliquid contact in a bubble hydrate slurry solution overall liquid side volumetric mass transfer coefficients were determined . An R134aN

@highlight The volumetric mass transfer coefficient for hydrate based gas uptake was evaluated.
@highlight An R134aN
@highlight mixture was used as a model gas with the aim of separating R134a.
@highlight The gas uptake coefficient was more than ten times that for gas dissolution.
