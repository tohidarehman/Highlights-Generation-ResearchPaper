 The design and fabrication of high performance noble metal free electrocatalysts with controlled structure and composition remains a great challenge for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction . Herein self supported Co Mo

@highlight Self supported Co Mo
@highlight C carbon nanofiber mats have been developed.
@highlight Co Mo
@highlight C CNF can be directly acted as electrocatalyst due to its self supported structure.
@highlight The synergistic modulation of Co and Mo
@highlight C can obviously enhance the HER performance.
