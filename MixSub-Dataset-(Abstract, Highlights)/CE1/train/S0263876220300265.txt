 Nanofluids heat transfer in a helical coil under pulsation condition was numerically simulated . The dynamic single phase model which considered Brownian motion effect was utilized to study the Al

@highlight Nanofluids heat transfer in a helical coil under pulsation condition was simulated.
@highlight Impact of various pulsation parameters on the heat transfer performance was studied.
@highlight got its maximum value of 1.35 at the optimum pulsation frequency.
@highlight The enhancing mechanisms of nanofluids heat transfer under pulsation were explored.
