 Metal organic gels as outstanding heavy metals adsorbents suffer the problems of ex situ construction and not being able to reutilize which restricts the widespread applications . To deal with this challenge an in situ ultrasound assisted technology integrated adsorbent fabrication with heavy metals removal in actual wastewater was firstly proposed . Characterizations analyses showed that the multivariate MOGs was successfully constructed in industrial wastewater and simultaneous obtained a superb removal efficiency of 97.2 95.3 and 98.1 for Cu Cd and Cr and the treated wastewater can reach the effluent standard . X ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis and density functional theory calculation indicate that MMOGs obtained the most stable structure owing to the most stable binding energy mainly attributed to the interaction between Cu andCOOH of gelators that generates additional bonding sites for capturing Cd and Cr during the synthesis of adsorbent . Furthermore we successfully show the possibility to reuse the adsorbed MMOGs in the oxyanions contaminated water and it exhibits satisfactory removal capacity for Sb with favorable biodegradability . This study provides a new insight and promising model for actual heavy metal wastewater treatment as well as resource utilization .

@highlight An in situ heavy metal removal strategy by MMOGs in actual wastewater was proposed.
@highlight In situ method realized full exposure and generation additional of binding sites.
@highlight The adsorbed MMOGs can be reutilized for Sb V capture.
