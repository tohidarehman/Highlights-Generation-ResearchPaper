 Microbial protein can alleviate the increasing pressure of food demand on agriculture and our environment . For its sustainable production feedstocks such as biomethane or hydrogen are needed . Here we coupled biogas produced from agricultural waste directly with electrochemical biogas upgrading to subsequently produce MP from methane hydrogen or a mixture thereof . Biogas was produced from co digestion of pumpkin and pig manure at production rates of 0.730.24 L

@highlight Electrochemical upgraded biogas was used for microbial protein production.
@highlight CO
@highlight and CH
@highlight were used simultaneously as carbon sources in mixed cultures.
@highlight Upgraded cathode off gas generates more microbial protein than raw biogas.
