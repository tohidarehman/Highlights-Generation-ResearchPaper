 Fluidized Bed Dryer is one of the efficient methods for drying moist particulate products . At the same time the design and optimization of a full industrial scale FDB requires extensive studies . Using a pilot scale dryer can be deemed as an efficient tool to obtain essential information on the drying phenomenon . Although these kinds of experimental analyses can provide valuable insight there are still some operational limitations including high pressure or high temperature conditions which make the use of a computational procedure highly desirable . In this study Computational Fluid Dynamics approach has been employed to investigate a dryer . The results of numerical simulations were verified using the experimental data obtained from a pilot scale dryer . The present investigation aims to study the effects of different operating conditions . It was observed that the impacts of gas inlet temperature were negligible as the dryer was equipped with a thermal jacket while the gas injection velocity had significant effects on the dryers performance . Moreover the efficiencies of the conical and horizontal gas distributors were compared and it was concluded that the conical configuration results in better performance . The numerical and experimental investigation from this study can facilitate the design and scale up of an industrial dryer plant .
