 One of the main drawbacks of heterogeneous photocatalysis is the high consumption of electrical energy generated by conventional lamps . This study proposes a methodology to find the best distribution of light emitting diodes i.e . the least amount of elements and the optimum distance between them in order to substitute conventional lamps in photocatalytic processes and a performance analysis in terms of energetic efficiency using for this the Electric energy per order E
