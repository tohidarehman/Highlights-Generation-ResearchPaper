 X ray absorption fine structure analysis has been successfully used to determine the coordination environment and therefore uptake mechanism towards the uranyl cation for a selection of commercially available ion exchange resins in non saline and saline conditions Cl

@highlight Most N containing functionalities on resins uptake uranyl as UO
@highlight  SO
@highlight Amidoxime containing resins form coordination complexes with uranyl.
@highlight Mixed sulfonate phosphonate functionalities on resins chelate uranyl.
@highlight No difference in uranyl speciation on resins loaded from fresh and sea water.
