 Activated bio carbons were developed from residues of supercritical extraction of raw plans such as raspberries blackcurrant nettle and green tea . The physicochemical properties of the activated bio carbons were characterized by low temperature nitrogen sorption and Boehm titration . All materials were used for the adsorption of methylene blue and methyl red from liquid phase . The influence of different parameters such as initial concentration contact time and pH of dyes solution on the effectiveness of organic dyes adsorption was evaluated . The possibility of using the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models for description of the character of the sorption processes was checked . The experimental data were found to be well described by the pseudo second order model . All materials were also used for nitrogen dioxide adsorption form gas phase . The presence of steam in the stream of gases has a positive effect on adsorption of toxic gas by bio sorbents obtained . The maximum sorption capacity of the activated bio carbons towards methylene blue was 146mg g
