 Silicone rubber is one of the most promising dielectric elastomer materials for DE actuator but it is still limited by low properties such as mechanical strength dielectric constant and actuated strain at low electric fields . In this study we report the design and preparation of SiR DE composite with simultaneously improved tensile strength dielectric constant and actuated strain at low electric fields by introducing both polar functional group and multifunctional filler . Firstly carboxyl groups were grafted onto polymethylvinylsiloxane by using a radical mediated thiol ene click reaction to improve the dipole polarizability . Meanwhile epoxy group functionalized TiO

@highlight The interfacial cross linking bonding between E TiO
@highlight and PMVS COOH was formed.
@highlight Both dipole and interfacial polarization lead to the large increase in .
@highlight The mechanical strength was largely improved due to good interfacial interaction.
@highlight The actuated strain at low electrical field was largely improved.
