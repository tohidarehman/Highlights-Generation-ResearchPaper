 The introduction of graphene into biochar can effectively and economically improve the capabilities of biochar for environmental applications . Graphene containing biochar derived from biological solid waste such as sugar cane trash coconut shell old corrugated cardboard packages and chicken feather possess a lot of improvement in physicochemical properties as compared to raw biochar . Consequently graphene containing biochar demonstrates a greatly enhanced environmental remediation potential . However the production of graphene containing biochar from biological solid wastes and its characterization and potential use for the remediation of organic and inorganic pollutants in the environments have not been critically reviewed up to date . Therefore we aim to summarize the state of art knowledge about graphene containing biochar preparation and its environmental applications . Furthermore five types of preparation techniques for graphene containing biochar and their applications for water remediation have been reviewed and discussed iron based catalytic methods for graphene like biochar carbonization with natural multilayered materials for graphene like biochar hummers method oxidation and exfoliation by strong acid and KMnO
