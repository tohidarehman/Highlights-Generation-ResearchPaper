 Heterogenous hydrogenations of high value chemicals are a widely used class of reaction that potentially benefit from the advantages continuous processing possesses . Trickle bed reactors offer a viable alternative to batch manufacture however further understanding of the interplay between hydrogen mass transfer and catalytic reaction is required to facilitate the uptake of such technologies .

@highlight Convection and mass transfer of H
@highlight into a film on a single 1 Pd C pellet were decoupled.
@highlight Hydrogen uptake was significantly affected by dissolved hydrogen in the feed.
@highlight A new two stage mass transfer model was developed and fitted to the uptake data.
@highlight The model accounts for H
@highlight transfer over inert and catalytically active surfaces.
@highlight Catalyst productivity in mol kg Pd increases if the G L surface area in m
@highlight  kg Pd is increased.
