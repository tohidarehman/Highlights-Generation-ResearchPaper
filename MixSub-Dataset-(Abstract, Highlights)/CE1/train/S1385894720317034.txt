 Biological contamination of surfaces is a thorny issue that brings series of adverse factors to the daily life and industrial manufacture . A dragonfly wing mimicking nanopillar array of ZnO Au on Polydimethylsiloxane with two fold bactericidal activity as well as the antiadhesive property has been developed . In this process ZnO nanopillar is obtained using a hydrothermal method followed by the introduction of plasmonic gold nanoparticles via a photo reduction protocol . The obtained PDMS ZnO Au surface demonstrates physical antibacterial performance resulting in a killing rate of 65.5 in dark . Furthermore the surface effectively inactivates bacteria under visible light irradiation yielding a lethality 99.9 in 30min . The advantages of high lethality rate and short action time are endowed to PDMS ZnO Au by a two fold antibacterial action combining the enhanced photocatalysis upon the introduction of Au nanoparticles and the mechanical property of biomimetic nanostructure . Meanwhile the nanopillar modified PDMS can also function as a superhydrophobic surface and efficiently impede bacterial adhesion by over 99.9 . Therefore the approach presented here holds a promising solution to tackle biological contamination for medical paint catheter and implant equipment .
