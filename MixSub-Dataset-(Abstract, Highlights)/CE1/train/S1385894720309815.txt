 Black shale source rocks have become a key natural gas resource in the US and China . Unlike in conventional hydrocarbon reservoirs a significant fraction of the gas in shales is adsorbed onto the inordinate specific surface areas of micropores inside organic matter with densities exceeding those of bulk gas by an order of magnitude . Yet the distribution of adsorbed versus bulk gas remains poorly understood . Experiments measure

@highlight Methane adsorption is analyzed for 12 shale samples up to 15MPa and from 35 to 120.
@highlight Temperature and pressure dependent adsorption layer densities are modeled.
@highlight Variable rather than constant densities improve predictions of absolute adsorption.
