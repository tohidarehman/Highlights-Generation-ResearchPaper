 Many heterostructures containing two types of strong polar bonds were often designed to synergistically increase the chemical confining for soluble lithium polysulfide in lithium sulfur batteries . To make maximum use of the two chemical interactions on confining the polysulfides a novel structure of 2D hexagonal WS
