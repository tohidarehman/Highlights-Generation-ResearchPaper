 In this work a facile sol gel strategy was developed to synthesize N P co doped ordered mesoporous carbons . By accelerating the volatilization of ethanol a strong driving force promoted the self assembly process among carbon precursor surfactant and dopant at the interface of water and ethanol . The obtained NPMC showed stacked flake like surface morphology and ordered 2D hexagonal mesostructures with uniform pore size and high specific surface areas 938m

@highlight A novel sol gel strategy was developed to avoid the time consuming procedure.
@highlight Synergic effects between N and P atoms provide more active sites and wettability.
@highlight An ultrahigh capacitance and excellent cycle stability were obtained.
@highlight The assembled symmetric supercapacitor shows extremely high energy density.
