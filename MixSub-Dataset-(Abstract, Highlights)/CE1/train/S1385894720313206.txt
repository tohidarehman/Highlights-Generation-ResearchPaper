 Carbon capture from power plants represents a powerful technique to mitigate increasing greenhouse gas emissions . In this work we describe a thin film composite membrane incorporating a polymer of intrinsic microporosity and metal organic framework nanoparticles for post combustion CO

@highlight An ultrathin highly permeable
@highlight gutter layer provided much less gas transport resistance.
@highlight The fresh
@highlight based TFC membranes exhibited a CO
@highlight permeance of 4660 7460 GPU along a CO
@highlight  N
@highlight selectivity of 2633.
@highlight The aged
@highlight  Ni MOF 74 TFC membranes showed a CO
@highlight permeance of 1200 GPU and a CO
@highlight  N
@highlight selectivity of 30.
@highlight Methanol vapor treatment can recover over 40 of CO
@highlight permeance while maintaining CO
@highlight  N
@highlight selectivity.
