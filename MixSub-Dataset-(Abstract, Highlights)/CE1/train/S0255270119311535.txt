 The effect of the impeller designs and impeller clearance level on power consumption mixing time and air entrainment point in a single liquid phase under turbulent conditions Re 10

@highlight Macro mixing study for different impeller design at different clearances in stirred vessel.
@highlight Develop a new curved blade impeller design.
@highlight Develop a correlation to estimate mixing time using nonlinear regression method.
@highlight Develop a model to predict mixing time.by using fuzzy Cmeans ANFISFCM .
@highlight Compare the prediction capability of the ANFISFCM and the empirical correlations.
