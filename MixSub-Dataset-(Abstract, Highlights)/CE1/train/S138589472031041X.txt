 Biochars have been suggested as cheap eco friendly and commercially available media for adsorbing various organic and inorganic target compounds . However there is a dearth of systematic examinations on the design of shape and thermally stable organic phase change materials . In this investigation composite PCMs based on standard biochars and organic PCMs were developed . The as prepared composite PCMs revealed enhanced thermal stabilities chemical compatibilities and moderate heat transfer performances . Among these biochar derived composites one from oilseed rape exhibited high heating enthalpy of 73.7 and 90.5kJ kg for 1 dodecanol and n dodecane respectively . The impregnation volume of dodecane based composite reached 71.6 which can be ascribed to the favorable structural and morphological characteristics of the supporting materials . The synthesis of 1 dodecanol based composite appeared to be influenced by specific surface areas of the biochars and intermolecular interactions owing to the highly sensitive hydroxyl group of the organic PCM . In general this study is expected to serve as a foundation for the synthesis of green composite PCMs in the thermal energy storage sector .
