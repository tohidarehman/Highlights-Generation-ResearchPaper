 Lepidolite is a precious multi metal resources of lithium rubidium cesium and potassium . A chlorination process for efficient co extraction of Li Rb Cs and K from lepidolite concentrate was investigated in this study . The lepidolite concentrate was roasted with a mixed chlorination agent of CaCl

@highlight Li Rb Cs and K were co extracted effectively from lepidolite with rejection of Al.
@highlight A chlorination process using the mixed agent of CaCl
@highlight and NaCl was investigated.
@highlight A leachate with few impurities was obtained benefiting subsequent purification.
@highlight The mechanism and phase transformation of the chlorination process was explored.
