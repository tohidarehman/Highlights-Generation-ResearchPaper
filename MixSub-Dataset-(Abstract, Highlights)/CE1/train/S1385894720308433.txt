 This study compared the removal and mineralization of nitrobenzene by electrolysis using granular activated carbon as three dimensional electrodes ozonation and the combination of electrolysis GAC and ozone E GAC O

@highlight Combining electrolysis O
@highlight  and GAC achieves a remarkable synergy for nitrobenzene NB removal.
@highlight Reactive oxidative species ROS were probed and
@highlight OH generation paths were quantitatively analyzed in E GAC O
@highlight GAC in E GAC O
@highlight possesses a stable catalytic activity even after reusing for 50 times.
@highlight The E GAC O
@highlight process can protect the properties of GAC from oxidative destroy of ozone and ROS.
@highlight Replenishing of free electrons from both cathode and inside of GAC is critical for GAC stability.
