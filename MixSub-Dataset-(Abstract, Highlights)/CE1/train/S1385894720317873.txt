 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons like phenanthrene and pyrene are found ubiquitously in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems . This study has attempted to investigate mechanistic features of simultaneous degradation of phenanthrene and pyrene by the yeast

@highlight Co biodegradation of two PAHs phenanthrene and pyrene using yeast
@highlight Formulation of kinetic model for cell growth accounting for self and cross inhibition.
@highlight Kinetic parameters revealed strong competitive cross inhibition between two substrates.
@highlight Inhibition induced by pyrene on cell growth was higher than phenanthrene.
@highlight Metabolic pathway initiated by dioxygenase enzymes leads to TCA cycle.
