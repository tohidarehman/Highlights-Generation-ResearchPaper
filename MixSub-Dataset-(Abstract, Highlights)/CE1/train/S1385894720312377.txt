 Recently metal doped organic inorganic hybrid nanomaterials have attracted substantial attention for their high catalytic activity in the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction . Here we report three novel porous metal phosphonates cobalt phosphonate nickel phosphonate and nickel cobalt phosphonate using iminodi as an organophosphorous precursor

@highlight Newly designed microporous metal phosphonates such as NiPIm CoPIm and NiCoPIm.
@highlight Hydrothermal non templated synthetic pathway by using iminodi methylphosphonic acid as an organophosphorous precursor.
@highlight Cobalt phosphonate CoPIm material exhibited excellent electrocatalytic behavior.
@highlight Overpotential and Tafel slope of CoPIm are 334mV and 58.6mVdec
@highlight  respectively.
@highlight CoPIm reveals the excellent stability up to 25h.
