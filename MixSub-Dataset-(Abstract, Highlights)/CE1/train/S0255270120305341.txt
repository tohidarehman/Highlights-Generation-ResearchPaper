 The present study aimed to develop a culturing regime directed to achieve an optimal balance of growth with DHA yield by an indigenous DHA producing microalga

@highlight I1 produces docosahexaenoic acid comparable to commercial sources.
@highlight The fatty acid profile of the isolate shows appropriate health lipid indices.
@highlight Production of docosahexaenoic acid is improved by biomass optimization.
@highlight Salinity temperature and light have simultaneous effect on DHA production.
