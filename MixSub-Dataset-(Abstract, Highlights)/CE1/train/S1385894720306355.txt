 Conductive polymer composites with high conductivity possess high electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness which is however associated with the complication of excessive reflectivity to cause secondary pollution . In this regard we designed a micro shielding unit named reflection absorption integrated shielding compartment which was composed of magnetic hybrids uniformly distributed inside and the CNT walls wrapped outside . Magnetic hybrids were synthesized by depositing Fe

@highlight Reflection absorption integrated shielding compartment was designed.
@highlight Such a compartment is composed by conductive wall and lossy core.
@highlight High EMI shielding effectiveness with improved absorption ability was obtained.
@highlight Compartment structure and lossy hybrids showed a synergic effect on EMI shielding.
