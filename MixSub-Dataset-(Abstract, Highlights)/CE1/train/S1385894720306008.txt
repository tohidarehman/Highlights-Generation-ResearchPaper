 The interfacial structure plays a key role for photoinduced charge transfer and molecular activation in heterogenous photocatalysis . However the specific interfacial electronic structure of heterostructure and its effect on the photocatalysis reaction have remained unclear . Herein insulator based heterostructure CaSO

@highlight CaSO
@highlight insulator based heterojunction was constructed for the first time.
@highlight Electron rich heterojunction interface promote the activation of small molecules.
@highlight The formation of activated reactants facilitated the photocatalytic reactions.
@highlight Much more amount of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals could be produced.
@highlight The electron rich heterojunction provides pathways for inert pollutant conversion.
