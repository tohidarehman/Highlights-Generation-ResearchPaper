 Due to the flexible tenability adjustable structure and the facile exchangeability of intercalated anions some kinds of LDHs and their derivatives have demonstrated excellent photocatalytic or electrocatalytic activity hence they could be used as catalysts for organic pollutions degradation harmful anion ions reduction the yield of hydrogen and oxygen carbon dioxide reduction nitrogen fixation and so on . This review mainly summarizes recent developments in photocatalytic electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic properties of LDHs based materials . In addition based on the published experimental data in the references to analyze the difference of their catalyst properties . Obviously an enormous challenge in this fast development field is to synchronously enhance the catalytic activity selectivity and stability of these LDHs based materials by designing novel structure of the catalysts . All in all these LDHs based materials can be used for helping efficiently solve the energy shortage and environment pollution and improve the usage of solar energy .

@highlight The preparation methods of series LDHs based functional materials are summarized.
@highlight Discussion on photo electro catalytic applications in environment and energy sectors.
@highlight An outlooke of possible future research directions for LDHs based materials.
