 In this study the highly efficient procedure for the synthesis of benzaldehyde by ozonolysis of styrene in a rotating packed bed reactor has been developed . Ozonolysis in RPB reactor yielded significantly more benzaldehyde compared to the stirred tank reactor in 15min . Response surface methodology was applied to optimize the simultaneous influence of experimental parameters on the yield of benzaldehyde . The relative influence of parameters on the yield of benzaldehyde decreased in the following order O

@highlight Highly selective oxidation of styrene to benzaldehyde by O
@highlight process in a rotating packed bed RPB was proposed.
@highlight RPB O
@highlight exhibited higher oxidation property for the synthesis of benzaldehyde.
@highlight Effects on the yield of benzaldehyde were optimized with response surface methodology RSM .
@highlight Possible mechanism of ozonization for the synthesis of benzaldehyde was deduced.
