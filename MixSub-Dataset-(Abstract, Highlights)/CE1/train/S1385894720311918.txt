 The sulfonated polyethylenimine was designed and employed to prepare high performance loose nanofiltration membranes . A simple ring opening reaction of polyethylenimine with 1 3 propanesulfonate was firstly conducted to synthesize SPEI . Then NF membranes were obtained by the cross linked reaction between SPEI and trimesoyl chloride via interfacial polymerization . Thanks to the restraining effect on interfacial polymerization from the sulfonic acid groups of SPEI NF membranes with loose structures of surface layers as well as more negatively charged and hydrophilic surfaces were prepared . The optimized loose nanofiltration membrane presented high dye rejections to Victoria blue B Congo red Methyl blue and Reactive red 120 and low salt rejections to Na

@highlight Sulfonated polyethylenimine SPEI was synthesized and used for loose NF membranes.
@highlight NF SPEI membrane exhibited desirable high pure water and permeate fluxes.
@highlight NF SPEI membrane has high dye rejections and salt permeations for dye salt mixtures.
@highlight The membrane has a good anti fouling ability and stability for dye salt mixture feeds.
