 Nanozymes are attractive alternatives to natural enzymes due to their high stability and low cost . However it is still a great challenge to acquire highly active specific and multi functional nanozyme catalysts for chemo biosensing and peroxymonosulfate activation to degrade toxic dye pollutants . Metal organic frameworks are attractive templates to construct multi functional catalysts . Herein Co
