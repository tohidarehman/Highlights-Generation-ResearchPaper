 Laboratory scale electrochemical disinfection experiments were carried out to investigate its removal efficiency for 23 antibiotic resistance genes that confer against 8 classes of antibiotics and its effects on the antibiotic resistance of surviving bacteria . EC treatments were conducted at different current densities and with different reaction times . Prolonged electrolysis resulted in a higher inactivation rate than an increased current density while the former was less efficient in the removal of ARGs . For example the inactivation ratios for the T20 and D80 treatments were both 99 while the decrease in the relative abundance of ARGs with D80 was greater than that with T20 . The detection frequency of bacteria resistant to the tested antibiotics decreased by 9100 after EC treatment . This was mainly attributed to a change in bacterial composition . The proportion of bacteria with high antibiotic resistance frequencies decreased such as

@highlight Generations of free chlorine and
@highlight OH varied between T and D treatments.
@highlight ARGs removal was closely associated with free chlorine and
@highlight OH.
@highlight The relative abundance of ARGs decreased with increasing current densities.
@highlight Less multi antibiotic resistant bacteria survived EC treatments.
@highlight The MAR indices of wastewater was significantly reduced after EC disinfection.
