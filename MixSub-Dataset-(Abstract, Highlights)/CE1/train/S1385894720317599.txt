 The Organometallic complex consisting of iron and 3 amino 2 hydroxypropanesulfonic acid ligand is newly suggested as negative active species for redox flow battery while ferrocyanide

@highlight Fe DIPSO consisting of Fe and DIPSO ligand is suggested as negative active species.
@highlight Fe DIPSO and Fe CN 
@highlight are selected as redox couple for RFB.
@highlight Fe DIPSO has a strong resistance against the reduction to Fe s .
@highlight Cell voltage of the redox couple is 1.37V.
@highlight RFB using new redox couple has 14.4 AhL
@highlight  capacity and 93.2 mWcm
@highlight  power density .
