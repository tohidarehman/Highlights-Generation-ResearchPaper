 Total ammonia nitrogen is a significant sign of the polluted water body and harms the aquatic environment . In order to enhance ammonia resource recovery and simultaneously treat the wastewater a novel flat sheet gas permeable membranes were prepared by paper making and hot press forming process sequentially . Because of an excellent balanced performance the GPM 3 was selected as the core functional component for the flat sheet GPM modules . Results demonstrated that the optimal TAN recovery rate of this contactor could be achieved at pH value 11 temperature 30C stirring speed 150rpm and flow velocity 7m min after 6h reaction wherein the overall mass transfer coefficient

@highlight A novel flat sheet GPM was prepared for ammonia resource recovery form wastewater.
@highlight 75.9 recovery rate of TAN was achieved at the optimal conditions.
@highlight GPM could balance COD TN ratio and recover TAN for landfill leachate treatment.
@highlight GPM is a realistic separation medium because of the prominent antifouling property.
