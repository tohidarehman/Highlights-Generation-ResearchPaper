 The pore distribution in activated carbon is crucial for its performance on adsorption processes . In desulfurization applications the literature highlights the importance of pores from 5 to 10 . However little is known and reported about the range of ultramicropores smaller than 4 which has been found in commercial samples used for H

@highlight Ultramicropores exert a strong influence on the adsorption capacity of the materials.
@highlight A method to block ultramicropores has been proposed based on molecular simulation.
@highlight The ultramicropore blockage causes a drastic drop in H
@highlight S retention.
@highlight The ultramicropore blockage affects not only physisorption but also chemisorption.
@highlight Ultramicropores immobilize and then redistribute molecules to the pore network.
