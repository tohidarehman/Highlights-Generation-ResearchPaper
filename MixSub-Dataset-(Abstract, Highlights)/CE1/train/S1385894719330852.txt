 Herein an efficient electrochemiluminescence energy resonance transfer system was first applied in an immunosensor for the detection of chloramphenicol . SnS

@highlight A novel ECL RET from SnS
@highlight QDs to
@highlight NSs is applied in a competitive immunosensor.
@highlight As an environmentally friendly nanomaterial SnS
@highlight QDs is acted as a donor in ECL RET.
@highlight The flaky
@highlight NSs served as the acceptor displaying stable quenching performance.
@highlight The proposed biosensor provide a sensitive and specific method for CAP detection.
