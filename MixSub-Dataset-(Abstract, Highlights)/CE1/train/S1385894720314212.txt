 With the progress of intelligent electronic equipment flexible and wearable strain sensors are being widely used in various applications such as electronic skins and smart robot . In this work we proposed a facile method for the preparation of stretchable strain sensors as well as compressible strain sensors by using commercially available melamine form . Firstly MF was coated with reduced graphene oxide to construct conductive networks via layer by layer assembly of polyethyleneimine and graphene oxide followed by chemical reduction . Thermoplastic elastomer poly styrene

@highlight Melamine foams were used as raw materials for strain sensors preparation.
@highlight The sensors were prepared by dip coating and solution absorption of rGO and SEBS.
@highlight The strain sensors could be stretchable as well as compressible.
@highlight The sensors exhibited good durability and potential in human motion monitoring.
