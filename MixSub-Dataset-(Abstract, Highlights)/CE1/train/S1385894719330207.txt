 Biochar was mixed with natural pyrite to catalyze the Fenton like oxidation of herbicide 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid so as to accelerate the degradation reaction . The accelerating effects of two biochars with different adsorption capacities were compared . The biochars functions on accelerating the oxidation were investigated by using radical scavengers electron spin resonance and the chemical probe method . The results indicated that the rate constant

@highlight Biochar accelerated 2 4 D degradation using pyrite as the Fenton like catalyst.
@highlight Biochar increased the production of
@highlight OH in the Fenton like system.
@highlight The mechanism related to the increased production of
@highlight OH was investigated.
@highlight The Fenton like oxidation of 2 4 dichlorophenol was also accelerated by biochar.
