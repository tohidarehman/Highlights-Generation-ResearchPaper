 Particle separation has been extensively studied in recent years in a wide range of sciences especially in the field of medicine and biotechnology . On the other hand the topic has been considered in the context of interdisciplinary research hence many experiments have been carried out in this field . Particle separation is used to track particles during the drug delivery process the direction of the droplets in a specified path etc . Both numerical and experimental methods have been used for separating and sorting different particles . Particle separation is performed using both active and passive techniques . In the present work various passive techniques of particle separation are explained and compared to evaluate the separation efficiency throughput rate and clogging in microfluidic devices . The present paper focuses on the investigations conducted in particle separation between 2015 and 2020 .
