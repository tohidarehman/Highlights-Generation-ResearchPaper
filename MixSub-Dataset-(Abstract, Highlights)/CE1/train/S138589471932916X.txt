 The most important thing to do with hexavalent chromium removal in wastewater through adsorption reduction method is to find an adsorbent that has both strong adsorbability and reducibility . Herein an eco friendly material ZIF 8 EGCG which was a combination of epicatechin gallate and ZIF 8 was synthesized to treat Cr containing wastewater . At room temperature the maximum adsorption amount of Cr reached 136.96mgg

@highlight ZIF 8 was firstly modified with epicatechin gallate EGCG .
@highlight Positively charged ZIF 8 became negatively charged upon modification.
@highlight ZIF 8 EGCG showed greatly improved adsorption and reduction for Cr VI .
@highlight Adsorption of Cr VI on ZIF 8 EGCG was governed by both physical and chemical processes.
