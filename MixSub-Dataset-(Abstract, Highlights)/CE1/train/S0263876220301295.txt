 The present study analyses the thermowell system for monitoring temperatures in a fixed bed catalytic reactor for the highly exothermic partial oxidation of o xylene to phthalic anhydride . Particle resolved computational fluid dynamics simulations are presented for the cases of randomly packed spheres inside cylindrical tubes with tube to particle diameter ratios

@highlight Axial thermowells change the void fraction and cause flow by passing in fixed beds.
@highlight For phthalic anhydride synthesis thermowells displace hot spots downstream.
@highlight Axial thermowell measurements can underestimate hot spot temperatures.
@highlight Temperature errors do not always decrease with thermowell size due to local effects.
