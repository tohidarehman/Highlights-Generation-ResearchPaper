 Red emitting carbon dots still suffer from low photoluminescence quantum yield and unclear luminescence mechanism . Group IIIA elements are firstly introduced to improve the QY of RCDs and the QY has been significantly increased from 0.29 to 12.02 1.99 and 1.53 for B CDs Al CDs and Ga CDs respectively . The improvement of QY for RCDs is mainly originated from the formation of C

@highlight Group IIIA B Al Ga elements are firstly selected to improve the QY of RCDs by doping.
@highlight The improvement mechanism of group IIIA elements on QY was investigated.
@highlight An energy band structure was built to disclose the switchable emission of B doped RCDs.
@highlight Acid alkaline induced discoloration of B CDs was used for a dual mode anti counterfeiting.
