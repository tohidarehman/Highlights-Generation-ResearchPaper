 Energetic coordination polymers as a new class of energetic materials have attracted extensive attention in recent years . However controllable modulation of mechanical sensitivities and the establishment of structure function theoretical models of ECPs to meet different applications remain great challenges . Herein we designed and synthesized four azide based ECPs Cd

@highlight Four novel azide based ECPs are prepared via the efficient method.
@highlight Compound
@highlight features scarce insensitivity among azide based ECPs.
@highlight Two new structural models have been first proposed for elucidating different sensitivities.
