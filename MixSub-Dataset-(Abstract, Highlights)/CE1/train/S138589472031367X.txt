 Improving catalytic efficiency is a yet still challenge in thermal catalytic oxidation . One of the key issues is to understand its catalytic oxidation mechanism . Here a series of Co

@highlight Co
@highlight nanotubes and nanoparticle were synthesized via solvothermal method without template.
@highlight Co
@highlight nanotubes exhibited high catalytic efficiency for toluene oxidation.
@highlight The role of surface lattice oxygen and gas phase oxygen were investigated and illustrated in detail.
@highlight Toluene oxidation process were investigated by combination of in situ DRIFTS PTR TOF MS quasi in situ XPS UVvis DRS.
