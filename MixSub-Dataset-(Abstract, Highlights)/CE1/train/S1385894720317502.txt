 Enrofloxacin is a highly toxic fluoroquinolone antibiotic widely used in a broad spectrum of human activities and therefore increased ENRO levels found in aquatic environments pose serious threats for human and livestock health . In this study a gasliquid nanosecond pulsed dielectric barrier discharge plasma reactor was used for the degradation of ENRO in aqueous solutions . The increase of pulse peak voltage and the pulse repetition rate up to a certain limit were found to enhance ENRO degradation efficiency degradation rate and energy yield . Under the optimum pulse voltage and pulse frequency ENRO was completely degraded after 20min with the corresponding energy yield being 1.1g kWh . Air and O

@highlight Gas liquid nsp DBD was used to degrade enrofloxacin in water.
@highlight Complete enrofloxacin degradation with high energy yield of 1.1g kWh.
@highlight The important role of
@highlight OH and
@highlight in the degradation process was confirmed.
@highlight CaO
@highlight additive promoted degradation rate by 86 
@highlight Degradation pathway of enrofloxacin was consistent with
@highlight OH and
@highlight involvement.
