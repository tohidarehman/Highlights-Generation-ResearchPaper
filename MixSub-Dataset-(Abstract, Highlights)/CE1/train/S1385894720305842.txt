 Continuous processes are always preferred over batch ones when reproducible and scalable industrial procedures are needed . This work illustrates the production of magnetite nanoparticles by oxidative precipitation in aqueous media following a continuous approach that offers additional advantages . Particularly the developed reaction setup succeeds the complete separation of the green rusts precipitation from Fe
