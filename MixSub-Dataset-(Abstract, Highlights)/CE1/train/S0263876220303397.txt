 In this study diethylene glycol as an absorbent was used for gas dehydration . For this purpose hollow fiber membrane contactor was fabricated from polyvinyl chloride . The effect of surface modification with polydimethylsiloxane in the presence of calcium carbonate nanoparticles relative humidity percentage of inlet air variation in the gas and liquid flow rates in a dehydration process were investigated . The surface modification of the membranes increased the contact angle from 64 to 101 and a liquid entry pressure of as high as 7

@highlight Gas phase velocity is the key parameter in controlling the mass transfer rate.
@highlight A very long term study of 35 days on the membranes was performed.
@highlight Liquid phase velocity has a marginal effect on the mass transfer rate.
