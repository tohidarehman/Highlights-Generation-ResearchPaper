 Although oxidation and advanced oxidation can degrade malathion from water unfortunately it is generally transformed into more toxic products such as malaoxon . In the present study a new approach has been proposed for the degradation and detoxication of malathion in aqueous solution using a combined process of chlorination followed by alkaline hydrolysis . The possible transformation pathway was proposed after identification of the main intermediate products using ultra performance liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry . The results showed that on average 90.3 of malathion was transformed into malaoxon during chlorination via a desulfurization reaction . After that in the subsequent hydrolysis reaction malaoxon was decomposed to malaoxon monoacid and diethyl 2 mercaptosuccinate via a carboxyl ester hydrolysis and a competing elimination reaction respectively . At the same time toxicity assessment of the treated solutions during the whole treatment process was performed based on the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase . It was found that during chlorination the toxicity index

@highlight Chlorination hydrolysis processes can detoxicate malathion completely in water.
@highlight Hydrolysis of malaoxon at high pH was over 4 times faster than that of malathion.
@highlight Real water matrices had almost no effects on the chlorination hydrolysis processes.
@highlight Both the oxidation and hydrolysis processes followed pseudo first order kinetics.
