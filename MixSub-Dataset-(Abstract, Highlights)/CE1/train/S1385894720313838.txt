 To effectively mitigate hazardous volatile organic compounds in air adsorption techniques for their complex mixtures rather than individual species are of great demand in light of the scarcity of relevant data . Four types of broadly studied metal organic frameworks Co Zr and UiO 66 NH

@highlight Various Metal organic frameworks were evaluated for the removal of 8 gaseous VOCs.
@highlight MOF 199 displayed the best performance towards polar VOCs.
@highlight Activated carbon was found as the superior adsorbent for less polar VOCs.
@highlight MOF 199 displayed the maximum adsorption capacity of 101mgg
@highlight for MiBK.
@highlight MOFs predominant adsorption mechanism was linked to the Lewis acidic sites.
