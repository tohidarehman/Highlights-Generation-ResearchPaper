 Developing materials with excellent adsorption performance and evaluating their feasibility for practical use are highly demanded for radioactive strontium removal from natural water . Herein a novel K Zn Sn S metal sulfide nanosheet is prepared using a hydrothermal method . The powdered KZTS NS consists of Lewis basic Zn Sn S layers and exchangeable K

@highlight A novel and environment friendly metal sulfide nanoadsorbent was prepared.
@highlight The adsorbent showed highly efficient Sr
@highlight adsorption via ion exchange with K
@highlight A new application of the powdered adsorbent was explored in actual tap water.
@highlight The CTA F MF process achieved a decontamination factor of Sr
@highlight as high as 1405.
@highlight The effect of competing ions was significantly reduced in the CTA F MF process.
