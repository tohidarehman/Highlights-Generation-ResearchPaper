 Tin and antimony with layered structure is proposed for the first time for the exceptional anode of potassium ion batteries . The Sn Sb with a layer structure significantly alleviates the structural damage and material pulverization caused by volume expansion during the reaction of potassium ions with metal atoms in the form of insertions improving the cycling stability of PIBs . Owing to the unique structure the material can achieve a high capacity of 296mAhg
