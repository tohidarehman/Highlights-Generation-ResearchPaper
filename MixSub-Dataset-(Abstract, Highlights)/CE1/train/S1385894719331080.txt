 As a cost efficient method for detecting analyses at trace level chitosan based surface enhanced Raman scattering sensor is a promising alternative . However research on this technique is frequently hindered to complicated operations dissatisfactory sensing and reproducible property . Herein a biosynthesis of Au nanoparticles was facially achieved through adding AuCl

@highlight Biosynthesis of Au NPs was facially achieved using an alkali chitosan solution.
@highlight Dissolved chitosan with anchored Au NPs were self assembled into a 3D architecture.
@highlight Well dispersed Au NPs with nanogaps led to excellent SERS
@highlight and reproducibility.
@highlight Shapable porous and pH sensitive feature promoted good molecular selectivity.
