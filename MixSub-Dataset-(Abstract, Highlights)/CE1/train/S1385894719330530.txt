 The overuse of refractory antibiotics in animal husbandry has caused serious aqueous environment pollution . Polymeric carbon nitride based photocatalysis a promising method to address antibiotic pollution issues has encountered with restricted efficiency because of the sluggish charge transfer and unexploited water matrices influence . In this study an efficient metal to ligand charge transfer was successfully implanted into the Cu coordinately polymeric carbon nitride framework via the bonds of coordinated Cu with organic N and few inorganic O atoms . The Cu CNF photocatalysts were endowed with high efficient chlortetracycline hydrochloride removal in deionized water . To insure the feasibility of the Cu CNF in antibiotics removal from different water matrices a systematical exploration covering the reaction kinetics the physicochemical stability and the influence of specific water matrices on CTC HCl removal was carried out by various ways . Results showed that the photo induced MLCT route with shorter transfer distance was able to broaden light absorption of CN in the whole visible region contributing to more available excitons and accelerating separation of the photoexcited electron hole pairs . The boosted active oxidative species h
