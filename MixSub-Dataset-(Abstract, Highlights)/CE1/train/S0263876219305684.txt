 Three dimensional time dependent simulations of dense agitated solid liquid suspensions involving particles of cylindrical shape in a Newtonian liquid have been performed . The liquid flow is resolved by the lattice Boltzmann method at length scales finer than the size of the particles which implies particle resolved simulations . The flow solution includes the hydrodynamic forces and moments on each particle that are used to integrate their linear and rotational equations of motion . No slip at the particle surfaces is imposed by an immersed boundary method . The marker points of the IBM are also used to detect and carry out collisions between particles . This numerical procedure has been applied to systems contained in a rectangular box and agitated by a revolving disk as well as by a pitched blade turbine with an impeller based Reynolds number of 87 which indicates laminar flow . The overall solids volume fraction has been fixed to 15 the number of particles is of the order of one thousand . We study the effect of impeller type and particle shape on the extent to which the solids are suspended and on the way the cylinders orient themselves .
