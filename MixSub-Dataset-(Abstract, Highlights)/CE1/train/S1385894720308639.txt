 Radiotherapy is usually accompanied by side effects to healthy tissue and radiation resistance of tumor cells in clinical application . Therefore how to enhance radiation effect and reduce radiation resistance is the key problem to enhance radiotherapy efficacy . In recent years the development of nanomaterials with radiation catalysis function has provided us with opportunities . Here we report a radiocatalytic platform using inorganic semiconductor nanoheterojunctions WO

@highlight WO
@highlight @Ag
