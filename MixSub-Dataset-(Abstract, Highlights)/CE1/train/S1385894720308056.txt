 In this study the oxidation kinetics mechanisms effects and products of metalaxyl by two different S based processes S and Cr S were systematically investigated and compared . The results showed that the concentration of S was primarily responsible for driving Mn and Cr consumption with a measured second order rate constant

@highlight of the Mn VII S IV process was 45 orders of magnitude higher than the Cr VI S IV process.
@highlight The reaction stoichiometry of Cr VI 
@highlight  S IV 
@highlight was determined to be 1 301 40.
@highlight SO
@highlight was major active oxidant in Mn VII S IV and Cr VI S IV systems.
@highlight Mn VII S IV process exhibits a stronger adaptation to the water matrices.
