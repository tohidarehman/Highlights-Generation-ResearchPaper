 Hydrophobic zeolites have been considered as one of the most promising adsorbents for capturing volatile organic compounds . In this contribution hierarchically structured ZSM 5 SBA 15 composites with different morphologies including platelet hexagonal prism long hexagonal prism and long rod were prepared . All materials were characterized using XRD SEM and TEM EDX which confirmed that the high dispersion of two zeolites within the composites . Due to the presence of intracrystalline mesopores that could shorten the diffusion pathway of toluene the composites resulted in increased effective diffusion and higher adsorption capacity . The composites also possess higher hydrophobicity leading to much better toluene adsorption performance under humid conditions . The water contact angle of ZSM 5 could be increased from 15.6 to 44.9 by forming well dispersed zeolite composites . The
