 To improve the relatively low transport efficiency of ionic liquid based polymer inclusion membrane an integration of electrodialysis with PIM is explored for the facilitated transport of Cr . Several parameters such as current density carrier concentration initial composition and properties of feed and stripping solutions have been systematically studied . Current intensity was crucial to the facilitating transport of Cr while a threshold of current density was observed at around 7 mA cm

@highlight Low diffusion efficiency of PIMs was significantly improved by integrating ED.
@highlight Both thresholds of carrier content and current intensity were observed.
@highlight Fixed site jumping mechanism in PIM is confirmed by the electro transport.
@highlight High current intensity induced a continuous pathway transport of Cr VI .
@highlight Multi membrane stacks PIM ED system is feasible for industrial application.
