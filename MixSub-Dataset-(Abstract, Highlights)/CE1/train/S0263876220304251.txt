 Droplet microfluidics allows a higher degree of control over the crystallization conditions than conventional methodologies . To extend this approach this work explores the synergistic effect of low frequency pulsed ultrasound on lysozyme crystallization in microdroplets . Pulsed actuation allows control of the crystallization temperature while the ultrasound effect significantly reduces the induction time and crystal size . Therefore protein nucleation is enhanced by pulsed sonication without causing precipitation resulting in uniform crystal size . Finally the initial supersaturation ratio has a crucial contribution to the crystal size for silent experiments while a threshold for induction time is observed in ultrasonic crystallization .
