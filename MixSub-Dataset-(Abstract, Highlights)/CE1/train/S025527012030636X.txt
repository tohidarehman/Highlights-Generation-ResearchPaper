 The bio production of lactic acid has gained great attention thanks to its versatility as building block with potential environmental and energy benefits . During its bio production one of its bottlenecks is the downstream processing where process intensification plays a significant role to increase process profitability . This work presents a techno economic assessment for LA bio production process from the residues of the sugar industry in the Latin American context using different separation and purification technologies namely reactive distillation liquid liquid reactive extraction and electrodialysis . A specific methodology to design each separation systems is presented which employs Aspen Plus Matlab and their combination . The simulation results indicate the potential of the emerging technologies compared to reactive distillation . Taking reactive distillation as baseline reactive extraction showed a reduction 44 in total annual cost and operational expenditures while electrodialysis reduced 55 in TAC and 62 in OPEX . As consequence the return of the investment is substantially faster for the new technologies . Despite the different TRL among technologies this result shows the tremendous potential for further developing the intensified reactive extraction and a potential integrated electrodialysis membrane bioreactor to make the LA bioprocess more profitable thus promoting its use beyond commodities .
