 Fullerene derivatives are promising electron transporting materials for low temperature processed inverted perovskite solar cells . However fullerene derivatives have some disadvantages e.g . phenyl C

@highlight HPDT is developed as an interface material in perovskite solar cells.
@highlight HPDT shows suitable energy levels and high electron mobility.
@highlight HPDT can achieve a homogeneous pinhole free PCBM layer.
@highlight The PSC performance is improved with negligible hysteresis and enhanced stability.
