 A short cut design method based on Residue Curve Maps is applied to the conceptual design of Distillation Pervaporation in a Single Unit columns . Unlike to a conventional hybrid distillation pervaporation column in a DPSU system the pervaporation module is located inside the column . The distillation and pervaporation mechanisms are fully coupled allowing overcoming azeotropic conditions of non ideal mixtures inside the distillation column . The simplified design method is applied to four non ideal mixtures with different Serafimovs topological classification acetone isopropanol water ethyl acetate ethanol methanol acetone methyl acetate methanol and acetone methanol chloroform . The results show that it is possible to achieve a feasible separation through a DPSU column with product compositions split by distillation boundaries . Besides the regions of a feasible separation with a DPSU column are identified . Thermodynamic limitations for a DPSU column are observed when the azeotropes generate isovolatility lines producing different separation paths for a specified membrane selectivity . DPSU columns promise to strongly reduce the number of units and associated energy consumption in distillation trains for separating complex mixtures .
