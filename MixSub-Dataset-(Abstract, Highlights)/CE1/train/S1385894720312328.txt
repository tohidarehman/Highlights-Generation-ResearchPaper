 Prevention of infection and promotion of osteoconduction are the key factors to achieve long term success in orthopaedic implants . In this work an effective antimicrobial and osteoconductive coating is facilely prepared by the cross linking of poly L lysine and catechol via a one step mussel inspired chemistry . A series of EPLC paints were prepared by catechol and varying concentrations of EPL and named as EPLC1 EPLC2 and EPLC3 . The coatings were easy to paint on implants . EPLC3 with the highest EPL concentration exhibited the most potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram negative bacteria

@highlight Dual functional coating was prepared via a one step mussel inspired chemistry.
@highlight This non leachable coating effectively killed drug resistant bacteria on contact.
@highlight Pre osteoblast proliferation and hydroxyapatite formation on it were promoted.
