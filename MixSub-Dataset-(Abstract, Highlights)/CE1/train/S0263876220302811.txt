 This paper focuses on the study of the production method evaluation of quality indicators and application of adsorbents based on wood and common polymer wastes . The co pyrolysis technique of polyethylene polypropylene polyethylene terephthalate and other polymers with sawdust at the weight ratio of 1 1 and 1 2 and temperature 370500 C is used for the production of adsorbents . Influence of polymer and wood type on the product quality is discussed . For the composition of birch wood and polypropylene linear models for the yield estimation and indicators of the porous structure of adsorbents based on the experiment planning method are proposed which allow us to forecast their quality under the joint influence of their production factors . The adsorbent at 500 C was also characterized by optical and electron microscopy X ray fluorimetry infrared spectrometry and low temperature nitrogen adsorption method its surface area is 435 m

@highlight Cheap carbon adsorbent is obtained from birch wood and waste polypropylene.
@highlight It has elevated yield and developed pores due to co pyrolysis of the raw at 370 C.
@highlight The adsorbent takes benzene vapor 1.6 times more than industrial analogue.
@highlight The pilot production of waste based adsorbent is profitable and eco effective.
