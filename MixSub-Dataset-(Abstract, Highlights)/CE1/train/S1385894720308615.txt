 The balance between the electrical performance and quenching suppression is crucial to develop the efficient host materials for full thermally activated delayed fluorescence white organic light emitting diodes . In this work through introducing one bulky diphenylphosphine oxide group at 4 position of each xanthene ring in a symmetrical and orthogonal spirobi skeleton 9 9 spirobi 4 4 diylbis

@highlight A spiro host with local asymmetry for blue and white TADF OLED.
@highlight Intermolecular interactions are optimized for optoelectronic improvement.
@highlight The full TADF white OLED achieved the state of the art performance.
