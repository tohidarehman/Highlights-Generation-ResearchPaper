 In the work a novel molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensor was proposed for sensitive and rapid detection of nitrofurazone . The sensor was modified with Cr

@highlight Biomass carbon Ag NPs and Cr MIL 101 derived Cr
@highlight were used to enhance conductivity.
@highlight MOF derived metal oxides retain the MOF morphology.
@highlight Bifunctional monomers were used to enhance the specificity of MIP for NFZ.
@highlight Wide linear range of 510
@highlight 110
@highlight M were obtained along with low detection limit of 310
@highlight M.
