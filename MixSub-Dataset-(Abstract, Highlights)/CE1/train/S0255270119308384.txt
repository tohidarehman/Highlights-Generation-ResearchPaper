 In this investigation a novel technique for intensification of pool boiling heat transfer coefficient has been proposed . This method is applicable to electrolyte aqueous solutions at the isolated bubble regime . This approach is based on stimulating heating surface by DC electricity . In this condition boiling and electrolysis phenomena performs simultaneously . Decomposed hydrogen and oxygen blends to vaporized water during boiling and provides extra bubble volume moreover active nucleation sites increase on the heating surface . Consequently bubble dynamics including frequency diameter and active nucleation site density are significantly affected . In this investigation two opposing consequence from modified bubble dynamics have been observed enhanced heat transfer up to 40 as a result of increased active nucleation site density bubble diameter and frequency at some low voltages of electrolysis and reduced heat transfer down to 70 because of an interconnected clusters of hydrogen water vapor mixture which are attached on the heating surface at some high voltages of electrolysis . The experimental data were analyzed by artificial neural network and sensitivity analysis have been performed . The impact of bulk and wall temperatures also electrolysis and heat power flux on heat transfer rate have been determined by sensitivity analysis . Results present that maximum enhancement of heat transfer coefficient is observed at about 1kWm
