 Pyrochlore materials show intensive potential for various everyday applications owing to their highly stable structure with tunable lattice parameters . Energy storage tunability and switching capabilities of these materials can further be improved using suitable cationic substitutions . In this context we report a series of Nd substituted lanthanum stannate La
