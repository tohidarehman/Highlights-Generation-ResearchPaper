 Two dimensional Ruddlesden Popper perovskite films have attracted considerable attention for the environmentally stable perovskite solar cells . However there is a big space for improving the film crystallinity and its crystallographic orientation to enhance the efficiency of solar cells . In addition the assistance of anti solvent is commonly used to obtain a better crystallinity and orientation of 2D RP perovskite films . Nevertheless the anti solvent method produces a lot of volatile organic compounds toxic to human health and is challenging to control . Here we prepared 2D RP perovskite

@highlight High crystallinity and vertically oriented 2D perovskite films were achieved.
@highlight The anti solvent treatment was avoided by MACl additive.
@highlight An intermediate phase composed of perovskite phase was induced by MACl.
@highlight MACl additive effectively improves the power conversion efficiency.
