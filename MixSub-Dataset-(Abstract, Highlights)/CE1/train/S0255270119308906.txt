 Micro structured reactors operated in Taylor flow are promising for intensifying heterogeneously catalyzed gas liquid reactions . By reaction progress or dilution physical properties may change with liquid composition . Here the effect of composition on physical mass transfer in the liquid film of Taylor flow is studied with regard to the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline . For the liquid mixtures nitrobenzene aniline and nitrobenzene ethanol composition dependent physical properties are determined using information from literature . By numerical solution of the unsteady one dimensional diffusion equation with composition dependent physical properties the instantaneous hydrogen concentration across the liquid film is obtained for different nitrobenzene mole fractions . The results indicate that in a wide composition range of reactant and product hydrogen diffuses slower in the mixture than in pure liquids . On the other hand dilution of nitrobenzene by ethanol increases hydrogen mass transfer in the liquid film . A theoretical relation is provided which allows estimating for given capillary number the necessary bubble length to achieve a certain hydrogen saturation in the liquid film during the passage of one Taylor bubble . This non dimensional relation can be applied to other physical systems and may be useful to guide optimal hydrodynamic operation conditions for applications with Taylor flow in chemical engineering .
