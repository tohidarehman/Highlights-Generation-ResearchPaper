 Understanding the dynamic transformation process of the oxygen evolution reaction catalysts is of importance for their rational design . Here we first report that Fe leaching could induce the electrochemical activation of strongly coupled Ni Fe alloy on N doped carbon composites to boost the OER performance . It is demonstrated that the leaching of unstable FeOOH mixed layer from the surface of FeNi

@highlight Fe leaching induces surface reconstruction of Ni Fe alloy NC during OER.
@highlight Fe leaching during OER benefits the exposure of more active sites.
@highlight The high valent Ni pyridinic N and metal N species are the exact active centers.
@highlight The fully activated catalyst exhibits excellent OER activity.
