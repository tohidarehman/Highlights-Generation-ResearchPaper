 Perfluorooctanoic acid is a persistent and bioaccumulative refractory organic pollutant which has aroused great concern on its environmental fate . Herein inspired by biomimetic materials a preeminent heterogeneous catalyst iron porphyrin loaded biochar BC was constructed to activate persulfate for PFOA degradation . Moreover the existence of persistent free radicals on biochar could transfer electrons to iron porphyrin and PS to directly or indirectly speed up the generation of SO

@highlight Inspired by biomimetic materials a heterogeneous catalyst was constructed based on iron porphyrin loaded biochar.
@highlight The system degraded PFOA rapidly and effectively and the degradation pathways and reaction mechanism were proposed.
@highlight The system could maintain the efficient degradation under original strong acidic conditions without pH adjustment.
