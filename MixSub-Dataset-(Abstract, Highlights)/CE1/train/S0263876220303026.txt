 This research aimed at synthesizing polyethersulfone zirconium phosphate flat sheet nanocomposite ultrafiltration membranes . The impact of ZrP nanoparticle addition on the morphology functionalities hydrophilicity and surface charge of the membrane among others were investigated . Different concentrations of ZrP NPs were tested . Membranes surface morphology was investigated by Fourier transform infrared energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy . Microscopic analyses affirmed that the ZrP NPs were successfully incorporated into the PES membranes . Also the composite membranes were hydrophilic reporting increased mechanical strength porosity and thermal stability than the pristine PES membrane . An overall removal efficiency of 70.2 1.0 99.7 0.2 81.7 1.1 74.4 1.5 and 91.5 2.0 for Cd
