 Coal fly ash rich in rare metals accounts for a large amount of solid waste released from coal fired power plants . However rare metals the components of coal fly ash with the highest economic value are not fully recycled due to the lack of an effective low cost approach . Therefore it is urgent to develop a new approach aiming at increasing the recycling efficient decreasing the cost and strengthening the high economic value of fly ash . Here we developed an integrated approach combines hydrothermal chemical treatment process and biological leaching process to improve recycle of rare metals from coal fly ash . The results showed that the one step bioleaching method could obtain more kinds of rare metals and dramatically improve bioleaching rate after hydrothermal alkali treatment using

@highlight An integrated approach for enhancing recycle of rare metals from fly ash.
@highlight A stepwise optimized biological process was developed for recoverying rare metals.
@highlight Hydrothermal alkaline treatment has higher efficiency for leaching rare metals.
