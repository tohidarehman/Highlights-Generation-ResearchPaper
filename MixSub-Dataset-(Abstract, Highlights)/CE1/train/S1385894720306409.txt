 This study was to co encapsulate a chemokine and a chondroinductive molecule within microspheres via microfluidics and to incorporate them into a hyaluronic acid injectable scaffold for articular cartilage defect repair . HA injectable scaffold as a cartilage friendly microenvironment was prepared by crosslinking HA with 1 4 butanediol diglycidyl ether . A microfluidic device was set up to prepare monodisperse PLGA microspheres to load SDF 1 and KGN . An in vivo model of full thickness articular cartilage defects in rabbits was applied to evaluate the reparative capacity of the current package . The SDF 1 and KGN were co encapsulated simultaneously within the core and shell area of the microsphere with high loading efficiency and sustained release profiles of more than 2months . The release profiles of them were highly matched and well fitted to a first order mathematical model . These microspheres when incorporated into HA injectable scaffold were demonstrated to heal the full thickness articular cartilage defects in rabbits . The regenerated tissue had the typical cartilage histological characters and integrated well with the surrounding tissue at 12w . This developed cell free system could serve as an efficient therapy for articular cartilage defects treatment serving as a supplementary way to cell based therapies .
