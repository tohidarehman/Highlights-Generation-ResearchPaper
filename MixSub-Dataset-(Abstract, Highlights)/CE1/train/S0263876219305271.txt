 We characterised different flow regimes and their transition through an objective and quantitative assessment of flow behaviour by applying four signal process techniques Shannon entropy and permutation entropy onto pressure signals of counter current two phase flows in a 170

@highlight Provided a non subjective and quantitative analysis for flow regime identification.
@highlight Applied four signal analysis techniques on pressure signals to characterise flow.
@highlight Provided insights into dynamic behaviour of counter current flows in annuli.
