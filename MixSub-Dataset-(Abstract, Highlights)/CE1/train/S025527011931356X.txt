 This work presents a new approach to improve mass transfer in and around catalyst particles in three phase operation with micro structured catalysts containing hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains . Partially hydrophilic catalysts were prepared via physical mixing of hydrophobic perfluorinated octyltrichloro silane Al

@highlight Well controlled and structured manipulation of catalyst wettability both internal and external.
@highlight Introduction of hydrophobic domains enhances H
@highlight transport increases activity as well as selectivity to ammonium.
@highlight Introduction of hydrophobic domains allows operation at lower H
@highlight pressure to achieve same rate and less NH
