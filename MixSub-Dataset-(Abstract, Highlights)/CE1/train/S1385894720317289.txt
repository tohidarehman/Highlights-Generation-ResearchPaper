 Catalytic membranes have gained increasing interest in water treatment due to their improved performance on contaminants removal fouling mitigation and cleaning efficiency . The reactive species generated in the catalytic membrane system play a critical role in the process . However the performance of SO

@highlight Catalytic ceramic membrane was prepared through filtration of catalyst suspension.
@highlight SO
@highlight was confirmed as predominant in the PMS catalytic membrane system.
@highlight Increased NOM removal and decreased flux decline were observed with catalytic membrane.
@highlight Enhanced PMS cleaning efficiency was obtained with fouled catalytic membrane.
