 Bridging heteroatoms on the surface of electrocatalysts aiming to modify the surface atomic and electronic configuration is of prime importance to improve the electrocatalytic performance . The present work establishes Co P bridging on the surface of Co

@highlight P Co
@highlight with optimized OER performance were developed through Co P bridging.
@highlight The electron transfer was manipulated by controlling the molar ratio of P Co.
@highlight Co P bridging can facilitate the formation of abundant Co
@highlight and oxygen vacancies.
@highlight Co P bridging can induce stronger electronic interactions in the catalysts.
@highlight Co P bridging can improve the electrical conductivity of P Co
