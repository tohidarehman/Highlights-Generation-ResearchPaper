 As a kind of promising plasmonic materials Au nanoparticles especially Au insulator core shell nanostructures offer great potential in the fields of catalysis diagnosis and energy conversion however it is still a challenge to fabricate protective layer Au nanoparticles with desired performance using a facile strategy . In this work we report a new synergistic method that combines in situ ligand free plasmonic treatment with TiCl

@highlight A facile
@highlight plasmonic treatment was proposed with quantum size Au nanoparticles direct growth on photoanode.
@highlight A champion PCE of plasmonic photoanode up to 12.7 has been achieved.
@highlight Enhanced light harvesting and charge collection have been obtained with plasmonic treatment.
