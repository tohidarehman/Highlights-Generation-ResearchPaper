 The development of cell instructive scaffolds which provide biochemical cues to direct endogenous bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells behavior has the potential to revolutionize osteochondral tissue engineering . However scaffold material itself is generally lacking the inductive signals . Here a novel peptide functionalized scaffold was prepared by prime coating Ca alginate scaffold with tannic acid followed by conjugation of E7 P15 peptides . The system leveraged TA as a reactive intermediate between Ca alginate and peptides due to the multiple functional groups of TA . These interactions induced by TA prime coating contributed to enhanced scaffold stability and mechanical properties increased peptide conjugation and sustained release of peptides without affecting their bioactivity in a TA concentration dependent manner . The conjugation of E7 P15 peptides endowed the scaffold with the potential to enhance BMSCs recruitment and deposition of cartilage and bone extracellular matrix . Furthermore the prepared CA TA E7 P15 scaffold showed a promoted biological performance of simultaneous cartilage and subchondral bone regeneration in rabbit osteochondral defect model . These findings indicate that TA is an effective surface modification intermediate and crosslinking aid and that the CA TA E7 P15 scaffold developed in this study serves as a promising cell instructive scaffold for osteochondral regeneration .
