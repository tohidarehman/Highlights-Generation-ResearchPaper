 Harvesting clean water from seawater is widely studied in thermal driven vacuum membrane distillation application . Although the conventional VMD promotes excellent flux due to the deaeration by means of vacuum the external heat supply of the system suffers the heat loss during pumping high feed volume . The batch submerged VMD which has internal heat supply was introduced in this work to provide uniform feed temperature in the feed tank . This simple and space saving design makes it particularly suitable to supply water for small community with space limitation . To evaluate the energy efficiency of the S VMD in desalinating seawater the performance of the system had been simulated and verified with the experimental results . The effects of main operating parameters including feed temperature and its circulation rate heat transfer coefficient vacuum degree on permeate side packing density of membrane and temperature polarization on the membrane permeation flux using saline water feed had been experimentally investigated . Energy efficiency in terms of gained output ratio
