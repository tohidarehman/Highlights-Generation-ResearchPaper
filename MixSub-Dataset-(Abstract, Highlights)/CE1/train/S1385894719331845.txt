 This paper describes a novel approach for enhancing membrane technology for the removal of heavy metal cations in contaminated waters . A simple method of forming a positively charged polyamide nanofiltration membrane has been developed by attaching a layer of hyperbranched polyethylenimine to the PA surface involving the linking of PEI amino groups to the PA surface carboxyl groups . The nature of the PEI modified PA membrane in terms of surface morphology zeta potential and hydrophobicity was found to depend on the PEI molecular weight and the PEI concentration and membrane exposure time during preparation . In turn the nature of the modified membrane determined its performance in terms of hydraulic flux and metal ion rejection . In tests using a model solution of 5mg L Cu

@highlight The surface charge of a PA membrane was modified by PEI coating from negative to positive.
@highlight The Cu
@highlight rejection was increased dramatically from 38.9 to 92.5 
@highlight The membrane performance depended on the PEI molecular weight and preparation method.
@highlight The presence of humic acid did not have an adverse effect on Cu
@highlight rejection.
