 The aim of this study was to determine the role of plants on pollutant removal and bioelectricity production in the treatment of municipal wastewater with

@highlight Plant uptake of pollutants was similar in CW MFCs under open and close circuit.
@highlight Live plants enhanced the power output by 6897 compared with unplanted CW MFC.
@highlight improved removal of COD N and power density by 43 66 and 97 in the CW MFC.
@highlight Dead
@highlight harms the CW MFC by releasing pollutants and lowering power production.
@highlight improved COD removal and power density by 28.38 and 68.02 .
