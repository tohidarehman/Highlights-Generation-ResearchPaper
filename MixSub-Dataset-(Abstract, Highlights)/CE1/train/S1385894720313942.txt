 Nanocarbon materials have been well developed due to their excellent properties whereas the hydrophobicity and surface inertness always limit their further application . In this study a novel smart nanodrug loading system based on porous carbon nanofibers were proposed which obtained excellent properties in dispersibility suitable near infrared absorbance photothermal conversion ability and dual responsive drug delivery . The pores benefited PCNFs to achieve high drug absorption and shortened release rate to prolong the delivery period . In vitro and

@highlight Porous carbon nanofibers PCNFs were prepared via electrospun by PAN and PMMA.
@highlight Acid and layer by layer processes were used to solve the dispersibility of PCNFs.
@highlight PCNFs obtained good biocompatibility hemocompatibility and photothermal ability.
@highlight PCNFs showed higher drug loading ability and pH photothermal dual responsiveness.
@highlight Better tumor inhibition was achieved by synergistic chemo photothermal therapy.
