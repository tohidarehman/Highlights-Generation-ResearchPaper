 The adsorption of the methylene blue on the biomass obtained from brazilian berries seeds was studied . Experimental adsorption data and results of the physicochemical characterization of the adsorbent besides theoretical physics based calculations were utilized to understand the dye adsorption mechanism . A monolayer adsorption model was proposed to simulate the dye adsorption assuming an interaction adsorbent adsorbate via two different functional groups on biomass surface . This statistical physics model calculated the number of bonded MB dye molecules and the saturated adsorption capacity for both functional groups at different temperatures . For instance the values of n
