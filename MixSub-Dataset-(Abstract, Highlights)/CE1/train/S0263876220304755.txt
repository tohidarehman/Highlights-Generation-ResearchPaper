 Agricultural wastes as low cost adsorbents with metal binding capacities have gained greater scientific attentions still their selectivity is badly affected by poor surface activity . Therefore in this study bagasse pith grafted copolymer adsorbent was prepared by aqueous solution polymerization using bagasse pith waste as raw material and acrylamide as grafting monomer . Textural characterization of the synthesized adsorbent was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy and X ray diffraction techniques . The effect of adsorbent dosage solution pH and initial concentration of Cu on the adsorption performance of BPGC were studied . BPGC realized higher Cu adsorption performance 105.3mgg
