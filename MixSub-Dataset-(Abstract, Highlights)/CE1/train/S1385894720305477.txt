 The development of economical and versatile catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction is an exceedingly challenge for hydrogen production from water electrolysis . Herein three dimensional phosphorus anion decorated cobalt disulfide hollow nanosheet arrays are uniformly deposited on carbon cloth P CoS

@highlight Integrated Co S P hollow nanoarrays is fabricated by a facile 2D Co MOFs based growth sulfidation phosphorization approach.
@highlight The Co S P hollow nanoarrays exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity toward OER HER and overall water splitting.
@highlight DFT calculations reveal that P anions doping into CoS
@highlight leads to moderated adsorption energetics of OER and HER intermediates.
