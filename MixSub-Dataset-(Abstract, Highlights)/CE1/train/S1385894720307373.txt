 Microwave heating has been applied to increase the selectivity to propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane . The preferential heating of the solid monolith allows working with a lower gas phase temperature reducing the formation of undesired by products in the gas phase via homogeneous reactions . Conversion levels of 21 and selectivity to propylene up to 70 have been achieved with MW heated straight channel monolithic reactors coated with a VMgO catalyst . These competitive values contrast with the more limited performance delivered by the same catalytic system when it is subjected to conventional heating in a fixed bed reactor configuration thereby corroborating the advantage of working under a significant gassolid temperature gap to minimize the extent of homogeneous reactions .

@highlight Microwave heating promotes higher selectivity to propylene in comparison with conventional heating conditions.
