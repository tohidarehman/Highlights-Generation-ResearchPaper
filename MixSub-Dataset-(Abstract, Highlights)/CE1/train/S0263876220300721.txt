 It is a significant subject that low quality coals could be used for high concentration slurry preparation because of the large reserve and low price . Nevertheless due to the microstructure and surface properties of low quality coals it is difficult to prepare qualified coal water slurry directly . In this study an improved flotation technique was employed to upgrade two low quality coals then Jinda raw coal and its upgraded coal together with Jisuo raw coal and its upgraded coal were applied to CWS preparation and combustion dynamics analysis . Results showed that after two samples of low quality coals were upgraded the maximum slurry concentration could be increased by 6 . It was attributed to the variation of free water content which was mainly influenced by composition and pore structure of coal particles . Because of the remarkable decrement on specific surface area and porosity after flotation the ignition temperature and apparent activation energy of CWS prepared by JD UC were increased comparing to JD RC . However the ignition temperature and apparent activation energy of CWS prepared by JS UC were lower than JS RC which was resulted from the higher combustible content in JS UC . The results of this study provided a method for the preparation of high concentration CWS using low quality coals with ultra high ash content .

@highlight Low quality coal could prepare high concentration CWS after upgrading.
@highlight Solid content increases by 6 after the coals upgraded via a novel flotation.
@highlight Change in the form of water distribution determines the apparent viscosity of CWS.
@highlight Combustion characteristics of upgraded coals are different comparing to raw coals.
