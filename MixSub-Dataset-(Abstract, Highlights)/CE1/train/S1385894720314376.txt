 Materials with highly absorptive property have been used to control bleeding by creating a physical barrier at the wound . Additionally studies have suggested that macroporosity cationic chemical groups and microparticle morphology are advantageous attributes for hemostatic materials . Yet no study to date has capitalized on these properties synergistically and integrates them into the development of multifunctional materials for enhanced performance in hemorrhage hemostasis . Here we present the preparation of such a new hemostatic sponge material using a facile and green method . The process simply involves epoxy amine click reaction in water coupled with the phenomenon of temperature induced phase separation of polymer solution . It enables the convergence of multiple key features with hemostasis significance into the material . Specifically phase separation results in the epoxy amine sponge being hierarchically structured with macroporosity for high water uptake while its microparticle structural units amenable for encapsulation of hydrophobic guests . Additionally the EA sponge is inherently rich in amine groups and thus can potentially exhibit a positive charge based procoagulant effect . The material is pliable and demonstrates excellent hemocompatibility and cytocompatibility . It also shows improved hemostatic performance over commercial products of gauze and gelatin sponge supported by findings of
