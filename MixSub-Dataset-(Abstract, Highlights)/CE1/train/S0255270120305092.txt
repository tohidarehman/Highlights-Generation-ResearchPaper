 This study demonstrates the entrainer effect of a co reactant alcohol on the feasibility of complete conversion and product recovery in reactive distillation for concurrently producing

@highlight Hexanol acts as an entrainer in reactive distillation of C4 C6 co esterification.
@highlight The entrainer leads to higher purities and reaction extents in the direct sequence.
@highlight No entrainer effect exists in the indirect sequence of C4 C6 co esterification.
@highlight The entrainer yields the most energy efficient upper reactive dividing wall column.
