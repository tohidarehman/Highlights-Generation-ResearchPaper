 Lithium ion capacitors lately evolved energy storage devices which integrate the merits of both lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors for high energy and power densities have attracted substantial research attention in recent years . Here a Prussian blue analogue nanocube templating process was developed to produce N doped carbon nanoboxes as high performance anode materials for lithium ion based energy storage . The N CNB exhibited high specific capacities and excellent rate capability and cycling performances as an anode . If paired with glucose derived carbon nanospheres cathodes the N CNB GCNS LIC delivered a high energy density of 77.5 Wh kg
