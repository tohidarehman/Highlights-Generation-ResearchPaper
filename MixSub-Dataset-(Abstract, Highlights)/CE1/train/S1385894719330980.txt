 Fabrication of high performance cost effective and environmentally friendly carbocatalysts for environmental remediation is still a challenge . In this study a series of iron and nitrogen co doped porous carbon catalysts were prepared through pyrolysis of Fe doped zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 . The catalytic performance of the Fe N C was evaluated for the degradation of bisphenol F via peroxymonosulfate activation . Fe N C at appropriate Fe doping possessed hierarchically porous architecture with abundant micro and meso pores rich defects enhanced N doping and conductivity . Compared with N C Fe N C retained original polyhedral morphology and the particle size could be tuned by controlling Fe doping amount . An optimized catalyst 1.0 Fe N C was obtained which exhibited superior catalytic activity for the degradation of bisphenol F. The rate constant was 34.0 and 6.1 times of that for N C and benchmark catalyst Co
