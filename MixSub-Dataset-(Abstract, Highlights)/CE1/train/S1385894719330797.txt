 Nanostructure construction and composition tuning are two effective methods to accelerate electrochemical reaction kinetics and increase electroactive sites of nickel cobalt selenides nanoarrays . Herein we have successfully designed and fabricated the P Se

@highlight The unique nanoarchitecture with PBA derived nanocubes anchored on nanowires and nanoflakes are rationally constructed.
@highlight The proper P incorporation in Ni Co Se
@highlight could greatly increase the electrochemical properties.
@highlight The operating potential of hybrid supercapacitor could be extended to 1.8V.
@highlight The P Ni Co Se
@highlight  ZC device shows a high energy density of 45.0Wh kg
@highlight at the power density of 446.3Wkg
