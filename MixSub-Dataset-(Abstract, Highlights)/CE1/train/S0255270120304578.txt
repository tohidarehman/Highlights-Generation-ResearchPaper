 In the present study micro hydrogen jet flames confined in cylindrical tubes without air co flow were numerically investigated under zero gravity . The effects of tube diameter D

@highlight Under a same velocity the combustion efficiency is higher in the larger tube D
@highlight  .
@highlight For D
@highlight  10 and 20 mm combustion efficiency varies non monotonically with velocity.
@highlight For D
@highlight  5 and 10 mm combustion efficiency is less than 50 due to flame tip opening.
@highlight For D
@highlight  20 mm complete combustion is achieved at medium velocity due to closed flame tip.
@highlight The air entrainment ratio increases with the increase of tube diameter.
