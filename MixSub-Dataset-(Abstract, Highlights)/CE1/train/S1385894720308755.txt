 In this study three fluoro containing ferrocene compounds with different fluorine and Fc contents were prepared and then be coated on the surface of nanoaluminum to increase the combustion performance of nAl and the anti migration performance of Fc . By removing the aluminium oxide Al

@highlight Three types of Fc Fx were prepared and then be coated on the surface of nAl by Al F bond.
@highlight Ignition delay time was shortened from 1.83s to 1.03s with
@highlight nanocomposite.
@highlight lowered the high temperature decomposition peak from 404C to 328C.
@highlight The reduced migration distance of
@highlight enhanced the combustion performance of propellant.
