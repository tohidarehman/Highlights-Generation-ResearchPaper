 Photoelectrochemical water splitting can convert solar power into clean energy carrier of hydrogen which is a promising strategy to address the global energy crisis and environmental issues . At present the sluggish kinetics of the separation and migration of the photo excited electrons and holes for water oxidation is the bottleneck for the high solar to hydrogen efficiency in this field . Herein we exploit cobalt polyoxometalate as a novel molecular cocatalyst locating at N doped carbon to boost the charge separation and injection of BiVO

@highlight Ternary BiVO
@highlight  N C CoPOM photoanode is constructed.
@highlight High photocurrent density of 3.30mAcm
@highlight and low onset potential are achieved.
@highlight Much higher applied bias photon to current efficiency and fill factor are achieved after depositing CoPOM.
@highlight Charge injection efficiency is greatly improved after depositing CoPOM.
