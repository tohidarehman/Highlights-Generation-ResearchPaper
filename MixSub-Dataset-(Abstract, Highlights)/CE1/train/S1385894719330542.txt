 A promising strategy to treat wastewater containing heavy metal complexes is to employ oxidation processes before carrying out the conventional processes . Metal ion catalyzed oxidation processes have been confirmed to be suitable for the remediation of wastewater . However the treatment of HMCs by MICOPs has seldom attracted researchers attention and the key mechanisms remain unclear . In this study Cu

@highlight Efficiency of various oxidation processes in Cu
