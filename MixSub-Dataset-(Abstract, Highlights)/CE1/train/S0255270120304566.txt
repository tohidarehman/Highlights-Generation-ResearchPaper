 This article proposes two energy saving extractive distillation configurations with single or double dividing wall column based on a conventional four column extractive distillation process CFC ED to efficiently separate a quaternary compound of acetone methanol butanone tert butyl alcohol with chlorobenzene as a solvent . One is composed of two single dividing wall extractive distillation columnsSDWCs ED the other consists of an extractive distillation column and double dividing wall extractive distillation columnDDWC ED . The parametric optimization is carried out with the minimum total annual cost as a goal and adopts a sequential iterative procedure . The comparison with the CFC ED process shows that the SDWCs ED process can reduce the TAC by 12.50 and CO

@highlight Separation of quaternary azeotropic mixtures in PO TBA coproduction is studied.
@highlight Extractive distillation configurations with chlorobenzene as solvent are proposed.
