 2 3 Dimethylmaleic anhydride decorated zinc oxide nanoparticles with doxorubicin and phenylsulfonyl furoxan loaded were designed and prepared through a step by step strategy . Amino terminated ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized in which DOX was encapsulated by forming coordination bonding between DOX and Zn

@highlight ZnO based nanospheres capable of releasing multiple therapeutic agents were developed.
@highlight The charge reversal nanospheres had long blood circulation and enhanced cellular uptake.
@highlight The nanospheres released therapeutic agents in response to intracellular stimuli.
@highlight Synergistic cancer therapy with improved efficacy could be achieved using the nanospheres.
