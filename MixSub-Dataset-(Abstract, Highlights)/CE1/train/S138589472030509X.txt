 Fabricating Z scheme photocatalytic system is of great significance for water splitting and degradation of organic pollutants . However it is highly challenging to select suitable materials to form Z scheme photocatalysis systems due to the harsh requirement for band edge levels alignment and interfacial contact . In this work a novel all solid state Pt bridge SnO

@highlight All solid state Z scheme visible light driven SnO
