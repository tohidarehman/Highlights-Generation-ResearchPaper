 The thermal coupling of endothermic and exothermic reactions is an important pathway for integrated thermal management within chemical reactors which supports process intensification . Microchannel reactors are unique in the sense that they provide various design and operational characteristics that benefit high throughput and millisecond contact time chemical conversions . These include high microchannel aspect ratios improved heat transfer and enhanced mass transfer . In this review of experimental and simulated microchannel reactors focus is put on improved designs and operating strategies to support thermal conduction across microchannel walls yet keep chemical products from the respective reactions separate using spatially segregated reaction chambers . Three common flow configurations are critically discussed as a result of their abilities to distribute and in some cases recirculate reaction heat the steady state temperature profiles established within them as a result of flow direction and reactant conversions product yields as a result of their thermal characteristics . Special attention is devoted to microchannel design aspects including wall thermal conductivity channel dimensions catalyst positioning and other design strategies to improve heat and mass flows within microchannel reactors .
