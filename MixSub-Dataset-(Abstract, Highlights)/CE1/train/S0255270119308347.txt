 This paper proposes an innovative vortex generator named as streamlined winglet pair VG . It is used in a helical channel with rectangular cross section to enhance heat transfer performance . The effects of the arrangement of the SWP VGs on the performance are investigated by using air as the working fluid . The heat transfer enhancement and pressure drop of the SWP VGs are compared with those of the equilateral triangular winglet pair VGs the isosceles right angled triangular winglet pair VGs the semicircle winglet pair VGs and the spline curve winglet pair VGs . The field of vorticity and pressure around the VGs are analyzed . The results of this study show that compared with those of the heat exchanger without VGs the heat transfer coefficients increase by 46 by using the VGs mentioned above . Among all types of VGs used in this study the SWP VGs exhibits the least pressure drop . Compared with those of the IRATWP VGs the friction factors of the SWP VGs decrease by 21 . The main reason for the lower pressure drop exhibited by the SWP VGs is that the pressure drag is lower owing to its streamlined configurations . The arrangements of the SWP VGs significantly affect the thermal performance enhancement .

@highlight A novel vortex generator VG named as streamlined winglet pair SWP is proposed.
@highlight Compared with other VGs the SWP VG gives the least pressure drop.
@highlight The lower pressure drop of the SWP is attributed to the lower pressure drag.
