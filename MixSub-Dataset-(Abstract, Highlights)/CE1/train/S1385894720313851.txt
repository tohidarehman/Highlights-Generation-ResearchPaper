 Moderate temperature chemical looping processes circumvent challenges including the sintering of oxygen carrier materials and the deterioration of the reactor at elevated temperatures . While the activation of hydrocarbons and oxygen releasing from metal oxides are difficult at lower temperatures leading to slow redox kinetics in chemical looping . Herein we proposed a moderate temperature chemical looping scheme composed of methane partial oxidation and splitting of CO
