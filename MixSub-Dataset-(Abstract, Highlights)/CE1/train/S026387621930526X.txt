 In this article we investigate the influence of a rectangular microchannel aspect ratio on the liquidliquid flow . An ionic liquid was chosen as one of the working fluids due to a vast scope of applications . Immiscible ionic liquid water flow in T shaped microchannels with 160

@highlight Ionic liquid water flow was studied in microchannels with different aspect ratios.
@highlight Flow pattern maps were drawn and compared for two channels.
@highlight The influence of channel aspect ratio on plug length and velocity has been studied.
@highlight Velocity profiles and velocity circulation in plugs have been obtained with PTV.
