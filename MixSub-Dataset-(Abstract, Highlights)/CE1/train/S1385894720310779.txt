 Sulfidated nanoscale zerovalent iron has showed higher reactivity towards organic pollutants and metal ions than nZVI . However the competitive reaction and electron transport mechanism of organic metal ions with S nZVI in one pot need further clarification . In this study the removal mechanism of Pb and decabromodiphenyl ether complex contaminants by S nZVI was systematically investigated . Compared with nZVI the removal kinetic constants of BDE 209 and Pb by S nZVI increased 7.29 and 5.15 times respectively . Pb can be immobilized to PbO Pb

@highlight S nZVI can quickly remove BDE 209 and Pb II composite pollutants.
@highlight Compared with BDE 209 Pb II can preferentially react with S nZVI.
@highlight Pb
@highlight enhances the electron transfer rate from S nZVI to BDE 209.
@highlight Pb II adversely affects the longevity of S nZVI.
