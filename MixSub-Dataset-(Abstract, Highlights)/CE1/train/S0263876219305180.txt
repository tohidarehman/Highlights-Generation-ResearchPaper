 In this study to investigate the mass transport characteristics in a structured porous medium with porous particles under an interfacial concentration discontinuity a macroscopic solute transport equation is proposed based on the volume averaging theory . A typical three dimensional geometry was chosen as the representative elementary volume . The corresponding closure problem was solved to obtain the longitudinal mass dispersion . Based on the numerical results a new correlation of the longitudinal mass dispersion for a structured porous medium with porous particles is presented . Through a comparison with the correlation of the longitudinal mass dispersion for a random porous medium it can be determined that for a mechanical dispersion the dependence of a random porous medium and that of a structured porous medium on the Pclet number
