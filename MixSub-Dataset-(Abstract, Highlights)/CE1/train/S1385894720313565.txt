 Metal oxides based materials are promising electrodes for energy storage devices however the low rate performance and the high energy consumption in the preparation limit their practical applications . Herein a novel amorphous hydroxyl rich Co

@highlight Novel Co
@highlight flexible electrode is fabricated via electrochemical oxidation of Co MOF.
@highlight This Co
@highlight electrode owns the amorphous hydroxyl rich hierarchical structure.
@highlight It expresses higher C
@highlight than a highly crystalline hydroxyl deficient Co
@highlight electrode.
@highlight It also exhibits better rate performance than many cobalt oxide based electrodes.
@highlight ASC based on this electrode shows excellent rate capability and cycling performance.
