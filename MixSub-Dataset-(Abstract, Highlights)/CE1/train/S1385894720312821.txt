 As an alternative to high temperature oxidation the present study demonstrates a new approach to the intercalation of excess O into 3R delafossite CuFeO

@highlight CuFeO
@highlight has been rapidly synthesized by microwave assisted hydrothermal method.
@highlight The sample has high quality as well as contains elevated concentrations of excess O.
@highlight The formation mechanism is based on the non equilibrium hydrothermal synthesis.
@highlight CuFeO
@highlight exhibits half metallic ferromagnetism and multiple band gaps.
@highlight Non stoichiometric CuFeO
@highlight compounds have potential applications in solar energy conversion.
