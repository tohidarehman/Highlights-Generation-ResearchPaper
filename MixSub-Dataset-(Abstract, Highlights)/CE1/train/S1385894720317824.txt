 Development of recyclable and self repairing phase change materials which enable renewable energy storage and sustainable development is critical for the efficient utilisation of solar energy . Hence we herein fabricated form stable reversible cross linked polyurethane phase change materials composites with excellent recyclability outstanding self healing ability and superior photo thermal conversion efficiency . Furan modified polydopamine particles which serve as cross linkers and photo thermal fillers were incorporated into maleimide terminated polyurethane phase change materials via a DielsAlder reaction . Sunlight irradiation experiments revealed that f PDAPs addition significantly improved the storage efficiency and photo thermal conversion of DPCM x thanks to the superior solar to thermal energy conversion performance of the f PDAPs . Additionally the existence of both reversible DA networks and f PDAPs ensured that DPCM x composites had excellent near infrared induced self healing abilities thermal induced recyclable properties and solid state plasticity . Meanwhile the recovered DPCM x composites could largely maintain their original mechanical properties and thermal energy storage capacity . Such cross linked polyurethane PCM composites exhibited excellent self healing properties under NIR irradiation . Due to their outstanding recyclability interesting energy storage ability and form stability they have enormous potential for applications in the fields of solar to thermal energy conversion and storage .
