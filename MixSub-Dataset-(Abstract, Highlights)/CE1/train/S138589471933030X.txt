 Micro fluidized bed technology is a newly emerging technique that is receiving increasing interest for various industrial applications . MFB is generally characterized by the use of inner diameters

@highlight Hydrodynamic diagnosis from large to micro fluidized beds is performed.
@highlight Time frequency analysis of PFS is firstly used to monitor fluidization of MFB.
@highlight Five regimes from fixed bed to turbulent fluidization are identified in MFBs.
