 Nanosheets and nanosheet based sorbents display great potential for adsorption and separation but low recognition selectivity the site loss caused by agglomeration and stacking and difficulty in collection are the main bottlenecks for their practical application . In this work the mosaic inspired magnetic Alginate composite sorbents are prepared by combining Alg Ca

@highlight Janus MIPs Nanosheets act as Pickering emulsion stabilizer and recognition sites.
@highlight Mosaic type Alg Ca
@highlight microparticles overcome site loss caused by agglomeration and stacking.
@highlight J SNs MMIPs Pickering shows excellent uptake kinetics high adsorption capacity and affinity.
@highlight J SNs MMIPs Pickering could be easily separated by an external magnetic field.
@highlight This work is useful for selective enrichment and analysis of dA in complex biological samples.
