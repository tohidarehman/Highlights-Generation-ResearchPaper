 Metal organic frameworks based catalysts are rising stars in advanced oxidation processes to generate reactive oxygen species . Nevertheless constructing an affordable and recyclable MOFs derived catalyst with high reactivity and stability is highly desirable but still challenging . Herein we unprecedentedly designed a novel CoAl

@highlight ZIF 67 derived CoAl
@highlight @ Al
@highlight pellet CoAl
@highlight @AP was synthesized.
@highlight SO
@highlight OH 
@highlight and O
@highlight were produced in the CoAl
@highlight @AP PMS system.
@highlight SO
@highlight and
@highlight played the vital roles in oxidative removal of metronidazole.
@highlight CoAl
@highlight @AP showed high activity stability and reusability in catalytic reactions.
