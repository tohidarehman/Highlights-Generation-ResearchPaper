 Desulfurization by ionic liquids has attracted wide attention since ILs as green solvents can be recycled after desorption . However the high viscosities of ILs limit the sulfur dioxide SO

@highlight Desulfurization by ionic liquid has been carried out in a RPB.
@highlight  CPL TBAB IL PEG 400 as absorbent has the best performance.
@highlight No obvious loss of desulfurization efficiency was observed during reutilization.
@highlight Desulfurization with IL in a continuous process was feasible with RPB.
