 In this study a novel asymmetric capacitive deionization technology using D314 activated carbon and D860 AC composite electrodes as the anode and cathode electrodes respectively was proposed to enhance the adsorption and separation efficiency of vanadium from complex V containing solutions . The V adsorption capacity and separation factor of V to impurities augments with pH increasing from 1.2 to 1.8 . The reduction rate of V and energy consumption decrease with increasing pH but improve with increasing voltage . The higher operational voltage can enhance the selectivity of asymmetric CDI ascribing to the greater influence of electric force on adsorbing impurities than on V adsorption . The adsorbed impurities and V can be effectively washed with 0.08 M H

@highlight Asymmetric capacitive deionization was firstly introduced into vanadium recovery.
@highlight V was selectively separated from complex leaching solution.
@highlight V was enriched for near 3 times after 8 adsorption desorption cycles.
@highlight Asymmetric capacitive deionization has great potential in recovering metals.
