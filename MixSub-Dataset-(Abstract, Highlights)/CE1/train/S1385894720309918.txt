 With the growth of anaerobic digestion for biogas production associated increasing digestate production may cause environmental problems if the increasing agricultural land required for digestate application is limited . An alternative is to valorise the digestate . Microwave assisted low temperature hydrothermal treatment was investigated as a post treatment for AD of grass silage under two scenarios 1 AD MLHT and 2 Acid pre treatment AD MLHT . Compared to the original grass silage the digestates investigated required lower temperatures for carbonization in MLHT owing to their lower cellulose content . The higher MLHT temperatures led to significant increases in heating value and greater reductions in atomic ratios of O C and H C of hydrochar due to dehydration and decarboxylation reactions . As a result higher temperatures contributed to higher sugar recovery higher solid solubilization and better quality of hydrochar . Under the MLHT at 180C the hydrochar produced from digested grass silage in scenario 1 exhibited a mass yield of 0.79g g total solid a carbon content of 63.6 and an ash free heating value of 27.6kJ g volatile solid the biomethane potential from the process liquor was estimated as 68.7ml CH

@highlight Microwave assisted hydrothermal treatment enables bioenergy recovery from digestate.
@highlight Digestates require lower temperatures for carbonization compared to raw grass silage.
@highlight Hydrochar properties significantly change as temperature increases beyond 160C.
@highlight Digestate from untreated grass silage produces hydrochar of high quality.
