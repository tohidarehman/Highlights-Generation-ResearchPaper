 Supersonic separator is a device for dehydrating and separating heavy hydrocarbons in natural gas . Laval nozzle and cyclone in the separator have a great influence on the separation efficiency . At present there are few studies on the energy distribution characteristics of the cyclone and the law of the influence of cyclone on subsonic and transonic flow fields is not clear . Based on numerical simulation the paper studies the influence of gas liquid density on the separation performance of the separator studies the energy distribution characteristics of methane flow in Laval nozzle under subsonic and transonic velocities and deduces the energy equation containing axial kinetic energy term and radial kinetic energy term in the nozzle . The results show that the gas liquid density has some effects on the separation efficiency of the separator . The distribution of tangential velocity and tangential kinetic energy in the nozzle is similar before the cyclone along the axis but after the cyclone the distribution of tangential velocity and tangential kinetic energy is significantly different . The proposal of tangential kinetic energy has important guiding significance to the structure design of supersonic separator .
