 A strategy for embedding ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles in silicalite 1 was proposed . It consists of treating the zeolite with tetrapropylammonium hydroxide solution loading Pt and recrystallizing the resultant composite in a silicon containing Na

@highlight A special strategy of encapsulating in zeolite was proposed.
@highlight It leads to the
@highlight with Pt nanoparticles embedded in single silicalite 1 zeolite.
@highlight The
@highlight catalyst exhibited strong resistance to sintering.
@highlight The catalyst is much active to CO oxidation as well as to ethylene hydrogenation.
