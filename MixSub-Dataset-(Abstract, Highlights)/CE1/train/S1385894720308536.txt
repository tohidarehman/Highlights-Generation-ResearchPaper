 A large predicted increase in population growth and dwindling phosphate resources has led to sewage sludge being an attractive alternative to commercial fertilisers . Among other contaminants heavy metals are a barrier to unrestricted use of sewage sludge or sewage sludge ash as a phosphate source . This study will focus on the equilibrium isotherm behaviours of Cu

@highlight Copper undergoes homogeneous ion exchange binding to both MTS9301 and C107E.
@highlight Iron II extraction was the lowest of all measured and modelled extraction values.
@highlight Lead displays the most heterogeneous binding with respect to C107E with low binding energies.
@highlight C107E was ineffective for the extraction of zinc from within acetate media.
