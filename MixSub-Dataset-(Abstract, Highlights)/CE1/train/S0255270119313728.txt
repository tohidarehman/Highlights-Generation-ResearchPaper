 Adsorption for environmental applications is normally studied in gas and liquid phases . For the first time in the literature Ni was adsorbed from a subcritical water stream in a fixed column using activated carbon as an adsorbent . Several breakthrough curves were constructed at different conditions of pressure and temperature so that the effects of these variables on the adsorption operation were evaluated using an experimental design . The results were also compared with an adsorption in normal conditions . The fixed bed performance was largely improved when subcritical conditions were used mainly at 25MPa and 200C . The values of stoichiometric adsorption capacity
