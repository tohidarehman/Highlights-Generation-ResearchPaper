 The electronic and sensing properties of pristine and defect tuned black phosphorus monolayer for the monitoring of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide at two defect concentrations 0.0165 and 0.0073

@highlight Unequivocal role of defects in black phosphorene BP for NO and CO detection.
@highlight Computing all plausible structures at two concentrations 0.0165 and 0.0073
@highlight Detection sensitivity correlated well with the predicted electrophilicity.
@highlight A perfect phosphorene layer cannot be a reliable conductance based chemosensor.
@highlight Defective BP is highly selective 193 sensitive 270 and reusable 3.6ms .
