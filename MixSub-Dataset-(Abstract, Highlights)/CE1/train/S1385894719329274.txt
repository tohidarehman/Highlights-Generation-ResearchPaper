 Constructing different 2D nano materials into hybrids is an effective way to fabricate high performance microwave absorbing materials . The formed heterointerfaces offers new loss mechanisms to make up the shortages of sole material in attenuating electromagnetic energy . For practical utilizations microwave absorbers perform at low frequency band with light weight and thinness are more desirable . Here hybrids aerogel microspheres constructed from graphene oxide and Ti

@highlight value of 49.1dB at 1.2mm with loading of 10wt was achieved.
@highlight The hybrid aerogel exhibited excellent attenuating ability in S band.
@highlight Multiple attenuation mechanisms enhanced microwave response.
