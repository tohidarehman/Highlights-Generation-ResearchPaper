 Herein a novel mountain soursop seeds powder adsorbent was employed to explore the adsorption mechanism of two relevant environmental pollutants crystal violet CV and methylene blue MB . As a first assessment to investigate the adsorption mechanism and to analyze the performance of this adsorbent the dye adsorption isotherms were measured at 298328K and pH 8 . Experimental results demonstrated that this adsorbent was more effective to remove the CV dye compared to MB dye from aqueous solution thus concluding that it could utilized for the treatment of dye polluted industrial effluents . To further interpret the adsorption mechanism and to obtain a new physicochemical vision a successful phenomenological theoretical analysis via double layer adsorption model was detailed in this paper . At high equilibrium concentration the adsorbed quantities at saturation were calculated and they followed this sequence Q
