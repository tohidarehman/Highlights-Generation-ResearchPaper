 The growth of bubbles has been extensively studied for decades . However the bubbling inside a single drop on complex surfaces and its subsequent effects on drop are not well understood yet . A systematical investigating of bubbling mechanism in drops on customized microscale pore patterned surfaces is presented and the results demonstrate that drop behaviors can be controlled under low air pressure . As the pressure decreases the drop behaves via two approaches depending on the competition between the critical chamber pressure and the lower limit of pressure . When the former one is higher drop prefers to expand otherwise evaporation occurs . Further studies suggest that the drop expansion consists of two stages pinning mode and pinning to depinning transition . This work provides new insights in understanding of bubbling physics on complex patterned substrates opens a general route for the controlling of drop behaviors under low air pressure and can also find potential applications in optimization design for self cleaning patterned surface .

@highlight The two kinds of drop behavior under low air pressure were investigated.
@highlight The critical air pressure for drop expansion was analyzed and experimentally verified.
