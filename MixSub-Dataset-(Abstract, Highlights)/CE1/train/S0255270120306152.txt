 This paper presents an alternative approach for the selection of the most suitable turbulence promoter for the intensification of heat transfer in tubular heat exchangers . The approach uses the thermal and hydraulic lengths that are determined based on the two main design objectives in a heat exchanger the heat duty and the pressure drop . Exchanger dimension in the form of plots of the exchanger length are produced to identify the device that results in the smaller equipment size within the constraints imposed by the pressure drop . The length plots are produced for various types of turbulence promoters under fixed design specifications such as heat duty pressure drop mass flow rate and tube diameter . The results indicate that from a set of 25 different types of turbulence promoters studied those that exhibit the largest heat transfer enhancement with the lowest pressure drop are the V cut twisted tape the square cut twisted tape and the straight tape with center wings . The benefits of the use of heat transfer enhancement on the stream that controls heat transfer on a practical heat exchanger design is analysed on a case study .
