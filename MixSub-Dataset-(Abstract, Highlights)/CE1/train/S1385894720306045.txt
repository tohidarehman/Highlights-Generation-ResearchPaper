 In this study magnetite zeolite was successfully synthesized to use as a feasible and cost effective cathode catalyst for enhancing methane generation in a microbial electrochemical system . The novel MZ catalyst consists of hydrophilic zeolite cores and conductive magnetite nanoparticles for enhanced electroactive biofilm development on the cathode by facilitating micro channels for nutrient diffusion increased surface area and reduced charge transfer resistance . The MES using an MZ cathode achieved a maximum methane yield of 0.380.010 LCH
