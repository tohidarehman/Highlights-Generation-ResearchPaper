 Conductive hydrogels as wearable devices meet the basic demands of mechanical flexibility and smart sensing . However achieving a combination of adequate skin adhesion long term stability and visible human sensor interface are still challengeable . Here a simple and effective strategy was proposed to fabricate all in one hydrolyzed keratin protein modified polyacrylamide composite hydrogel transducer . Hydrolyzed keratin endowed hydrogel with lower modulus and ultra stretchability to minimize wearing related tension and discomfort . Specially robust skin adhesion was obtained to achieve precise sensing without delamination . Impressively the hydrogel had high transparency and exhibited wide range temperature tolerance . Besides the hydrogel with stable conductivity was extremely sensitive to pressure and strain at a wide range . As a result the obtained transducer could not only detect human motion respiratory mode and vocal cord vibration but also identify handwriting and facial expression . This work shed a new light on the design of next generation skin like electronic devices with applications in human machine interface ionic skin artificial intelligence and healthcare monitoring .
