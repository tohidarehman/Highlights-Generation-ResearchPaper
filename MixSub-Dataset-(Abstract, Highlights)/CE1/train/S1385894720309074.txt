 Phosphate elimination is vital for the remediation of eutrophication to avoid deterioration of water quality . Lanthanum based adsorbents have been proven to have the potential for the removal of phosphate in contaminated water because of its strong affinity for phosphate . Herein we report the high efficiency of NaLa CO

@highlight NaLa CO
@highlight decorated magnetic biochar was prepared via one pot hydrothermal method.
@highlight La Fe BC has excellent phosphate uptake of 330.86mg g over a wide pH range of 38.
@highlight La Fe BC can be magnetically recycled with over 65 of removal efficiency remained.
@highlight and
@highlight on La Fe BC are believed to enhance the phosphate uptake.
@highlight Electrostatic and ligand exchange dominated the phosphate adsorption by La Fe BC.
