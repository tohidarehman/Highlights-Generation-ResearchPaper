 The limiting features of existing ammonium recovery technologies such as pH dependency inefficient manufacturing and low removal capacity of ammonium sorbents limit their commercial application potential . To overcome these technical limitations we employed reactive extrusion as a sustainable alternative synthesis method to prepare cost effective ammonium sorbents based on starch copolymers .

@highlight Copolymers of starch AAm and AMPS were prepared by reactive extrusion within 5min.
@highlight Solvent free copolymerization of CTS resulted in 93 conversion and 71 efficiency.
@highlight The starch copolymer swelling behavior is comparable to that of synthetic hydrogels.
@highlight The potential of the starch copolymers for ammonium removal from water is discussed.
@highlight A monolayer adsorption capacity of 23mg g is recorded for these starch copolymers.
