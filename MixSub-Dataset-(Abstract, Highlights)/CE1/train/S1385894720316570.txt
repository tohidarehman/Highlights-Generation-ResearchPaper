 Co Ce as the dominant active sites immobilized MCM 48 was fabricated via H bonding by the hydrothermal and incipient wetness co impregnation method . The incorporation of Co Ce MCM 48 provided higher mineralization of sulfamethazine than Co MCM 48 and Ce MCM 48 in O

@highlight The Co Ce MCM 48 O
@highlight  PMS could mineralize sulfamethazine efficiently.
@highlight The interface complex was form between PMS and Co Ce MCM 48.
@highlight The electron transfer rate was enhanced in Co Ce MCM 48 O
@highlight  PMS.
@highlight The Co Ce synergistic effect improved the redox behavior in O
@highlight  PMS.
@highlight Rich ROSs were generated in Co Ce MCM 48 O
@highlight  PMS.
