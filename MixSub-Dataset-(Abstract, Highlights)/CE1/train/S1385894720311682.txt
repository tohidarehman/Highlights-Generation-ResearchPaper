 Industrial production of formic acid requires a highly energy intensive process involving carbonylation of methanol with fossil fuel based CO to methyl formate and subsequent hydrolysis of methyl formate to formic acid . In this study we present a sustainable and selective production of formic acid from methanol reforming using electro synthesized nanoporous nickel iron oxyhydroxide borate thin film

@highlight Fe Ni Bi for Photo electroreforming methanol at near neutral pH was developed.
@highlight Role of iron in improving selectivity and activity of
@highlight Fe Ni Bi was uncovered.
@highlight Integration of
@highlight Fe Ni Bi activated BiVO
@highlight towards PEC methanol reforming.
@highlight HCOOH production with 100 selectivity from PEC methanol reforming was realized.
