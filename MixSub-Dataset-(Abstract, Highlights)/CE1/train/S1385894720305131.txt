 In promoting the application of green and sustainable chemistry in wastewater treatment it is urgent to explore effective and stable photocatalysts with excellent degradability on tetracycline and reduction of Cr . However photogenerated charge recombination and low visible light utilization limit the application of photocatalysts . To solve this problem we successfully prepared all solid BiVO

@highlight  3D 2D 2D BVO 
@highlight composite catalyst was successfully prepared by one step hydrothermal method.
@highlight BVO 
@highlight showed excellent photocatalytic activity in Cr VI and tetracycline.
@highlight and h
@highlight were the main active substances in the photocatalytic oxidation reaction.
@highlight is the main active material in photocatalytic reduction reaction to Cr
@highlight BVO 
@highlight demonstrates potential practical value by simulating actual water conditions.
