 The removal of chromium from contaminated water was investigated using biodegradable membranes and functionalized cellulose nanoparticles . We used poly a flexible polymer for membrane development via phase inversion technique . CNS with and without phosphorylation was used aiming to improve the removal of chromium from contaminated drinking water . The neat CNS showed limited efficiency on the Cr removal . On the other hand CNS P indicated removal of 93 and 88 of Cr and Cr respectively . The Cr removal can be associated with CNS higher surface area and active sites which allows more regions for immobilization of chromium species . Also at lower pH the CNS P presents a surface charge that can interact via electrostatic forces with the chromium species which increases the removal efficiency . CNS P also showed greater thermal stability due to phosphorylation . The addition of CNS and CNS P improved the membranes mechanical performance which improves the applicability of this material with potential application in domestic houses and water treatment stations . A small device for domestic use was tested to confirm the efficiency of the membranes and the functionalized membranes showed 71 of chromium removal which highlights its potential for water decontamination .
