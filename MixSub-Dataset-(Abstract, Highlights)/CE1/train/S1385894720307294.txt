 Solid particle distribution determines the reactor internal phases placement and the contact mode between catalyst particles and the liquid phase thus plays a key role in dictating the overall performance of slurry Taylor flow based microreactors . This study numerically investigates the distribution characteristics of particles within liquid slugs in a vertical capillary tube with the aim to describe the corresponding underlying mechanisms .

@highlight VOF DEM is developed for simulating the slurry Taylor flow STF .
@highlight Numerical problem is solved for applying refined mesh for CFD DEM simulations.
@highlight Body fixed frames of reference are introduced to aid the analysis of STF.
@highlight Three distinctly different solid distribution patterns are observed.
@highlight Relatively uniform solid distribution is achievable for
@highlight  550 and
@highlight  0.1.
