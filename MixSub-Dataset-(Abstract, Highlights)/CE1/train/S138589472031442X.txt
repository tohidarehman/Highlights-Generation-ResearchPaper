 In consideration of urgent need to detect trace nitroaromatic contaminants in the environment an ultrasensitive environmental sensing for NACs detection based on Prussian blue analogues cubes in situ grown on glucose derived porous carbon materials was synthesized for the first time via a simple one pot pyrolysis process followed by acid pickling . The prepared PBAcs PC 800 sensor possesses abundant cyano groups with lone pair electrons conjugated effect of porous carbon and NACs high conductive carbon lattices and numerous active redox sites on PBAs which boost the pre adsorption of NACs the electron transfer rate and the electrocatalysis activity toward reduction of NACs . Those synergetic effects endow the prepared PBAcs PC 800 GC electrode with not only wide detection range from 1 to 1000ppb for dinitrobenzene detection but also an clear response to DNB at a level of 110ppb with an extremely high sensitivity of 443.1 A ppm

@highlight Prussian blue analogues cubes were in situ grown on glucose derived porous carbon.
@highlight The sensitivity for nitroaromatic contaminants NACs detection is ultra high.
@highlight The pre adsorption and the electrocatalysis activity of NACs reduction are enhanced.
@highlight The sensor exhibited a distinctive current response to NACs at a level of 1ppb.
