 Three commonly used distributors were introduced into a multiphase monolith reactor in this work to investigate the pressure drop liquid holdup and gasliquid distribution performance by combining experimentation and CFD simulation . The experimental results showed that the nozzle distributor exhibited the better gas liquid phase distribution and the lowest pressure drop . However so far the gas and liquid velocities at the top of the monolith bed which are crucial for the transition from a single channel to bed scale have not been studied . Thus a discrete phase and continuous phase coupling 3D model using CFD simulation was established for the nozzle distributor and the magnitude and distribution of the gas and liquid velocities at the entrance of the monolith module were investigated . The simulation results showed that the droplets velocity reaching the monolith module was very high and had a strong influence on the gas velocity distribution . The increase in superficial gas velocity could enhance the gas distribution to some extent .
