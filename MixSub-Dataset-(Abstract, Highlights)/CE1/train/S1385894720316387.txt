 The efficient treatment of uranium is an important and challenging issue regarding radioactive wastes management . Adsorbent with high efficacy low cost is urgently needed for alleviating the contamination of U containing wastewaters . To solve these issues we report a series of phytic acid modified Zn Al Ti layered mixed metal oxides Zn Al Ti

@highlight Oriented functionalization of Zn Al Ti LMO is performed under different conditions for U VI removal.
@highlight Adsorption of U VI nearly approaches equilibrium within 200min.
@highlight The maximum adsorption capacity of U VI by Zn Al Ti
@highlight is up to 1486mg g.
@highlight Adsorption mechanisms are characterized by the strong chelation of PA and U VI .
