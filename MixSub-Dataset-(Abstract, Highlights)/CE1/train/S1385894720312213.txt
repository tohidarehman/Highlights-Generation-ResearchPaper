 Two dimensional graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets as novel types of emerging materials have aroused considerable research enthusiasm in recent years . Herein we describe for the first time a new application of 2D CNNs as an ideal scaffold for synthesizing AgPd 2D CNNs through a facile one step reduction method and further utilized it as catalysts toward photocatalytic hydrogen generation from FA under visible light . Benefiting from plasmonic and Mott Schottky alloying effects as well as the unique 2D nanosheets structure with a high surface area the resultant Ag
