 A kinetics free procedure is developed to transform a reaction recipe carried out in an isothermal discontinuous semi batch reactor into one based on a series of continuous tubular or tank reactors . Using a suitable number of reactors and a correct feeding policy it is possible to reproduce any discontinuous recipe in flow reactors without knowing the kinetics of the system . The developed procedure allows to determine the number of reactors in series able to reproduce the performance of a semi batch recipe in terms of selectivity keeping the same productivity of the original semi batch process . It was found that using 15 reactors in series allows to keep unchanged the performance of a large number of semi batch processes once a correct policy of intermediate reactant feeding is implemented . This large number of reactors in series with intermediate feeding can be easily implemented using tubular reactors instead of stirred tank ones . Finally the synthesis of an amine epoxy resin was investigated as a case study fully supporting the reliability of the proposed procedure .

@highlight A procedure for transforming SBR processes with selectivity problems into continuous ones is proposed.
@highlight Such a transformation allows for a significant process intensification.
@highlight The proposed methodology does not require any kinetic information.
@highlight The syntheses of an amine epoxy resin is investigated as a case study.
