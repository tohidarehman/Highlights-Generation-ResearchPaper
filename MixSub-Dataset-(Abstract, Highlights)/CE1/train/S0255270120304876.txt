 In the present study a new simple self gas stirred batch electrocoagulation reactor was designed . The new cell consisted of a cylindrical Al sheet anode and a cylindrical Al screen cathode placed at a small distance from the anode . The H

@highlight A new system for removal of heavy metals by electrocoagulation.
@highlight Faster removal of Cu rather than Ni under the same condition.
@highlight Low energy consumption and short electrolysis time were investigated.
@highlight The relationship between the rate constant k
@highlight  and electrical energy per order E
@highlight  was proposed.
@highlight Faster removal due to the generation of strong oxidant.
