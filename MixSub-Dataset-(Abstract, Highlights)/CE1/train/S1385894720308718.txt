 Herein we have successfully fabricated NiVS NiCuP nanostructures on Cu wire as a fiber electrode for high performance FSMSCs applications . The 3D NiCuP dendritic film was firstly deposited on Cu wire through the electrodeposition method which not only act as a scaffold for deposition of the electroactive materials but also served as a micro porous current collector supplied extra capacitances . Then NiV LDH nanosheets grown on 3D NiCuP film were obtained using a hydrothermal method . The sulfidation of NiV LDH is carried out through an ion exchange reaction of OH
