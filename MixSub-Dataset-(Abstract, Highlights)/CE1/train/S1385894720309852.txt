 Composite solid electrolytes have recently attracted widespread attention due to their acceptable lithium ion conductivity and suitable flexibility . However isolated ceramic particles in composite electrolyte can not provide continuous fast Li ion transport channels . And the non uniformity caused by particle agglomeration usually leads to a decrease in the performance of the composite electrolyte . Here we design a polymer in ceramic composite electrolyte that combines three dimensional Li

@highlight  LLZAO framework is successfully prepared via a template method.
@highlight A polymer in ceramic composite electrolyte that combines 3D LLZAO with PEO LiTFSI is fabricated.
@highlight The application of 3D LLZAO in the composite electrolyte effectively improves its performance.
@highlight The LFP electrolyte Li cell exhibits a high discharge capacity.
