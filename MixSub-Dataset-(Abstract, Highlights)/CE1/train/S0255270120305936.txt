 Biodiesel production was investigated by hydroesterification using enzymatic catalysis in both hydrolysis and esterification reactions . Soybean oil resulting from food frying processes was used as feedstock . Lipase from

@highlight Biodiesel was produced by hydroesterification using WCO and enzymatic catalysis.
@highlight A low cost used crude extract GCL I fully hydrolyzed WCO within a 80 min reaction.
@highlight PFL was immobilized on SDB which was used in the esterification step.
@highlight The prepared biocatalyst retained around 98 of its activity after 6 cycles of 9h.
@highlight Highly quality and purity of biodiesel were assessed by 1H NMR and FTIR analysis.
