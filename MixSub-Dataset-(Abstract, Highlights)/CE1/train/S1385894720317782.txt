 As an environmental water treatment technology membrane technology has been prevalent for water purification in the closed membrane reactor system . Can membrane technology be applied as an ecological water treatment technology for water purification in the open natural water system In this study the feasibility of water purification in the open natural water system with gravity driven biomimetic membrane was explored focusing on the filtration driving force for providing the superior filtration efficiency and stability of long term operation for improving the practicability . During GDBM preparation process laccase was immobilized by carrier then they were filtrated and deposited on microfiltration thus a biomimetic layer with high permeability was formed . Its filtration process could be driven by the gravity of its own hydrostatic height . Above all activated carbon graphene oxide and carbon nanotube were utilized as carrier materials . Because of more stable immobilization effect for laccase and greater permeable structure GO GDBM possessed the better BPA removal rate and higher permeate flux . It even reached 72.1 L m
