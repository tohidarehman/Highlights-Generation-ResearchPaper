 Self healing polymers have drawn significant attention because of their great potential for applications in many fields . It is highly desirable to prepare materials capable of self healing and with excellent mechanical properties . Additionally the flammability of polymers make them unsafe during use . A novel strategy is proposed to manufacture a multifunctional polyurethane elastomer with high tensile strength and excellent self healing efficiency containing a thermo reversible crosslinking network and multiple hydrogen interactions . The furan terminated phosphorus based monomer tri phosphoramide was successfully synthesized and then conjugated into a maleimide terminated linear segmented polyurethane backbone to prepare self healing recyclable and flame retarded polyurethane . Due to its synergetic dual reversible bonds the multifunctional polyurethane elastomer possessed ultrahigh strength and excellent self healing shape recovery and reprocessing properties . The phosphorus containing polyurethane elastomer exhibited improved thermal stability a limiting oxygen index value of 28.5 and a 12.3 decrease in the peak heat release rate relative to those of unmodified polyurethane . This work demonstrates an effective strategy to prepare multifunctional polyurethane elastomer with both high self healing efficiency and excellent mechanical properties allowing application for this material in the fields of fire control coatings and building materials .
