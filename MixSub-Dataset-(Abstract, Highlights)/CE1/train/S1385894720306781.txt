 Biochar is widely used material whose physical and chemical characteristics been widely investigated . Nevertheless dissolved organic matter released from biochar has received relatively little attention . In particular little research has been conducted to understand the effects of feedstock biomass components on biochar DOM release . To control the amount of DOM released from biochar this study focuses on the role of lignin a component of biomass . To this end samples of sawdust containing different lignin contents and a binary mixture of cellulose and lignin were pyrolyzed at 400 and 700C and then the physico chemical properties of the resulting biochar and Fe and As mobility were investigated in arsenic contaminated soil amended by the biochar . This study showed that lignin is an critical factor in controlling the release of DOM . The amount of DOM released from the sawdust biochar with the lowest lignin content was 33 and 44 lower than those produced from lignin rich biochar . The amount of oxalic acid in DOM decreased with increased lignin content . In addition As mobility and the transformation of Fe were minimized when lignin rich biochar was applied to the As contaminated soil . More importantly these results suggest that controlling the lignin content of biomass can be universally applied to predict DOM concentrations of the biochars produced .

@highlight Lignin content is inversely proportional to DOM release from the biochar.
@highlight Biochar pyrolyzed sawdust with more lignin extracted less Fe from soil.
@highlight Sawdust biochar with less lignin can enhance the As leaching from soil.
