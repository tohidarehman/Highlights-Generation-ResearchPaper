 Oxygen vacancies are efficient to promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes thereby enhancing the photocatalytic performance of the catalyst . In this work Ni doped ZnO with oxygen vacancies was successfully synthesized . 3ZnO with 3wt of Ni

@highlight A simple method for Ni doped ZnO with oxygen vacancies was developed.
@highlight 3ZnO with 3wt of Ni
@highlight doping got 94 depolymerization of sodium lignosulfonate.
@highlight The optimal yields of vanillic acid and guaiacol were 9.3 and 1.5 respectively.
@highlight Suitable concentration of oxygen vacancies promotes the production of
@highlight of O
@highlight is useful to depolymerization of sodium lignosulfonate into valuable product.
