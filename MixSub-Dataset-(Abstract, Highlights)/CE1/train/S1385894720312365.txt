 The design of robust metallic transition metal dichalcogenides based materials for photocatalytic water splitting is desirable but challenging . Here we report the exploration and crystal phase engineering of metallic CoSe

@highlight Crystal phase dependent hydrogen evolution performance of CoSe
@highlight is demonstrated.
@highlight The origin for crystal phase dependent performance is discussed.
@highlight The advance of using modern theoretical tools for the design catalysts is highlighted.
