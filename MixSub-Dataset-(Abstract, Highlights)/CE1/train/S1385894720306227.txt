 A large amount of petroleum coke is considered as waste with low gasification rate and urgently needs to be exploited in an environmentally friendly efficient and economic method . As potassium plays an important role in the gasification reactivity enhancement the effects of potassium on the carbon conversion gas product distribution and the sulfur conversion were investigated in the chemical looping gasification process via a batch fluidized bed . H

@highlight K reduced the rate disparity in volatile releasing and gasification of petcoke.
@highlight K doubled H
@highlight yield but the anions had weak effect on gas distribution.
@highlight The carbon conversion efficiency increased by up to 39.67 after adding K
@highlight CO
@highlight K inhibited the graphitization of petcoke so the gasification reactivity increased.
@highlight Relatively K was beneficial to in suit S capture by the formation of inorganic S.
