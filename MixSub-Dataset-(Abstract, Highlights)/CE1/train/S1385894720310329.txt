 Coupling chemical oxidation and biodegradation to remediate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons contaminated soil has gained great attention in recent decades . However there remains a knowledge gap concerning the integration of persulfate oxidation and anoxic biodegradation of PAHs in subsurface soil . In this study the potential of integrated persulfate oxidation and anoxic biodegradation of PAHs in aged subsurface soil are investigated . Dynamic changes in the soil bacterial abundance and community composition are also examined . The soil bacterial abundance and community composition were negatively influenced following the application of different dosages of persulfate but these were found to be gradually restored after the depletion of persulfate . The bacteria that were capable of degrading PAHs under anoxic conditions were predominated by the phyla

@highlight Integrated PS oxidation and anoxic biodegradation of PAH in subsurface soil was investigated.
@highlight Soil bacterial abundance was negatively impacted by PS but that can be restored.
@highlight Both PS oxidation and anoxic biodegradation contributed to PAH removal in the soil added 1 of PS.
@highlight PAH removal was primarily attributed to PS oxidation in soil added 1 of PS.
@highlight Combined treatment was more efficient for PAH removal than either one alone in the soil added 1 of PS.
