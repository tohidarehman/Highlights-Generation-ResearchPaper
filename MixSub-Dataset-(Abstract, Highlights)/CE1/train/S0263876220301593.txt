 A novel axial flow hydrocyclone in the ebullated bed reactor is proposed to solve problems such as low space utilization rate low operation flexibility and complex device structure . This study presents a numerical and experimental study of the liquid solid two phase flow and the performance of the hydrocyclone with focus on the effects of length

@highlight The hydrocyclone is applied to ebullated bed to efficiently separate catalysts
@highlight Low pressure drop is achieved with the optimal configurations of vortex finder
@highlight The effects of structure of vortex finder on performance and flows are quantified
