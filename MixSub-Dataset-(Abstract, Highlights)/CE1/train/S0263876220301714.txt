 Acetic acid is an essential chemical product . The need for green acetic acid has spurred new research in developing more sustainable processes . This paper presents an original conceptual design of a low energy and low emissions sustainable process for acetic acid manufacturing by methanol carbonylation . The emphasis is set on energy efficiency as the exothermic reaction releases a large amount of energy that may be more effectively used .
