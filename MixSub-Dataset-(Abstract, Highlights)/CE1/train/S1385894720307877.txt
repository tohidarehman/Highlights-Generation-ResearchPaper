 Microplastics an emerging threat to terrestrial ecosystems have aroused global concerns due to the potential harm to wildlife and human . So far no effectively method has been found to remove MPs from wastewater . In the present study a robust and compressive sponge prepared from chitin and graphene oxide was achieved with the compressive stress of 50 and 40MPa at dry and wet status . Such sponge efficiently adsorbed different types of MPs from water at pH 68 and can be reusable with the high adsorption capacity of 89.8 72.4 and 88.9 for neat polystyrene carboxylate modified polystyrene and amine modified polystyrene respectively even after three adsorptiondesorption cycles . The adsorption kinetic study suggested that the electrostatic interactions hydrogen bond interactions and interactions were the main driving force for MPs absorption and the intra particle diffusion played a major role in the whole adsorption process . The isotherm results followed the Langmuir isotherm model with the maximum adsorption capacity of PS calculated to be 5.898 . 7.528 and 8.461mgg
