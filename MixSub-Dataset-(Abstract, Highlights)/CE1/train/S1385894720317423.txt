 Combination chemotherapy such as doxorubicin plus cisplatin based on co assembling nanoparticles plays increasingly important role in the clinical treatment of cancer . But their synergistic antitumor effect is highly limited by unmatched release behavior of Dox and cisplatin . To enhance the synergistic antitumor effect of Dox and cisplatin herein an acidic triblock polymer

@highlight nanogels are programmatically fabricated via a simple mixing approach.
@highlight nanogels show sol gel transition ensuring long term retention in tumor.
@highlight nanogels exhibit sustained and parallel release of Dox and cisplatin.
@highlight nanogels show best synergistic antitumor and antimetastasis effects.
@highlight nanogels reduce toxicity of Dox and cisplatin on normal tissues.
