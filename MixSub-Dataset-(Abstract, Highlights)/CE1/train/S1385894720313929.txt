 A kind of tubular bio electrochemical system with functional biocathode coupling with oxygen producing submerged plants was developed to remove pollutants from polluted surface water and sediment . The coupled system showed an excellent performance in comparison with normal BES without plants only plant system and control system only containing sediment and water . The average removal efficiency of TOC and TN in water of P BES were 30.3 and 44.7 which was 2.9 and 2.4 times higher than that of CS . The rate coefficient k of nitrate of P BES was 26.2 lower than that of PS . The untransformed nitrogen in P BES accounted for 14.6 which was 8.0 65.2 and 81.0 lower than that in PS CS and NP BES . The maximum power density of the coupled system was 20.8mW m

@highlight Tubular BES coupling with submerged plants was applied to restore surface water.
@highlight Best removal efficiency of TOC 30.2 and TN 61.1 was obtained in P BES.
@highlight Proper DO level was provided by plants and biocathode to improve nitrogen removal.
