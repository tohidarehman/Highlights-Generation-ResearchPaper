 Porous polyvinylidene fluoride filled MWCNT hollow fiber mixed matrix membranes were fabricated and applied for carbon dioxide absorption in a gasliquid membrane contactor with Al

@highlight PVDF filled MWCNT mixed matrix membranes were successfully fabricated.
@highlight Formation of finger like pores was improved by adding MWCNT to the matrix.
@highlight Wettability resistance porosity and gas permeance of the membranes were enhanced.
@highlight Gas absorption performance of the membranes was significantly improved.
@highlight Replacing the absorbent with Al
@highlight nanofluid further enhanced the performance.
