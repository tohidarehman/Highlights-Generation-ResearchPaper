 A novel thiol functionalized covalent organic framework was prepared as an adsorbent for the simultaneous removal of BTEX and Hg ion from water . The COF S SH was obtained

@highlight A novel thiol functionalized covalent organic framework was prepared.
@highlight High binding ability and fast uptake kinetics for BTEX and Hg II ion.
@highlight High binding selectivity for Hg II in the presence of other common metal ions.
@highlight Efficiently simultaneous removal of BTEX and Hg II ion in simulated sewage.
