 The three dimensional vertical array scaffolds can be constructed by electrostatic flocking with quite high efficiency and low cost for large area applications . Herein we have fabricated stretchable and highly conductive fabric base resulting from the strong interaction between acid functionalized carbon nanotubes and cationic cotton spandex fabric . Then the electrostatic flocking was applied for the first time to implant vertical arrays of carbon fibers onto conductive fabrics accompanied by deposition of nano MnO

@highlight There is strong interaction between AC MWNTs and cationic cotton spandex fabric.
@highlight 3D stretchable scaffolds were made by electrostatic flocking with high efficiency.
@highlight Fabric based electrode provided ideal electrochemical reversibility under tension.
@highlight Asymmetric supercapacitors were assembled with excellent capacitive performance.
