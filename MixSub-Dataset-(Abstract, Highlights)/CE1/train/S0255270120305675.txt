 A microreactor based continuous inverse suspension polymerization method for synthesis of uniform spherical polyacrylamide hydrogel beads is reported . Aqueous phase containing monomer cross linker and initiator was dispersed in the form of droplets into a carrier phase by using a microfluidic T junction . The residence time for the reaction was provided by a microbore tube connected to the T junction . The effects of factors such as O A ratio microbore tube diameter design of the microfluidic junction and monomer concentration on the shape size and uniformity of the beads formed were studied in detail . Two different mixing approaches in situ mixing and ex situ mixing were also compared . The size of the beads could be varied by changing the O A ratio . The design of the microfluidic junction and the diameter of the residence time element were found to have significant effect on the size and shape of the beads . Spherical and monodispersed PAM hydrogel beads could be synthesized by using the microreactor comprising 800 m diameter microfluidic T junction as the dispersing device followed by a microbore tube serving as the residence time element .
