 With rapid development of large scale grid storage system aqueous Zn batteries with features of superior safety low cost and high energy density have attracted a growing number of researchers . However severe corrosion and dendrite growth of Zn anodes have hindered their cycling performance and commercial application . Here we fabricated an indium based protective layer on Zn metal surface via a facile ion exchange route . The insulating indium based compounds provide necessary potential gradient to induce Zn plate underneath the coating film . Meanwhile indium and its derivatives can effectively suppress corrosion and regulate Zn plating behavior due to unique physical and chemical properties . The symmetric cells with In coated Zn anodes maintain stable stripping plating process over 1400h . Improved performance of full cells with modified Zn anode paired with MnO
