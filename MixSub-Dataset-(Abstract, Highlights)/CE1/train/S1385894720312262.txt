 In this work a high performance photocatalyst by integrating iodine vacancy of bismuth oxyiodide was designed having rich iodine vacancy and superior photocatalytic activity . Specifically the mechanisms for the formation of iodine vacancy and reaction process were investigated . Further a novel iodine vacancy flower like BiOI

@highlight The flower like BiOI
@highlight photocatalyst was synthesized to delay recombination of electron hole pairs.
@highlight The iodine vacancy BiOI
@highlight photocatalyst exhibits better performance compared to pristine BiOI.
@highlight Possible photo induced charges transfer mechanism and photocatalytic reaction mechanism were proposed.
