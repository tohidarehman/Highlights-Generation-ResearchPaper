 In this study hydroxyethyl cellulose was cross flow deposited on flat sheet polypropylene porous support and insolubilized by cross linking using glutaraldehyde to fabricate cost effective thin film composite membrane for aqueous and non aqueous nanofiltration . Membrane physico chemical property permeation performance as well as tolerance to acid alkaline and organic solvents were systematically characterized . The obtained HEC PP composite membrane was found to be effectively modulated in pore size via changing HEC and GA contents and possessed good fabrication reproducibility . The desired HEC PP composite membrane with an average pore diameter of around 2.21

@highlight TFC membrane with HEC barrier layer and PP support was designed for nanofiltration.
@highlight Membranes were fabricated via cross flow deposition followed with cross linking.
@highlight Improved adhesion between HEC layer and PP porous substrate was achieved.
@highlight Membrane fabrication was free of organic solvent and possessed good reproducibility.
@highlight Membrane exhibited good perm selectivity chemical stability and solvent resistance.
