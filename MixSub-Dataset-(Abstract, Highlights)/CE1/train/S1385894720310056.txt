 In this study a systematic comparison in morphology long term degradation regeneration and reuse were conducted between palladized and sulfidized nanoscale zero valent iron . Pd Fe and S Fe were prepared after the synthesis of precursor Fe

@highlight Particle properties in nanoscale were characterized using HAADF TEM and EDS.
@highlight Pd Fe catalyze the CTC degradation greater k
@highlight  and S Fe shows a better longevity.
@highlight Pd Fe and S Fe effectively degraded chloroform intermediate of CTC but not for Fe.
@highlight Aged Fe based particles were converted to FeOOH and Fe
@highlight  Fe
@highlight Aged and regenerated S Fe lost S species and performed like Fe in CTC degradation.
