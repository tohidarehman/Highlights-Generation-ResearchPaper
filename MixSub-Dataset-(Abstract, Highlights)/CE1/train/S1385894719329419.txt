 The development of a unique and universal strategy for accurate and sensitive quantification of multiple targets is essential for a variety of applications ranging from environmental monitoring to biological research . Herein a novel silver nanoclusters beacon based ratiometric fluorescence sensing strategy for highly sensitive and multiple detection of various targets was reported . Single stranded multifunctional DNA sequences are rationally designed and used for simple synthesis of SNCB . Study of the fluorescent transduction mechanism testified that hybridization induced close proximity of non emitting AgNCs to green emitting AgNCs result in the generation of red emitting AgNCs . Based on target induced transformation of R AgNCs to G AgNCs the developed SNCB enabled the exploitation of a label free ratiometric nanoplatform for versatile fluorescence biosensing . As a proof of concept nanothermometer development pH sensing and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis with high accuracy and sensitivity were successfully realized . This sensing approach is applicable to many types of other targets by simply switching the sequences of nucleic acid probe showing great potential for extending the applications of SNCB in bioanalysis .
