 In this work the nacre like styrene butadiene rubber crumpled graphene nanosheets heater with integrated superior performance including excellent anisotropic conductivity flexible stretchable Joule heating performance and comprehensive mechanical performance is prepared on a large scale by the blade coating technique . The excellent flexible stretchable Joule heating performance almost constant of the saturation temperature at the excitation of 8V suffering 70 strain and 4000 times of bending is originated from the selection of elastic styrene butadiene rubber matrix and introduction of flexible conductive crumpled graphene nanosheets . The excellent comprehensive mechanical performance and the ultrahigh anisotropic conductivity are attributed to the distinctive nacre like structure . Moreover the heating model of the NSGH is proposed and validated that the heating performance can be tailored and forecasted .
