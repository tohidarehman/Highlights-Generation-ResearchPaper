 Natural and waste waters pollution by nitrates is considered a major environmental problem due to the possible consequences on human health and on water bodies through eutrophication phenomenon . Hazelnut shell were employed as packing material in a large lab scale column for the removal of nitrate from wastewaters comparing the process performances with those obtained in batch system . A nitrate removal efficiency up to about 67 was observed in batch mode at low pH and with a sorbent mass concentration of 8 g L with 0.5 mm size . A lower nitrate removal efficiency was observed at large lab scale column though notable volumes of effluents were successfully treated with a bed height of 30 cm and a sorbent mass of 590 g. Non linear regression of batch equilibrium data using Langmuir Freundlich and SIPS models allowed to estimate the isotherm parameters subsequently used in a mass transfer dynamic model to fit the experimental data . The regressed film mass transfer coefficient

@highlight The waste biomass was successfully to produce a novel column packing material.
@highlight The achieved nitrate removal efficiency in fixed bed column reached about 60 .
@highlight SIPS model well described the equilibrium data both in batch and continuous mode.
@highlight The limiting mass transfer mechanism was represented by film diffusion.
@highlight The pressure drops along the column packed with lower sized materials were 0.1 kPa m.
