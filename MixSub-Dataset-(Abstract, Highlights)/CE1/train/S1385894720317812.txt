 Combined partial denitrification and anammox process has received growing interest for treating wastewaters with high nitrate concentrations but the underlying molecular mechanisms are currently poorly understood due to the complexity in bacterial community composition and functionality of the coupled system . This study applied metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches to gain comprehensive and deep insights into the nitrogen metabolic pathways in a lab scale partial denitrification anammox bioreactor showing stable nitrogen removal . Stoichiometric analysis showed that most of nitrogen was removed by the coupled system but dissimilatory denitrification also contributed to nitrogen gas production . The latter was further evidenced by

@highlight Simultaneous partial denitrification and anammox process showed higher nitrogen removal performance.
@highlight Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses comprehensively uncover nitrogen metabolic pathways of the process.
