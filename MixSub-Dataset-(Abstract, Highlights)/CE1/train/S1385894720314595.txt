 Metal phosphide materials with unique nanostructures are of great interest for electrocatalysis . Herein an ion induction strategy is developed to synthesize a family of carbon incorporated homobimetallic phosphide electrocatalyst of hierarchical hollow polyhedral nanocages composed of ultrathin 2D subunits . The unique morphological structure effectively optimize the surface active sites accelerate the charge transfer and thus boost their superior catalytic activity . Density functional theory calculations reveal that not only the homogenously doped secondary metals but also the incorporated carbon effectively regulates the electronic structure and as a result collaboratively lower the kinetic energy barrier for the OER . Electrochemical measurements show high OER efficiency @ 10mAcm
