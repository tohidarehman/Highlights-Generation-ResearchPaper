 Two multi amine metformin and polyethyleneimine were used to prepare separative layer of composite membrane through chemical deposition with tea polyphenols an inexpensive mixture of nature polyphenols on a hybrid polysulfone membrane . The supporting layer was a blend membrane of Psf coupling agent treated sepiolite and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide . Sepiolite and the surfactant improved surface hydrophilicity of membrane . Pure water flux of membranes was increased from 33.97 to 611.46

@highlight Pure water flux of polysulfone membrane was increased greatly by sepiolite and CTAB.
@highlight A mixture of tea polyphenols could prepare effective separative layers though chemical deposition with MTM and PEI.
@highlight PT membrane showed more than 98.6 rejection for CR and NR under the water permeance about 3.0
