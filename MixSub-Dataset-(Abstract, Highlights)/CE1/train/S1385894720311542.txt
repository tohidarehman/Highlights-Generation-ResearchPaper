 Uranium extraction from seawater has attracted attention owing to the growing demand for nuclear energy . However it remains challenging because of the complexities of the marine environment such as competing metal ions high salinity alkaline pH and continuous biofouling . In this study a new hyperbranched poly modified adsorbent PAO

@highlight Hyperbranched
@highlight  PAMAM is introduced into U adsorbent for the first time.
@highlight Excellent anti biofouling activity and adsorption capacity are observed.
@highlight Marine applicability of adsorbents was enhanced via synergy of functional groups.
