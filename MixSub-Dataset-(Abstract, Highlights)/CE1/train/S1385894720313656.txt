 Though zein is gaining more and more attention because of its multifunctionality and biodegradability the high sensitivity to humidity limits its further applications . In the present study the multifunctional zein nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning with the assistance of polyvinyl alcohol followed by cross linking with glutaraldehyde . In this way the moisture resistance of the nanofibers was significantly improved while the air filtration performance was well retained . The optimized nanofibers exhibited over 97 filtration efficiency of PM
