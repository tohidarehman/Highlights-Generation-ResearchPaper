 The competitive adsorption between phosphate and arsenic in natural soil and mineral systems is important for controlling subsurface contaminants . Phosphate is known to adsorb more strongly than As in Fe oxide based mineral systems . Here X ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory were employed to understand the fundamental reaction mechanisms of As and phosphate on an FeS surface . The competitive effect of phosphate in As contaminated soil systems differed with changing FeS concentrations . In soil batches with high FeS contents As was more strongly adsorbed than phosphate and no additional As release was observed in the aqueous phase in the presence of phosphate . Through the XAS measurement of laboratory batch samples the reaction mechanisms could be comprehensively understood including the reduction of As to As the secondary precipitation of sulfide minerals and the adsorption mechanism of As on the surface of FeS . The DFT calculations revealed the relative adsorption strengths on the FeS surface were As phosphate As . Comparing the adsorption energies revealed that As reacted more strongly with FeS than phosphate and As and that the effect of phosphate co occurrence was negligible in the FeSAs system in line with the experimental measurements .

@highlight Phosphate has a negligible effect on the arsenic release in the FeS dominant environment.
@highlight DFT calculations revealed that the relative adsorption strength on FeS As V phosphate As III .
@highlight DFT allows to understand the sole effect of the adsorption mechanisms in complex FeS chemistry.
