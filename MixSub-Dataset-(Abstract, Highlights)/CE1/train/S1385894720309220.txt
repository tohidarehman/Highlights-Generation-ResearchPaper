 The currently mass produced graphene materials are typically graphene nanoplatelets with multiple layer structures the properties of which are not comparable to those of mono layer or few layer graphene . In this work high concentrations of commercial GnPs were effectively exfoliated in polypropylene GnP nanocomposites using supercritical CO

@highlight High concentrations of GnPs were highly exfoliated in PP GnP composites by sc CO
@highlight The pressure threshold to delaminate graphene was significantly reduced in PP GnP.
@highlight The electrical conductivity increased by 5 orders of magnitude after sc CO
@highlight treatment.
