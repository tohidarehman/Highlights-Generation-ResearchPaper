 Thermal Energy Storage using granular solids is gaining momentum in the last years . With no degradation up to very high temperatures and very low price the use of some granular materials such as sand or

@highlight The tensile strength and compressibility of fine CaCO
@highlight powders are measured using the SPT.
@highlight The effects of particle size temperature and consolidation stress are analyzed.
@highlight Powder cohesiveness is largely increased with temperature and consolidation stress.
@highlight Data agree with theoretical predictions for elasto plastic interparticle contacts.
@highlight The decrease of hardness with temperature causes a great increase of cohesiveness.
