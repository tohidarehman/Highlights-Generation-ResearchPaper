 Crystal violet is one of the most toxic organic dyes thus there is a critical need to remove it from wastewater before discharging into the environment . To tackle this challenge new resources should be exploited to construct green and environmentally friendly adsorbents . Herein we designed a novel cryogel by freeze thaw of naturally derived polysaccharides salecan and locust bean gum without any toxic and organic cross linkers . Their three dimensional network structure was established by strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the two polysaccharides and has been characterized systematically . More specially salecan LBG ratio could be accurately tuned to enhance the storage modulus and to adjust the hydrophilicity and pore architecture of these cryogels . Batch experiments with the subject of salecan LBG ratios pHs initial dye concentrations as well as contact time were studied . The adsorption equilibrium data could be well fitted with pseudo second order model and Langmuir model revealing monolayer chemical adsorption mechanism . The maximum CV adsorption capacity calculated by Langmuir equation was 309.5mg g higher than many reported CV adsorbents . Notably the regenerated cryogel could be easily reused with high adsorption capacity for at least five cycles . This work provided a facile avenue to develop sustainable cryogel adsorbent for deep cleaning of CV in wastewater .
