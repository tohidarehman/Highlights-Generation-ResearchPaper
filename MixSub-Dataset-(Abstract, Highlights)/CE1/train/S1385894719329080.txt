 In this study the performance of the peroxi coagulation fuel cell process for p arsanilic acid removal and power generation were evaluated at initial pH of 3.06.0 . It was found that 94 of p ASA could be removed within 60min at pH of 3.06.0 . The fastest p ASA removal could be obtained at pH of 4.0 whereas the optimum power density was 98.3mWm

@highlight The PCFC system was the combination of peroxidation and electrocoagulation processes.
@highlight Efficient p ASA removal was obtained in PCFC system with simultaneous electricity generation.
@highlight The optimum power density was 98.3mWm
@highlight at 745mAm
@highlight with pH of 3.0.
@highlight The optimum removal of p ASA was achieved at pH of 4.0 within 15min.
