 Biochar is extensively used in the remediation of pollutants because of its diverse physicochemical properties . Biochar application can alter the activity of microbial communities involved in bioremediation . However the electrochemical behavior of biochar and its potential effect on microbial nitrate reduction remains unknown . Electron transfer between microbial cells and electron donor or acceptor species is often across extracellular polymeric substances . However the role of EPS in extracellular electron transfer remains unclear . In this study we examined the electrochemical behavior of biochar and its effects on microbial nitrate reduction to elucidate the role of EPS in extracellular electron transfer . The biochar prepared by the pyrolysis of Aspen wood chips at 400600C . Electrochemical analysis using cyclic voltammetry electrochemical impedance spectrum and chronoamperometry showed that biochars could donate and accept electrons . BC 400 BC 500 and BC 600 had an electron donating capacity of 1.03mmol e
