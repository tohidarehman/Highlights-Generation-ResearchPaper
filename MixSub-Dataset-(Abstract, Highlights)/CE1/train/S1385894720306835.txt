 Carboxymethyl cellulose stabilized iron sulfide nanoparticles have been shown promising for reductive immobilization of U in water and soil . This work aimed to fill some critical knowledge gaps on the effects of the stabilizer and water chemistry reaction mechanisms and long term stability of stabilized uranium . The optimal CMC to FeS molar ratio was determined to be 0.0010 . CMC FeS performed effectively over pH 6.09.0 with the best removal being at pH 7.0 and 8.0 . The retarded first order model adequately interpreted the kinetic data representing a mechanistically sounder model for heterogeneous reactants of decaying reactivity . The presence of Ca

@highlight CMC stabilized FeS CMC FeS nanoparticles can rapidly remove U VI from water.
@highlight CMC FeS worked effectively under normal groundwater conditions pH DOM co solutes 
@highlight Reduction accounts for 90 of U VI removal and S
@highlight and S
@highlight are primary e donors.
@highlight High concentrations 5mM of bicarbonate or DOM may inhibit the U VI removal.
@highlight Immobilized U kept stable in anoxic condition while 26 remobilized under air in 180days.
