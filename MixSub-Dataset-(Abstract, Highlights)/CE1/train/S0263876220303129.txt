 Coating complex surfaces by functional amorphous silica films for new applications including energy harvesting and health depends on the operating range and robustness of their deposition process . In this paper we propose a new kinetic model for the atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition of SiO

@highlight New apparent kinetic model for the CVD of SiO
@highlight films in the range 150520 C.
@highlight Excellent fit between CFD process simulation and thorough experimental analysis.
@highlight First time definition of temperature dependent surface reaction from TEOS.
@highlight Original solutions proposed to uniformly coat complex and or large substrates.
