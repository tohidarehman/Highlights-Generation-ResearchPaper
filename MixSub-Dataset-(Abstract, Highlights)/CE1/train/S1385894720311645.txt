 The catalytic elimination of chloroaromatics is the frontier of catalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds and the screening of efficient catalysts remains challenging . In this work a series of porous Fe Mn oxides were synthesized

@highlight Porous Fe 
@highlight  Mn 
@highlight  oxides are synthesized
@highlight a simple template free oxalate route.
@highlight Fe1Mn1 shows the stronger acid property enhanced redox property and rich in Mn
@highlight Fe1Mn1 presents high activity and good durability in CB combustion.
@highlight CB is oxidized into less toxic products and scarce formation of chlorinated byproduct.
@highlight Correlations of acidity and reducibility with CB combustion activity were observed.
