 Considering the low recyclability of powder adsorbents an efficient method is needed to fabricate a novel three dimensional adsorbents . Take advantage of the 3D iron network and admirable adsorption performance of the Fe based metal organic framework a solvothermal method was used to in situ growing a series of Fe based MOFs MIL 100 and MIL 101 onto the iron network . The successful growing of MILs on the iron network was verified by optical microscopy SEM XRD FT IR and XPS characterizations . As expected the 3D MILs inherited the high adsorption capacity of powdery MILs while excellent recycling performance was obtained . Among them Fe MIL 100 exhibited the highest performance towards tetracycline more than 95 of TC could be removed at fifth adsorption cycle . Mechanism indicated that the and hydrogen bonding interactions between Fe MIL 100 and TC molecules played an essential role in the adsorption process . Besides the Fe MIL 100 adsorbent was stable in water with negligible iron leaching in solution . It is worth noting that Fe MIL 100 kept a high adsorption performance towards TC in a wide pH range of 210 and suffered minor influence from the anion and humic acid in solution . Even in actual aqueous solution high performance was presented by the Fe MIL 100 adsorbent . This work provided a new method to synthesis 3D MILs adsorbents for wastewater remediation .
