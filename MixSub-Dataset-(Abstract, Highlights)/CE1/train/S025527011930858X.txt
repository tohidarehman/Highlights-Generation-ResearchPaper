 Recent developments in nanotechnology have a great impact to improve the mass transfer in gas liquid systems . The effect of nanoparticles was taken into account considering Grazing effect and Brownian motion as main phenomena of mass transfer enhancement in nanouids . In the present study a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the inuence of nanoparticles on the CO
