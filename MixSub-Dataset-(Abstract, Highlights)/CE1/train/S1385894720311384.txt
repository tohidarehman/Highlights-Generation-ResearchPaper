 In this research the SAPO 34 nanocatalyst has been improved in order to produce biodiesel as a green fuel . According to large molecules of free fatty acids and difficulty in the diffusion of these molecules through small pores of SAPO 34 the active charcoal secondary template was used to create meso and macro pores . Also in order to increase acidic strength and density of active sites CeO

@highlight Potential use of secondary template on increasing of pore diameter and porosity.
@highlight Enhanced effect of ultrasound irradiation power on dispersion of ceria on SAPO 34.
@highlight Acidic improvement of mesopore SAPO 34 by ceria dispersion.
@highlight Potential application of nano ceria decorated SAPO 34 in green fuel production.
@highlight Kinetics consideration of esterification reaction on nano ceria decorated SAPO 34.
