 Developing bioresourced epoxy resin with excellent flame retardancy is challenging for satisfying environmental and fire hazard requirements . Herein a novel monomer with six functional epoxy groups was successfully synthesized by combining eugenol with hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene . Using aliphatic diamine as a curing agent a novel epoxy of EHPE D230 was prepared and its properties were systematically evaluated . Compared with commercial epoxy resin EHEP D230 possessed a higher tensile strength and better thermal resistance T

@highlight An epoxy monomer based on eugenol and cyclotriphosphazene was synthesized.
@highlight The resultant thermoset has high strength thermal stability and nonflammability.
@highlight Its unique char makes a contribution to flame retardancy.
