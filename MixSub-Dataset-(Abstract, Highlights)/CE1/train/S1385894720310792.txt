 Nanofiltration has been recognized as a cost effective membrane technology for wastewater reclamation while little information is available about its performance in pilot scale for practical engineering application . In addition the biofouling issue is always a barrier to membrane process for its long term stable operation which requires further investigations . In this study the performance of a pilot scale two stage NF system was continually monitored for three months . The membrane autopsy characterization was conducted when the irreversible membrane fouling occurred . The rejections of COD TOC and TP by NF were 96.51.2 91.91.9 and 97.72.1 respectively . A total of 23 emerging contaminants have been detected in NF influent including 19 pharmaceuticals and personal care products and four environmental estrogens . Except for bisphenol A and ibuprofen the rejections of other 21 emerging contaminants were all higher than 80 by the NF system . Microbial community structure analysis showed that

@highlight Performance of a pilot scale NF system for actual engineering application was studied.
@highlight NF system showed more than 80 rejections to 21 emerging contaminants.
@highlight Abundance and distribution of microbial community structures differed between the two stages.
@highlight was an extremely stubborn genus on the membrane surface.
