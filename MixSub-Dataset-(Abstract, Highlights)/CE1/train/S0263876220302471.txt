 Protecting the environment is important for its impact on the life of humans and organisms . Oil pollution is one of the most important factors affecting the life of creatures . Here we are looking for the way to magnetize oil contamination by modified sawdust . The iron oxide nanoparticles were coated in situ on the sawdust using co precipitation method which magnetized the sawdust . Subsequently the magnetic sawdust was successfully functionalized with a saline coupling agent to form a highly hydrophobic and oleophilic surface . FE SEM FTIR EDXA VSM WCA and optical microscopy were performed to complete characterization of the products . In addition a new magnetorheological fluid based on the crude oil and magnetized sawdust was developed and its rheological properties studied by a rheometer furnished with a magnetic field generator . The results were completely fitted using Bingham model . The strong MR response induced in the crude oil by adding the modified sawdust could exhibit a high crude oil removal capacity of about 47 times the modified sawdust weight .
