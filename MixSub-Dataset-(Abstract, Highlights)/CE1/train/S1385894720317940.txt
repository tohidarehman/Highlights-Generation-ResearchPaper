 Natural materials have enlightened us to assemble brittle building blocks into specific architectures with both high strength and toughness . As the main inorganic component of the bone and tooth hydroxyapatite materials have a high biocompatibility but usually have a high brittleness . It is still a big challenge to artificially prepare biomaterials with the combination of high strength and high toughness similar to natural materials constructed with brittle HAP building blocks . In this work considering that enamel and nacre are typical examples of natural biomaterials with high strength and high toughness respectively we combine the structural merits of both enamel and nacre to construct a new kind of highly ordered ultralong HAP nanowire fiberboard and mortar alignment hierarchical structure by the multiscale and multilevel assemblies of ultralong HAP nanowires from the nanoscale to microscale to macroscale and from one dimensional to 2 D to 3 D levels . The as prepared hierarchical HFMAS nanocomposite can achieve a confluence of strengthening and toughening mechanisms of enamel and nacre and exhibits superior mechanical properties such as high strength Young s modulus and toughness 4.77MPam
