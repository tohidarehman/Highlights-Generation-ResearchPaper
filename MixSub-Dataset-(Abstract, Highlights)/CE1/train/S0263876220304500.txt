 Three cascade processes for the simultaneous production of hydrogen and carbon nanotubes were designed about the catalytic decomposition of methane overcoming the conflicting requirements of carbon generation transfer and deposition rate for the generation of hydrogen and CNTs . NiFeAl and FeMg were selected as catalysts for the generation of hydrogen and CNTs respectively . In individual testing the hydrogen yield of CDM with NiFeAl reached 55 . However with FeMg the CNTs yield reached 0.95 g g

@highlight Hydrogen in feed was conducive for methane decomposition.
@highlight Three cascade processes were conducted producing hydrogen and CNTs.
@highlight The highest hydrogen yield was 86 of the best cascade process.
@highlight The yield of CNTs was 1.71 and 2.63 g gcat with R 3.25 and 2.95.
