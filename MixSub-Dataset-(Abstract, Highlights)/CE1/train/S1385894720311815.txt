 In this work we synthesized highly porous reduced graphene oxide foams presenting augmented antibacterial activity in presence absence of peroxymonosulfate . To date this is the first investigation of photocatalytic PMS disinfection by 3D rGO materials . The foams were prepared through hydrothermal and solvothermal method and analyzed by SEM PXRD FTIR Raman spectroscopy and BET . Hydrothermally synthesized aerogels were better organized and had higher specific surface area . The higher ratio of I

@highlight Visible light catalytic activation of PMS by 3D rGO materials was investigated.
@highlight The degree of functionalities in the aerogels affects the photo catalytic disinfection.
@highlight inactivation was achieved under visible light exposure via radical and non radical pathways.
@highlight Addition of PMS brought 5 fold increase on
@highlight inactivation under visible light.
@highlight The shift in inactivation mechanisms were determined using scavenging experiments.
