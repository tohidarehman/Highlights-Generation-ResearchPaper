 Ion exchange is a promising technology to remove hexavalent chromium Cr and nitrate from groundwater however its wide application is challenged by a costly disposal of spent brine . This study developed a novel photochemical process utilizing reductive carbon centered radicals to remove Cr and nitrate in IX spent brine . In the presence of formate or alcohol additives photolysis of nitrate in spent brine generated highly reductive carbon centered radicals including CO

@highlight Carbon centered radicals was utilized to reduce Cr VI and nitrate in IX spent brine.
@highlight Formate radical CO
@highlight exhibited superior performance for Cr VI removal.
@highlight Increasing formate dosage and decreasing pH enhanced Cr VI reduction.
@highlight High levels of chloride scavenged HO and inhibited Cr VI removal.
@highlight Complete removal of total dissolved chromium and nitrogen was achieved.
