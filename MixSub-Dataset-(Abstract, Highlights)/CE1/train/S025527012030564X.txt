 Sound field assisted fluidized bed is a promising approach to regulate particle behaviors in gas solid two phase flows . In this study an acoustic model was built and coupled with Euler Euler two fluid model to study macroscopic and microscopic flow characteristics of Geldart A particles . The influence of acoustic frequencies and sound pressure levels on particle behavior was analyzed . The sound field has little influence on the macroscopic flow characteristics of the particles but a significant influence on the microscopic characteristics . With the increasing acoustic frequencies and sound pressure levels the bubble granular temperature at the top of the fluidized bed decreases and the periodicity of it is becoming irregular . Particle granular temperature increases with the increasing acoustic frequencies and sound pressure levels . In the near wall region the sound field affected the particles to a smaller extent . This study provides a reference for exploring the sound field regulation of particles and bubble behaviors .

@highlight A two fluid model with sound field was established.
@highlight The sound field enhances the frequency of interparticle collisions.
@highlight The sound field strengthens the momentum exchange between gas and solid.
