 Flexible energy storage technologies that can be conformal with deformation as well as maintain their electrochemical functions is consistently and significantly considered . Therefore reinforcing the connection between active materials and supports is particularly pivotal . In this work as a flexible support Ar plasma treated carbon cloth combines with monoaminophthalocyanine Pc NH

@highlight Carbon fibers was modified by monoaminophthalocyanine covalently for electrode.
@highlight The electrode achieves high energy density and cycling stability simultaneously.
@highlight Multiple bending has little effect on electrochemical performance.
