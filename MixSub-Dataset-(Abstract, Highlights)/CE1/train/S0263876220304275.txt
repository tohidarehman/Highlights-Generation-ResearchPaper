 Hydrothermal Liquefaction is a moderate temperature high pressure depolymerisation process that converts organics in wet biomass into crude like oil . HTL feedstock properties and characteristics will influence the conversion of organics into crude like oil and other by products . The aim of the investigation is to quantify specific feedstock parameters to determine optimal feedstock properties for converting biosolids into crude like oil . The properties of the feedstock which included moisture content ash content particle density bulk density porosity and particle size were analytically determined which are useful data for reactor design . The data presented in this study analyses the behaviour of biosolids using batch settling experiments and pumping studies . The influence of particle size and solid concentration of biosolid slurries on the processability in terms of stability and pumpability of the feedstock slurry was assessed . Biosolid slurries with 60 w w dry solids were determined to be the minimum solid concentration that demonstrated no visible settling characteristics within an observation period of 30 min . Pumpability was achieved with slurries between 30 w w to 60 w w dry biosolids using a laboratory scale peristaltic pump . Pumping power required to transport biosolid slurries increased exponentially with an increase in solid concentration .

@highlight Biosolid particles settle within minutes.
@highlight Slurries with higher solid loading are pumpable during hydrothermal liquefaction.
@highlight Settling characteristics of biosolids can lead to pump and pipe blockage.
@highlight Pumping power requirement increases with solid concentration.
