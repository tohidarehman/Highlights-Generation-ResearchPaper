 MXenes have very recently emerged as an intriguing family of graphene like two dimensional layer structured transition metal carbides and or nitrides with a high specific surface area a large interlayer spacing hydrophilicity and abundant highly active surface sites and they have found a niche in environmental remediation as materials capable of efficiently removing and sequestering heavy metals dyes and radioactive nuclides . With exceptional surface tunable chemical compatibility and compositional flexibility MXenes are resistant to radiation induced damage and show high chemical compatibility and excellent thermal stability . They are thought to have the potential to serve as ideal adsorbents for a plethora of radionuclides such as uranium
