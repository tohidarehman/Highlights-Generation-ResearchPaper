 The depletion of fossil chemicals and energy sources led to develop processes allowing the conversion of renewable feedstocks into useful products . Bioethanol production is a typical case of biomass conversion into chemical species with attractive uses such as fuel fuel additives or chemical intermediates .

@highlight Highly selective photooxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde and acetic acid in water.
@highlight Effect of starting Cu concentration on acetaldehyde production.
@highlight Easy
@highlight photocatalyst regeneration through zerovalent copper reoxidation.
@highlight Careful flammability analysis of the ternary gaseous mixtures after Cu reoxidation.
@highlight Feasible process flow sheet for large scale implementations.
