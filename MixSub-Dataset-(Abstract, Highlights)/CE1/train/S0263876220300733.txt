 Calcium carbonate scale is a problem in many industrial and domestic processes as it precipitates from solution to form a hard deposit which grows on equipment surfaces . The potential for scale formation and aggregation is present whenever a solution becomes supersaturated . Scale formation and prevention creates a considerable capital operation and maintenance problem . Achieving effective and economical scale control and removal is consequently a major concern for efficient and safe industrial operations . To prevent such potential problems it is important to understand the mechanism of the calcium carbonate scaling process .

@highlight Laser technique can determine the start of calcium carbonate formation.
@highlight Laser technique can provide a real time measurements of the growth of crystals.
@highlight Laser technique has proven to be a sensitive method for monitoring the initial stage of process.
@highlight The effect of concentration and temperature on precipitation can be determined inline.
