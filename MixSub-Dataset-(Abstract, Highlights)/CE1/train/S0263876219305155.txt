 Mixing is a ubiquitous operation in process engineering . It is not only used for combining materials but also for promoting heat and mass transfer increasing aeration suspending solids and modifying material structure . Measurement techniques have the potential to optimise industrial mixing processes and improve product quality by monitoring critical process parameters . Real time sensing techniques that do not require manual material sampling are of particular interest owing to their automatic data acquisition capability . This makes them suitable for use in control systems for process automation and eventually as connected sensors in Industry 4.0 . This review article focuses on these measurement techniques defined as in and on line along with their capability for implementation in industrial processes . The applications reviewed include liquidliquid gasliquid solidliquid solidgasliquid in addition to solids blending . A technique selection section discussing the decision making process when choosing a sensor and a summary table including the advantages disadvantages applications and limitations of each technique are provided . The article concludes by discussing the future of monitoring techniques for mixing processes .
