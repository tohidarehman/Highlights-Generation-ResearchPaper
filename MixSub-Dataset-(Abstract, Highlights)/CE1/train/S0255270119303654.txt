 Stresses and formation of voids are the main origins of pinholes in palladium composite membranes at high temperatures . The stresses are associated with the Pd layer substrate interaction and the formation of the voids is due to the gas bubble trapped inside the deposits . Pd embedded polyethylene glycol was used during the activation step of the electroless plating method . Also multiple plating and annealing steps were employed to suppress void formation . Three plating and annealing steps rendered the prepared Pd membrane quite dense and defect free . The surface roughness of modified support was found to play a crucial role in the stability of the Pd membrane . The resulting membrane showed an infinite selectivity for H

@highlight High stable palladium composite membrane was synthesized for hydrogen purification.
@highlight Pd nanoparticles embedded in PEG was applied in activation step for the first time.
@highlight Small gap between Pd layer and modified support was formed by the applied method.
@highlight Relative roughness caused a mechanical interlocking to improve membrane stability.
