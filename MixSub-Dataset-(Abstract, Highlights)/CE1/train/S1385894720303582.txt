 Arsenic is one of the highly dangerous metalloid present in the polluted water its effective and economical removal is one of the major challenges to the researchers . It was planned to prepare hollow fiber membranes using polyphenylsulfone as a polymer cellulose acetate and cellulose acetate phthalate as additives with increased dosages of zirconium oxide ZrO

@highlight PPSU CA ZrO
@highlight and PPSU CAP ZrO
@highlight hollow fiber membranes were fabricated using phase inversion method.
@highlight Membrane performance was improved by incremental dosages of ZrO
@highlight nanoparticle.
@highlight Prepared membranes exhibited enhanced antifouling and arsenic removal tendency.
@highlight PPSU CA ZrO
@highlight membrane demonstrated effective arsenic removal from aqueous solution.
