 This study developed a new method that involved autocatalytic hydrolysis of soybean oil using microwave irradiation for fatty acid production . To enhance the conversion yield a surfactant and fatty acid were added to the reaction mixture . The oil hydrolysis using microwave irradiation had 96.6 conversion yield within a reaction time of 4 h at 195 C. Furthermore this study established a model for describing the kinetics of oil hydrolysis performed using traditional heating and microwave irradiation under different reaction conditions . The model exhibited a good fit to the data R
