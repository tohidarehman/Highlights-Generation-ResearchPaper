 A novel multi functional sensor was fabricated with multi layer and internal 3D network structure via two step assembly that mimicked the natural hierarchical skin model . The collagen aggregates derived from chromium containing waste leather were used as the substrate while polyaniline acidified multi walled carbon nanotube composites were employed as the conductive materials . The multi functional flexible sensor was assembled resulting in multi dimensional recognition ability 5.2 bending and twisting strains fast response and broad dynamic response range . Notably the multi functional sensor had superior sensing performance to humidity and comfortable wearing performance . Owing to these merits the fabricated sensor with multi functionality and intelligence can potentially act as the artificial skin for robot hand to detect weak pressure and humidity changes displaying great promise for applications in the fields of real time health monitoring biomedical and intelligent robots .
