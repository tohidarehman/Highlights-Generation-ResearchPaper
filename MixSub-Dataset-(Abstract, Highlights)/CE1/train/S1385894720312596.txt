 Ultrathin 2D carbon nitride sheets are potential materials for solar energy conversion . However these ultrathin sheets usually suffer from a wider bandgap of 3.06eV and thus nothing but ultraviolet range absorption . Here we realized that red CNs has a narrower bandgap of 2.05eV with a strong band to band visible light absorption band by fluorination of atomic CNs followed by thermal defluorination . Theoretical calculation results indicate that a defect band arises near the conduction band minimum after F DF resulting in a downward shift of the CBM and the band structures are highly associated with the spatial distribution of defects in ultrathin 2D CNs . Furthermore we confirm that such visible light absorption band of red CNs can enable the number of photons to harvest a larger portion of solar spectrum and suppress the rapid recombination of the photogenerated carriers . Consequently the red CNs sensitized TiO
