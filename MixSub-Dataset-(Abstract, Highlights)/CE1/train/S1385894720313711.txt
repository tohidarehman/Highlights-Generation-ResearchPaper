 The micro structured catalytic converter which has proven to be 5 times more efficient than packed bed reactors for the total oxidation of residual methane opens the door for a new line of catalytic converters that will be smaller cheaper and more durable than traditional catalytic converters .

@highlight A new line of convertors is underpinned by the micro structured catalytic convertor.
@highlight Large S V ratio of support makes the deposition on non precious catalysts feasible.
@highlight Methane conversion under real conditions was 5 times larger than that of a PBR.
@highlight Catalyst was active within the exhaust temperature range of natural gas turbines.
@highlight Catalyst was stable at 450C in the presence of SO
@highlight  5 ppmV and H
@highlight O 10 vol .
