 Several single dose studies found that biochar was an effective additive promoting methanogenesis in anaerobic digestion . However little attention was paid to the continuity of the biofilm formed on biochar and the subsequent evolution of microorganisms . In this study the continuous performance and changes were quantified when biochar biofilm consortia were applied as the recyclable inoculant to four cycles of acetate methanogenesis with increasing acetate loading . Biochar biofilm consortia as the inoculant were found to consistently realize stable methane production despite the removal of planktonic microorganisms in the reactor and no extra inoculum and biochar were added . Consortia with biochar particles smaller than 5m promoted initiation of methanogenesis more rapidly than those with biochar particles larger than 1mm especially when the activity of microorganism was low . Moreover the microorganisms were enriched throughout the continuous cycles . Biochar 5m was found to accumulate 6.67.1 E 11 16S copies per gram in the 3rd and 4th cycles which was about 2751 times that of biochar 1mm and also comparable to a fresh sludge inoculum . In addition specific functional methanogens proliferated during continuous application .

@highlight Recycled biochar biofilm consortia demonstrated feasible long term application in AD.
@highlight Biochar 5m more efficiently initiated methanogenesis than biochar 1mm.
@highlight Biochar 5m enriched 20 times more microorganisms than larger biochar.
@highlight dominated in biochar 1mm while SAOB dominated in biochar 5m.
