 Mercury removal is a hot topic in environments . The present work investigated the adsorption of Hg species on the surfaces of CuS which performs excellently in experiments as adsorbents for mercury removal with the dispersion corrected density functional theory . In this work a pair of asymmetric surfaces marked as

@highlight A pair of asymmetric surfaces are selected to present CuS 001 surfaces.
@highlight Three channels for HCl affecting Hg adsorption on CuS 001 surfaces are discussed.
@highlight Making Vacancies on slab1 strengthen adsorption between Hg and surfaces but the situation is different for slab2.
