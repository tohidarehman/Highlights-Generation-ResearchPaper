 Zeolitic imidazolate framework derived carbons have been considered promising catalysts for the degradation of organics in water through peroxymonosulfate based oxidation processes . The construction of hierarchical hollow porous structures while retaining the properties of ZIF derived carbons is highly desirable for a catalyst but remains an arduous challenge . Herein ZIF 67

@highlight Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks derived carbon with hollow structure was synthesized.
@highlight The hollow carbon exhibits high activity in catalytic ozonation of 4 nitrophenol.
@highlight The carbon can be easily separated from the solution and has good reusability.
@highlight Factors that affect 4 nitrophenol degradation are examined.
@highlight SO
@highlight is the main reactive species participating in 4 nitrophenol degradation.
