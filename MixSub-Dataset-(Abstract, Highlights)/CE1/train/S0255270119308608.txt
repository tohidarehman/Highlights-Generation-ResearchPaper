 A batch process with a dispersed solid photocatalyst requires a large reactor and unit process for catalyst recovery increasing the treatment cost . Structured supported photocatalysts enable the use of continuous compact reactors that are photoactivated by solar energy and promote process intensification . In the present work TiO

@highlight Monolithic systems are a promising technology for textile dye degradation.
@highlight The PVA increased the visible light absorption leading to greater dye degradation.
@highlight The films showed homogeneous overlay and good stability after 5 cycles of use.
@highlight Total organic carbon TOC conversion increases with increasing irradiated area.
