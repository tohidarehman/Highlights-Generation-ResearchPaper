 In this work we report the pioneering gas phase conversion of glycerol into glycidol in one step over CsZSM 5 zeolite catalyst with SiO

@highlight Glycidol was first time synthesized by green one step way from glycerol in the gas phase.
@highlight 20wt Cs HZSM 5 1500 catalyst showed promising results in the glycidol production.
@highlight The highest glycidol yield achieved was 40.4mol at 86.3mol glycerol conversion.
@highlight A correlation between the catalytic activity and the total basicity was found.
@highlight A reaction scheme was proposed for the glycidol production.
