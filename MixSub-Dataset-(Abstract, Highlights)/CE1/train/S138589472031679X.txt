 In this work an effective and facile extrusion based mixing and coating process for the manufacturing of electrodes for Li ion batteries is proposed . Following the development of appropriate pastes and basic rheological investigations promising formulations are dispersed continuously in a twin screw extruder and directly coated on a current collector foil using the example of LiNi

@highlight Extrusion based coating is promising for the fabrication of Li ion batteries.
@highlight Improved homogeneity and negligible binder migration during fast drying procedures.
@highlight Significantly reduced energy and materials demands leading to lower costs.
@highlight Extended the process window for electrode design parameters.
