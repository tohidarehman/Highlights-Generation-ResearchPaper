 The current study is conducted to prepare electro conductive hydrogels with optimized component ratios to explore the effect of reduced graphene oxide as an emerging nanomaterial on strengthening capabilities of the prepared hydrogel . Acrylamide copolymerized with acrylic acid and grafted to carboxymethyl cellulose is fabricated through free radical polymerization . The results indicate that adding rGO yields 98.27 decrease in equilibrium swelling ratio to 1.77

@highlight AM and AA monomers were grafted with CMC to form a dual network hydrogel.
@highlight Incorporation of rGO within the hydrogel structure resulted in conductive hydrogels.
@highlight Swelling morphology rheology thermal stability and conductivity were studied.
@highlight Incorporating rGO enhanced thermal stability and mechanical strength of hydrogel.
@highlight rGo hydrogel represented controlled swelling while preserving high viscoelasticity.
