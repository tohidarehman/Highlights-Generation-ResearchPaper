 The pollution of tetracyclines in waters has caused public concern and scientific interest . This study investigates the effect of low level hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ion concentrations on the UV treatment of four TCs oxytetracycline tetracycline chlorotetracycline and doxycycline . The optimum addition of Fe and H
