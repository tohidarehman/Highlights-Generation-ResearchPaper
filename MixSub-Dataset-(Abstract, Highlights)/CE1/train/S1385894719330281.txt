 Lithium nitrate has been highlighted as a high temperature phase change material with the melting temperature of 256C for the applications of thermal energy storage . However low thermal conductivity and corrosive property of lithium nitrate needs to be improved for wide applications . This report experimentally investigates thermal properties of a phase change composite consisting of lithium nitrate and porous copper oxide nanowires integrated on folded meshes . Specifically porous copper oxide nanowires vertically aligned on the folded copper meshes with desired shapes are synthesized by carrying out chemical solution growth and subsequent heat treatment . Then lithium nitrate is infiltrated in the network of the thermal conductive fillers under vacuum conditions . Our platform can provide a flexible geometrical configuration to enhance thermal performance by modifying the folded geometries to the target objects . As a result the fabricated phase change composites with 7vol of filling materials exhibit the 6.7 times higher thermal conductivities than pure lithium nitrate showing the excellent thermal transport by the fillers in the composite . Moreover the porous copper oxide nanowires exhibit excellent anti corrosive properties to lithium nitrate for stable operation under repeated phase change processes . Finally the phase change composite heat storages exhibit the 1.3 times faster thermal charging and discharging characteristics than pure lithium nitrate ones .
