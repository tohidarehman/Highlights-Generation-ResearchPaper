 Nonradical reactions induced by nanocarbon driven peroxydisulfate activation recently emerge a promising strategy of groundwater remediation or wastewater treatment whereas the involved reaction pathways remain controversial . We here investigate and differentiate the two representative nonradical mechanisms of PDS activation on graphene like nanosheets . The template induced GNS exhibited a high porosity of over 1200m

@highlight GNS showed the superior activity of persulfate activation by nonradical behavior.
@highlight Kinetic rate of GNS was 217 folds higher than the popular activators.
@highlight Singlet oxygen 
@highlight  only contributed 0.0046 to the overall degradation.
@highlight Surface confined electron transfer on GNS was the dominated nonradical mechanism.
@highlight Ka induced adsorption rather than partition controlled nonradical oxidation.
