 The development of general strategies for efficiently loading drugs with distinct physicochemical properties for example hydrophilicity lipophilicity and hydrophobicity is currently a great challenge in the field of drug delivery . In this work a poly nanoparticle with reversible hydrophilic to hydrophobic property was first prepared . Owing to the switchable property of the PNIPAAm particles all the water soluble lipo soluble and poorly soluble drugs could be successfully loaded in the PNIPAAm particles . Then these drug loaded PNIPAAm nanoparticles could be introduced into electronspun fibrous as a medical scaffold . Another advantage of such two stage drug loading strategy is that an extended release of the loaded drug would be achieved . We also found that the preparation of this nano in micro system also showed negligible effects on the drug loading ratio and drug activity probably due to the mid and efficient nature of this approach . Moreover the nano in micro scaffold exhibits excellent drug release characteristics such as a slow and persistent drug delivery for up to 4months . A preclinical application of this 20S Ginsenoside Rg3 loaded nano in micro scaffold showed a pronounced hypertrophic scar inhibitory effect in both early stage and later stage of HS formation . In short the nano in micro scaffold with reversible hydrophilic to hydrophobic property in the drug loaded nanoparticles would provide a facile effective and general strategy to fabricate diverse drug delivery system with long term release .
