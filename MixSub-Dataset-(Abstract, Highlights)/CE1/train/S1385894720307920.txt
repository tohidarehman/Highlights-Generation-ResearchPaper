 Microbial sulphur cycle is of great importance to anaerobic degradation of organic pollutants coupled with metal reduction which however is usually limited by the poor oxidation of the elemental sulphur to sulphate due to the lack of chemolithotrophic sulphur oxidizing bacteria . The study presented here utilized magnetite as an Fe source to enrich the chemolithotrophic sulphur oxidizing bacteria to proceed the oxidation of the elemental sulphur which further achieved the whole sulphur cycle . The results showed that under the low concentration sulphate conditions the effluent concentration of both Cr and phenol in the reactor with magnetite was significantly lower than that without magnetite . Energy dispersive X ray analysis showed that the content of sulphur in the aggregates without magnetite was lower than that with magnetite . Conversely with magnetite the special enrichments

@highlight was cultivated in the presence of magnetite as an Fe III source.
@highlight proceeded the oxidation of the elemental sulphur to sulphate.
@highlight Phenol degradation coupled with Cr VI reduction were simultaneously achieved.
@highlight Fe II reacted with residual oxygen in feedstocks to reduce re oxidation of Cr III .
@highlight Microbial sulfur cycle was proceeded via Fe III Fe II transformation.
