 A light emitting diode driven UV chlorine process was adopted to eliminate acetaminophen at three wavelengths . Our results showed that AAP was eliminated efficiently during UV LED chlorine process at three wavelengths and the AAP degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics . The pseudo first order rate constants

@highlight AAP degradation was affected by UV wavelengths during UV LED chlorine process.
@highlight RCS and chlorination mainly contributed to the degradation of AAP.
@highlight Factors affecting the roles of reactive species were studied at three wavelengths.
@highlight Intermediates were identified during UV LED chlorine process.
@highlight The acute toxicity can be better decreased during UV LED
@highlight  chlorine process.
