 Bubble dynamics and luminol emissions of cavitation in sub millimeter sized perfluoroalkoxy alkane flow tubes submerged in an ultrasonic bath reactor are studied at 27.2 kHz driving frequency . Nucleation of cavitation inside the tubes only takes place via a free interface realized here in form of an alternating water air slug flow . High speed recordings show that cavitation bubbles in the water slugs often develop localized structures in form of clusters or bubble plugs and that such structures can be seeded via a single pinch off from the free interface . Within the structures bubbles strongly interact and frequently undergo merging or splitting events . Due to the mutual interaction and resulting motion bubbles often collapse with a fast displacement suggesting jetting dynamics . Bubble compression ratios are estimated on basis of observed individual bubble dynamics and numerical fitting by a single bubble model that takes the tube wall into account . The resulting peak temperatures around 3500 K allow for dissociation of water vapor . This is in accordance with observed sonochemiluminescence from luminol originating from active bubble zones in the tubes .
