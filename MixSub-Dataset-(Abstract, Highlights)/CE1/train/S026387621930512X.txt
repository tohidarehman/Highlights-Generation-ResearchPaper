 Glucaric acid is being used increasingly as a food additive corrosion inhibitor in deicing and in detergents and is also a potential starting material for the production of adipic acid the key monomer for nylon 66 . This work describes a techno economic analysis of a potential bio based process for the production of pure glucaric acid from corn stover . Two alternative routes for oxidation of glucose to glucaric acid are considered via heterogeneous catalytic oxidation with air and by homogeneous glucose oxidation using nitric acid . Techno economic and lifecycle assessments are made for both oxidation routes and cover the entire process from biomass to pure crystalline glucaric acid that can be used as a starting material for the production of valuable chemicals . This is the first TEA of pure glucaric acid production incorporating ion exchange and azeotropic evaporation below 50

@highlight Techno economic and life cycle assessments for transformation of bio renewable feedstock to glucaric acid.
@highlight Heterogeneous Pt catalysis and nitric acid glucose oxidation are evaluated.
@highlight Glucaric acid is obtained from glucarate salt without lactone formation by ion exchange and azeotropic evaporation.
