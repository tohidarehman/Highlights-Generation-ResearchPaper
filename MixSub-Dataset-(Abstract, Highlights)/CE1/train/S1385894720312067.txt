 Photon upconversion of perovskite nanocrystals is an attractive topic and has been recently realized in colloidal solution . However this scheme suffers from system instability owing to the easy decomposition of PeNCs which will greatly limit their applications . This work reports the achievement of radiative energy transfer UC of glass stabilized CsPbX

@highlight NIR laser triggered UC emissions in glass stabilized CsPbX
@highlight perovskites are realized.
@highlight The UC mechanism is radiative energy transfer from Tm KYb
@highlight to CsPbX
@highlight Tunable DS UC combined luminescence is demonstrated via tailoring halogens in glass and selecting diverse excitation modes.
@highlight Visualized anti counterfeits using screen printable CsPbX
@highlight inks are practically applicable.
@highlight The luminescence of anti counterfeiting patterns is well retained after storing in water for 30days.
