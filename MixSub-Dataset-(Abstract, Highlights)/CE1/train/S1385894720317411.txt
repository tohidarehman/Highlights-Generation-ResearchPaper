 Current practice for C phycocyanin extraction from fresh biomass is greatly perishable so dried biomass is preferable for longer storage life and saving spaces for small scale industries . However the resistance of dried biomass towards cell disruption is higher compared to fresh biomass . Therefore this work aims to develop an effective technique for the extraction of CPC from dried
