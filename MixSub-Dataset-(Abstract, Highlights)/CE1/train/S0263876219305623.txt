 We examined the ultrafiltration adsoprtive membrane manufacturing and its modification with the porous organic polymer adsorbent using layer by layer technology to removal of nickel and lead heavy metals in the present study . We used the one step FriedelCrafts reaction coupled with dimethyl acetal formaldehyde cross linker and iron chloride catalyst for the synthesis of the POP adsorbent . We also used an amino monomer to functionalize this type of polymer which improved and modified the synthesized polymer for the better removal of heavy metals . The adsorbents and membranes prepared were analyzed and examined by various analytical d evices such as BET FESEM EDX FTIR AFM and the contact angle testing . In addition the performance of the synthesized adsorption membrane was examined in the static adsorption system and membrane filtration to removal of the Ni and Pb metal ions . In the batch adsorption studies the percentages of removal of nickel and lead metals for modified adsorption membrane with the adsorbent POP NH2 were obtained at ambient temperature and the initial concentration of 20
