 Biochar is considered to be the cost effective environmentally friendly and sustainable sorbent that has an extraordinary potential to efficiently remove toxic elements including arsenic from water . Until now no review has focused to understand various important and intriguing aspects on biochar use as a sorbent for As removal from water either pristine or modified . This review discusses various factors governing As removal potential of biochars sequestration mechanisms fate of sorbed As on biochar and the redox mediated interactions between biochar and As . The significance of biochar derived materials for the treatment of As contaminated drinking water wastewater and their potential regeneration ability is also critically discussed which has not been previously elaborated . This comprehensive review article could be greatly valuable for scientists policymakers water treatment industries environmentalists and graduate students who are involved in biochar As research . The review covers some new overarching and key scientific opportunities for the remediation of As contaminated water using biochar based materials which is a potential health risk to millions of people worldwide .
