 The current work focuses on synthesis of Pd C catalyst initially based on formaldehyde reduction approach followed by detailed investigation into intensification of catalytic transfer hydrogenation using ultrasound using the synthesized catalyst . The obtained catalyst was characterized by X ray diffraction BET surface analysis and FT IR . The XRD characteristic peaks of palladium at 2 angle of 39.5 and 68.1 coupled with a decrease in BET surface area for the obtained catalyst compared to activated carbon confirmed proper metal loading over activated carbon . The subsequent part of the work focused on understanding the effect of different operating parameters in CTH of corn oil to maximize the progress of reaction . Under the established best conditions of ultrasonic power as 120 W frequency of 24 kHz 60 C 600 rpm 2 w w as loading of catalyst 50 mL as quantum of water maximum reduction in the iodine value was obtained from initial of 124.46 g 100 g of corn oil to 93.61 g 100 g of corn oil . Comparison of the obtained results for ultrasound assisted approach with conventional approach also allowed demonstrating the process intensification aspects of applying ultrasound for catalytic transfer hydrogenation of corn oil .
