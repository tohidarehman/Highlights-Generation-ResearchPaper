 In this work a hydrophobically modified cationic polyacrylamide flocculant was polymerized by short wave ultraviolet initiation with acrylamide acryloyloxyethyl trimethylammonium chloride and coconut diethanolamide as monomers to enhance the destabilization and separation efficiency of emulsified oil and particles colloids from metalworking fluids wastewater . The parameters for flocculant polymerization were optimized and the features of UVC initiated polymerization were studied . Moreover the structural and morphological characteristics of the polymers were explored and the flocculation performance of CPAC in MWFs treatment was evaluated . The characterization results suggested that flocculants with a multilayer loose sheet morphology and intrinsic viscosity of 11.32

@highlight Organic flocculant was used to treat metalworking wastewater for the first time.
@highlight Hydrophobic modified flocculant was polymerized through UVC initiation polymerization.
@highlight UVC initiation showed great advantage in polymerization to traditional UV initiation.
@highlight Hydrophobic block in flocculant facilitated the adsorption of nonpolar oil colloids.
