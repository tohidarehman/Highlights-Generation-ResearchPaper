 To study two phase flow splitting at a T junction Parallel vertical riser pipelines were set up in the laboratory . Each of these pipelines was completely symmetrical . The experiment was conducted with various combinations of gas velocity and liquid velocities . Accurate measurement of gas liquid two phase flow were performed to determine whether the two phase flow was evenly distributed in the two riser pipelines . The conductance probe technique was used to measure the average liquid holdup in the cross section of the pipe . Three flow patterns in two risers were observed during the experiment slug slug churn churn and churn slug churn . Gas liquid flow of S S and C SC is asymmetric while that in C C is symmetric . When the flow state in the two risers is S S the gas liquid two phase split could be uneven . When the gas and liquid velocities were sufficiently high for sustaining C C the gas and liquid were split evenly . The last state was the transition state between S S and C SC . A model based on pressure minimization was established to predict two phase flow splitting . The measured and predicted flow splits were observed to be in agreement .
