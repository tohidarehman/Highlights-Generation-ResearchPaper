 Phosphorus has been regarded as one of promising anodic materials for Li and Na ion batteries owing to the merits of high theoretical specific capacity and natural abundance . Nevertheless its practical applications suffer from huge volumetric change during cycling and low electronic conductivity with the result of fast capacity decay and low Coulombic efficiency . To be noted that amorphous red P is universally used as the SIB anodic material in most of the reported works . Herein we successfully construct crystalline red P nanorods confined within 3D rGA architecture composite

@highlight The rational design strategy of crystalline RP rGA architecture was developed.
@highlight The crystalline RP rGA electrode exhibits high inicial CE with a 75.9 P loading.
@highlight The sodium storage mechanism of the crystalline RP rGA electrode have been revealed.
