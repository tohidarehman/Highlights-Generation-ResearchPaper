 Downer reactor has been widely used in carrying out multiphase processes in the recent decade . The nature and introduction of particles in the downer has its own characteristics to achieve uniform and well dispersed flow . This creates a necessity to design a distributor for achieving uniform dispersion of particles in a short distance . The present study explores the use of CFD with different distributor configurations to design an effective distributor for dispersion of ultrafine cohesive particles . In the present study the ultrafine cohesive powder considered is petcoke of mean particle size 60 m and estimated Carrs index of 30.83 . The downer reactor is of 200 mm diameter and 8 m long . The solid particles are fed through a screw feeder above gas distributor . Different distributor designs are considered for assessing the dispersion using Fluent ANSYS v19.0 . The results from the investigation indicate that there is a strong influence of jet velocities and pressure distribution in the distributor on dispersion of cohesive particles . The present study highlights the use of CFD in numerical experimentation in identifying the appropriate designs suitable for cohesive ultrafine particulate systems .

@highlight Numerical Experimentation of CFD simulation is adapted in design of distributor.
@highlight Distributor configurations used are focused to disperse cohesive fine particulates.
@highlight Dispersion effectiveness is described as zero radial solid concentration gradient.
@highlight Optimal configuration accomplished a highly intensified dispersion in a short distance.
