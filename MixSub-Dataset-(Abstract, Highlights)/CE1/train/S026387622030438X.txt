 An analysis of different operating points during the evaporation of a subcooled feed in a wiped film evaporator allows a conceptual segmental assessment distinction and quantification of various wetting behaviors and heat transfer situations during the liquid film flow . In detail single phase heating evaporation from a fully covered surface and evaporation from a partly covered surface may be distinguished . For each section the wetting situation is extracted . This knowledge is essential for operating wiped film evaporators within a suitable and appropriate range to prevent e.g . product damage . The experiments were conducted at a stainless steel and steam heated wiped film evaporator with a spring loaded inclined comb wiper system and monoethylene glycole as evaporation fluid . Process pressure wiper type and rotational velocity were kept constant . Variations of feed rate and driving temperature difference mark out the characteristic operating points . In case of sufficient wetting of the evaporation surface overall heat transfer coefficients of 1800 W are reached . By decreasing feed rate and assessing the achieved distillate rate minimum sump loads can be derived for a given driving temperature difference . This quantifies the position of film break up leading to a partly covered heat transfer surface . Active heat transfer areas are extracted from the experimental data and quantified to get a more precise view on suitable process conditions of WFE and its principal operation .
