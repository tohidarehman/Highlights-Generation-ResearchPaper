 Treatment and disposal of sewage sludge constitute one of the major problems of wastewater treatment plants due to high water content and more stringent environmental regulations . Supercritical water gasification technology is accepted as a promising method for sustainable sludge disposal because of the elimination of need for costly water reduction and drying processes before disposal by conventional methods . The aim of this study is to determine the effect of temperature solid matter content and catalyst addition on supercritical gasification of sewage sludge in a continuous flow pilot scale tubular reactor . The results indicate that the gasification efficiency is generally temperature dependent . Furthermore catalyst addition improves the gasification efficiency at high solids content . The produced gas contains 60 of H

@highlight The pilot scale continuous flow tubular reactor was designed specially produced.
@highlight Effects of temperature feed concentration and KOH catalyst were studied.
@highlight Temperature sludge concentration and KOH had great effect on the system yield.
@highlight SCWG is a promising and efficient technology for the gasification of wet biomass.
@highlight Unlike conventional gasification methods no hazardous emissions.
