 In this work the environmental performance of the reactive Jet dyeing process and the subsequent wastewater treatment currently carried out in the textile companies is compared with a new system . The developed system combines the application of an electrochemical process with ultraviolet irradiation to remove colour of effluents containing reactive dyes . EC UV system is also able to prepare the discoloured effluents for its subsequent reuse in a new dyeing process .

@highlight New electrochemical UV system to treat and reuse dyeing effluents.
@highlight Evaluation of the environmental impact of reusing water and salt in the dyeing process.
@highlight Modification of the process to increase the sustainability of the textile industry.
