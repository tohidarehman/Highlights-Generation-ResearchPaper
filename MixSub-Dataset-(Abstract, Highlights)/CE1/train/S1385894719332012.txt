 To address the biological or pathological barriers the self propulsion abilities of drug carriers may bring distinct improvements when compared to passive diffusion . In the current study bacteria propelled microtubular rockets are proposed to enhance the extravasation from blood circulation penetration in the tumor matrix and intracellular drug uptake . Microtubes with loaded doxorubicin MT

@highlight Microrocket is constructed by assembly of one bacterium as the bioengine into a microtube.
@highlight Microtubes are fabricated by layer by layer assembly of alginate and chitosan in porous template.
@highlight Bacteria drive the rocket like directional motion of microtubes in both water and viscous media.
@highlight Microrockets enhance the blood tumor tissue extravasation and internalization into tumor cells.
@highlight Demonstrate a novel strategy to combat multiple biological barriers in the drug delivery pathway.
