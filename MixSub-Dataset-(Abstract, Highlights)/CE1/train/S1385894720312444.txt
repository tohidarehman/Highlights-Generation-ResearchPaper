 Wastewater treatment plant is the point source of antibiotic contamination yet the removal of antibiotics from WWTP effluent has not been given necessary attention . In this study subsurface constructed wetlands were used to investigate the removal distribution and biotransformation of sulfonamides and their N

@highlight SCWs can efficiently remove SAs and their Ac SAs from WWTP effluent.
@highlight SAs and Ac SAs can transform into each other and affect their removal in the SCWs.
@highlight Microbial aerobic degradation is the major removal pathway of SAs in the SCWs.
@highlight VF SCWs owning high oxygen transport capacity may promote aerobic process of SAs.
@highlight Plants play a crucial role on temporal spatial change of SAs by rhizosphere effect.
