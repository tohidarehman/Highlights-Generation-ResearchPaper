 Waterborne human viruses with ubiquitous prevalence in aquatic environments extremely low infectious doses and high resistance to common disinfection processes pose a substantial threat to human health . Herein for the first time a photocatalytic membrane reactor driven by visible light emitting diodes was applied for effective water disinfection of human adenoviruses . The photocatalyst used in the PMR was selected to be a metal free heterojunction with the advantages of visible light response efficient virucidal effects green properties and easy recovery

@highlight A photocatalytic membrane reactor was explored for disinfection of human adenovirus.
@highlight Operation for adenovirus disinfection was analyzed by response surface methodology.
@highlight 5.00 log adenoviruses could be totally killed in 540min under the optimal solution.
@highlight The established prediction model matched well with the actual experimental data.
