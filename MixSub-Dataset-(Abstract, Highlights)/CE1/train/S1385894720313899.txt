 A magnetic aggregation bed photocatalytic reactor was designed and constructed to achieve continuous photodegradation of methyl orange solution without subsequent photocatalyst separation . A magnetic photocatalyst CoFe

@highlight The magnetic aggregates could increase the irradiation surface and enhance mass transfer.
@highlight Shallow film flow can enhance transmission while rough surface effectively avoids internal reflection.
@highlight The reactor operated continuously without catalyst separation use of solar energy for environmental protection.
@highlight Performance comparison preferred optimal experiment conditions.
