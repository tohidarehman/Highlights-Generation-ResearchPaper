 Recently chemodynamic therapy has become an outstanding cancer treatment because of its high specificity for tumor microenvironment . Nevertheless lower reactive oxygen species production efficiency and cellular antioxidant defense system are still the main obstacles in CDT . To this end we propose a highly efficient nanoplatform for exogenous and endogenous dual augmented mitochondrial targeted CDT based on bio reducible and bio breakable copper truncated octahedron

@highlight Stable in vitro and bio reducible in vivo of Cu II .
@highlight GSH depletion photothermal dual augmented chemodynamic therapy.
@highlight Excellent mitochondrial targeting and amplified the oxidative stress.
@highlight possesses bio breakable capacity in vivo.
