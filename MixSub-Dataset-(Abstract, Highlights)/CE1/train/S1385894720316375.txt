 Aqueous Zn ion batteries attract ever growing attention due to low cost high safety and environmental friendliness . Among the limited cathode candidates manganese based oxides stand out owing to large ion channels and multiple valence of Mn . Notably MnO thought to be inactive before actually exhibits high energy densities in AZIBs thus arousing wide interests . Herein the electrochemical behavior of MnO electrode is extensively investigated in ZnSO
