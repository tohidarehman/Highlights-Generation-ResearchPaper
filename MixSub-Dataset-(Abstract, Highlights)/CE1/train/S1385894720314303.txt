 We prepared an Ag Pd bimetallic nanozyme with the peroxidase like activity as a nanocarrier to load doxorubicin . It combines photothermal conversion ability and catalytic production of hydroxyl radicals to achieve enhanced antitumor effects . The temperature rise under near infrared laser irradiation was recorded to demonstrate the photothermal conversion ability of the Ag Pd bimetallic nanoparticles . The peroxidase like activity of the AgPd NPs was visually characterized by a color rendering experiment of TMB . Compared with bare Ag NPs bimetallic AgPd NPs exhibit better photothermal conversion capability and catalytic ability resulting from alloying with palladium . The antitumor effect was evaluated by cell experiments and tumor bearing mice experiments and it was confirmed that

@highlight AgPd bimetallic nanozyme possesses outstanding peroxidase like activity.
@highlight Superior catalytic efficacy of AgPd nanozyme results from alloying of Ag and Pd.
@highlight The lower pH value 7.45.5 the stronger catalytic ability of AgPd nanozyme.
@highlight AgPd nanozyme has higher photothermal conversion efficiency than Ag nanoparticle.
