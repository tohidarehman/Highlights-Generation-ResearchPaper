 Composite anion exchanges membranes are prepared by incorporating quaternized graphene oxide within poly or the mixture of PVA and quaternized polyethyleneimine followed by cross linking with formaldehyde . The PVA QGO series of membranes have low ion exchange capacities of 0.100.37

@highlight Composite AEMs are prepared from incorporating QGO into PVA or PVA QPEI matrix.
@highlight The PVA
@highlight OH groups can selectively accelerate the transport of OH
@highlight ions through hydrogen bonding.
@highlight QGO nanosheets in the membrane block the transport of ions with large hydrated ionic radius.
@highlight The composite membranes show high alkali recovery ratio and selectivity for ED process.
