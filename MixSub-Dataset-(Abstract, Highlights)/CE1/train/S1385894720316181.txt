 Microalgal growth was inhibited in high strength ammonium wastewater but the actual stress factor and their physiological responses remain to be elucidated . In this study compared to either the total ammonium or pH alone free ammonia concentration clearly exhibited negative correlation with the growth of

@highlight Sludge fermentation liquor was used for microalgal cultivation.
@highlight FA was the real primary stress factor rather than ammonium or pH alone.
@highlight FA concentrations negatively correlated with algal growth and photosynthesis.
@highlight Ammonium was removed primarily by algae uptake and evaporation.
@highlight EPS showed protective behavior of microalgae to ROS produced in high FA.
