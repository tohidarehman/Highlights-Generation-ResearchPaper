 Kinetic modelling of methanol synthesis over commercial catalysts is of high importance for reactor and process design . Literature kinetic models were implemented and systematically discussed against a newly developed kinetic model based on published kinetic data . Deviations in the sensitivities of the kinetic models were explained by means of the experimentally covered parameter range . The simulation results proved that an extrapolation of the working range of the kinetic models can lead towards significant simulation errors especially with regard to pressure stoichiometric number and CO CO
