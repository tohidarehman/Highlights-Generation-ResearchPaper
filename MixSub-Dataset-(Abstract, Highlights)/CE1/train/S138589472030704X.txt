 Pseudocapacitors can exhibit higher capacity compared to traditional electrostatic or electric double layer capacitors while they can provide faster power delivery and longer cycling ability than lithiumion batteries . In this study we demonstrate the hierarchical structures of NiCo hydroxides which are grown on Ni foam

@highlight We investigated the morphological evolution of NiCo hydroxides due to carbonate ions.
@highlight The NCCH16 AC device shows the maximum energy densities of 31.1Whkg
@highlight The hierarchical NiCo hydroxides exhibit excellent electrochemical performance.
