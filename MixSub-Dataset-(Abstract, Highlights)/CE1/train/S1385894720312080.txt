 The fabricated intercalated structure composed of a Co based zeolitic imidazolate framework and expanded graphite has been prepared using a facile and simple one pot hydrothermal reaction . This framework was used to detect heavy metal ions via a square wave anodic stripping voltammetry method for the first time . Here the composite material is useful for the selective electrochemical detection of nanomolar Cd
