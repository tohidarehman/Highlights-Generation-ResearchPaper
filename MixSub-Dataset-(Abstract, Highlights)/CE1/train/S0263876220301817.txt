 Although high shear wet granulation is widely used the knowledge of this operation is not yet fully clarified and the process design is particularly difficult .

@highlight The granulation process depends on the rheological properties of the wet mass.
@highlight A mixer torque rheometer represents a valuable tool for the process development.
@highlight The use of a mixer torque rheometer was used to assess optimal amount of binder.
@highlight The maximum torque developed by the wet mass was used to predict the growth regime.
