 Self disinfecting textiles with high efficient antimicrobial function play a vital role in the prevention of pathogen transmissions such as bacteria in hospitals and medical institutions . However low reactive oxygen species generation of current photodynamic materials can not meet the efficiency of microbial inactivation . Herein to increase the singlet oxygen

@highlight GQDs and PCN 224 were selected as a donor acceptor FRET pair.
@highlight GQDs and PCN 224 were introduced into cotton fibers by chemical coupling and
@highlight growth method.
@highlight FRET strategy was employed to increase the singlet oxygen production of cotton self disinfecting textile.
@highlight The
@highlight generation was increased by 1.61 fold via FRET process.
@highlight PCN 224 KCF GQDs showed enhanced antibacterial activities.
