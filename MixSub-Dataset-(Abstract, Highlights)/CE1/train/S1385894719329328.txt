 In this study a single chamber Mg air fuel cell is used to remove phosphorous and to simultaneously recover struvite and electricity from synthetic hydrolyzed urine . The Mg

@highlight An MAFC is constructed to recover P and electricity from hydrolyzed urine.
@highlight The effluent P concentration is lower than 0.5mgL
@highlight after 15 min treatment.
@highlight More than 99.48 of P in urine is recovered as high purity struvite 98 .
@highlight The maximum power density of urine powered MAFC reaches 552.32mWm
@highlight The struvite precipitation enhances the electricity generation of MAFC.
