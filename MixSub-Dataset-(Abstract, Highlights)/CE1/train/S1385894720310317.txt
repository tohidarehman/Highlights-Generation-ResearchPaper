 The performance of a fluidized bed reactor depends mostly on the fluidization quality which can be significantly affected by the gas properties especially the gas viscosity and density . The effects of gas species on the fluidization properties such as minimum fluidization velocity bed expansion dense phase voidage and pressure fluctuation of three typical types of Group C

@highlight High bed expansion and large dense phase voidage in Group C
@highlight fluidized bed.
@highlight Better fluidization quality with the increase of gas viscosity and or gas density.
@highlight Gas viscosity plays a more important role than gas density in fluidization processes.
@highlight Dimensionless groups are effective in characterizing the fluidization quality.
@highlight Smaller pressure fluctuation with the increase of gas viscosity and or gas density.
