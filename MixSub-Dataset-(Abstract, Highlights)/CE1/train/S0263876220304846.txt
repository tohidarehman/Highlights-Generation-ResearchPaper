 In this research compost was used as raw materials in the production of biomass adsorbent granules using drum granulation technique . Different concentrations of aqueous sodium silicate solution were used as the binding agents . Chromium and Methylene Blue solutions were selected as model adsorbates for heavy metals and dyes respectively . The results obtained showed that the concentration of sodium silicate used had a positive influence on the mechanical strength of the granules increasing the concentration would increase the compressive strength of the granules . The adsorbent granules had sufficient strength to survive wet conditions they were subjected during the adsorption study . However increasing the concentration has a negative influence on the adsorption properties of the compost granules for both Chromium and Methylene Blue .

@highlight Adsorbent granules successful made from bio waste.
@highlight Granules strength increased with concentration of silicate based binder.
@highlight Adsorbent granules were stable under aqueous conditions.
@highlight Silicate concentration hindered adsorption of the both MB and Cr VI .
@highlight High percentage removal attained for both MB and Cr.
