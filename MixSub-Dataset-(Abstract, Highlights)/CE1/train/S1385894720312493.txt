 An artificial intelligence enhanced optimization framework is developed to reduce computational costs for evaluating transport performance of buoyancy driven heat and mass transfer in porous structures . The present optimization framework integrates prediction with artificial neural networks optimization with the weighted objective function and physics based simulations with high performance computing . Multi dimensional governing parameters and objectives are investigated by ANNs with sparse scattered training data obtained from HPC with controllable structure generation scheme and parallel non dimensional lattice Boltzmann method . The macroscopic prediction results based on ANNs are validated by comparison with HPC results . Full maps of the objective function values versus structure and physical parameters are illustrated . The maximum objective function value subjected to constraints is obtained together with the corresponding optimal structure and physical parameters . The optimal parameters are further applied in HPC to obtain mesoscopic physical fields . The underlying mechanism is also revealed by comparing the physical fields with optimal and off optimal parameters .
