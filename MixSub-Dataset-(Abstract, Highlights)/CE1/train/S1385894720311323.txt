 Zero valent aluminum has attracted considerable attention in degradation of organic contaminants and reduction of heavy metal ions due to its very low redox potential E

@highlight Al was modified by soaking Al powder in water and then heat treating in vacuum.
@highlight Modified Al has a high rate in reduction of Cr VI to Cr III ions in solution.
@highlight Modified Al exhibited an excellent recyclability in removing Cr VI .
@highlight XPS indicated that Al surface passive oxide films become thin after modification.
