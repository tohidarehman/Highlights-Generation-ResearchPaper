 Wet granulation is a process used in the pharmaceutical industry to improve raw materials flow and compressibility . Adequate granulation process to manufacture furazolidone is not in place which may compromise the quality and performance of the final product . In this study statistical planning and rheological analysis using Mixer Torque Rheometer were employed to evaluate the influence of microcrystalline cellulose sodium lauryl sulfate and different binders on FZD wet granulation . The results revealed a statistically significant influence of MCC 101 and SLS on torque value whereas MCC 101 increases it by 0.240 N.m SLS resulted in 0.055 N.m decrease . Moreover sodium alginate showed better performance as a binder in the FZD granulation than PVP K30 . It has also been evidenced how the MTR plays an important role during the wet granulation process leading to accurate granulation endpoint determination and superior formulation . In conclusion MTR is an optimal tool to be explored in pharmaceutical formulation since our results allowed the development of FZD formulations using small amounts of raw material through rational and non empirical methods providing granulates with appropriate characteristics .

@highlight Evaluation of furazolidone wet granulation point through the Mixer Torque Rheometer.
@highlight Impact of different binders and concentrations on furazolidone formulations.
@highlight Furazolidone formulations with Microcel MC 101 presented higher torque values.
@highlight The higher the alginate concentration the higher the agglutination between particles.
@highlight MTR results leads to furazolidone granules with desirable characteristics.
