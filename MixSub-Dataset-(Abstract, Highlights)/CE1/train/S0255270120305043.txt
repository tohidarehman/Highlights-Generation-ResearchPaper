 This study examines the impact of corrugation configuration on the thermal hydraulic and overall energy performances of nanofluid flows in corrugated tubes . Different fluids and tube geometries are investigated using a carefully validated computational fluids dynamics model . Compared to DW flow in a smooth tube the maximum overall performance improvement was found in the case of GNP SDBS DW nanofluid flow in a curvedly ribbed tube at Re of 10 000 . For all fluids and tube geometries the overall performance enhancement was found to decrease at Reynolds numbers higher than 10 000 . Curvedly ribbed tubes have better performances at medium and high flow rates regardless of the fluid type . However at low flow rates or when the pumping power consumption is not a major concern trapezoidal ribs can be used to achieve higher heat transfer rates . Overall using corrugated tubes was found a more energy efficient technique than using nanofluids . Combining both techniques achieves enhances the performance by up to 37 . These findings can be used as a guide for determining the most suitable technique based on an overall techno economic evaluation .
