 Biomimetic scaffolds have been a growing demand in bone tissue engineering . Owing to the performance shortcomings of single natural or synthetic polymer nano hydroxyapatite reinforced hybrid scaffolds loading with icariin were biomimetically fabricated by emulsion template method combining organic inorganic hybrid technology . The scaffold successfully combined insoluble polymers between water soluble carboxymethyl chitosan and oil soluble poly . In vitro physicochemical properties and cytocompatibility showed that the scaffolds with similar topological structure to the nature bone and the incorporation of nHAP and icariin not only improved the mechanical properties and in vitro bioactivity but also accelerated the repair of the damaged bone tissue . In vivo osteogenesis showed good biocompatibility with the scaffolds especially the 3.0wt nHAP CMCS PLGA scaffold and icariin loaded 3.0wt nHAP CMCS PLGA scaffold they effectively promoted the adhesion proliferation and differentiation of the osteoblast . In conclusion the icariin loaded nHAP CMCS PLGA scaffolds fabricated by emulsion template and organic inorganic hybrid technology holds great potential and provides a unique strategy for bone repair and regeneration .
