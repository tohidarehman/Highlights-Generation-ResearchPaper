 Purification of water contaminated with organics has recently attracted much attention . In this study the adsorptive removal of bisphenol S from water was studied by using a metal organic framework MIL 101 with or without NH

@highlight MOFs were firstly applied to remove bisphenol S BPS from water via adsorption.
@highlight A MOF MIL 101 NH
@highlight  showed the highest adsorption among all reported adsorbents.
@highlight Recyclable MIL 101 NH
@highlight showed 3.7 times BPS adsorption that of activated carbon.
@highlight Amino group on MIL 101 increased adsorption much because of favorable interactions.
@highlight The remarkable adsorption was due to H bonding especially with 6 membered ring.
