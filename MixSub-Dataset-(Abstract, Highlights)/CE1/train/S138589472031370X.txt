 Toxic cyanobacterial blooms in source waters could impair drinking water quality and chlorine was a common oxidant to treat cyanobacteria in drinking water treatment plants . In natural freshwaters cyanobacterial bloom is a successive process mainly including development and maintenance stage . However previous studies only focused on one stage of cyanobacteria . Here we collected

@highlight Characteristics of
@highlight at development and maintenance stage were compared.
@highlight Elevated cell density and DOC at maintenance stage caused faster chlorine consumption.
@highlight Chlorine could completely inactive
@highlight of development and maintenance stage.
@highlight Possible reactive chlorinated intermediates promoted toxin degradation at maintenance stage.
@highlight Sufficient chlorine exposure could completely degrade total toxin for
@highlight at both stages.
