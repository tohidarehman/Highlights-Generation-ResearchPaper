 A bio inspired polydopamine molecularly imprinted substrate is fabricated by one step oxidative self polymerization of dopamine and template molecules in weakly alkaline medium on screen printed electrode . Through the catechol and amine groups on PDA surface Au nanoparticles can be easily anchored and growth on PDA MIP coating thereby forming a three dimensional architecture . By adjusting the reaction conditions the particle size and distribution of PDA and AuNPs can be well controlled . Benefiting from the hot spots generated by AuNPs and recognition sites produced by MIP the AuNP PDA MIP nanocomposite can serve as excellent SERS substrate enabling selective enrichment and identification of phthalate plasticizers . Using this substrate an enhancement factor up to 1.7010

@highlight Bioinspired PDA based MIP substrate was fabricated under mild conditions.
@highlight In situ growth of AuNPs was facially obtained rely on the reduction of PDA coating.
@highlight Notable SERS enhancement generated by adjusting size distribution of PDA and AuNPs.
@highlight Template mediated molecular recognition boosts the SERS selectivity and sensitivity.
@highlight On site SERS detection of phthalate plasticizers in real samples was achieved.
