 In this study an economic evaluation of the Rotating Packed Bed technology for the absorption of aromas from bioreactor off gas was performed for different process scales based on experimental results for a model compound benzaldehyde . The comparison of the total annual costs of the RPB with the costs of a packed column showed that the RPB process is more expensive at all scales investigated . At the laboratory to pilot plant scale the costs of the RPB contactor are higher than of packed columns . At the production scale however the RPB machine itself becomes cheaper than the packed column . The sensitivity analysis revealed that the main cost drivers influencing the investment decision are the equipment costs of the contactor and the blower as well as the blower power required to overcome the pressure drop generated in the contactor . Although technically the RPB remains a promising alternative for the intensification of the product recovery from gaseous process streams its economic benefits are questionable .

@highlight Apparatus costs of a Rotating Packed Bed were estimated using basket centrifuges.
@highlight Aroma recovery in Rotating Packed Bed is technically beneficial but more expensive.
@highlight Expensive machine and large pressure drop dominate Rotating Packed Bed costs.
@highlight Sensitivity analysis shows economic disadvantage despite any overestimations.
