 Precious metal free bifunctional catalysts offer scalable possibilities for achieving oxygen cathodes in rechargeable metal air batteries . Literature thus far suggests that the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions take place at different active sites . However the design and preparation of oxygen electrocatalysts with high performance is still a great challenge . This work develops a general approach to introduce a nanoparticle that offers oxygen evolution reaction sites onto an oxygen reduction reaction catalyst via rapid microwave treatment . The metalorganic frameworks derived Co N C with high ORR performance is employed as a support to homogeneously disperse OER active Ni
