 Rhamnolipids are widely investigated to control the growth of food pathogenic bacteria as well as repair environmental problems . This work was proposed to in

@highlight Cyclic fermentation coupled with foam fractionation technology was developed.
@highlight Rhamnolipids have slight effect on the growth of bacteria.
@highlight Coupling time could be chosen at the maximum rhamnolipids rate in fermentation.
@highlight The yield of rhamnolipids increased by 32 after process improvement.
