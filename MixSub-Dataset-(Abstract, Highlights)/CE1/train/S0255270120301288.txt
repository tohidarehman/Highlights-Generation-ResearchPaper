 Three dimensional turbulent fluid flow and heat transfer through circular tubes with internal rods are simulated in the present work . The novelty of this work which was not studied in the previous studies is these rods act as fin and insert simultaneously to intensify the heat transfer . Constant wall temperature are assumed for the outer surface of the tube . The realizable K model is applied as the turbulence model . The influence of various geometrical characteristics like rod diameter longitudinal and transverse pitches and tube diameter as well as operational parameters like Reynolds and Prandtl numbers on the augmentation of the coefficient of the transfer of thermal energy and factor of friction are obtained . Results indicate the application of the rods increases the Nusselt number about 2.8 times at Re 8400 while increases it about 2.3 times at Re 21 900 . Furthermore it was found the PEC of the tubular heat exchanger with the rod bank is in average 18.4 higher than one with coiled wire insert . As a result of this study correlations are suggested for estimation of the factor of friction and Nusselt number for these types of the improved tubular heat exchangers for wide range of the geometrical and operational variables .

@highlight New types of the internal fins are introduced.
@highlight Effect of Reynolds and Prandtl number as well as geometrical variables are discussed.
@highlight Two equations are suggested for the estimation of the Nusselt number and factor of friction.
