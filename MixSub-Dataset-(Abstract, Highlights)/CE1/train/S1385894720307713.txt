 Benzophenone 3 is a potential phenolic endocrine disrupter that is widely used as a sunscreen and ultraviolet stabilizer . The degradation of BP3 in water during chlorination and UV chlorination reactions was investigated . The degradation of BP3 by both reactions followed pseudo first order kinetics . The pH profile of the observed pseudo first order rate constants

@highlight The degradation of BP3 in chlorination and UV chlorination were the faster at pH 8.
@highlight OH radical contribution in UV chlorination to BP3 increased in acidic pH.
@highlight UV chlorination of BP3 was promoted by HCO
@highlight ions and was inhibited by humic acid.
@highlight Seven transformation products TPs of BP3 were identified during two reactions.
@highlight Toxicity with
@highlight on TPs in UV chlorination was lower than in chlorination.
