 The developing sulfide solid electrolyte is a promising way to overcome shuttle effect of polysulfide in the traditional liquid Li S battery . However an air stable sulfide solid electrolyte and competitive solidsolid interface structure must be constructed firstly . Herein we have designed an organicinorganic multi scale composite electrolytes to overcome the interfacial issues of solid state Li S batteries . The organicinorganic composite electrolyte consists of a gel polymer electrolyte and an oxygen doped inorganic sulfide solid electrolyte . The O doped sulfide solid electrolyte improves its chemical stability and suppresses the lithium dendrites . A thin GPE film protects the crystal structural stability during cycles and greatly enhances the performance of O doped sulfide solid electrolyte due to the GPE not only constructs soft interface contact between S cathode and solid electrolyte but also builds lithium ion transport paths by ionic liquid between them . Those SSLSBs display a very good cycling performance with the specific capacity of 1023 mAh g after 50 cycles at 60 C and 541 mAh g after 150 cycles at 30 C under same rate of 0.1 C. This study demonstrates that the development of advanced solid state Li S battery needs to fully integrate a number of technical advantages .
