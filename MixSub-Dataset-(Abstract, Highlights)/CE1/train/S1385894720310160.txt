 The development of highly efficient electron transport layer free perovskite solar cells with simplified and economical device configurations can significantly motivate the commercialization of PSCs . However the performance of ETL free PSCs has been hampered by the sluggish charge extraction and severe charge carrier recombination due to the energy level mismatch at the interface of the perovskite and the transparent conductive electrode FTO . In this study this issue is well solved by modifying the FTO surface with a simple low cost and non toxic rubidium fluoride interlayer . An interfacial dipole layer is formed on the FTO surface by inserting a RbF layer which tunes the work function of FTO eliminates the electron transport barrier and optimizes the energy level alignment at the FTO perovskite interface thereby enhancing the charge transfer and suppressing the carrier recombination . Consequently the rigid ETL free PSCs with RbF layer yield high efficiencies of up to 18.79 higher than that of ETL free devices on bare FTO . By virtue of the low temperature processability a superior PCE of 15.7 has been achieved by flexible ETL free PSCs fabricated on RbF modified plastic substrate . This study provides a simple efficient and environmentally friendly approach to modify the FTO electrode for fabricating ETL free PSCs which contribute to promote the design of advanced interface materials for simplified and high performance perovskite photovoltaics .

@highlight A simple and low cost non toxic RbF modifier is introduced for the first time in the ETL free PSCs.
@highlight A superior efficiency of 18.79 along with a reduced J V hysteresis in the ETL free PSCs is achieved.
@highlight The barrier free FTO perovskite contact favors efficient electron transfer and suppresses the carrier recombination.
