 Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat associated Cas9 nuclease system has become a powerful toolbox as a gene fixed point knock out method and hold the promising prospect for cancer therapy . However the biological safety of the viral vectors and the instability of exogenous plasmid in blood circulation limits its application . Herein we reported a lactobionic acid functionalized and stimuli responsive chitosan based nanocomplex to co deliver sgVEGFR2 Cas9 plasmid and paclitaxel for hepatoma carcinoma therapy . The genome editing efficiency of sgVEGFR2 Cas9 in the nanosystem achieved up to 38.6 of HepG2 cells

@highlight Nanocomplex for co delivery of CRISPR Cas9 and paclitaxel was constructed.
@highlight The nanosystem triggered efficient gene editing with good safety.
@highlight The gene therapy of VEGFR2 sensitized the treatment effect of paclitaxel.
@highlight The nanosystem exhibited the synergistic modulation for IL 6 IL 8 NF B pathway.
@highlight The nanosystem achieved significant synergistic gene chemo HCC treatment.
