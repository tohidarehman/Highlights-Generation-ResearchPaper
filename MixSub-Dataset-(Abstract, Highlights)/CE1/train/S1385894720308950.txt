 Single metal catalysts build a bridge between homogeneous catalysis and heterogeneous catalysis . Herein we report the single atom copper sites embedded in reduced graphene oxide for the degradation of various antibiotics including sulfamethoxazole meropenem and sulfafurazole via the heterogeneous activation of peroxymonosulfate . The SA Cu rGO PMS system exhibited an enhanced performance toward the degradation of SMX with the kinetic was 3.9 times faster than in the rGO PMS system . Strikingly we found that over 99 of the total organic carbon was eliminated in the SA Cu rGO PMS system within 120min demonstrating its excellent mineralization ability . The enhanced catalytic performance could be due to the synergistic effect between the rGO matrix and the exposed Cu active sites which facilitated the generation large amount of reactive species and the in situ decomposition of the pollutants at the surface of the catalysts . This SA Cu rGO catalyst with multifunctional properties can be potentially applied in the treatment of refractory wastewater .
