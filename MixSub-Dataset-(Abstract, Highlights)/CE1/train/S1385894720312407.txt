 Severe membrane fouling caused by iron and manganese limited the intensive application of ultrafiltration technologies . In the present study an innovative biofilm based UF process gravity driven membrane filtration was employed to evaluate its possibility to directly treat manganese contaminated surface water at high concentration . Surprisingly an extremely short and stable ripening period of iron and manganese removal was achieved in GDM filtration with average removals of 90 and 58 respectively attributing to the effective rejection of active catalytic manganese oxides and fast colonization of iron and manganese oxidizing bacteria e.g

@highlight Flux stabilization of GDM process occurred under high Mn pollution.
@highlight An extremely short ripening period 10days of Mn removal was achieved.
@highlight Fe and Mn were efficiently removed by 90 and 50 in GDM process.
@highlight A highly porous biofilm formed on the membrane surface under Mn pollution.
@highlight Pre coating manganese oxides could improve the stable flux and Mn removal.
