 Li S cathode loaded with microdomain sulfur is preferred because of its high utilization of sulfur during charging and discharging . Encapsulating sulfur in porous carbon has often been used to form microdomain sulfur but is limited by the charge ion diffusion resistance in the pores . Here we demonstrate the formation of microdomain sulfur in the open pore CNT assembly . We obtain microdomain sulfur on CNTs coated with CeO
