 Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a promising technology for propylene production and offers several advantages over traditional dedicated propylene production processes particularly a low energy consumption and safety in operation with their associated economic advantages . In this study the technical feasibility of employing oxygen carriers based on Ga Mo and V for CL ODHP was investigated and compared . The oxygen carriers were prepared by incipient wet impregnation and their physical and chemical properties as well as their reactivity performance were determined . Because of the required high temperature during calcination the morphological properties of Mo based and V based oxygen carriers differed from their Al

@highlight Technical feasibility of CL ODHP was proved by experiment.
@highlight Three different kinds of oxygen carriers were prepared and comparative studied.
@highlight Effect of temperature on reactivity were studied for prepared oxygen carriers.
@highlight V based oxygen carrier is suitable for CL ODHP.
