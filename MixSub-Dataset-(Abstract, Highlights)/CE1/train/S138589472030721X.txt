 The interfacial interactions between siderite humic acid and phosphate is critical to understand the transport of HA and phosphate in the environment . In this study the influence of HA on the adsorption of phosphate by siderite not only includes competitive adsorption but also includes indirectly facilitated adsorption . It was attributed to that humic acid as a representative natural organic matter possesses abundant carboxylic groups which facilitate chelation between minerals and HA and then the phosphate adsorption performance is affected . The experimental results concluded that three stages of the transformation from siderite to goethite under the action of HA can be divided . Firstly chelation can be formed between HA and the ferrous ions from siderite and it is favorable for the oxidation of Fe by the O

@highlight The influence of HA on P includes competitive and indirectly facilitated adsorption.
@highlight HA could affect the surface complex species of phosphate.
@highlight Humic acid could induce mineral transformation from siderite to goethite.
@highlight Ferrihydrite as the mesocrystal exists in the process of mineral transformation.
@highlight Goethite was formed by the structural rearrangement of ferrihydrite nano particles.
