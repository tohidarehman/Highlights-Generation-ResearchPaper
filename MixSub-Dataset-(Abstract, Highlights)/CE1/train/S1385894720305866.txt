 The construction of multimodal targeting and therapeutic platforms is a promising strategy for combating multidrug resistant bacteria associated infections . We report a dual targeted antibacterial platform integrating a synergistic chemo photothermal effect based on the boronic acid functionalized graphene based quaternary ammonium salt . When located at the sites of Gram negative bacteria associated infections B CG QAS was able to specifically bind to the bacteria and their biofilms via the dual effect of electrostatic adhesion and covalent coupling resulting in a superior targeting ability over the single targeted agents improved bactericidal efficacy a reduced dose of QAS and minimized chemotherapeutic photothermal toxicity . In addition to the QAS mediated antibacterial effects NIR laser irradiation onto CG could further improve the antimicrobial effect via the synergy of hyperthermia . On the other hand QAS could disrupt the bacterial cell membrane and improve its permeability and sensitivity to heat . Moreover B CG QAS could be effectively utilized for synergistic chemo photothermal therapy against the
