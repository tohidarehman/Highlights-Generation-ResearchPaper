 Recovery of antimony from wastewater is desired . Deposition of Sb to metal Sb can occur via cathodic reduction which is limited for Sb reduction . Herein a UV sulfite assisted electrodeposition system was developed for the recovery of Sb as metal Sb . The hydrated electron e

@highlight Recovery of Sb V was achieved by e
@highlight assisted electroreduction.
@highlight Over 95 of Sb V was recovered in the optimal conditions after reaction for 6h.
@highlight Electrochemical reduction of Sb III to metallic Sb was exhibited.
@highlight The recovery rate of 60 was achieved for practical Sb containing wastewater.
