 The effect of basic process conditions and the initial distribution of mixed liquids on mixing on the molecular scale was studied experimentally for helical and twisted bends reactors . The selectivity of two competitive parallel reactions acid base neutralization and alkaline ester hydrolysis carried out in aqueous solutions between initially unmixed reactants was used to quantify micromixing in steady state isothermal and laminar flow . Faster micromixing is achieved in the twisted bends mixer than in the helical mixer due to the periodic reorientation of Dean vortices present in curved conduits . The difference in micromixing performance of the two reactors decreases for high Reynolds numbers

@highlight Micromixing is investigated in regular and periodically reoriented Dean flow in two multiple bends reactors.
@highlight Several cost effective methods of enhancing positive effect of chaotic advection on micromixing are identified.
@highlight Optimum orientation of the first contact surface of mixed liquids with respect to the first tube bend is determined for both reactors.
@highlight Selectivity of competitive parallel chemical reactions is found sensitive to the total system throughput inlet stream configuration and modifications of the system geometry.
