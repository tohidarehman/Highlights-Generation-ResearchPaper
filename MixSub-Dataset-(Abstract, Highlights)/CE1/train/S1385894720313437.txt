 Turning heterocyclic contaminants into polymers from industrial wastewater is a promising method that opens a new door for feasible and cost effective treatment for aromatic wastewater . In this study CuO shows the high reactivity in the catalytic oxidation of thiophene by persulfate under pH neutral condition and the observed rate constant

@highlight PS is activated on CuO via the nonradical pathway.
@highlight The activated PS abstracts electron from thiophene with the formation of thiophene radical cation.
@highlight Thiophene radical cations are polymerized into insoluble polythiophene
@highlight  dioxides.
@highlight The produced polymers exhibit pseudocapacitive properties.
