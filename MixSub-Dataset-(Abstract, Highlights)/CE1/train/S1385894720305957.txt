 Spatially resolved data for biofilm structure can often not be assessed easily in bioelectrochemical setups due to the orientation and placement of anode and cathode . However understanding the interplay of biofilm development and electrochemical parameters is crucial for optimizing bioelectrochemical biofilm systems . For example to produce value added products . This study thus presents a versatile flow cell setup allowing for control of hydrodynamic substrate and nutritional conditions as well as physical parameters . Here a versatile lab scale flow cell system equipped with a cathode and an anode is presented to monitor the growth of
