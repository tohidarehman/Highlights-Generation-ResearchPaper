 In this paper a naturally occurring ilmenite ore and the same ore modified with NiO were employed as oxygen carriers for chemical looping reforming of CH

@highlight A dual function catalyst modified oxygen carrier of ilmenite ore was prepared.
@highlight The addition of NiO to ilmenite enables syngas generation through both CLR and DMR.
@highlight The incorporation of CLR and DMR provides an opportunity for CO
@highlight utilization.
