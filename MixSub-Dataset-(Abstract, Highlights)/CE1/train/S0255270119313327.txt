 This work proposes the optimization of 2 ethylhexyl caprylate caprate synthesis in a pulsed loop reactor and the energy efficiency of the reactor was assessed . 2 EH caprylate caprate can be used as a biodegradable base fluid . Only 0.4wt catalyst concentration was used in the reaction . The face centred central composite design experiment coupled response surface methodology has been implemented to screen independent parameters . The optimization process showed that vacuum pressure was the most influential factor followed by oscillation speed temperature and time . The maximum conversion of 98 and yield of 89 were achieved under optimal conditions of 78C 10mbar 20min and 155rpm . Meanwhile energy balance calculation indicated that the usage of low vacuum pressure not only significantly reduced the total heat duty from 1381kJ to 823kJ but also alleviated the reaction temperature from 172C to 78C . The calculation also demonstrated that the reflux stirred tank reactor produced a lower conversion and yield of ester yet 6kJ higher total heat duty compared to the pulsed loop reactor indicating a cost saving with the pulsed loop reactor .
