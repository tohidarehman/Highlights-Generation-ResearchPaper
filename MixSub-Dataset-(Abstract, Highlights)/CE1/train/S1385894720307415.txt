 The advancement and exploitation of modern industry has a significant and far reaching impact on water environment prompting to development of advanced technologies for the filtration of oil water emulsion mixtures and purification of soluble organic contaminants . However bifunctional materials capable of continuously filtrating multiphase emulsion mixtures and degrading soluble organic contaminants from wastewater are still a concerning issue . Herein a dual prewetted underwater superoleophobic and underoil superhydrophobic microalgae residue membrane hybrid was developed which demonstrated outstanding performance in the filtration of multiphase emulsion mixtures and catalytic degradation of microplastics released BPA . The combination of underoil superhydrophobic oil containing region with underwater superoleophobic water containing region in an integrated membrane promoted successive filtration of multiphase emulsion mixtures . Additionally DMRM serves as a high performance carbocatalyst for peroxydisulfate activation of rapid elimination of BPA . The reagents used in the integrated DMRM PS system were optimized in a safety dose evaluation by the osteoblasts viability . Hence the presented results will inspire the future comprehensive environmentally friendly treatment of wastewater with integrated systems and advanced membrane technology .

@highlight The DMRM shows superior performance for continuously filtering multiphase emulsion mixtures.
@highlight A novel DMRM AOPs system is established for simultaneously separating insoluble and degrading BPA.
@highlight This work explored the safety dose of agents in AOPs by measuring the viability of osteoblasts.
