 Transformation from photocatalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to photocatalytic dehydrogenation of ethane is an attractive process . A series of Pd TiO

@highlight The transformation between PDHE and PODHE is realized over Pd TiO
@highlight Small Pd particle is easily reduced and it affects CB and VB of Pd TiO
@highlight No CO
@highlight reduction is found on Pd particles smaller than 3nm with a high Pd
@highlight  Pd
@highlight selective formation is related to the type and the number of active sites.
