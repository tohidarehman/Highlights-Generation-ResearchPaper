 Methanol to olefin process is a chemical technology for producing low carbon olefins from coal based or natural gas based methanol . It has changed the pattern of low carbon olefins relying on petroleum cracking and opened a new process for producing low carbon olefins . However the wastewater generated in the MTO process is difficult to handle . Numbering up of mini hydrocyclone is often used to enhance the processing capacity of wastewater treatment when mini hydrocyclone is used for oil water separation in methanol to olefin process . In this paper the efficiency and pressure drop distribution of a single mini hydrocyclone were studied in the laboratory . In addition according to the U

@highlight A unit consisting of 150 parallel amplified mini hydrocyclones in a UU type parallel configuration was constructed.
@highlight the efficiency and pressure drop distribution of a single mini hydrocyclone are studied in the laboratory.
@highlight The mini hydrocyclones group has been applied in Methanol to Olefin MTO oil water separation.
