 In this paper we firstly report on the different scenarios of the process integration to produce jet fuel intermediates from biomass . Rigorous process simulation optimization techno economical evaluation and carbon emission calculation are performed . We start from the aldol condensation process converting furfural and acetone to the jet fuel intermediate . COSMO SAC model and the PR COSMOSAC equation of state are firstly incorporated to estimate the missing physical properties of both pure component and the mixture . In this part three process schemes assisted process and the solvent less process are investigated and the total annual cost are compared . Comparing with the distillation only process the optimization results indicate a more favorable condition in the solvent less process than the MEE assisted process . Moreover different strategies of integrating the aldol condensation process with the front end furfural production process are discussed . They are presented in five scenarios . YUMC and ER are calculated to quantify the economic performance and CO
