 Substrate clogging is regarded as one of the main influencing factors on the sustainable operation in subsurface flow constructed wetlands . The accumulation of extracellular polymeric substances produced by microbial metabolism may contribute to the substrate clogging due to the increasing formation of biofilms in CWs . In this study the quantity and composition of EPS and the distribution and variation of bacterial communities in different CW systems with and without aeration and biochar addition were comparatively investigated . Biochar and intermittent aeration addition could shift the production and compositions of EPS in SSFCW . Higher total EPS production was observed in CW with intermittent aeration and biochar 328mg L

@highlight EPS microbial communities and its implications for clogging were investigated.
@highlight Total EPS quantity increased in SSFCWs by applying aeration with biochar addition.
@highlight Contents of different types of EPS decreased from upper to lower substrate layer.
@highlight Biochar and aeration enhanced the abundance of microbes but reduced the diversity.
@highlight Aeration and biochar addition may increase potential risks of clogging in SSFCWs.
