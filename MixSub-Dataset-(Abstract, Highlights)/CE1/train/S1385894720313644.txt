 The co pyrolysis technology of the second generation feedstocks has both engineering and environmental advantages towards resource recovery waste stream reduction and energy generation . However there exists a large knowledge gap about the co pyrolytic mechanisms kinetics emissions and products of biomass wastes . This study aimed to quantify the co pyrolytic interactions between the five N

@highlight Sewage sludge SS and coffee grounds CG were co pyrolized in five atmospheres.
@highlight Eight parallel DAEM elucidated the co pyrolytic kinetics in five atmospheres.
@highlight Temperature dependency of gases evolved from co pyrolysis were quantified.
@highlight A strong interaction existed with SC64 co pyrolysis in CO
@highlight atmosphere.
@highlight SC64 co pyrolysis changed the co pyrolytic product selectivity and distributions.
