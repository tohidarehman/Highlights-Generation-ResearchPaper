 The effect of the two types vortex finder on the performance of the single and double inlet cyclone separators was experimentally investigated . In particular the collection efficiency pressure drop and overall performance of single inlet cyclone separator with a cylindrical vortex finder single inlet cyclone separator with an inverted cone vortex finder double inlet cyclone separator with a cylindrical vortex finder and double inlet cyclone separator with an inverted cone vortex finder were obtained and compared . The results show that the increasing diameter of the vortex finder would decrease the collection efficiency and pressure drop of the double inlet cyclone separators and increase the overall performance . It also found that inverted cone vortex finder provides higher collection efficiency and pressure drop . Furthermore when the vortex finder shape of the single inlet and double inlet cyclone separator changed the variation of the collection efficiency and pressure drop was different which is the same as changing the cyclone from a single inlet to double inlet .

@highlight An industrial scale experiment of double inlet cyclone separators was investigated.
@highlight Effect of the inverted cone vortex finder on the performance of the double inlet cyclone was experimentally studied.
@highlight Variation of performance on cyclones when vortex finder and inlet number changed was successfully explored and compared.
@highlight The limited inhibitory effect of the double inlet on the diameter of the vortex finder was demonstrated and discussed.
