 The aim in this work is to develop an optimization framework to address cycling of baseload energy systems due to the penetration of renewables into the grid . The developed strategy corresponds to a multi objective and dynamic real time optimization framework applied to a postcombustion MEA based CO

@highlight MOO DRTO strategy is proposed for baseload energy systems under cycling conditions.
@highlight Novel PSO and SQP approach is implemented in process systems engineering.
@highlight Tchebycheff based MOO component guarantees Pareto front optimal compromise.
@highlight Framework is applied to carbon capture under cycling for different landscapes.
