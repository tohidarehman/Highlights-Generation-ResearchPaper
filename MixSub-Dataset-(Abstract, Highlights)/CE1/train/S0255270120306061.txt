 The present manuscript explores a comprehensive study on effective parameters of a submerged photocatalytic membrane reactor comprising both membrane and photocatalytic parameters . For this propose the response surface methodology was applied and five effective parameters i.e . PVDF polymer concentration of the fabricated membrane TiO

@highlight Both membrane and photocatalytic parameters on performance of SPMR were tested.
@highlight Response surface methodology RSM was applied to investigation of correlations.
@highlight Performances of membrane flux fouling reduction and dye removal were improved.
@highlight RSM output showed pH adjustment has main effect on membrane fouling reduction.
@highlight Inserting of TiO
@highlight NPs in PVDF membrane reduced fouling and increased dye removal.
