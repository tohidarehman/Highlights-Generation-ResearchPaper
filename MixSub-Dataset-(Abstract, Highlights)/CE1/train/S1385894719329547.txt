 Metallic solid liquid phase change materials are crucial for the thermal energy storage technology of various industrial systems . However the encapsulation of metallic SLPCMs is still technically difficult . In this pursuit the present research envisaged the development of a novel technology to successfully prepare the core void shell Al

@highlight A novel core Al Si Bi void shell Al
@highlight  composite PCM was successfully prepared.
@highlight The Al Si alloy and Al
@highlight shell were in situ prepared by the displacement reaction.
@highlight The void layer was formed by the evaporation of most of the outer Bi in Al Bi alloy.
@highlight The thermal stability of Al Si Bi Al
@highlight was obviously improved due to the void layer.
@highlight The Al Si Bi Al
@highlight possessed an adjustable thermal energy storage performance.
