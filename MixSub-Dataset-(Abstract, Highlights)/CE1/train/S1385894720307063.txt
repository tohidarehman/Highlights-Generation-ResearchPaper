 Injection of cell laden hydrogel microspheres is a minimally invasive method for tissue regeneration . However microspheres are usually limited by structural heterogeneity uneven size low cell loading capacity and poor cell survival rate . We devised a microfluidics synchronous cross linked technology to obtain injectable homogenous porous microspheres of desired particle and pore size by adjusting the flow rate and concentration of gelatin methacrylamide . The synchronous cross linking controlled the strength of cross linking and prevented fusion and uneven cross linking . The freeze dried microspheres of particle size 300m and pore size 50m rapidly adsorbed murine bone marrow derived stem cells and maintained their viability and osteogenic potential

@highlight Proposing a new microfluidic technology for the preparation of cell loaded porous microspheres.
