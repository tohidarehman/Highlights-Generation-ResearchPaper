 The development of alternative clean and renewable fuels has become the need of the hour due to the decreasing supply of fossil fuels . Solar hydrogen produced from water is a sustainable green substitute for fossil fuels for a variety of applications . However cost effective efficient and stable production of hydrogen fuel from water is a challenge for real world applications . In pursuit of cost effective and large scale commercialization of hydrogen from water attempts were made to describe an up to date knowledge on photoelectrochemical water splitting processes . In this respect solar hydrogen production based on semiconductor photoelectrodes is regarded as a highly effective option . In this review we summarize the development of the PEC based water splitting processes with respect to the efficiency and stability of the PEs . This study is thus expected to help open new paths for the establishment of a sustainable renewable and clean energy economy .
