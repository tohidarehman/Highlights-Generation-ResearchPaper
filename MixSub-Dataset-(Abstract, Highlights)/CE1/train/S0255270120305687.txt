 In this paper the effect of using turbulator and different oxides water based nanofluids on heat transfer characteristics of a straight tube have been investigated numerically based on empirical data . In the first part the influence of SiO

@highlight Heat transfer characteristics of a straight tube with twisted turbulator were investigated.
@highlight Thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity of nanofluids were measured experimentally.
@highlight The effect of different oxides nanofluids on thermal performance was assessed.
@highlight SiO
@highlight  water nanofluid in volume fraction of 2 increased heat transfer by 7.93 in comparison with deionized water.
@highlight CuO water nanofluid showed better thermal performance compared to other Oxide nanofluids.
