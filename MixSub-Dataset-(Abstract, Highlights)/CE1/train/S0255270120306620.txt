 The size of the combustion space has a significant effect on the flame behavior in the micro combustor . In this paper the structures and dynamics of laminar partially premixed methane air were experimentally investigated as the combustion space gradually decreases . In the experiment five flame regimes were observed in sequence the stable flame transient oscillating flame extinction flame with repetitive extinction and ignition and quenching . The effects of the mixture flow rate primary equivalence ratio and separating distance of plates on the different flame behaviors were analyzed . It was revealed that increasing the mixture flow rate could improve the flames stability while increasing the primary premixed air and the flame tended to become unstable . Moreover in the FREI regime the larger the separating distance the lower the frequency of the FREI flame meanwhile the FREI frequency increased as the primary equivalent ratio decreased . The FREI frequency exhibited a non monotonic change with the mixture flow rate and peaked at 1.06m s. Furthermore it was demonstrated that the smaller the primary equivalent ratio the smaller the quenching distance . The mixture flow rate had no significant effect on the quenching distance . The research is helpful to the design of the micro combustion device .
