 A new approach for calculating flow domains with embedded monoliths is presented focusing on a system suitable for an automotive converter . Using appropriate boundary conditions the monolith itself can be excluded from the CFD computational domain leaving two mapped computational domains upstream and downstream of the monolith . The resulting method enables more detailed results of the downstream flow profile than afforded by the commonly used porous body approach for simulating a monolith but without the complexities of a full 3D calculation of the entire domain including the monolith . The present approach was validated with experimental flow data from the literature collected with a prismatic monolith with approximately 4500 channels . Sensitivity studies were performed to check the influence of the downstream turbulence model inlet turbulence boundary conditions and spatial discretization schemes . RANS turbulence models generally predict the experimentally measured flow profile downstream of the monolith although the transition to turbulence can not be reproduced correctly . Currently LES is the best approach for adequately describing the characteristics of flow downstream of monoliths .

@highlight New approach for calculating flow domains with embedded monoliths.
@highlight Domain coupling allows exclusion of monolith and usage of different models in domains.
@highlight Approach works perfectly and leads to valuable results.
@highlight RANS modeling leads to good results but transition behind monolith cannot be predicted.
@highlight LES yields all details of flow and captures transition from laminar to turbulent flow.
