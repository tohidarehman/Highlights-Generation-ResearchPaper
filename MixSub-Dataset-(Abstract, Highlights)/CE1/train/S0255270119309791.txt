 There are different purification technologies aimed at separating azeotropic mixtures among which extractive and pressure swing distillation stand out . While the former is characterized by the use of a solvent the latter is employed when the composition of mixtures is significantly affected by the operating pressure . In this article said separation technologies are applied to a tetrahydrofuran water mixture and further compared to one another in terms of their exergetic performance and CO
