 The application of microwave was observed to be an emerging intensification tool in the field of extraction . A recent study in extraction revels the rising prospectus of the microwave as an integrated unit operation with Three Phase Partitioning . This work aims to determine the best mode of microwave application for TPP assisted extraction of oil from custard apple seeds which has significant industrial potential as a biopesticide . A maximum oil extraction yield of 33.23 was obtained by opting microwave pre treatment assisted Three Pase partitioning with 120 W applied power for 60 s as optimized parameters . Parameters affecting TPP such as salt concentration aqueous to t butanol ratio and slurry to t butanol ratio were also optimized as 45 1 2 and 1 10 respectively . Also MPTPP was observed to extract 18.46 of protein along with the maximum oil extraction . In MPTPP the yield of oil was improved by 1.13 fold than the conventional method and the process time was reduced by 2.5 times than TPP .
