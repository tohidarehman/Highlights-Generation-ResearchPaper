 The raise of environmental concerns in the past decades consequently increased the need of obtaining cleaner sources of energy . Among the studied alternatives second generation biofuels are one of the most promising solutions and nearly reached industrialization . The production of cellulosic bioethanol is one of the possibilities of second generation biofuels and the studies involving the use of cellulosic compounds to produce bioethanol recently increased . Its production involves four dependent steps pretreatment enzymatic hydrolysis fermentation and distillation . This work considered the pretreatment stage aiming at modifying the structure of the lignocellulosic biomass so that cellulose becomes more accessible to enzymatic hydrolysis step .

@highlight Residence time distribution modelling in industrial scale screws is performed.
@highlight A novel experimental methodology suited to harsh thermodynamic conditions is used.
@highlight AD PF CSTR and a model based on the Zusatz function are adjusted and compared.
@highlight The non ideal flow behavior observed is likely to be due to material backflow.
