 Polyphosphazene is utilized in various fields due to its versatility and nontoxic nature however the polycondensation reaction in its preparation process relies on hazardous organic solvents and acid binding agents . In this work we proposed a synthetic method based on both molecule and nanostructure design to prepare cyclomatrix polyphosphazene frameworks in a green and sustainable manner without any solvent . Using block copolymer Pluronic F127 as the structural directing agent and porogen the synthesized product was assembled by nanosheets with a mesoporous structure . The generality of the proposed strategy was also examined in depth . After being doped with cobalt its structure property relationship was studied in flame retarding polypropylene . Polyphosphazene with a high specific surface area and unique morphology was first applied as an eco friendly halogen free flame retardant . With the addition of 18wt of the product the flame retardant PP composite achieved a UL 94V 0 rating with a limiting oxygen index of 26.7 . The peak of heat release rate and total smoke production were also reduced by 60.5 and 32.6 respectively . The composite exhibited an outstanding water resistance as evidenced by constant V 0 rating after soaking in water for 3days . This systematic research will shed light on the advanced structural design and eco benign synthesis strategy of polyphosphazene for more feasible applications .
