 A novel CuO modified ceramic hollow fiber membrane for in situ peroxymonosulfate activation was developed and employed in surface water treatment . The performance of membrane fouling control and organic pollutants removal was systematically investigated . The results indicated that compared with pristine membrane CuO modified ceramic hollow fiber membrane significantly improved the removal of dissolved organic carbon and UV absorbance at 254nm UV
