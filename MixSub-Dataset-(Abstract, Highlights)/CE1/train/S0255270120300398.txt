 Methylene blue removal by means of a filter press electrochemical flowcell operating in recycle mode equipped with graphite electrodes was surveyed . Hydrodynamics and mass transport inside flowcell were evaluated by Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations and validated by experimental Residence Time Distribution technique . Good agreement was observed between experimental data and simulated MB decay . Increasing flowrate from 0.31 to 0.51L min
