 The design of high energy power density supercapacitors requires advanced electrode materials with high surface area suitable pore size for ion diffusion as well as mechanical robustness under high pressure compression . For conventional graphene materials with planar structure high pressure compression inevitably leads to reduced surface area and sluggish ion diffusion due to restacking . Here we present highly crumpled nitrogen doped graphene like material with abundant wrinkles in nanoscale utilizing one step pyrolysis method to enable compression resistant supercapacitive performance . The highly curved structure enabled CNG to retain large specific surface area 952m

@highlight Highly crumpled graphene like material is obtained by one step pyrolysis method.
@highlight The material possesses abundant wrinkles with ultra small curvature radius.
@highlight The crumpled structure avoids restacking of graphene sheets under high pressure.
@highlight Supercapacitors using this material deliver high energy power density.
