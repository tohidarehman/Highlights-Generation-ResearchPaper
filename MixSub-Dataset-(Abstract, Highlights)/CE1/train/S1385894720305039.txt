 The elimination of sulfamethoxazole from water matrix is still challenging in advanced oxidation processes due to the hindrance by background constituents and the generation of toxic by products especially halogenated ones in the presence of halide ions . Herein we reported the catalytic degradation of SMX by combined reactive oxygen species including both radical and non radical mediated processes . The combined ROS of sulfate radicals SO

@highlight Radical non radical combined system was employed for sulfamethoxazole degradation.
@highlight Contribution from reactive species to sulfamethoxazole degradation was evaluated.
@highlight Generation of BrO
@highlight is inhibited in the presence of Br
@highlight Detoxification and degradation pathway of sulfamethoxazole was pH dependent.
