 Highly efficient and cost effective electrocatalysts towards both oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction are critical for the large scale and environmental friendly hydrogen production . Here we report the facile synthesis of a novel bifunctional catalyst mesoporous Co

@highlight Mesoporous Co
@highlight with surface epitaxial S doped CoO layers is synthesized.
@highlight Excellent OER and HER activity and stability in 1M KOH is achieved.
@highlight The current density for overall water splitting reaches 10mAcm
@highlight at 1.60V.
@highlight DFT calculations suggest faster carrier transport after S doping.
