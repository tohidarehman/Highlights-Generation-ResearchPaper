 Desalination plants besides freshwater produce brine and high greenhouse gases emissions . To address both issues this study introduces a solar multieffect distillation thermal vapor compression hybrid system . The aim of the system is to desalinate brine and to recover freshwater and solid salt of high purity . Thus a techno economic model was developed to evaluate this hybrid process in two cases . Numerous sensitivity analyses have been carried out showing that the freshwater cost and the payback period decrease with an increase in freshwater production capacity from 10 m

@highlight A techno economic analysis was performed for brine treatment using SMED TVC system.
@highlight Freshwater cost decreases with increasing freshwater capacity and plant life time.
@highlight Both freshwater and solid salt of high purity can be recovered.
@highlight The profit of treatment with the hybrid system can reach up to US 5.71 m
@highlight Salt recovery significantly increases the potential profit of the hybrid system.
