 Achieving high immobilization performance to reduce the toxicity and bioavailability of heavy metals is critical for the remediation of heavy metals contaminated sediment . Herein a novel chlorapatites with high stability and dispersibility is successfully synthesized using sodium lignin sulfonate as dispersant . Scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscopy characterization demonstrated that SNClAP possessed an internal layered structure and exhibited better dispersibility which was conducive to the immobilization of lead in sediment . Besides SNClAP showed excellent remediation performance towards Pb contaminated sediment with the highest Pb immobilization efficiency of 80.29 which was much higher than that of pristine chlorapatite . The results of available phosphorus showed that the better dispersion of chlorapatites could make soluble phosphorus released by chlorapatites more fully combine with Pb to form the extremely stable Pb

@highlight Sodium lignin sulfonate was applied to fabricated a novel chlorapatite SNClAP .
@highlight SNClAP was used for the remediation of Pb contaminated sediment.
@highlight SNClAP led to excellent immobilization efficiency 80.29 of Pb.
@highlight The reduction efficiency of TCLP leachable Pb was 94.13 by SNClAP remediation.
@highlight Precipitation dominated the whole remediation process.
