 The controlled synthesis of ultrathin metal organic framework nanosheets and the rational design of three dimensional aggregates of these nanosheets are vital for electrochemical applications . Herein ultrathin nickel terephthalate nanosheet 3D aggregates were synthesized by a facile one pot hydrothermal method and employed as electrocatalysts for overall urea electrolysis . Surprisingly the thickness of the nanosheets could be controlled by varying the synthesis time . A low dose high resolution transmission electron microscopy technique with spherical aberration corrected TEM was utilized to visualize the crystalline structures of the ultrathin MOF nanosheets . Interestingly 5 nm thick disordered layers were observed at the edges of the ultrathin nanosheets plausibly induced by vacancies that could not be identified with conventional TEM . The 3D aggregates of the ultrathin nanosheets with disordered layers required an ultralow potential of 1.381V for urea oxidation with a current density of 10mAcm
