 Blast furnace gas ash contains high amounts of metal oxides such as Fe Ca Na and other active substances . In this paper the possibility of BFGA as an effective and low coat catalyst for the decomposition of biomass pyrolysis has been explored based on the high content of iron oxides for high yield of gas and low yield of pyrolysis oil from biomass . The effects of temperature and BFGA on the yield and properties of pyrolysis products were discussed . The variation of pyrolysis gas composition and low heating value of BFGA with temperature was analyzed . The results clearly indicate that adding BGFA to pine pellets can effectively decrease the liquid yield and significantly enhance the yield of pyrolysis gas . The production of H

@highlight In situ catalytic pyrolysis of biomass using BFGA as catalyst is proposed.
@highlight The catalyze effects of temperature and different type of BFGA are determined.
@highlight With the adding of BFGA the yield of liquid is decreased.
@highlight The yield of gas is increased and H
@highlight content is improved under the action of BFGA.
