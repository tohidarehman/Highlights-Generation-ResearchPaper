 In this work in addition to the presence of cool white luminescence under ultraviolet illumination after removing illumination transitory phosphorescence was observed in pure tin fluorophosphate glass prepared by traditional melting methods . By dynamic spectroscopy analysis its novel coexistence of fluorescence and phosphorescence phenomenon was attributed to the double relaxation behavior of T

@highlight The coexistence of fluorescence and phosphorescence was found in the tin fluorophosphate glass.
@highlight The energy transfer model demonstrates the mechanism of double relaxation emissions of T
@highlight in Sn
@highlight The glass shows the effective photoelectric response and luminous efficiency properties.
