 A separator is an indispensable part of a lithium ion battery and can seriously affect the battery performance . This study demonstrates the feasibility of a non solvent induced phase separation mechanism for the preparation of lithium ion battery separators . Based on the mechanism polyacrylonitrile solutions were prepared with different proportions of dimethylformamide and tetrahydrofuran for electrospinning to prepare separators . The surface and interior of the fibers of the electrospun membranes show different morphologies which make a difference in the performance of batteries based on these separators . The property mixing of DMF and THF can cause microporous structures on the surface and inside of the electrospun fibers and some pores are internal and external interconnected . This improves the porosity ionic conductivity 1.96mScm

@highlight Electrospun PAN separator for LIB based on the NIPS was fabricated.
@highlight The fiber of the separator has pores on the surface and interconnected pores inside.
@highlight The structure and function of the fiber membrane are related to the THF.
@highlight The separator can have good porosity and electrolyte absorption.
@highlight The separator can have good charge and discharge performance.
