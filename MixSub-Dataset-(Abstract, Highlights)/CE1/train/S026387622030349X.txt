 The extended use of niosomes in food cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries demands novel preparation processes which could enhance nanovesicles production with controlled size and size distribution . Microfluidics are a novel promising set of preparation methods for this purpose . Studies comparing methods for niosome preparation are still scarce .

@highlight Monodispersed controlled size niosomes production by Microfluidics MF was studied.
@highlight Tween 80 and Span 80 were used in presence and absence of Dodecanol.
@highlight Results were compared to Thin Film Hydration TFH and Ethanol Injection EI methods.
@highlight MF showed an accurate control of the final size of the niosomes produced.
@highlight MF were smaller and more homogeneous to those achieved by TFH and similar to IE.
