 A robust nanofibrous membrane with dual layer composite structure and remarkable features has been developed in this work . The new membrane is based on the affordable styrene acrylonitrile polymer and a commercial hydrophilic nonwoven for the support layer . This can help to step forward the industrialization of the direct contact membrane distillation process for treating the hot dyeing effluent in the textile industry . The modified electrospinning with a gas jet surrounding the Taylor cone was used for fabricating the membrane samples . Using the gas assisted electrospinning a nanofibrous nonwoven structure embedded with micro cups and micro spheres can be achieved in a one step gas assisted electrospinning . The hydrophilic substrate was used for enhancing the permeate flux of the resultant composite membrane . The fabricated membrane showed remarkable features in comparison with a commercial polytetrafluoroethylene membrane including high surface hydrophobicity higher porosity and smaller tortuosity factor . The unique properties of the membrane with the best performance provided a promising permeate flux 28.31 kg.m
