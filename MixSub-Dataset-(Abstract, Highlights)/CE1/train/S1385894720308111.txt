 Rationally constructing the electrode with the hierarchical structure different components and the flexibility is a promising approach to further improve the electrochemical properties and meet the demand for flexible electronic devices . In this paper for the first time hafnium carbide nanowires HfC

@highlight The hierarchical free standing core shell NiCo
@highlight @HfC
@highlight  CC was obtained.
@highlight HfC
@highlight network was used as the superhighway for electron transport.
@highlight NiCo
@highlight @HfC
@highlight  CC exhibits excellent electrochemical properties.
@highlight The hybrid supercapacitor shows good performance stability and flexibility.
