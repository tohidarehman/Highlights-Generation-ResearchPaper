 Bubble size is an important variable in aerated stirred tanks as it determines the surface area available for reactions . In the bubble break up process impellers play a key role . Despite this importance research into the effect of impeller design on bubble size is scarce . In this work we study the effect of two impellers with and without a stator as well as the effect of airflow rate impeller speed and surfactant concentration on bubble size .

@highlight Impeller design and operation have an important effect on bubble size.
@highlight Changes to impeller design affect the impact of impeller speed on bubble size.
@highlight The stator reduces
@highlight by reducing the number of large bubbles in the tank.
@highlight There is a critical impeller speed at which
@highlight is minimised regardless of air flow.
