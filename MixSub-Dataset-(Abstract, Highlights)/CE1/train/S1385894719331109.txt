 N containing organic wastewater is harmful to human health and ecosystem while its degradation remains a huge challenge for decarburization and denitrification simultaneously . In this paper we proposed a new photoelectrochemical method of chlorine oxide radicals production to oxidize mixture wastewater of phenol and N ammonia into N

@highlight Efficient degradation of N containing organic wastewater via chlorine oxide radical was proposed.
@highlight Chlorine oxide radical was generated via a photoelectrochemical system.
@highlight N ammonia was oxidized directly into N
@highlight with the reaction of chlorine oxide radical.
