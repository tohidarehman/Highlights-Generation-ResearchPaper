 In the current numerical study three dimensional heat and fluid flow over various arrangements of the tube bank are simulated via realizable K as the turbulence model . A new arrangement twisted tube bank is introduced and compared with the other common arrangements inline and staggered . Temperature dependent properties are assumed for the working fluids . The suggested experimental equations of the previous studies are used for the model validation . The influence of the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers dimensionless transverse and longitudinal pitches twist angle and dimensionless shell diameter on the thermo hydraulic performance are perused . Two equations are proposed for estimation of the Nusselt number and friction factor as functions of these variables . Results indicate that if the Reynolds number is doubled the Nusselt number increases by 71.2 and the friction factor reduces by 27.9 . Furthermore it was found the twisted arrangement could increase the Nusselt number by 22.8 and 7.5 compared to the inline and staggered arrangements respectively at the optimum twist angle . While the friction factor increases only by 36 and 2.47 compared to the inline and staggered arrangements respectively .

@highlight The best value for the wall and energy Prandtl number for the simulation is 0.04.
@highlight and
@highlight equations are in good agreement with the results.
@highlight The twisted arrangement have higher Nusselt number than inline and staggered arrangements.
@highlight The Chebyshev Rational order 10 10 are used as the curve fit for the relation between Nu and f with .
