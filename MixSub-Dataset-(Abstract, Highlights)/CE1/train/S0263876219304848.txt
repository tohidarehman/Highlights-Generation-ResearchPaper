 In this study adsorption equilibria and kinetics of propane and propylene on Cu MOF 74 and Co MOF 74 were investigated at temperatures of 303 323 343 and 363

@highlight Cu MOF 74 and Co MOF 74 were evaluated for propane propylene separation using volumetric method.
@highlight Cu MOF 74 showed higher adsorption selectivity 12.7 as well as higher adsorption capacity compared to Co MOF 74.
@highlight Adsorption uptake curves were fitted by isothermal micropore model.
@highlight Results from uptake curve measurement showed the fast diffusion of propane and propylene to the Cu MOF 74 structure.
