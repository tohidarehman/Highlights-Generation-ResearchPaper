 Nowadays combined photothermal therapy and imaging diagnosis based on nanotheranostic agents are attracting increasing interest in tumor therapy field . However facile synthesis approach and excellent biocompatibility of the nanoagents are highly desired but still remain a challenge . It is also difficult to eliminate the phototoxicity of the agent to normal tissues resulting from the lack of tumor targeting by traditional approaches . Herein a biosafe Gd integrated Dy nanoagent BSA Gd

@highlight The biocompatible BSA Gd 
@highlight NPs were developed through biomimetic strategy.
@highlight Gd and Dy were simultaneously doped into BSA to realize
@highlight  MR CT imaging.
@highlight The PDA coated and FA modified NPs performed high photothermal therapy efficiency.
@highlight The NPs could eliminate the tumor and inhibit the tumor lung metastasis and recurrence.
