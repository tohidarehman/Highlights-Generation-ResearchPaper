 Direct contact membrane distillation and high temperature nanofiltration were compared in terms of technical and economic aspects for the treatment of pressure oxidation process real effluent . Tests were carried out in bench scale and differences in fouling behavior and its impacts on NF and MD performance were evaluated . High pollutants rejection rates were observed for both systems . However DCMD had better permeate quality and lower energy requirement which contributed significantly to its lower operational costs due to use of the effluent residual heat . CAPEX and OPEX were estimated at US m

@highlight The performance of high temperature NF and DCMD was compared
@highlight DCMD showed better physical chemical quality compared to NF
@highlight The energy cost related to DCMD was significantly lower 99.47 compared to NF
