 The materials with highly aligned tight arrangement at nano and molecular level exhibit extraordinary mechanical properties . Bacterial cellulose is a three dimensional network hydrogel formed by layers of disordered nanofibers generated by bacteria . Because of the disordered arrangement of nanofibers and the strong interaction between nanofibers it is impossible for BC to give full play to the excellent mechanical properties of nanocellulose . In this paper we first adopted an easily realized method to obtain high strength BC ultrathin film with highly aligned tight nanofiber structure . First the hydrogen bond between nanofibers was weakened by simple solvent replacement and then we stretched the BC hydrogel to 2040 to realize the nanofiber alignment . After by hot pressing drying we first realized the peeling of BC film layer by layer to obtain the high strength ultrathin films inspired by graphene peeling method . The highest strength of the obtained film with thickness of 410m was up to 758MPa and the toughness up to 42.3MJm

@highlight BC nanofiber alignment was achieved via a simple one step solvent assisted drawing.
@highlight It is the first time to realize the peeling of BC film layer by layer to obtain BC ultrathin film.
@highlight The ultrathin film simultaneously exhibited high tensile strength 758MPa and high toughness 42.3MJm
@highlight  .
@highlight The BC ultrathin film can be twisted to super strong fibers or multifunctional fibers.
@highlight The fiber exhibited high tensile strength 954.2MPa and the record high toughness 93.2MJm
