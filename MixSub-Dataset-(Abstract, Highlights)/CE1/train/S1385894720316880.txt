 A novel strategy of utilizing eggshell wastes to condition food wastes anaerobic fermentation for efficient volatile fatty acids production was proposed . The VFAs production especially acetic and butyric acids was significantly accelerated and enhanced by eggshell conditioning . The enhanced effects were dose dependent and improved by approximate 13 folds with optimal dose when compared with that in control . Eggshell conditioning synchronously enhanced the FW solubilization hydrolysis and acidification steps resulting in high VFAs production . Further analysis found that the environmental conditions
