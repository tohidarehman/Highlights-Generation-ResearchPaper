 Since biomagnification takes place in food chains cadmium contamination in paddy fields has aroused substantial concern . The remediation of soil cadmium by amendment addition has been commonly implemented in agriculture . However for sustainable development this technology still has unclear microbial and metabolic effects . In the present study a 3 month in situ field scale experiment was performed to clarify how five compound amendments with different pH values affect the Cd concentration soil microbes and metabolic activities related to Cd transformation . Compared with the control treatment CK1 the five amendments noticeably decreased the content of soil available Cd which was lowest in alkaline treatments . In the acidic treatment the Shannon diversity was reduced in both June and September whereas the abundant genera related to ammonia oxidation namely

@highlight Lower pH was conducive to the intracellular Cd accumulation in microbes.
@highlight Sulfate dissimilation effected the extracellular Cd immobilization negligibly.
@highlight Nitrogen fixation microorganisms mediated the extracellular complexation of Cd.
