 Ti based oxides have attracted extensive attention as promising lithium intercalated materials for hybrid capacitors . However the low electronic conductivity and sluggish lithiation dynamics hinder their performance including reversible capacity rate capability and cycle stability . Herein we report a kind of quasi layered titanate hydrates deriving from the dehydration induced structural rearrangement of Ti O octahedra and their superior electrochemical performance in the quasi solid state Li ion capacitors . As predicted by Mulliken charge analysis the surrounding O atoms will transfer electrons to the central Ti atoms accompanying with the detachment of bonding OH groups . The resulting unpaired 3

@highlight Quasi layered titanates with superior Li ion storage performance have been proposed.
@highlight The Q TH anode is equipped with fast Li ion diffusion and lower activation barriers.
@highlight The structural rearrangement induces the charge redistribution between O and Ti atoms.
@highlight The quasi solid state LICs present impressive energy density and cycle stability.
