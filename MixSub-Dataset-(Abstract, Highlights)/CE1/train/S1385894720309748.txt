 Direct interspecies electron transfer between exoelectrogenic fatty acid oxidizing bacteria and electrotrophic methanogens has recently been discovered and studies have suggested that promoting DIET by adding electrically conductive material can effectively enhance the methanogenic performance and stability of anaerobic digestion . This study investigated the effect of conductive magnetite Fe

@highlight The effect of magnetite on anaerobic digestion of sulfur rich biomass was studied.
@highlight Magnetite addition did not induce an apparent enhancement of CH
@highlight production.
@highlight The production of H
@highlight S in biogas was significantly reduced by magnetite addition.
@highlight Magnetite promoted the anaerobic microbial oxidation of sulfide to S
@highlight through DIET.
@highlight A novel electric syntrophy between unknown ASOBs and methanogens is proposed.
