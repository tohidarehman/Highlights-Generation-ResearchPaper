 The versatility of rattle type microspheres is tightly correlated with the composition and morphology . Exploring advanced rattle type microspheres with simultaneous controllable composition and micro nanostructures via novel designed and regulated strategies may have great advantages for performing complex tasks . Herein cellulose inorganic hybrid rattle type microspheres produced using microalgae as natural chemical reservoirs microreactors and matrix is reported . By adjusting only pH and temperature rattle type microspheres with simultaneously controllable mesoporous outer shells and multicomponent nano cores i.e . Ca

@highlight Rattle type microspheres are fabricated using microalgae as single source precursor.
@highlight Microalgae act as natural chemical reservoir microreactor and matrix.
@highlight Microspheres with simultaneous adjustable pore size shell and composite nano cores.
@highlight Microspheres are an ideal signal multiplier for highly sensitive immunoassay.
@highlight Enhancement of sensitivity is due to the tunable compositions and morphology.
