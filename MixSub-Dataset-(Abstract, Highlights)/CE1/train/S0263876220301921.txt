 A repeatable method was introduced for developing liable flat sheet thin film forward osmosis membranes on spacer backing fabric support . Pasting of a water soluble polymer on the backside of the fabric was investigated to prevent the penetration of the polymer dope into the backing fabric during phase inversion . All samples were prepared on spacer fabric with a 250

@highlight Thin film composite forward osmosis FO membranes with permeate spacer fabric were synthesized.
@highlight The water soluble polymer PVP employed as paste on the back of the fabric.
@highlight Polymer penetration and thickness were controlled thanks to applied PVP.
@highlight PVP washed up during phase inversion in water bath.
