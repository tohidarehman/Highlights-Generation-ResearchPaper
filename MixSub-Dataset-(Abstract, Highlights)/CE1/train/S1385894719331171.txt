 The development of highly efficient photocatalytic materials and composites has been one of the main goals in the energy and environmental fields . To this date however the efficiency and stability of photocatalytic materials are still very low . This work shows a novel strategy of Pd coated TiO

@highlight The synergistic effect of Pd decorated TiO
@highlight  Si nanopillars for photocatalytic applications was investigated.
@highlight A comprehensive physico chemical characterization of the pillars will be presented.
@highlight The capability of this route to enable and enhance the catalytic activity to the as prepared structures will be discussed.
@highlight The ability of these pillars to boost water evaporation rates will be demonstrated.
@highlight The general cooperative performance of nanostructures will be explained by a combined OER HER mechanism.
