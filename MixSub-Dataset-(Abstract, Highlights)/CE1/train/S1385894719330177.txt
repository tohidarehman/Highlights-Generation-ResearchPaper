 The performances of a photocatalyst in volatile organic compound adsorption photon harvesting and charge separation largely determine its VOC mineralization efficiency . To simultaneously optimize these properties this work constructed a hollow heterophase junction by coating anatase TiO

@highlight Anatase TiO
@highlight hollow spheres were coated with porous amorphous TiO
@highlight The content of micropores and mesopores was greatly increased.
@highlight The formed heterophase junction redshifted the light absorption edge.
@highlight The formed heterophase junction enhanced the charge separation.
@highlight Mineralization efficiency of toluene and acetone was significantly improved.
