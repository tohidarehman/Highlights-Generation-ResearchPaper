 In this study we fabricated ultrafiltration mixed matrix membranes through wet phase inversion method of cellulose acetate blended with polydopamine particles solution . PDA as an organic and hydrophilic particle altered the physicochemical and antifouling property of CA membranes . X ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of PDA particles on the membrane surface . Adding PDA particles led to the formation of macrovoids onto the cross sectional morphology of CA membranes . This also improved the membrane porosity pore size and hydrophilicity . At an optimum concentration of 0.2

@highlight Polydopamine PDA particles were embedded in cellulose acetate CA membrane.
@highlight PDA particles improved the porosity and hydrophilicity of the CA membrane.
@highlight Modified membranes delivered higher flux and better antifouling property.
