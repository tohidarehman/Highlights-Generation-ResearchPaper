 The aim of this paper is to study the enhancement mechanism of adsorptive particles on gas liquid interfacial mass transfer . A quantitative model for predicting enhancement factor is proposed based on film model and interfacial non equilibrium model in which the enhancement factor depends mainly on the surface fractional coverage

@highlight A new enhancement model of adsorptive particles on gas liquid mass transfer was proposed.
@highlight Enhancement was divided into particle transport controlled regime and surface adsorption controlled regime.
@highlight Influences of surface fractional coverage and solute bulk concentration on enhancement factor were investigated theoretically.
