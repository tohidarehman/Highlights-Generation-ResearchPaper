 Efficient charge separation and high photo stability are crucial for sustainable solar to hydrogen energy conversion over photocatalysts . Here we describe a facile synthetic strategy to construct the novel direct Z scheme tandem heterojunction consisting of the zero dimensional ultrafine cadmium sulfide nanograins and the two dimensional ultrathin tungsten trioxide tungsten disulfide WO

@highlight A novel direct Z scheme WO
