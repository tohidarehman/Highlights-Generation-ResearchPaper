 In this work the mixing efficiency is studied in case of different multibore nozzle constructions in a pretreatment part of a continuous reactor . Computational Fluid Dynamics is used to model the multijet mixer and design of the nozzle is carried out by simulation studies . The simulation model is validated by residence time experiments performed in a laboratory device with the same spatial scale as in the industrial case . The aim of the study is to find the most effective nozzle design out of some limited number of physically realizable constructions considering predefined mixing metrics . Poincar maps are prepared by a particle tracking study and the derived mixing maps are introduced to give a first impression about the quality of mixing . According to the quantified results the nozzle with 6 bores angled at 23 degrees is proposed as the optimal construction which reduces the volume of the dead zones and increases the mixing efficiency providing a proper pretreatment of the inlet stream for the consequent reactor unit .
