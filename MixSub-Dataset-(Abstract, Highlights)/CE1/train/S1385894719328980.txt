 Hydrogen isotope separation under moderate conditions with high selectivity remains a huge challenge due to the identical physicochemical properties of the isotopes . Here we present zeolite materials with an excellent thermal stability and highly selective for hydrogen isotope separation through dihydrogen bond on ion exchanged Cu centers . Thermal desorption spectroscopy measurements show that hydrogen isotope separation and enrichment can be carried out in a technologically favorable temperature range from liquid nitrogen temperature to near room temperature and a D
