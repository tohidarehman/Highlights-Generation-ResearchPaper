 Fine particles were separated by applying an electrostatic field in a designed wet classifier to improve the classification performance . Separation experiments were performed using fine silica particles with a size range from 0.21 to 8.71 m based on the zeta potential of the suspended particles in the water . The effects of feed flow rate electrode voltage and feed particle concentration on separation performance were discussed . The results show that partial separation efficiency increased with feed flow rate and feed particle concentration but decreased with electrode voltage . Maximum total separation efficiency was achieved at a given feed flow rate a given electrode voltage and a given feed particle concentration . The total separation efficiency reached 61.9 when the nozzle diameter was 1.0 mm the feed flow rate was 46.2 mL min and the electrode voltage was 150 V which was higher by approximately 11.1 compared to gravity settling . The separation factor for electrostatic wet classification reached 44 000 for 0.5 m particles . The 50 cut size decreased linearly with the increase in electrode voltage and a minimum 50 cut size of 1.033 m was obtained . Particle agglomeration effect fishhook effect and strong reverse flow should be considered when wet classification technology is employed in engineering applications .
