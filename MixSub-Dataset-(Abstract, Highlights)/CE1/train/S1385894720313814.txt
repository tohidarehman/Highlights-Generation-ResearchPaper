 Cavitation used to be associated with negative outcomes in hydraulic turbomachinery but nowadays it is often used for water cleaning microorganisms destruction and degradation of organic compounds . This study investigated the amount of

@highlight High concentration of SA significantly influences cavitation dynamics.
@highlight Physical and chemical explanations for the observed anomalies are given.
@highlight Change in surface tension coalescence and nucleation influence cavitation the most.
@highlight Past results on radical formation by cavitation may be falsely interpreted.
@highlight Special care needs to be given to cavitation characteristics in dosimetry studies.
