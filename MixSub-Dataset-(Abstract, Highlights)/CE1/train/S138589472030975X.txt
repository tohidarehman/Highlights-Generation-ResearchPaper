 Although lithium sulfur batteries have high theoretical capacity and energy density their practical applications have been hampered by the rapid decay of capacity caused by the shuttle effect of polysulfides . In this paper we synthesize the MoS

@highlight MoS
@highlight  Ni
@highlight yolk shell heterostructure material was prepared by hydrothermal method.
@highlight The heterostructure material itself was used for sulfur loading for the first time.
@highlight The heterojunction between MoS
@highlight and Ni
@highlight accelerates reaction dynamics.
@highlight Yolk shell structure enables fast electron ion transport and high sulfur loading.
@highlight The MoS
@highlight  Ni
@highlight composites exhibit superior electrochemical performance.
