 Remote control of microfluidic locomotion by external stimuli is attracting extensive attention due to its practical applications in various areas such as chemical reactors gas sensors and transporters . Within this report we describe an effective method of preparing liquid marbles stabilized by super hydrophobic luminescent carbon dots and demonstrate their outstanding photothermics fluorescence and diamagnetism . The super hydrophobic CDs were synthesized by surface functionalization using polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane and manipulation of the LMs was achieved using light electricity and magnetism . LMs could act as ideal models of collision triggered miniature reactors for enhanced chemical reactions with fast mixing of microfluidics leading to substantial improvement in reaction rate and selectivity . For the first time the use of collisions triggered by multi external stimuli has been demonstrated showing an intensification to the micromixing process and therefore an enhancement to the microreactions . We expect that these LMs can be applicable in microfluidics miniaturized reactors and many other associated industries .
