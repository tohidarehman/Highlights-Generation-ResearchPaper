 Soil co contaminated with heavy metals and pesticides has caused large global environmental issues . The interaction of heavy metals and pesticides make the contamination situation more complicated . It is crucial to remediate the co contaminated soil by heavy metals and pesticides . Bioremediation has the advantages of high efficiency low cost easy available harmless for the ecosystem and high public acceptance which has been widely developed in remediation of combined pollution of heavy metals and pesticides . This paper reviews the bioremediation applications of combined contaminated soil with heavy metals and pesticides . Abiotic and biotic factors can all affect the bioremediation of heavy metals and pesticides . Meanwhile the present review summarizes the bioremediation mechanisms of heavy metals and pesticides by microorganisms and plants . The effectiveness evaluation methods of soil remediation are also reviewed . Based on above this review proposes the future investigations required for this field .

@highlight The bioremediation applications of co contaminated soils with metals and pesticides were reviewed.
@highlight Factors affecting bioremediation of heavy metals and pesticides were discussed.
@highlight The bioremediation mechanisms and effectiveness evaluation methods of co contaminated soil were introduced.
@highlight Potential research needs for this field were proposed.
