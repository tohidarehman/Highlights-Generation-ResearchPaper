 In this research a ZnO Mg nano photocatalyst was synthesized by solvent combustion using microwave waves and its efficiency and application in the removal of furfural were evaluated . The synthesized nano photocatalyst was characterized by XRD FESEM EDX MAP and band gap techniques which showed that crystalline nanocomposite particles were synthesized uniformly . Also the average particle size of the syntheses is 60nm and the photocatalyst energy band is 3.02 electron volts . The removal of furfural pollutants was maximized using UV irradiation at 0.1g L photocatalyst and pH 5 conditions . Under optimal conditions furfural degradation analysis by mass chromatography showed that the photocatalytic process is an effective method for removing the pollutant . Also modeling and kinetic studies showed that this process follows the Langmuir Hinshelwood model and the pseudo first order kinetics it also shows quadratic mathematical model .
