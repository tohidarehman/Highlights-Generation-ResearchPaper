 In this contribution a data driven control approach was developed and applied experimentally to a pharmaceutical batch cooling crystallization process . In this approach a radial basis functions network model was trained in real time with experimental data with two different input data update strategies . The control objective was to optimize the cooling profile with the aid of trained RBF to achieve the desired crystal population profile throughout the process . The robustness of the proposed control strategy was tested with 10 comprehensive experiments in the presence of several disturbances . The presented control strategy was able to easily handle all the case scenarios . In 8 cases the experimental crystal population profile followed successfully the reference with less than 10 offset . In the remaining 2 cases the offset was 17 that was due to the absence of the supersaturation . The proposed RBF network driven control is a promising strategy that is easy to implement fully automated and relies on relatively limited data for training . Therefore the RBF control is expected to contribute to quick process development and control especially when there is a lack of comprehensive process understanding and historical data especially in the pharmaceutical industry .
