 The enzymatic activity and practical applications of immobilized enzymes were severely influenced by their location orientation and microenvironment which played the key roles in maintaining the active conformation and accelerating the reaction process of the desired enzymes . Herein we presented a general approach to prepare magnetic DNA nanocompartments for encapsulation of metabolic model cascade multi enzymes glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase through self assembly . The enzymes were spatially confined in the well designed DNA compartments which were located at the gap areas of magnetic particles . Systematic studies indicated the proximity effect of the multi enzymes and the high negative charge density microenvironment of the DNA compartments contributed to the high cascade activity together . In addition the immobilization enzymes within magnetic DNA compartment remarkably increased the overall catalytic efficiency operational stability and reusability . The
