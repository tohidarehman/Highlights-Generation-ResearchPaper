 Dry reforming of methane is a potentially useful reaction but has some drawbacks catalyst deactivation by coke and yield limited by thermodynamic equilibrium . New improved fluidized bed reactors may compensate these disadvantages . Mathematical models for the dry reforming of methane in three types of fluidized bed reactors have been developed . These reactors include a conventional fluidized bed reactor b two zone fluidized bed reactor which provides simultaneous reaction and catalyst regeneration in a single fluidized bed and c two zone fluidized bed reactor with hydrogen selective membranes which in addition to the previous one provides increased yield to hydrogen because the selective removal of hydrogen through the membrane . The situations where these reactors counteract the two main drawbacks of dry reforming of methane are shown . Comparison with previous experimental results shows that the models predict well the effect of operating conditions .
