 Recently the switchable wetting surfaces between superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity have been widely studied . However for almost all existing surfaces especially inorganic responsive smart surfaces TiO

@highlight A new surface is prepared by coating the TiO
@highlight nanoparticles on the SMP pillar arrays.
@highlight The surface realize the restoration of superhydrophobic superhydrophilic switching.
@highlight The restorable functional application in droplet storage is demonstrated.
@highlight The strategy can easily be extended to other inorganic oxides such as ZnO and V
