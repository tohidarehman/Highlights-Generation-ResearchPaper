 The oxygen carrier plays a vital role in chemical looping combustion . Development of low cost oxygen carriers is of great significance to the engineering application of chemical looping techniques . In this study pyrite cinder a byproduct from the process of sulfuric acid production was used as an oxygen carrier in CH

@highlight Pyrite cinder presented stable redox performance with the highest CH
@highlight conversion and CO
@highlight selectivity.
@highlight Active lattice oxygen in pyrite cinder enhanced complete CH
@highlight combustion at low reaction temperature.
@highlight Pyrite cinder showed high resistance to sintering deactivation.
