 The practical deployment of high energy Lithium sulfur batteries has been largely impeded by inferior cycling performance and poor rate capability owning to polysulfides shuttling and sluggish reaction kinetics . To conquer both the two problems simultaneously herein an effective sulfur host has been demonstrated through implanting vanadium nitride nanoparticles homogeneously into nitrogen doped 3D interconnected pore graphene hybrid architecture . The VN nanoparticles derived from the cracking and transformation of V
