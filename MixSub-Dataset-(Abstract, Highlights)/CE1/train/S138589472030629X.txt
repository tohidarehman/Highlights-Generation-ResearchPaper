 Remediation of contaminated agricultural soils focused on fixing heavy metals in soils to reduce their bioavailability . However with the influence of pH redox potential and microorganism in the soils heavy metals were likely to be released from a fixed state . The study aims to investigate magnetic porous biochar spheres and their roles in

@highlight A biochar sphere was prepared through a one step gelation and pyrolysis strategy.
@highlight The biochar sphere showed excellent flotation and magnetism performance.
@highlight The biochar sphere significantly decreased Cd II and As V concentrations in soils.
@highlight Fixed Cd II and As V in soils can be activated.
@highlight The biochar sphere can be recycled after use.
