 A novel design for a three channel internal recirculation type reactor is described . The reactor has an extremely compact design that consists of inlet and outlet channels filled with an inert structured packing on either side of a reactor channel containing a catalytic washcoated monolith . The reactor stream flows in counter current flow with the flow in the inlet and the outlet channels . The reaction studied is the catalytic combustion of lean dry methane at low feed temperature . Autogenous operation can be obtained over a reasonable set of operating conditions which makes the unit potential suitable for the destruction of fugitive emissions from an underground coal mine and other spatially restricted environments .

@highlight A novel three channel autogenous reactor for lean methane combustion is described.
@highlight Low temperature feed streams can be completely reacted.
@highlight The geometrical design is critical for optimal operation.
