 While an increasing number of superhydrophobic surfaces have been developed in the past two decades due to their tremendous application potential they generally suffer from low durability as their liquid repellency could be easily damaged by chemical or mechanical erosion . A promising route to address this issue is to design self healable superhydrophobic surfaces that can restore the liquid repellency upon external damage . Although several types of self healable superhydrophobic surfaces have been prepared by introducing healable polymers or migratable low surface energy materials these surfaces are limited by the requisite of external energy input to drive the healing process or long self healing time . Inspired by the self healing mechanism of wax secretion in natural plant leaves herein we report a unique self healing superhydrophobic poly

@highlight A novel self healing superhydrophobic PDMS C
@highlight composite surface is reported.
@highlight The surface can recover its superhydrophobicity after severe plasma etching or physical damage.
@highlight The surface mimics the self healing mechanism of wax secretion in natural plant leaves.
@highlight The surface exhibits a remarkably fast self healing speed.
