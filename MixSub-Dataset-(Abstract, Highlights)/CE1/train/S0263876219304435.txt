 In this work we propose a fault detection and isolation methodology that enables diagnose of single multiple and simultaneous actuator and sensor faults regardless of the utilized model structure . The basis of the proposed methodology is modelling and inversion of nonlinear systems using recurrent neural network s. To this end a bank of RNNs is used to estimate system inputs and or outputs and build predictive models using the obtained estimates and an RNN as the plant model . Then a bank of residuals is generated in a way each residual is sensitive to a subset of faults and insensitive to the rest and as a result of this a unique fault signature is obtained for each fault scenario . RNNs can be replaced by other machine learning techniques such as partial least square s random forest etc . One of the advantages of the proposed methodology is that it does not require the existence of plant fault history or first principles models unlike other existing results in the literature . Also it enables isolation of actuator and simultaneous actuator and sensor faults in highly interconnected systems . The effectiveness of the proposed FDI scheme is shown via simulation examples .

@highlight An FDI framework based on black box models for diagnosis of different fault scenarios.
@highlight Performance of the FDI design does not rely directly on plant model structure.
@highlight FDI is achieved without using a first principles model or plant fault history.
@highlight Analytical estimation filters and other data driven approaches can be used as well.
