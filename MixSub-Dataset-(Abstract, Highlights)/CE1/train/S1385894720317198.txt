 Endowing conjugate microporous polymers with appropriate electrical conductivity greatly expands the application scope of CMPs especially in electronic related applications . In this paper we report a strategy to prepare electrically conductive CMPs via confined polymerization of pyrrole in micropores . The conductive CMPs shows remarkably enhanced dielectric loss behaviors toward microwaves and exhibits high electromagnetic absorption performance where the effective EMA bandwidth reaches 7.52GHz and the maximal absorption achieves 59.7dB . A confining model is adopted to explain the reason for the enhanced dielectric loss of conductive CMPs . This research expands application scope of CMPs in areas of conductive materials .
