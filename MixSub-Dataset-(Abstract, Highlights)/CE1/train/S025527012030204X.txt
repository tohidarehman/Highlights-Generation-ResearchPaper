 Valorization of agro industrial waste by the extraction of bioactive molecules and their activity preservation by encapsulation is an open topic in process engineering . In this work a combined approach for the recovery of antioxidants from spent coffee grounds by High Pressure and Temperature Extraction and the entrapment of extract into liposomes using the Supercritical assisted Liposome formation process was proposed . High Pressure and Temperature Extraction showed that high extraction performances 432.3mg

@highlight A combined process for bioactive extraction and preservation was proposed.
@highlight High pressure and temperature extraction allowed spent coffee grounds valorization.
@highlight Extract was rich in polyphenols and caffeine exhibiting high scavenging activity.
@highlight Produced loaded liposomes showed small size and high encapsulation efficiency.
