 Metal organic frameworks have been widely used for drug delivery systems due to their high drug loading content and easy modification . But it remains the biggest challenge to exploring biocompatible MOFs with uniform small sizes and well defined surface chemistry for tumor therapy . Especially the hollow structured MIL 125 Titanium nano MOFs have not been prepared for drug carriers . Therefore we studied a facile approach to synthesize hollow structured Ti based nano MOF via surfactant coordination modulation . The as prepared nanomaterials exhibited uniform size of 200nm and large BET surface area of 1134m

@highlight A facile approach to synthesize biocompatible hollow structured MIL 125 Ti nano MOFs.
@highlight The optimal MIL 125 Ti HA nanoparticles were synthesized for delivery of doxorubicin.
@highlight The NPs had high DOX loading contents with pH sensitive release.
@highlight The NPs could escape from lysosomes to improve intracellular drug accumulation.
