 Pyrolysis process of metal organic frameworks was analyzed by thermal analysis kinetics for the study of the synthesis of MOFs based carbon materials with high adsorption performance . The process was studied based on the thermogravimetric mass spectrometry through which the gas products of the pyrolysis process were detected . The HKUST 1 and MIL 101 were prepared by solvothermal method and characterized by XRD BET SEM and TEM . The characterization results showed that HKUST 1 and MIL 101 have been successfully prepared with cubic octahedral morphology and specific surface areas up to 1477.50m

@highlight Pyrolysis processes of typical MOFs were studied including HKUST 1 and MIL 101.
@highlight HKUST 1 and MIL 101 could be divided into three stages and seven stages.
@highlight The values of
@highlight in the dehydration stage of both two MOFs were less than 100kJ mol.
@highlight Mechanisms of main weight loss step were all random nucleation and subsequent growth.
@highlight Nature differences of MOFs might cause significant differences in deepening stage.
