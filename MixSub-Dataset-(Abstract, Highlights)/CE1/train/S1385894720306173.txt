 Multifunctional organic luminescent materials have attracted intensive interests . Nevertheless the mechanisms behind them are still to be explored . In this work we reported four multifunctional emitters with thermally activated delayed fluorescence aggregation induced emission multicolor mechanochromic luminescence and polymorphism . We also demonstrated their applications in acid base responsive on off chemosensors ink free rewritable paper and organic light emitting diodes . By deeply analyzing their three dimensional supramolecular frameworks with ordered micro pores and different intermolecular interactions in crystal structures we revealed the underlying mechanisms of polymorph dependent TADF and multicolor MCL simultaneously .
