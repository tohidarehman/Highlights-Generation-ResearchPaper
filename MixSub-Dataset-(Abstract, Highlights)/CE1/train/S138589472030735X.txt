 By using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations we investigated the adsorption of Xe Kr mixtures with the mole fractions of Xe ranging from 10 to 90 in single walled carbon nanotubes having diameters of 0.81 to 2.03nm at different temperatures . For the Xe Kr mixture the Xe Kr selectivity decreases with diameter of the CNT at 298K while demonstrating a complex dependency on pressure in CNTs . Due to the single file adsorbate configuration the smaller CNT achieves a higher adsorption capacity than the CNT . At 1bar and 298K the adsorption of Xe and the Xe Kr selectivity achieve their maxima 1.69mol kg and 36.3 in the CNT among the CNTs considered and this optimized selectivity is much superior compared to a large number of metal organic frameworks . We find that increasing temperature generally reduces the adsorptions of Xe and Kr with an exception that the co adsorption of Kr is enhanced in the small CNTs for obtaining additional adsorption volume released by the reduced adsorption of Xe . While increasing temperature reduces the Xe Kr selectivity in all the CNTs the selectivity decreases with the bulk concentration of Xe in the and CNTs and remains almost independent of Xe concentration in the larger CNTs at 1bar . As revealed by the performance coefficient the CNT holds the best performance on the adsorptive separation of Xe Kr in all the cases considered in this work . Our findings reveal that the CNT has a great potential on preventing the uncontrolled emission of Kr while facilitating the commercial usage of Xe .
