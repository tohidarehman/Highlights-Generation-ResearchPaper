 This paper focuses on a novel one step co hydrolysis synthesis strategy of silicon modified N doped titanium dioxide nanocrystals and its application in the visible light photocatalysis of chromium at g L

@highlight The N doped TiO
@highlight microspheres and Si N TiO
@highlight nanocrystals were synthesized through the one step hydrolysis method.
@highlight The cross linking state between nanocrystals increases the oxygen vacancy concentration and provides more transport channels.
@highlight The positively charged nanocrystals had a repulsive effect on the cationic pollutants.
@highlight Removal efficiency of 1.0g L
@highlight Cr VI in 120min was as high as 53 .
