 In this study the effect of graphene oxide and polyvinylpyrrolidone grafted GO on the hydrophilicity and antifouling properties of polyvinylidene fluoride was investigated . PVP GO was synthesized via surface initiated free radical polymerization method . Successful immobilization of PVP on the GO surface was proved by FTIR and XRD analyses . FESEM results of PVP GO nanosheets showed that immobilization increased interlayer space between nanosheets which resulted in better dispersion of PVP GO in PVDF membranes . In addition the presence of GO and PVP GO nanosheets resulted in membranes with more and bigger finger like pores and thinner sponge like layer . Contact angle measurement abrasion resistance and pure water flux of membranes containing different percentage of GO and PVP GO ranging from 0 to 2 wt were investigated . PVDF GO and PVDF PVP GO showed the best hydrophilicity and pure water permeation and therefore their performance was compared with neat PVDF in MBR system . The results indicated that the presence of GO and PVP GO improved antifouling properties of PVDF membrane due to their hydrophilicity .

@highlight GO nanosheets were successfully immobilized with PVP.
@highlight PVP GO enhanced the hydrophilicity and pure water flux of membranes.
@highlight Fouling of PVDF membranes was decreased owing to the presence of PVP GO.
