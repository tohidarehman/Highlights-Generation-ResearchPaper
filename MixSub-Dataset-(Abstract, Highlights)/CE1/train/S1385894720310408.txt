 In this study Cu LTA and Cu SSZ 13 catalysts are examined for sulfur poisoning and regeneration . The nature of the Cu species was probed with H

@highlight Cu LTA and Cu SSZ 13 were synthesized and examined for SO
@highlight poisoning.
@highlight  Cu OH 
@highlight in Cu LTA is found to be more vulnerable to SO
@highlight than Cu SSZ 13.
@highlight In SCR condition with SO
@highlight  Cu LTA can store more SO
@highlight than Cu SSZ 13.
@highlight Cu LTA exhibit a slower deactivation rate than Cu SSZ 13.
@highlight 750C fully regenerates Cu LTA while Cu SSZ 13 show some loss at high temperature.
