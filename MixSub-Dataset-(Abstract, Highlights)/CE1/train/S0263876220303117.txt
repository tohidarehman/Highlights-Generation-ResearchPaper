 Herein a triple layer thin film composite forward osmosis membrane was fabricated via interfacial polymerization of m phenylenediamine and trimesoyl chloride on a tannic acid Fe

@highlight Tannic acid Fe
@highlight interlayer is combined with porous MF substrate for novel TFC FO membrane.
@highlight The TA interlayer played a vital role in the formation of PA selective layer.
@highlight A smooth and ultrathin PA selective layer was achieved by using TA interlayer.
@highlight Water flux is significantly improved without obvious increase of reverse salt flux.
