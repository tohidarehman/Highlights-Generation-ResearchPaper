 Poly dimethyl ethers are fuel additives that can reduce the emissions associated with diesel fuels considerably . POMDME have been synthetized from methylal and trioxane catalyzed by the acidic ion exchange resin Amberlyst 15 . A batch autoclave reactor has been used to carry out experiments conducted up to equilibrium conditions . The resulting POMDME distribution is modelled using the Schulz Flory distribution theory which confirms a sequential chain growth with insertion of one formaldehyde molecule at each reaction step . The kinetic experiments were carried out in an isothermal continuous fixed bed reactor . The influence of temperature and space time 1.63.2kgh m

@highlight POMDMEs were effectively synthesised from methylal trioxane mixtures.
@highlight Chain propagation modelled according to Schulz Flory theory.
@highlight Product distribution depends only on conversion.
@highlight Trioxane decomposition was found to be the rate limiting step.
