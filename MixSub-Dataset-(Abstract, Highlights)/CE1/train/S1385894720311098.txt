 The accurate detection of myoglobin in human serum plays a crucial role in early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction . This work presents a novel impedimetric aptasensor for sensitive and selective detection of Myo in which bimetallic MnCo oxide nanohybrids represented by MnO

@highlight MnO

@highlight hybrids with varying morphologies were derived from the bimetallic PBA.
@highlight A simple anchoring platform was developed for myoglobin determination.
@highlight The developed aptsensor exhibits good sensitivity selectivity and stability.
@highlight The aptasensor also possesses reproducibility and acceptability in human serum.
@highlight The aptamer anchoring platform can be universal for other aptamers.
