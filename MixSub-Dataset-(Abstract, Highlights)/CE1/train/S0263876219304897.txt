 Crystal engineering of hierarchical zeolites is regarded as a promising way to enhance diffusion dependent catalytic properties of zeolitic materials . Crystallization process control on crystal size and pore structure is desirable over porogen based protocols and post synthetic methods for the low cost high yield and potential scalability . Herein a tumbling crystallization of hierarchical ZSM 5 zeolite in immiscible water toluene Pickering emulsion inspired by energy dissipating structure occurring in nature is presented . The structure and acid properties of the obtained hierarchical material have been revealed using a panoply of characterization techniques such as powder X ray diffraction N

@highlight Hierarchical ZSM 5 has been synthesized in a toluene water biphasic media.
@highlight Pickering emulsion structure formed under tumbling crystallization conditions.
@highlight Non classical oriented attachment growth was the dominant crystallization pathway.
@highlight Improvements in catalyst lifetime and light olefin yields were achieved in dimethylether to olefin conversion.
