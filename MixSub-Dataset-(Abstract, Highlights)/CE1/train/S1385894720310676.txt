 Copper nanowire is one of the most promising materials for next generation flexible transparent electrodes . Currently large scale applications of CuNW in FTEs are still hindered by their poor resistance against oxidation chemical and electrochemical corrosion . Previous studies mainly focused on solving a single problem which can hardly overcome these problems simultaneously . Hence

@highlight The sheet resistance of the FTE decreased to 14.2 Ohm sq at a transmittance of 90.1 .
@highlight The stability resistance to oxidation chemical and electrochemical corrosion of the FTE was greatly enhanced.
@highlight A bifunctional electrochromic and supercapacitor device was fabricated based on
@highlight NW FTEs.
