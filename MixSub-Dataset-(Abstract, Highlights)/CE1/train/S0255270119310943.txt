 In this work the removal of chromium from aqueous waste solution by solvent extraction with 2 ethylhexyl phosphonic acid mono 2 ethylhexyl as extractant is investigated in a novel rotor stator spinning disc reactor . The effect of rotational speed volumetric flow rate and rotor stator distance on extraction efficiency and volumetric mass transfer coefficient are studied . Experimental results indicates that the maximum values of extraction efficiency and volumetric mass transfer coefficient are 97.2 and 0.40 1 s respectively . The mass transfer performance inside the rotor stator spinning disc reactor exceeds that of conventional reactors . Moreover it is found that the extraction efficiency increases with the increase of rotational speed but with the decrease of volumetric flow rate and rotor stator distance . The Volumetric mass transfer coefficient increases as both the rotational speed and volumetric flow rate increase but decreases with the increase of rotor stator distance . Furthermore an analysis on the relationships between volumetric mass transfer coefficient and various parameters is launched by the grey correlation method . The calculation result shows good coincidence with the experimental data .
