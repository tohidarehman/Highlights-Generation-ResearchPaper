 Bio oil is a highly valuable product derived from biomass pyrolysis which could be used in various downstream applications upon appropriate upgrading and refining . Extraction and fractionation are two promising methods to upgrade bio oil by separating the complex mixture of bio oil compounds into distinct fine chemicals and fractions enriched in certain classes of chemical compounds . In this review various extraction techniques for bio oil their associated features the characteristics of bio oil extracts and their applications are presented and critically discussed . It was revealed that the most promising technique is via organic solvent extraction . Furthermore the technological gaps and bottlenecks for each separation techniques are disclosed as well as the overall challenges and future prospects of oil palm biomass based bio oil value chain . This review aims to provide key insights on bio oil upgrading via extraction and fractionation and a proposed way forward via technology integration in establishing a sustainable palm oil mill based biorefinery .
