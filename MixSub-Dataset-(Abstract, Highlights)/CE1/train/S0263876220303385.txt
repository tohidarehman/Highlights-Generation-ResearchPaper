 The purpose of this work was to study the hydrodynamic behavior of two viscous waste oils and a silicone oil in a laboratory scale packed column

@highlight Hydrodynamics of two waste oils and PDMS in a structured packing was investigated.
@highlight Pressure drop in the loading zone was lower than 450 Pa m
@highlight Loading and flooding velocities were relatively low especially using the viscous lubricant.
@highlight Billet Schultes correlations were efficient to predict the loading and flooding points and the pressure drop.
@highlight Scale up calculations proved that transformer oil can be used in an industrial scale packed column.
