 It is attractive though it is very challenging to synthesize conductive elastomers with high transparency and self healing ability simultaneously with facile and environmentally friendly preparation process . Here we demonstrate the fabrication of highly transparent self healing conductive elastomers based on synergistic hydrogen bonding interactions between poly and phytic acid molecules . The hybrid network elastomers showed a fast self healing property without any other external stimuli and excellent self healing efficiency within 48h . The poly PA elastomers were highly transparent intrinsically conductive an ionic conductivity of 7.810

@highlight Highly transparent self healing conductive elastomers were prepared.
@highlight Synergistic H bonding interactions were employed for the self healing mechanism.
@highlight Poly PDES PA elastomers were used to monitor the human activities.
