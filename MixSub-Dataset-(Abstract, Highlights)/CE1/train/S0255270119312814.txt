 A novel approach was developed for producing biodiesel by acid ionic liquid catalyzed esterification of oleic acid and methanol under ultrasonic microwave combined intensification . Four kinds of acid ionic liquids were synthesized as suitable catalysts . Some key parameters affecting oleic acid conversion were investigated using single factor experiments . Moreover the production process was optimized via response surface methodology . The results indicated that the ionic liquid 1 3 methylmidazolium hydrosulfate exhibits good catalytic performance because of its double acid sites . The ultrasonic microwave combined assistance can intensify the process to significantly shorten the reaction time from about 180 min to 15 min thereby affording good industrial application potential . The specified regression model is accurate reliable and adequate for simulating actual production the oleic acid conversion was 97.85 which is close to that achieved with conventional methods .
