 Smart responsive materials have been attracting increasing interests in membrane separation field . Herein we reported a new thermo responsive membrane with interesting anti fouling and self cleaning properties . N isopropylacrylamide grafted silica nanoparticles SiO

@highlight The thermos responsive PVDF SiO
@highlight  PNIPAm ultrafiltration UF membrane was designed.
@highlight The hydrophilicity of smart PVDF SiO
@highlight  PNIPAm membranes was improved.
@highlight The new membranes showed the unique reversible water flux with temperature stimuli.
@highlight PVDF SiO
@highlight  PNIPAm membranes have both good anti fouling and self cleaning properties.
