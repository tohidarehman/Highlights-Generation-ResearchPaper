 A multiscale model including scales at the surface grain and particle was developed to understand the steam enhancement mechanism on the carbonation of CaO particle . The interaction of H

@highlight A multiscale model describing steam enhancement effect on carbonation was developed.
@highlight O dissociation on grain surface enhanced O
@highlight and CO
@highlight ions diffusion through product layer.
@highlight The fraction of
@highlight increases greatly when a small fraction of steam is present.
@highlight The negligible steam effect on reaction at high temperature is due to pore plugging.
