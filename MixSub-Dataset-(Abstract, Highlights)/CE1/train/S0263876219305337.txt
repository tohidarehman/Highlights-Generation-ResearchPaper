 Propionic acid is widely utilized in different chemical applications and industries such as plastic coating agricultural chemical and perfume industries . However propionic acid occurs in the waste streams of these industries and is produced in aqueous solutions by fermentation processes . Thus removal of propionic acid from both waste streams and production medium is an important topic . In this experimental and optimization study the reactive extraction of propionic acid from its aqueous solutions was investigated . Imidazolium based ionic liquids namely 1 hexyl 3 methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate PF

@highlight TBP concentration is the most crucial factor on the extraction efficiency.
@highlight Ionic liquids can be used as green solvents in propionic acid reactive extraction.
@highlight CCD based RSM can be employed to design the reactive extraction system.
