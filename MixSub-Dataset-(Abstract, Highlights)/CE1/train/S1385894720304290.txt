 In this study a model for an unconventional bioreactor a U loop fermentor is presented and compared to experimental data from a series of pH tracer pulse experiments . A good agreement between model and data with very little error and computation time could be achieved when numerical diffusion combined with a carefully determined variable finite volume discretization method is employed to solve the system of partial differential model equations . The approach also overcame the obstacle posed by a constraint related to a complex pressure profile . An analysis of stability controllability and observability if the reactor model is extended to include manipulated inputs measured outputs and a complex validated bio kinetic model revealed unstable process dynamics but good observability and controllability even if very few sensors were functioning . A thorough investigation of the linearization effect suggested to perceive this result with caution but encouragement .
