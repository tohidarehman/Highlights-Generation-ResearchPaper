 The application of coating films is an important step in the manufacture of pharmaceutical tablets . Understanding the phenomena taking place during coating spray application provides important information that can be used to reduce the number of defective tablets and select the optimal conditions for the coating process . In this work we investigate spray impact and film spreading on a tablet while this passes through the spray zone in a rotating coating drum . To simulate spray impingement we developed an one dimensional spreading model that is based on the mechanical energy equation . We assumed the spray to be uniform and we divided it into arrays of droplets that impinge successively on the substrate orthogonally to its surface . In the mechanical energy equation that describes the coating spreading we accounted for the rate of work done on the surface of the liquid coating film by the impinging droplets that leads to volume change . The novel model we propose in this work can calculate the coating spreading rate and thickness . We implemented the mathematical model employing the gPROMS Modelbuilder platform . To study the effect of coating properties and process parameters on the film spreading rate and on the final liquid film thickness we performed variance based sensitivity analysis . The model predictions are in good agreement with experimental data found in the literature .
