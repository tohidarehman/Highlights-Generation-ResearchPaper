 Versatile composite materials integrating extreme water repellency with a series of characteristics have been seen as potential competitors for innovative applications . In this work the author designs a three dimensional superhydrophobic composite material featuring robustness and repairability by utilizing organic polymer components polydimethylsiloxane and epoxy acrylate and inorganic component silica particle SiO

@highlight A material was designed by photo polymerization hydrolytic polycondensation.
@highlight The composite material exhibits a three dimensional superhydrophobic state.
@highlight The superhydrophobic material possesses high damage insensitive behavior.
@highlight The superhydrophobic material presents repairable ability via polishing treatment.
@highlight The design control and aquatic show are sequentially achieved.
