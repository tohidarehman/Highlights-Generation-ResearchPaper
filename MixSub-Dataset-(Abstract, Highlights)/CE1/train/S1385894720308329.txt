 Recently removal of trace hazardous organic contaminants in the water is still a challenge work and attracting a growing number of concerning . Herein a photo responsive cellulose based intelligent imprinted material was fabricated through SI ATRP and employed for the selective adsorption of a typical pesticide residue 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid . The characterization results showed that the obtained PR Cell MIP displayed 2 D petal like laminar sheet and owned ample functional groups such as N N COCl and COOH . The photo responsive tests confirmed the excellent photo isomerization property of PR Cell MIP leading to a satisfactory regeneration during the 2 4 D adsorption . Batch adsorption experiments demonstrated that the 2 4 D adsorption followed Frendlich adsorption isotherm . Meanwhile the higher equilibrium template bindings lower specific binding constant K

@highlight Cellulose based imprinted photo regulated adsorbent PR Cell MIP was designed.
@highlight Photo responsive mechanism was discussed with multi dimension.
@highlight The specific recognition properties towards typical contaminant were studied.
@highlight PR Cell MIP displayed durable reversibility of binding ability under clean light.
