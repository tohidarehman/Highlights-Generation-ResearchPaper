 The treatment of plastic waste is a global issue and the demand for technologies to reuse or upgrade plastic waste is increasing . In this study waste polyethylene terephthalate plastic bottles were used to prepare cost effective porous carbons and the prepared carbon materials were tested for capturing CO

@highlight Microporous carbons were derived from PET plastic bottles by chemical activation.
@highlight PET KOH 973 showed the highest CO
@highlight uptake of 4.42molkg
@highlight at 298K and 101kPa.
@highlight Langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic models described data well.
@highlight Adsorbents from PET wastes are promising for capturing CO
@highlight and solving plastic waste disposal.
