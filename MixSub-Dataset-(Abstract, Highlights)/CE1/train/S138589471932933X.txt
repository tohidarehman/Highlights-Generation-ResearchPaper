 This study evaluated biodesulfuruization of sulfate containing wastewater using CO as the only carbon substrate in a gas lift bioreactor . The effect of hydraulic retention time sulfate loading and CO loading rates on sulfate reduction and CO conversion was examined and 72h HRT proved to be best for achieving maximum sulfate reduction and CO utilization . The CO utilization was nearly 80 at the beginning of the reactor operation which reduced later due to increase in the inlet CO concentration in the third phase of bioreactor operation . Artificial neural network based model was successfully described to predict the performance of the system using Levenberg Marquardt algorithm with twelve number of neurons . Steady state experimental values of sulfate reduction obtained using the gas lift bioreactor accurately matched well with the values predicted by the ANN model . Furthermore addition of biologically synthesized iron nanoparticles using green tea extract significantly improved the bioreactor performance towards sulfate rich wastewater treatment with CO particularly under high sulfate loading condition .
