 Development of advanced energetic materials with promising properties has been intensely pursued over the past decades . However traditional strategies for integrating fuel skeleton and oxidizing groups into an organic molecule are very difficult to balance the contradictory relationship between high energy and low sensitivity of energetic materials . In this work we present a promising approach to develop advanced energetic materials through intermolecular assembly of nitrogen rich triazine energetic compounds and high energy oxidants . Under the direction of electrostatic potential and proton affinity calculations a novel energetic compound 2 4 6 triamino 1 3 5 triazine 1 3 dioxide was rationally designed and synthesized . The easy and effective self assembly of TTDO with high energy oxidants afforded a series of novel advanced energetic materials with a good balance between energy and sensitivity . Among these self assembled energetic materials TTDOP a self assembled energetic material between TTDO and HClO
