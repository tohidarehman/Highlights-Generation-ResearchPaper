 Magnesium alloys have many unique properties but suffer from poor corrosion resistance . Effective anti corrosion strategies are highly desirable for widespread applications of Mg alloys . Bioinspired super anti wetting coatings are promising for metal protection but are limited by some issues . Here we report a bi layer superamphiphobic coating for efficient protection of Mg alloy by sequentially spray coating a conventional epoxy anti corrosion coating and a superamphiphobic coating perfluorodecyl polysiloxane modified SiO

@highlight Combination of epoxy paint and superamphiphobic coating provides long term protection for Mg alloys.
@highlight Mg alloy shows high stability during 70 d 3.5wt NaCl immersion and 35 d neutral salt spray tests.
@highlight Differences of superhydrophobic and superamphiphobic coatings in anti corrosion are revealed.
@highlight Corrosion resistance of super anti wetting coatings in neutral salt spray test is improved.
