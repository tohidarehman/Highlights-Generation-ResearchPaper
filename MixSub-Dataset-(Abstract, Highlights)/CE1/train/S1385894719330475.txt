 The selective aerobic oxygenation of organic sulfides under mild conditions represents one of the most important chemical transformations because of a wide variety of applications of sulfoxides . However this reaction is very challenging to be implemented by conventional semiconductor photocatalysis . Herein polydopamine could be easily assembled onto TiO

@highlight TiO
@highlight surface complex photocatalysis can carry out a reaction in a redox active solvent.
@highlight Turnover number in terms of dopamine precursor can be as large as 275.
@highlight Visible light photocatalytic selective aerobic oxidation of sulfides into sulfoxides has been achieved on TiO
@highlight @PDA.
@highlight TEMPO could improve the endurance of TiO
@highlight @PDA photocatalyst.
@highlight The electron transfer between TEMPO and TEMPO
@highlight accelerates the formation of sulfoxides.
