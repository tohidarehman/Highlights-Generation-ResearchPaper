 To date the application of electrochemical nitrogen fixation into ammonia is severely hindered by the deficiency of high performance electrocatalysts . In this paper a facile approach is proposed for the preparation of MXene Mn

@highlight Ultrafine Mn
@highlight nanoparticles are confined on MXene nanosheets as superior nitrogen reduction reaction electrocatalyst.
@highlight Elaborate 0 2D heteroarchitecture is fabricated through facile and versatile van der Waals assembly.
@highlight Evident synergy effect guarantees commendable activity stability and durability of composite electrocatalyst.
