 This study applies individual and combined application of ultrasound and ozone pretreatments for the tandem recovery of microalgae biocompounds and phosphorus from

@highlight The individual or dual effect of ultrasound ozone pretreatment on microalgae were studied.
@highlight Ultrasound released proteins to the aqueous phase and increased lipids viability.
@highlight Ozone induced carbohydrates and phosphorus depolymerization.
@highlight Dual ultrasound and ozone intensified microalgae biocompounds fractionation.
@highlight Dual pretreatment reduced 95 the solvent waste and 80 the extraction time.
