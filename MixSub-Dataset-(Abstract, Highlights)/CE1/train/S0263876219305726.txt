 Wide viscosity range impellers have extensive demands and applications in process industry . The gasliquid dispersion and mass transfer characteristics of wide viscosity range impellers including Large double blade impeller Fullzone impeller and Maxblend impeller in water solutions of xanthan gum were investigated experimentally and compared . The influences of gas flow rate impeller speed and polymer concentration of liquid on the power consumption overall gas holdup

@highlight LDB FZ and MB impellers were studied in terms of gas dispersion and mass transfer.
@highlight Effects of gas flow rate impeller speed and liquid concentration were revealed.
@highlight Operating parameters and impellers under different conditions were recommended.
