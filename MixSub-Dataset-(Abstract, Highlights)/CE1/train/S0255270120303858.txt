 The fluidization process within gassolid fluidized bed reactor can be intensified by adding liquid as it can enhance mass and heat transfer between gas phase and solid phase . With the help of computational fluid dynamics and discrete element methods fluidization characteristics are investigated at different liquid contents

@highlight Fluidization characteristics of LC GSFBR have been studied by CFDDEM.
@highlight Compared with V Bo
@highlight increase is more likely to enhance agglomerate formation.
@highlight Stagnation zone is reflected from particle velocity increase in annulus region.
@highlight The variation of region distribution due to Bo
@highlight increase is complicated.
