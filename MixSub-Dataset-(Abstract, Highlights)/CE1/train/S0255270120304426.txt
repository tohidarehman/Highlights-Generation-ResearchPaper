 The feasibility of oxygen removal from alcohols using cold plasma technologies at atmospheric pressure and low temperatures was studied experimentally and numerically . Methanol was used as a model compound to understand the effect of highly energetic electrons and the carrier gas on deoxygenation and to establish the reaction pathways . The results will provide insight into upgrading bio oil derived from lignocellulosic pyrolysis waste glycerol from biodiesel production processes and waste cooking oils .

@highlight Liquid methanol deoxygenation in the presence of cold plasma via radical mechanism.
@highlight O bond cleavage is the dominant route in cold plasma decomposition of methanol.
@highlight Gas liquid reactions in cold plasma generate otherwise unfeasible products without a catalyst.
@highlight Product distribution tunable through carrier gas reactor design and plasma power.
@highlight Hydrogen carrier gas favours formation of hydrocarbons and CO.
