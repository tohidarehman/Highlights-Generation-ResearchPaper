 The design and construction of superior electrocatalysts based on covalent organic frameworks for oxygen reduction reaction have attracted increasing interest . However COFs typically exhibit low electrocatalytic activity as a result of their poor electrical conductivity . In this study a highly graphitic nitrogen doped porous carbon electrocatalyst

@highlight COF derived N doped graphitic carbon heterostructures were constructed.
@highlight MOF derived
@highlight with core shell structure were used as sacrificial templates.
@highlight Excellent structural characteristics of
@highlight C were found to be ideal for ORR.
@highlight manifested an outstanding ORR performance.
