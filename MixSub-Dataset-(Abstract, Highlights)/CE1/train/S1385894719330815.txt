 Nanoengineering technology has made great achievements through the design of useful nanostructures and components to provide us with more functional materials . Therefore the ideal performance can be achieved by maximizing the contribution of nanostructures and components . As a typical material core shell material has been widely studied in order to find more possibilities in the nanoengineering applications . In this work a designable core shell composite material with graphitized tunable hollow carbon sphere as the core and sheet like MnO
