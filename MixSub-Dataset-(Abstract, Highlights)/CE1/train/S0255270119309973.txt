 The supersonic separation technology has been widely concerned as a new technology in separating and processing liquid in many fields . It is well known that the shape of the nozzle is very important to the separation performance . However most of the previous researches for structural profile of the nozzle ignored the the fact that diversion cone and swirler contributes to change the flow field . And the investigation of strong swirling flow in the nozzle is not enough and especially the diversion cone in nozzle increases the particularity and complexity of the swirling flow which makes the rotation flow of the fluid deviate the motion of combined spiral vortex . In the paper the structural profile of the nozzle and the swirler was studied considering the influence of diversion cone and swirler on the flow field . Meanwhile the motion law of strong swirl caused by swirler in the nozzle was analyzed by 3D numerical simulation . The simulation results indicate that the presence of the diversion cone has a great influence on the nozzle profile and internal flow field . The optimum configuration was determined as follows stable length of 0.5

@highlight The diversion cone has great influence on the profile of convergent section of nozzle.
@highlight The swirler with circular arc blade is more conducive to separation of condensate.
@highlight The swirling fluid in convergence and throat does not have trait of combined vortex.
@highlight The diversion cone weakens the relative pulsation and stabilizes the flow field.
@highlight The reflux channel can solve the backmixing resulting from the forced spiral vortex.
