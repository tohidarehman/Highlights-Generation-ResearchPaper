 The present study discusses the simultaneous application of electric field during membrane separation of oil from oily wastewater on eliminating the fouling propensity over the membrane . A novel hybrid electrocoagulation and electroflotation enhanced membrane module was proposed here to expect the benefits of electrocoagulation and electroflotation with the membrane separation . The synergistic effect of applied voltage and membrane operation facilitates demulsification for emulsified oily wastewater along with substantial turbulence creation over the membrane surface through hydrogen bubbling . Such turbulence reduces the deposition over the membrane surface that eventually restricts the permeate flux decrease by 4372 . Voltage was applied both continuously and periodically along with a gradual voltage increment in each mode . Further with both the mode of applied voltage polyethersulfone and polysulfone membrane were employed with each of the modes . It was observed that the permeation of the PES membrane is not substantially affected by the mode of the applied voltage . On the contrary with relatively low hydrophilic PSf membrane the permeation is highly dependent on the applied voltage and its mode of application . The minimum flux decline for PSf membrane can be achieved with periodical voltage application at 10 V with substantial oil rejection of 9496 .
