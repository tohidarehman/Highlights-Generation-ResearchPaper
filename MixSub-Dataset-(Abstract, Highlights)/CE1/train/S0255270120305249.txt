 Effect of intensification of cellulose dissolution process on the spinning of lyocell fibers and their physical properties was systematically investigated . The cellulose dissolution process was intensified by pre swelling of the pulps that benefited in bringing down the conventional process temperature of 75C to 50C as well as by assisting in good dissolution and formation of homogeneous dope . Further effect of dopes prepared from pre swelled and un swelled pulps at a lower temperature on spinnability and fiber properties was thoroughly investigated and compared with dopes prepared at 75C . The resultant fibers were morphologically and structurally analyzed using SEM and XRD and correlated with their physical properties . It was observed that fibers regenerated from pre swelled dope showed increased overall molecular orientation as well as high amorphous orientation that resulted in improved tenacity of the fibers . Finally it has been observed that cellulose dissolution using pre swelled method is an energy efficient technique over un swelled method . Present work makes lyocell process more sustainable and simultaneously enhance fiber properties .
