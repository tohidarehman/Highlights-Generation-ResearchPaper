 Photoluminescence has been significantly applied in anticounterfeiting and encryption . However present PL anticounterfeiting and encryption efforts are based on static PL which is easily counterfeited by substitutes . In this work a multimode dynamic PL material MgGa

@highlight An advanced multimode dynamic PL material MgGa
@highlight is developed.
@highlight PL color changes from green to blue in seconds and reverses at high temperature.
@highlight Safe anticounterfeiting images are fabricated based on multimode dynamic PL.
@highlight A new technology of encryption optical storage is designed based on dynamic PL.
@highlight Information stored on images is stable and can be erased by irradiation of lamp.
