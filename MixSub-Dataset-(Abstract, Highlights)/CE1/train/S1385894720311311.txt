 Highly performance fogdrop collection is of great practical importance in addressing the worldwide water shortages especially in arid regions . Although great progresses have been made to solve this problem there still are challenges in developing high performance fogdrop collecting systems to satisfy efficient fogdrop capturing and fast transport simultaneously which are two critical factors that determine the collection efficiency . The well evolved water collecting capacity of creatures that adapt to the harsh environment provides a great inspiration for the design of efficient collection systems . Here inspired by the unique hierarchical structures and the excellent fogdrop collection ability of wheat awn artificial awn like hierarchical systems are developed via a precision 3D printing strategy which exhibit excellent fogdrop capture and fast transport . The presence of hierarchical structure composed of conical spine gradient microgrooves and oriented thorns enables the fogdrop collection to transform from dropwise mode on the thorns to filmwise one on the spine . Furthermore the collection efficiency of such a bioinspired system is 5.90g cm

@highlight A series of wheat awn like systems are printed in a programmable manner.
@highlight The hierarchical system exhibits excellent capture and transport towards fogdrop.
@highlight Each substructure and their synergy are evaluated for efficient collection.
@highlight Anticipated for effective fog collecting devices in various assembled forms.
