 In the present work a novel agarosenickel bilayer composite adsorbents modified with Cibacron Blue 3GA dye ligand were fabricated via the three phase emulsion method . The surface morphology of the novel adsorbents was evaluated using an optical microscope scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy . Also the commercially purchased adsorbents were modified with the same ligand and compared to novel composite . Also Lactoferrin nanoparticles synthesized and employed as a protein model . Residence time distribution experiments were performed to consider the effect of particle density and fluid viscosity . The results established that the ANBC CB3 bilayer composite follows a typical size range of 60300
