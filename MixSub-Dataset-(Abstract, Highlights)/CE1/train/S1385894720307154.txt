 Lightweight polydimethylsiloxane foam materials with outstanding mechanical flexibility and high temperature stability as well as excellent flame resistance are attractive for various potential applications . However incorporation of conventional flame retardants needs high filling content and usually induces compromise of other important performance limiting their practical application significantly . In addition the problems of complicated procedure and environmental pollution of the traditional processing are imperative but challenging . Here we report a facile and green

@highlight GO sheets or nanoribbons were assembled onto the SiRF foam surface via a facile strategy.
@highlight Two GO derivatives were well covered and bonded onto the foam skeleton at only 0.10wt .
@highlight Ultra low GO derivatives improved mechanical property and flame resistance significantly.
@highlight GONRs showed lower reinforcing flame retardant effects than the corresponding GO sheets.
@highlight The synergistic flame retardant mechanisms and their difference were discussed and clarified.
