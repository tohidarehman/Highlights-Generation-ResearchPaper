 Methanol to gasoline process is an important modern technology for fuel production . As a process featured in redundant heat with reaction temperature sometimes up to 380 so far MTG heat integration has not been discussed in detail to make MTG an electricity generator . This paper in this context proposes a novel superstructure of the integration of methanol to gasoline process with organic Rankine cycle in the hope of higher energy efficiency . To simultaneously optimize the flowsheet structural the working fluid and operating condition of the novel superstructure of ORC MTG integrated process genetic algorithm is performed based on economic criteria through MATLAB coupled with Aspen Plus . With Propylbenzene R601 the most favorable working fluid pairs in ORC . Compared with the current industrial counterpart process the optimal ORC MTG integrated process saves cooling water by 18.77 with the ROI at 22.66 . The thermal efficiency of 18.3 is valuable for the industrial application which suggests the significance of introducing ORC to other heat rich industrial plants requiring higher energy efficiency especially in the case of expensive electricity .
