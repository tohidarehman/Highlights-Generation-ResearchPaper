 Shape stability PCM loading capacity and energy storage performance of organic phase change materials are crucial in broad applications of thermal energy storage and management . In this study a facile strategy was followed to design 3D porous metal supramolecular gels as supporting materials . The phase change composites were prepared by solution impregnation of polyethylene glycol . The porous supporting material exhibited large specific surface area high total pore volume and micro mesopore characteristics . In addition the influence of gel concentration on PCM encapsulation and thermal properties of composite materials were investigated in which increasing the concentration result in a decrease in energy storage capacity and loading ratio . The as prepared phase change composites revealed a high PCM loading capacity up to 90wt and energy storage capability reaches 100 . Factors such as pore characteristics and gel concentration played a central role in the thermal properties of composite PCMs . Further the phase change composites showed high durability after 100 heating cooling cycles without a significant shift in latent heat and phase transition temperatures . This investigation provides an insight into making a facile synthesis of gel based composite PCMs and possible thermal energy management systems .
