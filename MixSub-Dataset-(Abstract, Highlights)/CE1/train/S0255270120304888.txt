 Air flow and heat transfer through a rectangular channel equipped with transversely twisted turbulators are studied experimentally . Three twist angles and two pitch ratios are considered to explore the effects of design factors . To create a better understanding of possible mechanisms a numerical simulation is also carried . The experimental data show that decreasing twist angle and pitch ratio increases both

@highlight Transversely twisted turbulators are introduced in a channel to enhance heat transfer.
@highlight Three twist angles 0 90 and 180 and two pitch ratios 1.875 and 3.75 are examined.
@highlight Noticeable variations of h and p are seen as design factors are changed.
@highlight Highest
@highlight of 1.62 is recorded at twist angle of 90 pitch ratio of 3.75 and Re 1643.
