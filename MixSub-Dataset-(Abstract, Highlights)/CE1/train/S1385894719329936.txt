 Toxic arsenic species cycle in the geochemical process are strongly influenced by iron and manganese elements thus understanding mutual transformation of multiple Fe Mn redox states is essential to predict the redox transformation and sequestration of arsenic in natural environment . Herein a nanosized magnetic mesoporous iron manganese bimetal oxides with highly well ordered inner connected structure and large surface area was fabricated the obtained Nanosized MMIM possessed higher content of surface bound

@highlight Magnetic Nanosized MMIM were successfully fabricated via the hard template method.
@highlight Nanosized MMIM possessed highly well ordered inner connected structure and large surface area.
@highlight Nanosized MMIM exhibited excellent catalytic performance for As III oxidation.
@highlight Surface bound
@highlight Fe II content was greatly associated to the amount of

@highlight As III was oxidized by bulk solution
@highlight OH
@highlight and surface bound
@highlight OH
@highlight radicals.
