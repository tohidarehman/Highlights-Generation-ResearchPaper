 Fish oil is a nutritious product mainly due its omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids content that is attractive for its health benefits . Fish oil is discarded as a waste in many seafood industries due to the lack of recovery processes to refine the oil in a lucrative and sustainable manner . This work tackles this by proposing a framework to integrate the economic environmental and social aspects with the process design decisions of a crude fish oil refinery . The application of the framework is highlighted through production of 3 PUFA concentrates from waste oil of a tuna processing plant in Mexico . This is addressed by formulation and solution of a multi objective optimization problem including intensified processing options in a superstructure . The resulting Mixed Integer Non Linear Programing problem is solved with lexicographic and constraint methods . The solutions in the form of a Pareto front are subject to benchmarking with Life Cycle Assessment methodology . The optimal configuration consists of an intensified process with an LCA score of 458.94 and the donation 12.64 of the 3 production to local communities without compromising the process profitability . Waste fish oil valorization is proven significant to achieve a circular economy model for the seafood industry .

@highlight A framework for lipid process design in a Circular Economy model was developed.
@highlight The case study addressed was the production of 3 concentrates from waste fish oil.
@highlight The multiobjective optimization problem includes intensified process options
@highlight The resulting MINLP is solved with lexicographic constraint and LCA approaches.
@highlight The optimal process configuration counterbalances the three sustainability dimensions.
