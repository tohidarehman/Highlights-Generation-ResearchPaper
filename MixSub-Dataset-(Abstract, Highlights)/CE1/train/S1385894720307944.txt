 Ciprofloxacin and ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria are emerging concerns that threaten public health due to the heavy use of antibiotics and the development of bacterial resistance in water environments . In this study we examined an energy efficient treatment driven by a UV LED chlorine reaction with UV LED chip emitting UV275 nm to remove ciprofloxacin and ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria in water . Ciprofloxacin degradation during the UV LED chlorine reaction followed pseudo first order kinetics and the excessive chlorine dosage has a negative effect on ciprofloxacin removal . Alkaline pH showed the best efficiency for ciprofloxacin removal and the reactive chlorine species played a major role at alkaline pH values . The cleavages of piperazine cyclopropyl and quinolone moieties are considered as the principal degradation reactions in the UV LED chlorine reaction . Seven byproducts

@highlight UV LED chlorine was applied to remove antibiotic and antibiotic resistant bacteria.
@highlight Among the reactive chlorine species Cl radical played a major role at alkaline pH.
@highlight Organic and inorganic byproducts were detected during UV LED chlorine process.
@highlight UV LED chlorine process achieved complete detoxification of hospital wastewater.
@highlight UV LED chlorine showed the lowest electrical energy consumption per order.
