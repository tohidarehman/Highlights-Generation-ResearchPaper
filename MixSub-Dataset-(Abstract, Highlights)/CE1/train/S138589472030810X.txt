 Radioactive uranium discharged from terrestrial sources heterotrophic leaching has caused significant harm to the ecosystem and public health . Here we report an electrocoagulation method enhanced by ligand chelation for removing and recovering uranium from wastewater . The anode material and chelate were optimized for treating bulk uranium containing wastewater and the uranium precipitation mechanism and recycling method were comprehensively investigated . With the optimized Fe anode and Alizarin S as chelate uranium was removed efficiently within a short time to satisfy the emission regulation . After Alizarin S selectively captures the uranyl ions the formed chelation complex will compress and encapsulate the flocculation precursor minimizing its crystal growth and decreasing its interfacial charge to facilitate the precipitation . Uranium in the precipitated flocs was efficiently eluted with an oxidizing detergent and the yellowcake heavy uranium amide was obtained by subsequent digestion of organics and ammonia precipitation . The overall uranium recovery efficiency was as high as 89.71 . This proposed scheme may be used for practical uranium elimination and recovery from wastewater .
