 In this study we investigate the mixing performances of a modified micromixer which achieves a very good mixing quality that can be compared to other micromixers proposed recently our idea proposes a modification of the crossing zone to reduce the unit number . The numerical simulations have been carried out at low Reynolds numbers using the CFD Fluent code to solve the 3D momentum equations continuity equation and the species transport equations . The elongation of the crossing zone is defined by a parameter called aspect ratio . A parametric study was realized using five values of aspect ratio from 0 to 1 in a wide range of Reynolds numbers from 0.2 to 80 . To analyze the obtained results through the numerical simulations the mass fraction contours velocity vectors velocity profiles and pressure losses were presented in different cross sectional planes and positions . The selected geometry has excellent mixing performances where the obtained mixing index exceeds 85.67 for Re 0.2 and reaches 99.22 for Re 50 it also has a lower pressure drop compared to other geometries studied recently . Therefore the selected micromixer shows high mixing performances at low Reynolds numbers so it can be employed to improve fluid mixing in various microfluidic systems .
