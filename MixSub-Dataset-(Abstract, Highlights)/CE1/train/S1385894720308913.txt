 In this study ion imprinted polymer IIP was synthesized using allylthiourea as a functional monomer and As as a template in removing As from water . The synthesis of As IIP as a sorbent was prepared via bulk polymerization . The characterization study has been conducted included pre polymerization study by using Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance

@highlight The proposed mechanism agreed with the formation of complexation was selective.
@highlight A moiety of amino acid at As III IIP contributes to the selective properties.
@highlight As III removal by using As III IIP as a sorbent reached 90 at neutral pH.
