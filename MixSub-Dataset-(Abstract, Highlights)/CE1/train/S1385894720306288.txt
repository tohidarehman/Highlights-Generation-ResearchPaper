 A holocellulose framework with anisotropic microchannels which is synthesized via a facile topdown strategy is demonstrated to be an ideal anisotropic substrate to guide the directional assembly of CuS nanoparticles along the walls of microchannels . The oxygen containing groups on the surface of HCFW and its abundant low tortuosity of channels contribute to the high loading and homogeneous dispersion of CuS NPs as well as the fast outdiffusion of cytotoxic substances Cu hence endowing the composite with an outstanding antibacterial activity which achieves approximatively 100 of growth inhibition ratios for
