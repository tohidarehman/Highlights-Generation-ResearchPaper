 Dialysis of single component solutions and neutralisation dialysis of oxalic acid with sodium hydroxide were experimentally studied in a two compartment batch cell . For this purpose an anion exchange membrane Neosepta AHA was used . The transport of single components was quantified by the diffusion coefficient of the component as a function of its concentration in the membrane while that of oxalic acid in the neutralisation dialysis experiments was quantified by the permeability coefficient of the membrane for oxalic acid . Moreover the acceleration of the acid transport by an NaOH solution was evaluated by the enhancement factor based on the permeability coefficients .

@highlight Neutralisation dialysis of oxalic acid with sodium hydroxide was studied.
@highlight The concentration profiles of oxalic acid in the membrane were calculated.
@highlight The acid transport was quantified by the enhancement factor.
@highlight The diffusion length of acid is practically equal to the membrane thickness.
