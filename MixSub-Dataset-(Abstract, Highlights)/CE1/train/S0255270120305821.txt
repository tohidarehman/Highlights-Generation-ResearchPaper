 The application of electrocoagulation for the treatment of cosmetic effluents considered to be commonly toxic and of low biodegradability has shown satisfactory results . However most studies focus on batch experiments with the application of technologies complementary to EC . Along these lines this research sought to evaluate the influence of operational parameters on initial pH electric current density conductivity and hydraulic retention time of a cylindrical electrochemical reactor in continuous upward flow for the treatment of cosmetic effluent . A Fractional Factorial Planning 2

@highlight A new continuous upward flow EC reactor for treat cosmetic effluent was investigated.
@highlight Effects of operating parameters on the treatment performance were analyzed.
@highlight Good reactor performance operating a low values of HRT and current density.
@highlight Maximum COD and turbidy removal with low of power consumption.
