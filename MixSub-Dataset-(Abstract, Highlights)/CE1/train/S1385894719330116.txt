 High theoretical specific capacity good electrical conductivity intrinsically stable metallic nature excellent thermal stability and corrosion resistance enable vanadium carbide as a promising anode material for sodium ion and lithium ion batteries . However drastic structural change during cycling and poor electrochemical kinetic performance both make the application of VC in dilemma . Herein VC nanodots were successfully embedded in N and P co doped carbon nanosheets via a simple wet chemical process followed by high temperature calcination . Benefiting from the carbon based conductive network and supporting structure for the rapid ion transport and alleviative volume change in VC the
