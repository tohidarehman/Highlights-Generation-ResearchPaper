 Water stressed countries have been shifting their sources of clean water from inland freshwater to seawater . This led to a comprehensive exploration of seawater desalination processes to address water scarcity however membrane processes have expensive operational costs and high energy consumption . In this regard this study presented a novel energy self sufficient desalination system design that incorporates rechargeable seawater batteries as an additional energy storage system . Experimental data were projected using the reverse osmosis system analysis model to determine the configuration that achieved the lowest energy consumption and highest charging rate . The results show that the seawater battery achieved a satisfactory desalination performance with 90 and 74 82 removal of sodium and chloride ions from actual water samples respectively . Among the configurations using ultrafiltration as pretreatment and applying 1.8mA as initial current yielded the lowest energy consumption 1.35kWh m
