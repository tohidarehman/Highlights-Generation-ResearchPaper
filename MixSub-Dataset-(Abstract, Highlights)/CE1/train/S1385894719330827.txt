 Recently biomass derived fire safe epoxy thermosets have been developed for the substitute of petroleum derived bisphenol A epoxy thermosets due to the shortage of petroleum resources and the negative health impacts of petroleum derived products . However the synthesis of bio based epoxy thermosets combining excellent mechanical properties and fire safety performance is still a great challenge . In this paper a novel Schiff base compound 4 4 bis bis bis was efficiently synthesized from bio based protocatechualdehyde . PH ODA was subsequently reacted with epichlorohydrin to obtain the epoxy monomer N N bisphenyl methanimine . After curing PH ODA EP with 4 4 diaminodiphenylmethane the cured resin PH ODA EP DDM network possessed a high glass transition temperature

@highlight A novel biomass derived epoxy thermoset was synthesized from Schiff base compound.
@highlight Schiff base structure promotes char formation and reduces the fire hazards of epoxy thermoset.
@highlight The new epoxy thermoset exhibits superior mechanical properties and high glass transition temperature.
@highlight This paper provides a new strategy for simultaneously enhancing the mechanical properties and fire safety performance.
