 One of the main difficulties to achieve a good performance with the emulsion liquid membranes technique for metal extraction is the solvent phase recovery . In the present work heating is proposed as an efficient and easy method to destabilize extraction liquid membranes used to recover Cr from wastewaters . The formulated ELM consists of sunflower oil as vegetable green solvent PGPR and Tween 80 as surfactants tri

@highlight Liquid membranes for metal chromium removal.
@highlight Heat treatment for emulsions destabilization and solvent recovery.
@highlight Heat treatment up to 80C do not affect solvent properties.
@highlight Up to four cycles extraction were done with recovered solvent obtaining 97 metal extraction.
