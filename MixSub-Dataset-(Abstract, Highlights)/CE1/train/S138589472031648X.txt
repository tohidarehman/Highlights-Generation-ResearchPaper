 With a view to the rapid development of pulsed power capacitors the demands for higher energy density energy efficiency and stability have increased significantly . A large amount of research has been devoted to the energy storage field of dielectric ceramics however scientific and effective strategy to design novel materials with excellent energy storage performance is still lacking . In this work a new guideline was proposed that higher energy density and efficiency are easier obtained in crossover relaxor ferroelectrics which is between normal ferroelectrics and relaxor ferroelectrics . Based on this theory a series of lead free 1

@highlight A new theory named crossover relaxor ferroelectrics were reported.
