 Water distillation is proved to be an effective method for the recovery of tritium from nuclear power plant drainage . In addition to the geometry and material the surface wettability of the internals also affects the mass transfer performance of the packings . In this paper we prepared a superhydrophilic coating on the surface of copper packings by a simple method to increase the intensity of gas liquid interface and thus intensifying the heterogeneous mass transfer process . Scanning electron microscopy atomic force microscopy X ray diffraction and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed to study the physical and chemical condition changes of the packings surface . Measured by ultraviolet fluorescence imaging technology the wetted area of the copper wire mesh corrugated packing increased by 58.0 91.2 . The mass transfer performance for separating H
