 A novel purification technology for raw biogas streams is proposed and it is based on the use of a superacid solution within a bubble column reactor . The solvent is a mixture of sulfuric acid H

@highlight A novel technology using a superacid solvent is proposed to purify biogas streams.
@highlight Superacid solvent eliminates COVNMs siloxanes H
@highlight S and partially CO
@highlight from biogas.
@highlight Process simulations and hydrodynamic analyses confirm the technology feasibility.
@highlight Superacid process shows lower energy demands than other solvents methanol and MEA .
