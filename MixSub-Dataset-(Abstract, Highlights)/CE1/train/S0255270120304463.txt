 The objective of this work is to establish an experimental approach to scale up the production of melamine formaldehyde microcapsules from a batch lab scale to a pilot scale inline rotor stator mixer . The inline RSM is operated in a continuous recycle mode allowing multiple passes of the emulsion through the intensive mixing zone during continuous production . The liquid is continuously recirculated directly to the RSM without a holding vessel as is the case in conventional batch recirculation emulsification . The setup is operated at feed flow rates of 0.24 kg h 20 kg h. Parameters including the Weber number tip speed and energy density are investigated to correlate the mean capsule size of the batch and flow process . Rotational speeds range from 3000 to 26 000 rpm . The dimensionless maximum diameter correlated well with the Weber number to the power 0.4 for both devices operated at the same residence time . Volume and number based mean diameters showed little influence of the feed flow rate in the continuous recycle mode of operation . This inline RSM setup is therefore an ideal tool to optimize emulsification processes at lab scale and increase production by increasing the feed flow rate while maintaining rotor stator geometry .

@highlight A continuous recycle operating mode for an inline rotor stator mixer is presented.
@highlight The setup allows separate control of the feed and recycle flow rate.
@highlight Scale up is realised without the need for an increase in equipment size.
@highlight Weber number is a good batch to inline transfer parameter for D
