 Oxygen catalysts that concurrently meet the durability and activity requirements for both the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer and the zinc air battery are rarely reported despite their tremendous advantages in cost reduction . We use a group of Mg doped Y

@highlight YMRO 0.15 is stably operated in both PEMWE and ZAB devices for the first time.
@highlight The OER and ORR performance of YRO are optimized by oxygen vacancy engineering.
@highlight This work develops new type of oxygen electrocatalysts for both PEMWE and ZAB.
