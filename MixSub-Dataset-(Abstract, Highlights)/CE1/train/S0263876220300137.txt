 The aim of this work was to assess whether with high amounts of nano silica filled cured resins release nano particles upon their abrasion as this could form an occupational health risk and require specific safety measures .

@highlight 3D printing is a common operation today.
@highlight Filled composite resins for stereolithography were considered.
@highlight Abrasion might lead to exposure to hazardeous levels of nanoparticles.
@highlight In this study very low exposures were observed.
