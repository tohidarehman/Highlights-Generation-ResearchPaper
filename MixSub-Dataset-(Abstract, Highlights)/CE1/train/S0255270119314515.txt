 The bimetallic nanoparticles have been used to improve the reactivity of Nanoscale Zero Valent Iron during environmental contamination remediation . The main objective of this research was to determine the reactivity of the metal doped NZVI nanoparticles in aqueous solutions . In this study FeCu FeNi and FeAg bimetals were synthesized through the chemical reduction of ferric chloride with sodium borohydride then deposition of 1 of the corresponding metal . The reactivity of these bimetallic nanoparticles in specific reaction conditions being temperature oxygen supply pH dosage and interferences was studied . The results revealed that more iron dissolution was in acidic pH high dosage and continuous oxygen supply . Furthermore nitrate was removed more in alkaline pH due to co precipitation whereas phosphate was adsorbed more in acidic pH due to the positively charged surface that attracts negatively charged species . FeCu FeNi and FeAg showed the best dissolution of iron in 90C 5C and 25C respectively . Loaded metals catalyzed NZVI reaction promoted electrons transfer and minimized oxidation .

@highlight Dissolution precipitation and electron transfer are important processes involved in iron nanoparticles corrosion.
@highlight The conditions that favored iron dissolution include acidic pH continuous oxygen supply and highest dosage.
@highlight Temperature conditions of 90C 5C and 25C were conducive for iron dissolution for FeCu FeNi and FeAg respectively.
@highlight The acidic pH promoted phosphate ions adsorption but NZVI enhanced the adsorption in all pH conditions contrary to bimetals.
@highlight The alkaline pH showed highest nitrate reduction due to co precipitation in the presence of bimetals instead of pure NZVI.
