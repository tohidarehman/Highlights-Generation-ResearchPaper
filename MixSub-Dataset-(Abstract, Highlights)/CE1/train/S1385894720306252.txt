 Solar to hydrogen holds a great sustainable energy solution in which photocatalysis plays an important role . In this study a composite photocatalyst with NiO quantum dots in graphitic carbon nitride was synthesized and evaluated in photocatalytic and thermophotocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction under visible light . A sample of 9wt NiO QDs g CN achieved the highest PC HER rate of 130molg
