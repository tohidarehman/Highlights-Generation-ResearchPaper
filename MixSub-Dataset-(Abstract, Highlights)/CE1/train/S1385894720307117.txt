 The development of visible light responsive photo reductant with organic conjugated polymers is considered as a promising and efficient way to solve the current environmental pollution and energy crisis . In this work we reports the Fe

@highlight The photochemical activity of polypyrrole could be effectively promoted by S I S heterostructure.
@highlight The reaction pathway of polypyrrole was significantly changed by S I S heterostructure.
@highlight The photogenerated electron was the key role in the photoreaction system of Fe
@highlight @SiO
@highlight @Polypyrrole.
@highlight The removal ratio of Cr VI was 99.2 by using Fe
@highlight @SiO
@highlight @Polypyrrole under irradiation.
@highlight The as prepared S I S heterostructure has potential reusability and recoverably.
