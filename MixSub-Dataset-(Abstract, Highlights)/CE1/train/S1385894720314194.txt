 The effect of various alcoholic solvents and their compositions on the size of silica particles synthesized through hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethyl orthosilicate is studied . The alcohols used are Methanol ethanol propanol i propanol butanol pentanol hexanol octanol decanol and do decanol . Ethanol was used as a co solvent with the higher molecular weight alcohols . Silica particles of size between 100nm and 2m were obtained by changing solvent composition . Concentrations of total soluble silica and silicic acid were measured and used for exploring the kinetics of hydrolysis and condensation reactions . Polarity steric hindrance and viscosity of solvent were found to have a strong influence on the rate constants and size of silica nanoparticles . An attempt is made to correlate both final particle size and rate constants with dielectric constant Wiener index and viscosity of the solvent .

@highlight Kinetics of hydrolysis and condensation of TEOS in different alcohols is studied.
@highlight The reactions are fastest in decanol ethanol and slowest in pure ethanol.
@highlight The hydrolysis and condensation rates increase with decreasing polarity of the solvent.
@highlight Particle size could be varied from 400nm to 1700nm by changing solvent.
@highlight Mixture of ethanol and butanol gives monodispersed particles.
