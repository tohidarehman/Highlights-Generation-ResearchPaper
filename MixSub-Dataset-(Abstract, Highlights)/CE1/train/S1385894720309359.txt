 Carbonization is a low temperature thermochemical process that converts organic matter in the absence of oxygen mainly into char gas and liquids . Bio coke is a char prepared from a mixture of biomass charcoal and a coal blend . It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing coke and reducing coal consumption in the ironmaking process . In this study the carbonization characteristics such as char conversion gas and tar composition of bio coke were determined using a batch type carbonization reactor . Yellow poplar wood used as a biomass was added to a coking coal in different ratios and the resulting raw bio coke was carbonized at different final temperatures . The calorific value of bio coke was higher than 7000kcal kg exceeding the standard value . Moreover the initiation combustion temperature of the resultant bio coke determined using TGA was in the range of 400600C . It is concluded that bio coke is a suitable substitute for conventional fossil fuels reducing CO
