 In response to the worldwide need for more sustainable chemical processes distillation became target of major efforts for efficiency improvement . Leveraged by process intensification several technologies have been proposed to reach a more compact safer and less energy intensive equipment . Falling film columns were intensively used for heat and mass transfer research in last century . Noteworthy studies proposing the falling film technology in distillation condition highlighted numerous advantages such as low residence time and simple constructive structure when compared to conventional distillation as well as high transfer rates due to the small thickness that flows in longitudinal direction of the distillation wall . Therefore this review brings a historical perspective of theoretical and experimental works as well as deposited patents on falling film distillation from the beginning of 20th Century to present . Theoretical background and conceptual aspects related to efficiency improvement and process intensification were deeply discussed aiming to guideline future perspectives in chemical separations .

@highlight Wetted wall columns have been used since the mid last century for distillation.
@highlight Falling film distillation represents 10.9 of total works on wetted wall columns.
@highlight Background and conceptual process design aspects are deeply discussed.
@highlight Steady state studies of separation efficiency are already well established.
@highlight Knowledge gaps on dynamics and control of falling film distillation are highlighted.
