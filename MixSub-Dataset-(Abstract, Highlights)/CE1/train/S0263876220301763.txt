 This paper presents a data driven model of pressure drop in spiral wound reverse osmosis membrane channels with the aid of computational fluid dynamics simulations and multilayer artificial neural networks method . Typical industrial spacer structures are considered in the CFD models to ensure practicability . To generate adequate data for MLN training three dimensional CFD model problems with respect to 500 different design parameter combinations are solved with a high performance computing strategy . With the HPC strategy the efficiency of CFD simulations is improved by about 50 times . The proposed MLN method is then used to correlate the pressure drop considering 7 design parameters which enables a quantitative description of geometric structures and operation conditions for improvement . The accuracy of the MLN prediction on the test set is 99.734 . The obtained results show that the performance of the predictive model is comparable to alternative approaches in previous literatures . The proposed method has potential applications in intricate PDE constrained optimization problems involving CFD simulations due to its high computational efficiency .
