 Nanocomposite adsorptive membranes with nanosorbents incorporated have become a promising material for the treatment of heavy metal containing water but their practical applications have been limited by the aggregation of nanosorbents in the membrane matrix . In this study a homogenous in situ generated ferrihydrite nanoparticles polyethersulfone adsorptive membrane was prepared for the removal of lead from water for the first time . The XRD TEM and XPS results showed that ferrihydrite particles with the size smaller than 10nm were successfully introduced into the composite membrane . The SEM EDS result indicated a homogenous distribution of the in situ generated ferrihydrite NPs in PES membrane . With more generated NPs the membrane structure varied from a larger finger like macro void structure to a suppressed finger liker macro void structure due to the contributions of viscosity hindrance and thermodynamic enhancement to the demixing rate . Besides the surface hydrophilicity and water flux increased gradually . The membrane M9 was stable for treating lead contaminated water at pH above 3.0 with the optimal adsorption pH at 5.5 . Furthermore the M9 displayed the highest adsorption capacity of Pb

@highlight Homogenous ferrihydrite NPs PES composite membranes were firstly prepared by in situ generation.
@highlight The membrane exhibited high adsorption good selectivity and superior reusability for Pb removal.
@highlight The adsorption of Pb by M9 mainly occurred via the cation exchange between Pb
@highlight and H
@highlight HA enhanced Pb removal in filtration via adsorption and size exclusion mechanisms.
@highlight The prepared membrane shows great potential for the removal of heavy metals from water.
