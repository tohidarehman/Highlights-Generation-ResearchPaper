 Heavy duty diesel engines emit over half of mobile source NOx so SCR is used to reduce NOx . But in applications SCR is hard to work in desired temperature range . In this work we try to improve exhaust thermal management and finally reduce NOx through intake throttling effect . Firstly a throttle was designed and its response characteristics were widely explored through steady state experiment . Results showed that exhaust temperature can be raised largely through intake throttling degree control it has obvious effect only after 60 TD . At 1100r min and 65 TD exhaust temperature rises by 123.3C 74.2C 49.7C and 33.5C for 600Nm 400Nm 200Nm and 50Nm loads respectively . TD demand for rising transition point becomes larger as engine load decreases at 600Nm transition point occurs at 61 TD but it increases to 68 TD at 50Nm . Finally the intake flow rate was optimized continuously with whole cycle level consideration in transient operation . NOx decreased by 43 with fuel consumption and HC keeping unchanged while CO increased by 24.6 . We hope to provide a good example for diesel engine performance improvement from optimization of existing technologies without too much cost .

@highlight The throttling effects on performances of a heavy duty diesel engine were explored.
@highlight The throttle response of this engine is more sensitive than those in literature.
@highlight Exhaust temperature is largely improved after 60 throttling degree.
@highlight Air flow and thermal status were optimized at real driving without much payments.
@highlight NOx decreases by 43 after optimizations while fuel consumption is kept unchanged.
