 Electrocatalytic overall water splitting is always holding great promise in renewable energy field . It is crucial to fabricate low cost earth abundant and robust bi functional electrocatalysts for both hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions . Herein we report a polyoxometalates based molecular approach to construct Co promoting MoS

@highlight Well defined Evans Showell type POMs were firstly used to fabricate efficient electrocatalysts.
@highlight POMs act as pre assembling molecular platform for modulating CoMoS active sites at atomic level.
@highlight Co
@highlight Mo
@highlight None
@highlight shows excellent HER OER and overall water splitting catalytic performance.
@highlight The synergistic catalytic mechanisms are revealed by coupling experiments with DFT simulations.
