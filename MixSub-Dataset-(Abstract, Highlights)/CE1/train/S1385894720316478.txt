 The combination of catalysis with non thermal plasma is a promising alternative to thermal catalysis . A dielectric barrier discharge reactor was used to study plasma catalytic dry reforming of methane at ambient pressure and temperature and a fixed plasma power of 45W . The effect of different catalytic packing materials was evaluated in terms of conversion product selectivity and energy efficiency . The conversion of CO

@highlight The plasma was found to activate the dry reforming mixture at ambient conditions.
@highlight A CO
@highlight and CH
@highlight conversion of 22 and 33 was achieved respectively.
@highlight A large variety of hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds was detected.
@highlight Methanol was the fifth most selective compound formed.
@highlight SEM EDS revealed migration of electrode material onto the surface of the packing material.
