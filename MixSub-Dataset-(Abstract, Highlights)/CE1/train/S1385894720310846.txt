 Due to its high redox potential zinc sulfide is considered an excellent semiconductor photocatalyst . However the rapid recombination rate of the photogenerated electron hole pairs limits the efficiency of ZnS for photocatalytic reactions . Herein we suggest a design rule of heterojunction structure of ZnS for improvement of its photocatalytic performance . Two specific properties are specially emphasized phase immiscibility and the different growth rates of the component materials . The phase immiscibility not only guarantees a well separated interface it also enables the technical convenience of one pot synthesis . The different growth rates help form wide heterojunctions that foster the efficient consumption of materials . We found that the ZnS Ni
