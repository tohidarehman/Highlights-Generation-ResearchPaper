 Metal free carbocatalysts are raising increased interest in advanced oxidation processes for green degradation of aqueous organic pollutants . In the present study a series of N doped hydrochars was prepared from pinewood biomass and used in carbocatalysis toward catalytic peroxymonosulfate activation to degrade refractory endocrine disrupting compounds . Nitrogen doping was found to regulate the concentrations and types of persistent free radicals on hydrochar promoting the electron transfer and oxidative degradation of the contaminants . Mechanistic studies revealed that graphitic N not only shows a strong electron transfer to facilitate PMS activation in a nonradical pathway but also induces the formation of oxygen centered PFRs from the structure defects for a radical oxidation pathway . More importantly the PMS NHC system demonstrates efficient degradation and satisfactory stability for real water treatment . This study has gained in depth understanding on the roles of N dopants in radical and nonradical pathways of biomass based carbocatalysis and will provide a promising and environmental friendly route for efficient degradation of refractory endocrine disrupting compounds for green remediation .

@highlight N doping of biochar induced a variation of persistent free radicals PFRs .
@highlight Different types of PFRs were found on hydrochar and N doped hydrochar NHC .
@highlight NHC was a robust catalyst for degradation of endocrine disrupting compounds.
@highlight Graphitic N played a role in both radical and nonradical pathways for the degradation.
