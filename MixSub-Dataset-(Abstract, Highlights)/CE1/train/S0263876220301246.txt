 The accuracy of the distillation efficiency correlations plays a critical role in cost effectively designing distillation columns . Liquid viscosity is considered to be a major factor that influences distillation efficiency through its contribution to the liquid phase mass transfer coefficient interfacial area of mass transfer and vapor and liquid phase residence times . Nearly all of the distillation efficiency correlations in the literature were developed or validated on the basis of efficiency data at liquid viscosities less than 1.5
