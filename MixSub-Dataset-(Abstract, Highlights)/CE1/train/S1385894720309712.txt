 Because of the existence of the soluble lithium polysulfides the requirement for an ideal separator for lithium sulfur batteries is higher than that in LIBs . Herein we report a double layered MOF PAN rGO PAN nanofiber membrane as an alternative to commercial polyolefin separators for Li S battery . This PAN based membrane possesses the intrinsic advantages of good mechanical property thermal stability and high electrolyte uptake showing a high lithium ion transference number of 0.81 . The

@highlight The PAN membrane was
@highlight modified with MOF by LPCVD as the separator.
@highlight This separator can effectively trap polysulfides and protect the lithium anode.
@highlight The Li S battery delivered a long lifespan of 600 cycles at 5C.
@highlight A high capacity of 7.8mAhcm
@highlight was obtained with sulfur loading of 7.7mgcm
