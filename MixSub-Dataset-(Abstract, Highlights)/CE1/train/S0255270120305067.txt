 Wheat has been increasingly employed as malt in the food industry . As the malting process demands long processing time ultrasound can be a clean intensifying alternative . This work studied the ultrasound assisted hydration of wheat grains at different nominal input power and temperatures . The actual acoustic field within the reactor was characterized . The effects of the studied variables on hydration kinetics were assessed separately by the Weibull and Peleg Models . Thermodynamic parameters were evaluated . Grains germination was also addressed under the studied conditions . Increasing temperature as well as higher acoustic density caused an improvement in the hydration kinetics reaching 72 when both variables were combined . Hydration was an endothermic and non spontaneous process . In the range of actual acoustic density 0.0610.102 W mL

@highlight Actual acoustic density within the reactor was determined.
@highlight Increasing temperature and acoustic density accelerated hydration.
@highlight Peleg and Weibull Models described hydration with high accuracy.
@highlight Hydration was an endothermic and non spontaneous process.
@highlight Adequate germination could be performed under the studied conditions.
