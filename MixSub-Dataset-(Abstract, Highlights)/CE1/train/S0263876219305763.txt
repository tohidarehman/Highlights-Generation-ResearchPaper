 We establish a Quantitative Structure Property Relationships study on the Henrys law constant of 530 heterogeneous compounds including pesticides solvents aromatic hydrocarbons and persistent pollutants . The multivariable linear regression models are established with the Replacement Method technique by searching the best 18 molecular descriptors on 26 795 available non conformational structural variables . These descriptors are derived from different freely available softwares such as PaDEL Mold

@highlight A QSPR model for Henrys law constant of 530 heterogeneous compounds is established.
@highlight Only non conformational molecular descriptors are used to develop the QSPR model.
@highlight The results are comparable with those obtained through the HENRYWIN program.
