 In this work an experimental study on the influence of hydrodynamic conditions on the total degradation process of ibuprofen dissolved in water has been carried out . A comparative analysis of the use of TiO

@highlight Ibuprofen contained in water has been degraded by photocatalysis.
@highlight A static mixer inside the reactor increased the exposure time of TiO
@highlight particles suspended in the contaminated water.
@highlight Flow fields in the mixing region revealed temporal flow instabilities resulting in higher degradation rates.
@highlight The turbulent intensity should be considered as a key parameter in tubular reactors.
