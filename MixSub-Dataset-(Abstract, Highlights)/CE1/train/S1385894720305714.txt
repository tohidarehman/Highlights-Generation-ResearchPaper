 Iron activating persulfate has been recently used to pretreat waste activated sludge to enhance short chain fatty production especially acetate production . However details of how iron activating persulfate enhances acetate production remain largely unknown and direct use of scrap iron or powder iron causes either iron precipitation or loss which would limit its practical application . This work therefore aims to provide such supports in an iron electrode activated persulfate system . In the study before anaerobic fermentation WAS was pretreated in IEAP reactors which employed sheet iron as anode and contained persulfate . Experimental results showed that when WAS was pretreated by IEAP 100mA and 50mg

@highlight IEAP pretreatment enhanced total SCFAs production in sludge fermentation.
@highlight IEAP pretreatment promoted acetate yield remarkably.
@highlight IEAP pretreatment decreased the acetate consumption but have inverse impact on propionic acid and sulfate.
@highlight IEAP pretreatment altered community structure and stimulated the growth of SRB.
