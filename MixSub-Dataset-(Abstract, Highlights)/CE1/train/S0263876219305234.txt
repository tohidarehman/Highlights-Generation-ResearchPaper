 2 3 Butanediol which is produced via the fermentation of biomass has been recognized as a sustainable and renewable liquid fuel mainly due to its high anti knock index and high heating value . However high thermal energy is required to remove the excess water in the fermentation broth in order to achieve 99 purity . Recently 2 3 butanediol has been separated and purified adopting hybrid blower and evaporator assisted distillation with significant consumption of high pressure steam which ultimately increases the total annualized costs . In this context this study proposes dual column based and dividing wall column based purification schemes . The proposed dual column based scheme utilizes low and medium pressure steam rather than high pressure steam . The overall energy efficiency of the proposed dual column structure is further enhanced through pressure optimization and an appropriate heat integration approach . The heat integrated evaporator assisted dual column configuration gives the 54.2 and 49.9 savings in operating cost and total annualized costs respectively . Whereas the evaporator assisted DWC and heat integrated blower assisted DWC offer potential reductions of the total annualized cost of 25.2 and 25 as compared to the published base case respectively .
