 An increasing demand on wood fiber based products requires an increasing efficiency of wood fiber resources . This can be achieved by a selective treatment and usage of two different fiber length classes which are separated by a novel high performance fractionator . Hydrodynamic fractionation in a mini channel exploits network formation of fibers when flowing through a narrow channel while longer fibers are linked to the network shorter fibers can be extracted by a suction slot . Since an increase of slot suction rate would decrease fractionation performance total suction rate is increased by connecting several suction slots in series . We present a scale up strategy to a pilot scale plant by parallel connection of 16 fractionation channels . Therefore a novel bifurcation distributor for fiber suspensions is developed . A comparison of the miniFrac pilot plant to a state of the art fractionation device i.e . a pressure screen shows that miniFrac can be operated with higher fractionation performance . Moreover miniFrac is shown to be significantly more energy efficient than typical pressure screens .
