 Heavy metal and other toxicant detection in natural resources like water air soil and food is vital for environmental safety personal hygiene and public health care . Abundant number of sensor has acquired its wide and pivotal role in establishing the peaceful and healthy environments . The reliable features such as detection range response recovery time stability and portability is in its urgency for achieving its lifetime applicability . For ultrasensitive chemosensory applications colorimetric and fluorescent nanofibers engender a linear range the lowest detection limit and faster response toward harmful toxic pollutants such as heavy metals and other toxicants including gases pH temperature humidity and cancer cells . In this review we surveyed various modes of sensing sensor fabrication and the evolution of naked eye visible color optical sensors developed with electrospun nanofibrous membranes along with their strength and weaknesses . The review outlines the obstacles trends and breakthroughs achieved in optical sensory nanofibers and it will definitely inspire the research community in recognizing and overcoming the interdisciplinary challenges to achieve the cleaner greener environment .
