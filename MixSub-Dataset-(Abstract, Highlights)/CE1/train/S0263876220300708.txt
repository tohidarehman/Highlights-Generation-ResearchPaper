 The synergistic effect of nanoboehmite particles and various amounts of poly as a pore former agent on the characteristics permeability and fouling resistance ability of the nanoboehmite EPVC blended membranes has been investigated . Scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive X ray atomic force microscopy and water contact angle analyses were utilized to examine the morphology surface roughness nanoboehmite dispersion and surface hydrophilicity respectively . By increasing the PEG content in the EPVC dope solution hydrophilicity porosity and pores diameter improved leading to the performance promotion of the membranes . The pure water flux flux recovery ratio and bovine serum albumin flux of the nanoboehmite EPVC composite membrane improved by enhancing the PEG loading up to 2 wt . and then they dropped at higher content of it . Anti fouling ability of the mixed matrix nanoboehmite EPVC composite membrane including 2 wt . of PEG had a dramatic growth relative to the pristine EPVC membrane . Moreover all the membranes were able to reject BSA proteins more than 98 . The obtained results displayed that the influence of PEG concentration enhancement on the characteristics and efficiency of the EPVC and EPVC nano composite membrane was different . The addition of various amounts of PEG to the nano composite membranes matrix has not unfavorably influenced the amount of BSA rejection and membrane structure .
