 To achieve a highly efficient charge transfer and separation for photocatalysis we propose a bridging effect to construct a direct charge transfer path in g C

@highlight Superficial potential trap is formed near Co atom in g C
@highlight  Co .
@highlight Co atom act as a bridge to connect g C
@highlight and Pt NPs.
@highlight The bridging effect of Co atom can rapidly transfer the photo induced electrons.
@highlight The water molecule is more easily dissociated by Co atom bridge.
@highlight The photocatalytic activity of g C
@highlight  Co Pt is 145.8 times that of pristine g C
