 The PES B Cur membranes were prepared by incorporating boehmite nanoparticles functionalized with curcumin into PES membrane via phase inversion method . The PES B Cur membranes were characterized in terms of average pore size pore size distribution porosity specific surface area water contact angle and zeta potential . Characterization techniques like ATR IR XRD and XPS were used to confirm the presence of B Cur nanoparticles in the PES B Cur membranes . The morphological properties of B Cur nanoparticles and the PES B Cur membranes were studied using FESEM . performance of the membranes was also evaluated for pure water flux antifouling behavior and removal of heavy metal ions Fe

@highlight The boehmite functionalized with curcumin was used for synthesize of membranes.
@highlight The PES B Cur membranes showed high permeation flux and antifouling resistance.
@highlight The PES B Cur
@highlight membrane exhibited high rejection towards heavy metal ions.
@highlight The modified membranes showed high adsorption capacity for heavy metal ions.
