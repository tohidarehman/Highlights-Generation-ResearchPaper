 Fine particles pose a dangerous threat to our environment and human health . Although a series of air filters have been developed to achieve high removal efficiency while maintaining a low pressure drop is still a challenging task . Herein we introduce an additional force into action the space charge when designing the filter to capture the particulate matters . The corona discharge drives the PMs toward graphene aerogel filter under the imposed electrostatic force . The prepared filter displays a very high PM removal efficiency and low pressure drop under an extremely high concentration 10000g m

@highlight Robust graphene aerogel filter is rationally designed and constructed.
@highlight Particulate matters PMs were captured by the imposed electrostatic force.
@highlight Filter displays a good removal efficiency under an ultrahigh PMs concentration.
@highlight Renewable filters are sustainable for PMs capturing under a low pressure drop.
