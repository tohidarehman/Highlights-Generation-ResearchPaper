 In the present study we investigated the degradation kinetics and transformation pathways of two 5 halogenosalicylic acids namely 5 chlorosalicylic acid and 5 bromosalicylic acid by sulfate radical SO

@highlight Efficient removal of 5ClSA and 5BrSA was achieved by thermo activated persulfate.
@highlight Phenoxyl radicals were identified as the key intermediates in the reaction process.
@highlight Subsequent reactions of phenoxyl radicals included hydroxylation and coupling.
@highlight Dissolved oxygen exhibited no effect on the degradation kinetics of 5XSA.
