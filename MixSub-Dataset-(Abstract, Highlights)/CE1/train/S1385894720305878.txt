 Increasing application of rare earth elements in electronics renewable energy biomedical devices and industrial products has increased their demand globally . Enhanced production of industrial and electronic wastes has led the researchers to focus on the REE recovery from these alternative economic sources . Recent developments in bioprocess technology have created suitable avenues of REE recovery from waste materials . This review focuses on secondary sources of REE including industrial wastes mine wastes and electronic wastes . Detailed mechanisms of REE biorecovery from waste mineral sources have been discussed elaborately . The influence of physico chemical operational parameters on the efficiency of REE biorecovery from source materials has also been thoroughly elaborated . Analyses in terms of economic perspectives indicate that REE biorecovery from waste materials may be a cost effective approach . This review directs future research towards the development of enhanced REE biorecovery from wastes on a large commercial scale .

@highlight There is an increasing worldwide demand for REEs and a limited global supply.
@highlight Several industrial and e wastes have been used as sources for biorecovery of REEs.
@highlight Bioaccumulation dissolution and bioprecipitation are main biorecovery mechanisms.
@highlight Key biorecovery factors include pH redox potential temperature and aeration.
