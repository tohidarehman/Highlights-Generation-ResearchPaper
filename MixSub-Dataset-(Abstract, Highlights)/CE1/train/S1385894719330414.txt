 An enhanced hydrolysis process has been proposed as a promising pretreatment method for removing high concentrations of antibiotics from production wastewater . Herein the prediction of hydrolysis efficiency and reactive moieties of 14 fermentative antibiotics belonging to six classes were investigated at 85C under different pH conditions . Eight antibiotics could be hydrolyzed at 85C within 1h . A semi empirical prediction tool using the parameterized model number 3 method was established by making correlations between the enhanced hydrolysis efficiency and E the energy gap between the lowest unoccupied and highest occupied molecular orbitals E

@highlight Energy gap of antibiotics was one of the key factors to predict hydrolysis potential.
@highlight Some hydrolysis moieties were related to the active antibacterial groups of antibiotics.
@highlight Enhanced hydrolysis could remove antibacterial activity in wastewater.
