 There are increasing demands for self healing anti corrosion coatings with high efficiency and durability in various industrial applications . Recently eumelanin polymers especially polydopamine based nanostructures have been served as a mussel inspired strategy to provide such requirements due to the intrinsic adhesive nature of amines and catechols along with its film forming ability . Nevertheless direct embedment of hydrophilic PDA nanoparticles into polymer coatings could eventually trigger corrosion as a consequence of the osmotic pressure exerted beneath the coating . In the present work we have adopted a rational design for constructing robust self healing epoxy composites

@highlight PDA Zn complex nanospheres were tailored on the graphene oxide sheets.
@highlight PDA and Zn II reduced the corrosion rate of both cathodic and anodic reactions.
@highlight GO PDA Zn nanocomposites exhibited excellent ion capturing releasing properties.
@highlight GO PDA Zn EP showed robust self healing anti corrosion properties.
