 In this work polysulfonamide membranes are presented that are prepared by the interfacial polymerization of polyethylenimine and benzene 1 3 disulfonyl chloride on porous polyvinylidenefluorid support membrane . The thin lm composite polysulfonamide membranes show superior acid stability as compared to conventional polysulfonamide membranes that are derived from monomeric amine and benzene 1 3 disulfonyl chloride . The polysulfonamide membranes show exceptionally strong resistance towards nucleophilic attack induced by extreme acidic conditions . This is veried by the dyes rejection performance in 20 H

@highlight Acid stable PSA membrane was developed by interfacial polymerization of PIP MPD PEI and BDSC.
@highlight PSA membranes displayed a remarkable dyes rejection.
@highlight The presence of PEI in amine solution has increased the stability of the membranes.
@highlight The PSA membrane has excellent acid stability to 20 w v H
@highlight SO
@highlight and 2.5 w v HNO
@highlight aqueous solutions at 70 5 C.
