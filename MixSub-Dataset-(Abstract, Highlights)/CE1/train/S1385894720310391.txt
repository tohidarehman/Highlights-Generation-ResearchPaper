 In this work and for the first time an alkali metal potassium as a promoter was loaded on an activated carbon to be used for selective catalytic reduction of NO from industrial flue gas . The denitrification activity of K modified AC samples was investigated and compared with those of acid and Cu modified AC samples . The three modifications can enhance the denitrification activity of AC samples . To investigate the enhanced mechanisms of denitrification and SO

@highlight AC K shows efficient SCR activity due to increasing new active intermediates.
@highlight AC K shows good sulfur resistance owing to the enhanced chemisorption of NO.
@highlight AC K shows a high N
@highlight selectivity by promoting the dissociation of N
@highlight O.
