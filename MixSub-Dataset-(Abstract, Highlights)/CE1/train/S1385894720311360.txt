 Multinary metal oxide semiconductor based gas sensors have great potentials to attain outstanding selectivity comparing with binary metal oxides owing to their abundant structure types . While doping is a very versatile route to modify the electronic structure of MOSs and enhance the sensing response to specific gas . Inspired by the encouraging results of Mo doped in the BiVO

@highlight The sensing properties of Mo doped BiVO
@highlight were investigated for the first time.
@highlight 0.2 at Mo doped BiVO
@highlight possess the best gas sensing properties to H
@highlight S at 150C.
@highlight The introduced Mo in BiVO
@highlight can adjust conductivity and induce the oxygen vacancy.
