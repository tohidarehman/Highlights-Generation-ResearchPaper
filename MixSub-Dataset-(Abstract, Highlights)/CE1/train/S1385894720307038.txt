@highlight UV HSO
@highlight and UV S
@highlight led to fast degradation of PhACs in secondary effluents.
@highlight UV HSO
@highlight was less effective than UV H
@highlight in degrading PhACs.
@highlight The efficacy of UV S
@highlight depends upon the rate constants of PhACs with SO
@highlight UV S
@highlight led to faster degradation of CBZ GEM IBP and TMP but not CRMT and DEET.
@highlight The second order rate constants of HO
@highlight  SO
@highlight with the target PhACs were determined.
