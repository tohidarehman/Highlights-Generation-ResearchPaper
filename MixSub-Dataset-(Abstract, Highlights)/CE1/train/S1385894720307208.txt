 The objectives of this study were to assess the formaldehyde adsorption capacity of doped porous carbon by experiments and theoretical calculations . Nitrogen sulfur or phosphorus containing porous carbons were prepared with different precursors by activation with KOH at 700C and compared with commercial activated carbon and used as the low HCHO concentration adsorbents in dry and wet conditions . Results showed that the HCHO adsorption capacity of AC N 2418.20m

@highlight Removal of indoor HCHO could be enhanced by doping optimized elements.
@highlight The static dynamic adsorption trends of doped materials to HCHO were consistent.
@highlight The adsorption energy of doped carbon materials to HCHO was P S N by DFT calculations.
@highlight Surface functional groups played a secondary important role in the HCHO adsorption.
