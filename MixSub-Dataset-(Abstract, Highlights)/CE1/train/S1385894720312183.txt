 An organohalloysite was prepared using a new procedure . Halloysite was pre intercalated with dimethyl sulfoxide and then mixed with a solution of hexadecyltrimethylammonium having a concentration equivalent to six times the CEC of the starting Algerian halloysite . The novel nanohybrid obtained was characterized and compared with a sample intercalated from the beginning by HDTMA . Intercalation of HDTMA cations in the interlayer space was evidenced by XRD with an expansion of the basal distance from 7.6 to 26.0 for an intercalation rate of 75 versus 42 for HH6 . All materials were used to remove diclofenac . pH influence isotherm thermodynamic data reusability of the best adsorbent and the mechanism of interaction have been examined . The experimental isotherms were appropriately adjusted by the Redlich Peterson equation . The best adsorbent adsorbs 154.3mgg

@highlight Halloysite was intercalated with HDTMA via a novel procedure.
@highlight An expansion of basal distance occurred with 26.0 for intercalation rate of 75 .
@highlight The resulting nanohybrids were used as diclofenac DFC adsorbents.
@highlight The aim is to understand the interaction mechanism for effective use in depollution.
@highlight The mechanism would involve a hydrophobic bond and electrostatic interaction.
