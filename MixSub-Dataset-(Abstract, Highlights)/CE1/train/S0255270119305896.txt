 In industries where water is used for heating cooling purpose i.e . water desalination oil fields operations are carried out one of the major problem is deposition of metal salts on the surface of the different heat transfer equipments reducing its overall heat transfer efficiency increased pressure drop and increasing the maintenance cost of the unit and due to shut down of the plant there is a reduction in the production . It also decreases the purity of the desired product . When the various metal salts present in the process fluid combine with each other due to a change in the pH pressure concentration and temperature of the operating system leads to a change in the solubility of the ions present in the system . This leads to the process of nucleation and crystal growth in the system . In the current work we have examined the process of deposition of gypsum crystals in a supersaturated brine on the Mild steel metal surface and its inhibition under different hydrodynamic conditions .

@highlight A change in the equilibrium of the system leads to the process of Nucleation and Crystal Growth. These Crystals adhere on the metallic surface due to the adhesive forces between the crystals and the surface. Overcoming this adhesive force of attraction by providing excessive shear force on the crystals by the flowing fluid can inhibit the process of scale deposition on the surface.
@highlight The effect of linear velocity on the process of scale deposition was found to be effective beyond 3.8 4 m s.
@highlight The crystal size and morphology was significantly changed due a change in turbulence and linear fluid velocity.
