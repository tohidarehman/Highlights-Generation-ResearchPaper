 In this study the effect of rare earth Y on the microwave absorbing properties of the powders was studied directing against low electromagnetic loss and low dielectric constant of Fe

@highlight Fe
@highlight Si
@highlight alloy powders with excellent absorbing properties were prepared.
@highlight The mechanism of yttrium s influence on absorbing performance was explored.
@highlight The minimum interference thickness at 0.3GHz decreased by 56.5 .
@highlight The performances were due to synergistic effects of components and structure.
