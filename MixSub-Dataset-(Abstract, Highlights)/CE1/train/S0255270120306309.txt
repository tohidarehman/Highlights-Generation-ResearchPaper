 Steam injection is one of the popular methods for oil recovery enhancement . Success of this method to a significant extent depends on steam properties at a point of injection into a reservoir . A model of a steam flow through an injection tubing is developed . Heat losses from a flow to a surrounding formation are assumed to be quasi steady state . A simplified model of a cylindrical reservoir at injection tubing end is introduced into the flow model to imitate realistic boundary conditions . Fluid thermodynamic parameters are calculated by using high precision correlations . Computations performed are focused on high pressure high temperature flow conditions . Effects of initial steam quality fluid flow rate different frictional pressure correlations and insulation thermal conductivity on distributions of steam quality pressure and temperature along a vertical tubing are studied . An effect of initial steam conditions on a steam flow is also illustrated . A strong effect of hydrostatic pressure on a steam flow behavior is demonstrated .
