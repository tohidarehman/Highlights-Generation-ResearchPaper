 The application of lithium ion battery in portable electronics and electric vehicle has received tremendous attention however challenges remain in seeking suitable high capacity anode materials with excellent rate performance and thus potentially to boost the energy power density . Here we report an arc discharge production of high quality F modified graphene as anode for LIB with high rate capability . As a result of F modified the acquired graphene exhibits high atomic ratio of C O excellent electric conductivity and more crumpled and wrinkled surface . Interestingly the in situ formation of LiF nanoparticles during the first Li
