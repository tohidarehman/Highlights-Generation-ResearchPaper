 Effective and rapid mixing is crucial for chemical and biological processes . The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effect of steady and varying magnetic field on the mixing of a water based ferrofluid and two streams of deionized water inside a microchannel for Lab on Chip applications . To this end the nonlinear governing equations the momentum equation the continuity equation the mass transport equation and the Maxwell Ampere equations are numerically solved . A commercial code based on the finite element method is used and the numerical simulations are validated by the experimental results in the literature . To augment the mixing performance the effects of influencing parameters such as the magnetic field strength and frequency inlet velocity relative inlet velocity and duty cycle are investigated . A mixing efficiency as high as 94.4 only after 13s is achieved with a peak current of 1 A a frequency of 5 Hz 100 m s of inlet velocity a relative inlet velocity between the ferrofluid and water streams of 0.8 and a duty cycle of 0.2 . This proposed model provides a versatile and low cost solution to intensify microfluidic mixing performance and develop efficient Lab on Chip platforms .

@highlight Higher switching frequency improves the mixing for stronger magnetic field strengths.
@highlight By increasing the inlet velocity the mixing efficiency decreases.
@highlight Relative inlet velocity around 0.8 is best for the mixing efficiency.
@highlight Duty cycle around 0.2 provides a homogenous concentration at the outlet.
@highlight Ferrofluid is mixed with DI water with 94.4 mixing efficiency in 13s.
