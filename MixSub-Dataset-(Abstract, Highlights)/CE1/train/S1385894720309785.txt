 Toluene and dichloromethane are two kinds of frequently encountered VOC species derived from solvent usage which severely threaten human health and the ecological environment . At the same time they are valuable industrial resources that can be recovered . In this study different types of zeolites with various topological structures including FAU MFI and BEA were employed for adsorptive recovery of both VOCs . All adsorbents were characterized by means of X ray diffraction scanning electron microscopy N

@highlight Adsorption of VOCs and water vapor was studied by static equilibrium and dynamic measurements.
@highlight High silica zeolites with various structures were compared for separate VOCs from exhaust.
@highlight Multi component breakthrough combined with DFT calculation was conducted to reveal the mechanism.
@highlight Silicalite 1 is the best adsorbent to remove toluene and dichloromethane under humid conditions.
