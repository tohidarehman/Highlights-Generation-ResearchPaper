 The Thermal Electrochemical Co drive System has the advantages of high desorption rate and low energy consumption . However the fluid flow and capture performance is still unknown in TECS . Thus a comprehensive experiment and simulation work on TECS is performed to demonstrate the fluid flow and capture performance in a pilot scale TECS . The reaction kinetics of the electrolyzed MEA SG solution is discussed . A pilot scale TECS is set up and gas liquid two phase flow model is developed for the TECS . According to the numerical computation and experiment the gas liquid two phase flow field was analyzed under the thermal electrochemical co drive conditions . The mechanism of CO
