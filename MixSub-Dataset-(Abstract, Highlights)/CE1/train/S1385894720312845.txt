 Arsenic is worldwide recognized the first class carcinogen . How to efficiently treat arsenic in alkaline mining smelting wastewater is an urgent technical problem . Here in acetate modulated yttrium based metal organic frameworks MOF 76 Ac has been exploited for investing the adsorption behavior and mechanism of arsenate in alkaline conditions . MOF 76 Ac presented smaller particle size higher porosity and larger number of coordinatively unsaturated sites and consequently exhibited significantly enhanced adsorption affinity and capacity toward arsenate compared with that of pristine MOF 76 . In the optimized operating condition the maximum Langmuir adsorption capacity of arsenate by MOF 76 Ac can be 201.46mgg

@highlight Yttrium MOFs were first applied in dearsenic from alkaline smelting wastewater.
@highlight Acetate modulation obviously enhanced As V adsorption performance of MOF 76 Y .
@highlight As V adsorption selectivity and reusability were confirmed.
@highlight Adsorption mechanism of As V on MOF 76 Y Ac in alkaline condition was proposed.
