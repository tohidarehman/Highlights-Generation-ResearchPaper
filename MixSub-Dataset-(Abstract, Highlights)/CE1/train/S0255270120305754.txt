 In this work three new configurations in a hybrid adsorption membrane technique were adopted for the removal of methyl green dye from synthetic wastewater and tested the capability of HAMT on real sample from textile industry . The hybrid process involved the simultaneous activity of mesoporous material MCM 41 as an adsorbent coupled with an ultrafiltration membrane . The effects of the feed flow rate MG concentration and MCM 41 dose were tested for each system configuration . The results proved the significant effect of the feed flow rate feed concentration and MCM 41 dose on both permeate flux and MG rejection . The rustles showed that the optimum configuration performance was in the following order Batch filtration with the retentate full recycled Semi batch filtration Single pass continuous filtration . Where the highest permeate flux and rejection coefficient were 42.5 L hr . m
