 In order to fully exploit the potential of Cu based Fenton systems Ce was utilized to modify the Cu based catalysts through one pot synthesis . A typical antifungal drug fluconazole was selected as the target pollutant to evaluate the reactivity of as synthetic Cu Ce bimetallic catalysts . Evaluation test results indicated Ce

@highlight Ce was used to enhance the surface characteristics of Cu based materials.
@highlight Cu Ce bimetallic catalyst showed much higher reactivity for FLC degradation.
@highlight The relationship between catalyst activity and structure was investigated in detail.
@highlight Mechanism of Cu Ce composite catalyzed Fenton reaction is proposed.
