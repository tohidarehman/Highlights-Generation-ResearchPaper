 The powdery electromagnetic functional materials severely suffer from the intricate post compositing coating process and high weight loading in the ultimate production which desires a significant revolution of the manufacture technology . Herein a facile and scalable drawing method is developed for manufacturing a series of flexible repairable and high performance electromagnetic functional coatings with merely ultra low filler contents . The holography and simulation demonstrate that the drawing process can simultaneously enhance the structural anisotropy and confine the distribution of the filler thereby significantly reducing the filler content . For instance the pencil drawing with high dielectric constant holds a record low graphite content of 4.7wt which sharply reduces by 89.6 compared to traditional polymer graphite composite . Other six kinds of materials with different dimensions are further employed to prove the universality of the unique drawing method . All these drawings acquire the first rate electromagnetic stealth and interference shielding performance within a wide effective operating bandwidth of 12GHz with slight filler weight fractions . Eventually the as drawn composites with excellent flexibility and repairability can be easily coated on the equipment without any post processing . The above achievements endow the drawing method with broad application prospects such as wearable electromagnetic functional textiles and renewable devices .
