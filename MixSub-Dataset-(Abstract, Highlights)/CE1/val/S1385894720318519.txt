 Lithium sulfur batteries are considered as a promising next generation battery system because of their theoretical high capacity and large energy density . However such battery still faces many obstacles mainly including the shuttle effect of polysulfides and sluggish reaction kinetics of the electrode actions . Herein a freestanding metallic tin modified and nitrogen doped carbon skeleton was designed and used as the interlayer for Li S batteries to efficiently mitigate the above issues and sustain a long lifespan . Here the carbon skeleton builds a high effective conductive network for the whole interface while the uniformly distributed metallic tin nanoparticles act as an absorbent of polysulfides and a catalyst to promote the conversion of sulfur species . As a result both the specific capacity and cycle stability of Li S battery are significantly improved with the assistance of the TCS interlayer . With a high sulfur content of 72.6wt Li S battery used TCS as interlayer shows an ultrahigh initial capacity of 1123.1mAhg
