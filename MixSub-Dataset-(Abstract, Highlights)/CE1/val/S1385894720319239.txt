 Injectable hydrogels have potential applications for regenerating the injured spinal cord but their performance needs to be further improved . In this study an injectable silk fibroin polydopamine composite hydrogel was fabricated

@highlight An injectable SF PDA composite hydrogel was successfully fabricated.
@highlight The hydrogel with 2mg mL DA had the best hippocampal neuron growth behavior.
@highlight The SF PDA hydrogel possessed the capability of repairing SCI in vivo.
@highlight Self polymerization and crosslink reaction mechanism coexisted in SF PDA hydrogel.
@highlight The study provides experimental and theoretical basis for developing SCI implants.
