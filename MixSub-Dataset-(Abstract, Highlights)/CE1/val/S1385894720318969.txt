 Air pollution has become a global concern and numerous studies have focused on developing filters for particulate matter removal . However the reusability of air filters which could lower resources consumption and waste discharge is also necessary to be investigated . In this study a water washable electrospun poly cellulose nanocrystals nanofibrous air filter for PM removal was prepared . The water soluble polymer composite was converted to be completely water resistant via a facile heat treatment without adding any crosslinking agent . Our results indicate the increased crystallinity is the key factor to improve the aqueous stability of PVA CNCs fibers . The CNCs provided additional nucleation sites for PVA crystallization during electrospinning and heating process . By loading 20 CNCs and heating at 140C for 5min the crystallinity degree and crystal size of PVA were increased from 54.7 and 3.3nm to 85.4 and 6.3nm respectively . The reusability of fabricated filters was tested by water washing over 5 cycles . The results show the heavily fouled filters were regenerated effectively the PM
