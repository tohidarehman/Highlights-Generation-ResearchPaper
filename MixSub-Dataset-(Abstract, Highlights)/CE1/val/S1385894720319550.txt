 Improvement in the durability and activity of platinum based electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction is significant for the large scale commercial applications of proton exchange membrane fuel cells . Herein porous boron nitride was employed as functional support to stabilize Pt nanoparticles and engineer its electronic structure . The as prepared p BN supported Pt NPs achieved excellent activity and stability for ORR with 53mV positive shift of half wave potential compared to commercial 20wt Pt C electrocatalyst and the electrochemical active surface area remained almost unaltered after 10 000 potential cycling durability tests . Density functional theory calculations clarified that electron rich N and electron deficient B play different roles when p BN interacts with Pt . The transfer of electrons from electron rich N atoms to Pt NPs and from Pt NPs to electron deficient B atoms generate the occurrence of an electron donation back donation process which strengthened the binding between Pt NPs and p BN and aided in optimization of the electronic structure of Pt . The results of this study clarified the interaction between p BN and Pt catalyst and demonstrate that p BN can effectively anchor Pt NPs to enhance the ORR performance by promoting easy electron transfer during catalytic reactions and preventing Pt NPs from aggregation in the process of ORR .

@highlight The ultrafine Pt NPs are anchored on the edge of micropores of p BN.
@highlight The electron donation back donation process is formed between Pt NPs and p BN.
@highlight The Pt p BN catalyst achieves superior catalytic performance to Com. Pt C.
@highlight The durability of Pt is enhanced due to the strong metal support interaction.
