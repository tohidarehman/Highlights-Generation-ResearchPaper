 The use of a photocatalytic fuel cell in wastewater treatment is an intensively researched topic because the device integrates organic pollutant degradation and chemical energy recovery . Herein we proposed a strategy to enhance PFC performance by increasing the concentrations of hydroxyl radical HO

@highlight Oxygen containing groups were introduced to graphite felt by H
@highlight SO
@highlight treatment.
@highlight Activated graphite felt cathode exhibited enhanced in situ H
@highlight generation.
@highlight produced high concentration of free radicals for organic matter degradation.
@highlight Activated graphite felt cathode improved photocatalytic fuel cell performance.
