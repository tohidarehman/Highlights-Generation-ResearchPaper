 Non wettable surfaces have attracted attention for their promising potential in anti fouling and self cleaning applications . However the complex fabrication and loss of super hydrophobicity because of poor durability have restricted their commercial applications . To address these issues a robust super hydrophobic surface was fabricated through construction of a coral reef like fibrous structure followed by adhesive assisted dip coating . Wrinkled fibrous nano silica was synthesized using the Winsor III system . WFNS having hierarchal surface and enhanced surface area was modified by salinizing agent and by coated on various substrates . This fibrous structure aids to minimize the water solid interface resulted to achieve the super hydrophobic surface with a water contact angle of 167 . To impart mechanical and chemical robustness an adhesive assisted approach was used . The as prepared surface maintained a remarkable super hydrophobicity even after mechanical and chemical stresses . The prepared super hydrophobic surface illustrated excellent anti fouling performance against corrosive liquids and an antimycotic property . The combination of liquid repellency and exceptional robustness exhibited indicates the WFNS as a promising candidate for super hydrophobic and self cleaning applications .
