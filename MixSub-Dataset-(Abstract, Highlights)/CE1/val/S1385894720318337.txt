 Electrode materials play a paramount role in developing high performance lithium ion batteries . Nanostructured electrode materials can offer unique advantages such as high rate capability . Here we describe a strategy for synthesizing advanced anode materials with tungsten nitride quantum dots firmly anchored on mesoporous ternary borocarbonitride . A composite sample exhibited reversible capacities of 683.4 and 366.9mAhg

@highlight Highly dispersed WN quantum dots confined within porous BCN is prepared.
@highlight The composite as anode material exhibits high rate performance in Li ion batteries.
@highlight Porous BCN and ultra small WN particles synergistically contribute to the high performance.
