 A novel iron cobalt mixed oxychloride nanosheet with a plane size in the ranges of 0.21.0m and a thickness of 3040nm was manufactured firstly and employed as catalyst for peroxymonosulfate activation . The CoFeOCl PMS system exhibits excellent catalytic activity for non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs removal at buffered pH 5.58.5 with extremely low catalyst dosage . The mechanism of PMS activation by CoFeOCl indicated that
