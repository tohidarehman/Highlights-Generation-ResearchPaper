 It is of significant importance and a great challenge to explore new electrocatalysts with highly activity and durability above all high mass activity and rapid kinetics for oxygen evolution reaction due to the demand for clean energy . In this work we prepared a three dimensional CoFe based zemannite type selenite via in situ transformation of CoFe layered double hydroxide as both the precursor and template . The as prepared CoFe selenite affords low overpotential in 1.0M KOH on glass carbon electrode @ 10mAcm

@highlight A zeolite type CoFe selenite was discovered via a facile in situ transformation of LDH.
@highlight This fabricated electrocatalyst exhibits superior OER activity in 1M KOH electrolyte.
@highlight Its unique structure and composition are favorable for the activity of the active sites.
@highlight The present study provides a new insight into developing highly active OER catalysts.
