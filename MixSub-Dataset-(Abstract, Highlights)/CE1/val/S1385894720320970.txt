 The oxygen reduction reaction is critical to various energy conversion and storage systems . Developing cost effective and high performance metal free carbon as an alternative to Pt based ORR electrocatalytsts is a promising strategy for the commercialization of these clean energy conversion technologies . In this work the microalgae biomass with a high N content was used as a precursor to prepare N doped biochar material via an ionic liquid assisted carbonization process . Experimental results show that the sp
