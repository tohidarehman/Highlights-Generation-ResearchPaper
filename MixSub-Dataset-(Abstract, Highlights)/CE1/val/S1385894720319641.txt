 In view of the urgency to replace fossil fuel based energy sources with sustainable and renewable sources much has been done to discover new materials and or production methods that can provide devices capable of converting solar energy into chemical or electrical energy . This work describes the electrodeposition of Bi on WO

@highlight Metallic Bi electrodeposition as a pre step to improve the heterojunction WO
@highlight  BiVO
@highlight Obtaining pillar like BiVO
@highlight structure by intermediary step of Bi electrodeposition.
@highlight Using spray electrodeposition and drop casting to build WO
@highlight  BiVO
@highlight heterojunctions.
@highlight Increasing the time constant of charge carriers by suitable heterojunction formation.
