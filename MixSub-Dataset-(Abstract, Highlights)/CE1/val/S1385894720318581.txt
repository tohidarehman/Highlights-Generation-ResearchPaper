 This work presents novel photochemical reactors with integrated titania photocatalyst for the UV photodecomposition of gaseous methyl iodide present in simulated vessel off gas in a nuclear fuel reprocessing facility . Continuous flow reactors composed of fluorinated ethylene propylene were designed and constructed to allow transmission of UV light into the reactor while also providing resistance to the corrosive nature of methyl iodide . Titania nanotube photocatalyst increases methyl iodide photolysis rate by two orders of magnitude compared to that with UV light alone . The rate constant for methyl iodide photolysis with and without catalyst directly depends on the intensity of the light at the location of the reaction which is inversely proportional to the distance from the linear light source . The titania photocatalyst is significantly active at low light intensity where no detectable reaction occurs in absence of catalyst . For example at an initial concentration of 400ppb methyl iodide a residence time of 9s and a light intensity of 0.5mW cm
