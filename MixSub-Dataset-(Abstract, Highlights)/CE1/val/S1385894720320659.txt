 In this study we report a convenient one pot synthesis of silsesquioxane hybrid xerogels with excellent mechanical flexibility by using copolymer emulsion as templates . During the acid catalyzed sol gel process of the precursors the random copolymers of n butyl methacrylate and hydroxyethyl methacrylate not only suppressed macroscopic phase separation but also were incorporated in the skeleton of polysilsesquioxane by synergistic physical and chemical interactions . The resultant gels could be directly dried via ambient pressure drying to gain xerogels without visible volume shrinkage . This unique preparation process is economical and environment friendly without involving any organic solvents . The morphology and physicochemical performance of the monolithic hybrid xerogels can be readily tailored by changing the compositions and the concentrations of silsesquioxanes and copolymers in the reaction solutions . Xerogels fabricated from methyltrimethoxysilane showed excellent thermal insulation property inherently superhydrophobicity and outstanding mechanical strength against compression up to 50MPa . Besides the compressed specimen could recover its original shape by immersing in solvents and subsequently drying .
