 Organic materials are attractive for energy storage due to the structural versatility and green sustainability . Recently the organic material based on polyaniline has exhibited an enormous potential for zinc ion batteries . However their advancement still suffers from limited capacities and unstable voltage plateaus . Herein we have for the first time developed the poly organic cathode for aqueous ZIBs . The PoPD with phenazine like structures can integrate sufficient C

@highlight A novel polymer organic cathode PoPD was prepared by a facile chemical oxidation reaction.
@highlight The active C
@highlight N bonds in the organic cathode were found to be responsible for efficient zinc ion storage.
@highlight The as prepared cathode exhibits a high specific capacity with excellent rate and cyclic performance.
