 Functional moieties are critical in mixed mode ligand design for separation and purification of biomolecules . This study investigated the role of carboxyl group and a hydrophobic moiety on a recently developed mixed mode ligand for hIgG purification . The effects of carboxyl group were focused for its appearance in several commercial mixed mode ligands . A ligand with glutamic acid on FYE ABI substituted by glutamine was first prepared to explore the binding mechanism of the FYE ABI ligand . The selectivity of the FYQ ABI ligand was found inferior comparing to the original design which was gradually recovered during the hydrolysis process of glutamine to glutamic acid . Meanwhile a cationic exchange resin CM Bestarose Fast Flow with carboxyl group was used for comparison and the results demonstrated that other moieties such as aminobenzimidazole were helpful for elution processes . A new model mixed mode ligand with such a design principle was thus synthesized and comparable separation performance was achieved using the prepared resins . The model ligand had much simplified chemical structure and this study can help for the design of related mixed mode ligands for antibody purification .
