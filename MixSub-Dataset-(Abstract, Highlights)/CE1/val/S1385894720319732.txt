 Nitrogen containing polymers with high cross linking degrees are attractive precursors for the preparation of N doped porous carbons while their synthesis in liquid phases is difficult . Moreover the difference between liquid phase synthesis and solvent free synthesis has not been well clarified . Herein a solvent free strategy was employed for the synthesis of an N containing polymer from 1 3 5 tris 2 4 6 trimethylbenzene and

@highlight An N containing polymer was prepared by solvent free method.
@highlight The solvent free method endows the polymer with highly crosslinking structure and ideal thermal stability.
@highlight The derived N doped porous carbons possess developed microporosity.
@highlight The CO
@highlight adsorption capacity of a derived N doped porous carbon reaches 8.1mmol g.
