 Recently plenty of nanomaterials have demonstrated great promise for photothermal therapy of osteosarcoma . However bioactive nanomaterials are still rare to function as nano photothermal agents to thoroughly kill residual tumor cells and repair the bone defects caused by surgical removal of bone tumors . Herein for the first time two dimensional borocarbonitrides nanosheets were applied in the biomedicine to play multiple roles of photothermal agent for osteosarcoma therapy and promoter for bone regeneration . In this work akermanite Ca
