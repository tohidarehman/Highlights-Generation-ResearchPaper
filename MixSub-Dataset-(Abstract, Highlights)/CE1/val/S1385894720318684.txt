 Co precipitation is by far the most common synthesis for magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles as cheap and environmentally friendly precursors and simple experimental procedures facilitate IONP production in many labs . Optimising co precipitation syntheses remains challenging however as particle formation mechanisms are not well understood . This is partly due to the rapid particle formation providing insufficient time to characterise initial precipitates . To overcome this limitation a flow chemistry approach has been developed using steady state operation to freeze transient reaction states locally . This allowed for the first time a comprehensive analysis of the early stages of co precipitation syntheses

@highlight Early reaction stages of a co precipitation synthesis were studied
@highlight in situ synchrotron XRD and SAXS.
@highlight A stabilisation procedure was developed not requiring any ultra sonication or washing step.
@highlight IONP formation and stabilisation kinetics were determined.
@highlight A multistage flow reactor facilitated the entirely continuous production of stable IONPs.
