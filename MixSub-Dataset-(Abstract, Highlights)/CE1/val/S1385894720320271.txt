 Co based catalysts can effectively active peroxymonosulfate for organic pollutants degradation . However the loaded Co on porous materials could easily release into the solution during the reaction . Herein a stable layered double oxide supported Co Fe bimetal catalyst i.e . Co

@highlight Co
@highlight FeAl LDO was synthesized to active PMS for carbamazepine degradation.
@highlight Co
@highlight FeAl LDO presented 99 removal of carbamazepine in 30min.
@highlight The coexistence of Co Fe Al and LDO made Co
@highlight FeAl LDO a high effective catalyst.
@highlight The optimal conditions and inhibitory effects of the reactions were investigated.
@highlight The activation and degradation mechanisms were proposed.
