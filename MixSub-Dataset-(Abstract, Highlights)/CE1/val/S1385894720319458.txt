 Cs is harmful to human health and the environment hence research on new techniques and development of materials for removing from contaminated water have attracted attention . Herein we demonstrate that core shell structured Prussian bluecarbon nanofiber composites synthesized by electrodeposition can be used to effectively remove radioactive

@highlight Core shell structured Prussian blue carbon nanofiber PB CNF are synthesized.
@highlight PB CNF efficiently remove the Cs ions by sequential adsorption and desorption.
@highlight Electrochemical system using PB CNF can be an alternative Cs removal process.
