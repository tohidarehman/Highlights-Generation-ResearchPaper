 Anaerobic digestion at low temperature for low strength municipal sewage treatment was evaluated in two laboratory scale up flow anaerobic sludge blankets one with and one without granular activated carbon . During the 120 day operation the addition of GAC significantly improved average COD removal and methane production from 132 to 264mL CH

@highlight Granular activated carbon GAC enhanced wastewater anaerobic digestion at 20C.
@highlight Slight increase in
@highlight  from 9 to 12 .
@highlight Biomass electric conductivity increased from 1.52 to 8.37S cm.
@highlight DIET was stimulated through sludge physiological changes.
@highlight GAC upregulated the functional gene
@highlight expression.
