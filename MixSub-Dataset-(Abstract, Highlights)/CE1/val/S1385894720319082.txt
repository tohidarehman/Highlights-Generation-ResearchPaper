 At present traditional inhibitors applied for selective flotation of fluorapatite from dolomite generally own low selectivity high toxicity large dosages and high costs . Thus this research offers a novel non toxic and eco friendly dolomite depressant 2 phosphonobutane 1 2 4 tricarboxylic acid for selective flotation of fluorapatite with sodium oleate as a collector . The selectively depressing effect and adsorption mechanism of PBTCA in the selective flotation of fluorapatite from dolomite were investigated via a series of experiments and analyses . The results from zeta potential and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that the chemisorption of PBTCA onto dolomite was much stronger than fluorapatite . Crystal chemistry calculation and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy further confirmed that large amounts of Mg sites only exposed on the dolomite surface mainly accounted for the selective adsorption of PBTCA onto dolomite due to the strong affinity to PBTCA . Moreover the chemisorption of NaOL onto fluorapatite was hardly affected by the pre addition of PBTCA whereas the intensive chemisorption of PBTCA prevented the adsorption of NaOL onto dolomite . As a result in the presence of PBTCA dolomite exhibited a poor flotation performance while there was good floatability for fluorapatite which benefited the efficient recovery of fluorapatite from dolomite by froth flotation .

@highlight PBTCA strongly depresses the flotation of dolomite rather than that of fluorapatite.
@highlight PBTCA is selectively adsorbed onto dolomite in the form of HL
@highlight and L
@highlight at pH 9.5.
@highlight Many Mg sites enhance the adsorption of PBTCA onto dolomite.
@highlight NaOL is still selectively adsorbed onto fluorapatite in the existence of PBTCA.
@highlight PBTCA can improve the selective flotation of fluorapatite from dolomite.
