 Recently hybrid architectures are extensively developed in environment and energy field with outstanding and multifunctional property to make up the drawbacks of less efficient single component nanomaterials . Thereinto noble metals are rationally integrated with carbon based dots as one of the most commonly pursued nanohybrids which can synergize their respective strengths after combining properties such as electronic property up conversion ability and localized surface plasmon resonance and exhibit enhanced features in the diverse applications . Herein this review focuses on the synthetic methods physicochemical characterizations and recent progress in applications of noble metal carbon dots nanohybrids . Specifically synthetic methods of NMs CDs nanohybrids are concluded which are different from the synthetic methods of NMs or CDs single component and have not been systematically concluded . It can help guide the NMs CDs nanohybrids control synthesis for obtaining target materials accordingly . physicochemical characterizations of NMs CDs nanohybrids are briefly summarized . applications of NMs CDs nanohybrids in environment field and energy field are summarized . In particular the mechanisms and synergistic effect between the two components in these applications are emphasized . Finally the limitation and prospects of NMs CDs in remaining issues are proposed for further development of these nanohybrids .

@highlight The synthetic methods of NMs CDs mainly include chemical reduction hydrothermal method and assembled method.
@highlight The combination of NMs and CDs synergizes their respective strengths for enhanced performance.
@highlight The electronic properties and up conversion ability of CDs as well as LSPR effect of NMs boost the catalytic performance.
@highlight Each NMs CDs in different application has its own characteristic depending on the applied conditions.
