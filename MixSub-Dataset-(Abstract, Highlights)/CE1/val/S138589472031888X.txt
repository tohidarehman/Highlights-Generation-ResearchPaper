 The present work introduces a novel strategy for preparation of a recyclable aerogel absorbent for heavy metal purification of industrial wastewater . The absorbent Fe

@highlight First report magnetic aerogel spheres based on alkaline residue alginate composite to remove heavy metal ions.
@highlight Mechanical strength of the composite aerogel spheres increased 10 times.
@highlight Possess excellent floating persistence feasible separability and good recycling stability.
@highlight Faicile fabrication easy industrialized production efficient adsorption to Cd II satisfying recyclability.
