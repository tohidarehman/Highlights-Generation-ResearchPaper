 The creation of biocatalytic nano platform with high performance is the focus of attention in the field of enzyme catalysis . However most enzyme nanoreactors suffer from poor versatility and recovery ability . Herein we construct a versatile biocatalytic nano platform with steady magnetic recyclability through hybrid magnetic carbon nanotubes named by h CNT Fe

@highlight A CNTs based biocatalytic nano platform with steady magnetic recyclability was prepared.
@highlight The CNTs were filled with Fe
@highlight nanoparticles the holes shrunk and surface loadable for enzymes.
@highlight Its role can be changed from biocatalyst to biosensor by loading different enzymes.
