 Strong and flexible hydrogels have attracted increasing scientific interest due to their soft and wetproperties which are similar to those of human soft tissues . In this study a bioinspired facile method to fabricate a composite hydrogel with a naturally high strength skeleton structure that shows comparable mechanical performance to those of muscle tendons and ligaments is reported . The method includes extracting an aligned cellulose skeleton directly from wood by delignification and then compositing with polyacrylamide by

@highlight An aligned cellulose skeleton was extracted from balsa wood by delignification.
@highlight A strong hydrogel was developed by combining cellulose skeleton with polyacrylamide.
@highlight Alkali treatment can swell and soften cellulose crystalline structures.
@highlight The prepared hydrogel shows super flexibility after alkali swelling treatment.
@highlight This study provides an effective route for developing flexible wood derived materials.
