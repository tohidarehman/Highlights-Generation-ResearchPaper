 This study retrofitted the rich split carbon capture process by introducing a commercial multi channel ceramic membrane heat exchanger for waste heat recovery from the stripped gas vented from the CO

@highlight Large pore sized ceramic membrane has a high heat recovery performance.
@highlight CO
@highlight capture cost reduces by waste heat recovery from the stripped gas.
@highlight Waste heat recovery may be more applicable in the high fuel price scenario.
