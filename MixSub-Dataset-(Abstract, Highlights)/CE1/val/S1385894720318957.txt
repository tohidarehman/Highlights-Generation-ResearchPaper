 Protein imprinted materials receive considerable attention in biological scope but restricted about practical utilization for the lack of adsorption efficiency and rebinding specificity . To approach the dearth imprinted polymers or ligands capable of designable structure herein the facile thiolactone based conjugates accompanied by multiple functional units were put forward into imprinting system as protein anchors by click chemistry . Due to the simple implementation and flexible reconstitution of this conjugation strategy a series of thiol ene amine segments were fabricated to capture bovine serum albumin for generating imprinting cavities through dopamine self polymerization on well defined hollow magnetic substrates . Among them the BSA imprinted microspheres based on thiol ene MA conjugates not only exhibited remarkable rebinding ability and efficient saturation adsorption but also presented satisfactory selectivity in the individual and competitive protein samples . Assisted with thiol ene amine conjugation the elaborate magnetic imprinted materials for specific separating target macromolecules hold great promising in applications .

@highlight Thiolactone based conjugates were used as protein anchors in imprinting systems.
@highlight The conjugation strategy was flexible in multiple functional units construction.
