 The rational design and synthesis of efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions and oxygen evolution reactions is significant yet challenging for rechargeable Zn air batteries . Up to now most attention has been focused on the ORR performance but the disproportion of OER proficiencies results in poor cycling capabilities and energy waste during charging process . Herein a dual active site hierarchical composite

@highlight A facile strategy is developed to construct a hierarchical
@highlight composite.
@highlight consists of Co N doped carbon nanotubes and NiFe layered double hydroxide.
@highlight possess abundant ORR and OER active sites with an overpotential of 819mV.
@highlight exhibits superior discharge power and durability in Zn air batteries.
@highlight The
@highlight based Zn air battery has a high peak power density 107.8mWcm
