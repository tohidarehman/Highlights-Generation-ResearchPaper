 Wide range linear viscoelastic materials with high mechanical properties have not been reported yet despite their bright prospect in diverse applications . Herein we fabricate a class of physical hydrogels manifesting linear stress strain relationship up to a strain of 1700 high tensile stress up to 12.0MPa and fracture toughness up to 82.1MJ m

@highlight Hydrogels are designed by a homogenous network with multi coordination interactions.
@highlight Such designing principles enable affine extension and progressive dissociation.
@highlight Hydrogels manifest wide range linear viscoelasticity with high mechanical properties.
@highlight Hydrogels can be used as quantifiable stress strain sensors.
