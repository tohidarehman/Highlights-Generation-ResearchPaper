 Construction of sulfur host with high immobilization ability and catalytic effect towards polysulfide intermediates is of great significance to boost the electrochemical performance of lithium sulfur batteries . Herein for the first time a free standing sulfur host consisting of cobalt and nitrogen co doped porous carbon nanocages supported by reduced graphene oxide Co

@highlight A free standing sulfur cathode consisting Co 
@highlight was prepared.
@highlight The cathode shows an improved immobilization and catalytic ability to polysulfide intermediates.
@highlight The cathode exhibits an exceptional capability and an ultralow capacity decay rate.
