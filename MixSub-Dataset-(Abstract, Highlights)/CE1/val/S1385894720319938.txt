 An efficient collection and recovery of high viscous crude oil from oil spillage through an environmental friendly way is extremely important for water remediation . Herein a new material of thermally reduced graphene oxide coating and decoration of hydrophobic layer over a compressible wood sponge was proposed as an adsorbent . Owing to the preferable photothermal conversion an in situ solar assisted thermogenesis process could increase the temperature to 88C within 100s under 1 sun illumination and decrease the viscosity of crude oil for easy adsorption . The fabricated adsorbent exhibited great performances in separation and adsorption 7.28g g0.801g cm
