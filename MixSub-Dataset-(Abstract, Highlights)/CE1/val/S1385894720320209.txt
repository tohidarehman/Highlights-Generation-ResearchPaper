 A new process for the treatment of phosphoric acid industry wastewater is proposed . The technique comprises the following major steps selective removal of fluoride ions via reaction adsorption with SiO

@highlight Two step process for treatment of acidic wastewater.
@highlight Fluoride removal by reaction adsorption on SiO
@highlight particles leads to pH decrease.
@highlight At low pH nonionic H
@highlight PO
@highlight is a major P specie that makes its separation possible.
@highlight Electrochemical separation of non charged H
@highlight PO
@highlight from Cl
@highlight and SO
@highlight ions.
@highlight 90 recovery of phosphorous and 100 removal of fluoride.
