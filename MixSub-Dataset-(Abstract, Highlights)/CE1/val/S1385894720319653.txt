 Lithium sulfur battery is one of the most promising next generation energy storage devices due to its low cost and ultrahigh energy density . However the uncontrolled formation of Li dendrites and shuttle effect seriously hinder its practical applications . To simultaneously address both fatal issues herein for the first time we present a novel Mo

@highlight Ultra uniform Mo
@highlight C quantum dots anchored on N doped graphene porous composites have been synthesized.
@highlight The embedded structure can provide pathways for Li
@highlight transportation.
@highlight Mo
@highlight C quantum
@highlight functionalized separators effectively suppress the Li dendrites.
@highlight Polar Mo
@highlight C effectively blocks the shuttle of polysulfides.
