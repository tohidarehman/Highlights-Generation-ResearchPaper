 The most common scale up methods for predicting the product distribution of competitive chemical reactions aim for partial similarity by keeping the dominant mixing mechanism constant . Instead methods aiming for complete similarity have been neglected as they were assumed to allow scale up for uneconomical process parameters only .

@highlight CSA as novel scale up method for competitive chemical model reactions is presented.
@highlight CSA is based on complete similarity of all chemical and mixing time scales.
@highlight CSA enables better reliable and applicable scale up and more concise result plots.
@highlight Successful validation of CSA by Villermaux Dushman experiments in static mixers.
@highlight Impact of
@highlight on product distribution must be evaluated at a constant
@highlight number.
