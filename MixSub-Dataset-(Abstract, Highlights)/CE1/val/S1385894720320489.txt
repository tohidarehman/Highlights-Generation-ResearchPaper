 As a key hemicellulase xylanase has great potential as catalyst of degrading lignocellulose . However the practical application of xylanase in the industrial sector is limited by its instability high production cost and difficulties of recycling . In this study three dimensional printing technology was used to immobilize xylanase . The optimum immobilization conditions were determined by single factor experiments and response surface methods sodium alginate concentration was 1wt the CaCl

@highlight Immobilization of xylanase using 3D printing technology.
@highlight The 3D printed xylanase can be recycled 7 times.
@highlight The programmability of the structure gives the immobilized xylanase a variety of shapes.
@highlight This study was applied to the degradation of lignocellulose.
