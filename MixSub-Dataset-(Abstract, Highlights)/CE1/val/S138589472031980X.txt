 Access to safe drinking water is still a world challenge . The SODIS process is an easy and affordable household water treatment for low income countries . The main limitations of its standard procedure are the low treated volume bottles are commonly used and the uncertainty in the required solar exposure time which is strongly dependent on the water composition and irradiance . This work evaluates the use of high volume PET containers for the SODIS process especially focusing on the effect of water composition on the efficacy of

@highlight SODIS process in high volume containers for water disinfection is feasible.
@highlight Quantification of water composition in the distribution of radiation.
@highlight Successful kinetic modelling for radiation attenuating substances in water.
@highlight Solids and humic acids play a critical attenuating role in high volume containers.
@highlight Iron mainly attenuates radiation but also improves bacterial internal Photo Fenton.
