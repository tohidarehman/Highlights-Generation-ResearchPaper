 The skill for the proper management of air pollution turned out as one of the major concerns not only in the developed but also in developing countries . The materials used for the decoration of houses are often found to be major sources of highly dispersible light weight toxic air pollutants such as formaldehyde well known for the priority carcinogenic substance . Although diverse remediation options are available to treat or remove FA nanomaterials based catalysts gained great attention due to several merits like enhanced degradation efficiencies high regenerability and favorable structural properties . Here a comprehensive review is offered to describe the advanced NMs available for the catalytic degradation of FA based on thermocatalytic and photocatalytic approaches . In this review nanomaterials developed for both catalytic methods have been evaluated critically for their degradation performances . Finally the present shortcomings in the application of catalytic technologies toward either the maintenance or improvement of the indoor air quality have been discussed along with some prospective solutions and outlooks .

@highlight Control on formaldehyde FA levels is helpful to avoid associated health risks.
@highlight Catalytic photocatalytic degradation of FA became one of the trendy area of research.
@highlight Structural versatility of nanomaterials offers effective photocatalytic degradation.
@highlight Synergetic effect of composites provides additional benefits in the degradation.
@highlight Combination of photocatalyst with adsorbent is found effective option for FA treatment.
