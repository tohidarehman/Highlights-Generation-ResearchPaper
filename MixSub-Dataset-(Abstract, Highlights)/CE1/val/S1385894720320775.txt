 Despite drastic improvements in surgical excision techniques tumor recurrence has remained a significant problem over the past decades . In particular there are unavoidable factors that include intraoperative tissue defects and trauma related bacterial infections that can persistently induce tumor recurrence after surgical excision . Here a novel platform was established with an extracellular matrix scaffold that innovatively incorporated photothermal chemodynamic therapy . A decellularized small intestinal submucosa extracellular matrix was extracted from porcine small intestine and used to generate a polyporous tissue engineering scaffold . In addition black phosphorus nanosheets were synchronously assembled by polydopamine and Ag nanoparticles to fabricate a
