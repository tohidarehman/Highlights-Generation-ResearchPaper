 As a high energy density renewable and green energy carrier hydrogen has recently received increasing attention . However the reliable detection for hydrogen leakage especially in harsh environmental conditions and the efficient high purity hydrogen production are still challenging issues . Here we report that uniform palladium nickel nanowires arrays which have been synthesized via anode aluminum oxide template confined electrodeposition as bi functional material for hydrogen leakage detection and hydrogen evolution reaction . PdNi NWs arrays exhibit rough surface with the diameter of 60nm and present alloyed crystallization . Benefited from the synergic effect of the rough surface of PdNi NWs etched during synthesis and the electronic structure of Pd modified by Ni PdNi NWs enable to stably work within the wide temperature range of 153388K in which the Pd Ni alloying decreases the critical temperature of reverse sensing behavior to 153K . Meanwhile the PdNi NWs show the overpotential of 91mV at 10mA cm
