 Xylene molecules are a class of volatile organic compounds in the air that are harmful to human health . It is difficult to selectively capture xylenes from the air using existing porous sorbents due to unspecific and insufficient sorbent sorbate interactions . We herein report a series of covalent triazine frameworks that enable selectively capturing of xylene compounds with high adsorption capacities at low pressure . The best performing CTF material which is comprised of biphenyl and triazine motifs can adsorb a remarkable amount of

@highlight CTF 2 400 displayed superior capture ability to xylenes isomers.
@highlight 1g CTF 2 400 can continuously capture xylene from the real flowing air for 192h.
@highlight Theoretical calculation recovers multiple C H weak interactions between xylene molecules and CTFs.
