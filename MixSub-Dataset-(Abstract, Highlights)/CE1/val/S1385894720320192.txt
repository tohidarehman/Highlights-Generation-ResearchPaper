 The drying of waterborne acrylic alkyd hybrids is a complicated process involving both curing of the alkyd phase and evolution of the overall morphology of the film . Understanding this drying process is of great importance in practical application of these hybrids where the physical properties of the film are dictated by the film microstructure . Here a mathematical model for the curing of coatings cast from acrylic alkyd hybrid waterborne dispersions is developed . The model provides the dynamic development of the crosslinking density through the film . Furthermore it also provides the evolution of the morphology of the coating in term of the size distribution of alkyd domains . The model is compared with experimental data from literature and used to predict the effect of variables such as primary catalyst concentration and acrylic polymer content on curing .
