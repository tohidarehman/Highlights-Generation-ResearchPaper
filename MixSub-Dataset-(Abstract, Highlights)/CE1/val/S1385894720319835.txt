 This paper proposed a novel simultaneous denitrification and biogas desulfurization process for domestic sewage treatment and biogas upgrading . The process consisted of an expanded granular sludge bed for integrated autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification and a biological aerated filter for nitrification . The experiments were firstly conducted to investigate the performance of the lab scale SDBD system with real domestic sewage at various hydraulic retention times . The system successfully achieved 83.01.8 chemical oxygen demand 96.21.8 ammonia NH

@highlight A simultaneous denitrification and biogas desulfurization process SDBD was proposed.
@highlight 0.9 1.5 hydrogen sulfide in biogas was completely removed.
@highlight More than 85 COD 98 NH
@highlight  N and 81.65 TN was removed from real domestic sewage.
@highlight Hydrogen sulfide introduction altered the pathway of nitrate removal.
@highlight Economic assessment enables SDBD system to be a promising way in biological N removal.
