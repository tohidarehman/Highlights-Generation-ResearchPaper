 Although all solid state hybrid supercapacitors based on cobalt sulfides are revealed to procure high density of redox species their rate performance and power are severely restricted by adverse bulk structure of the electrode materials . Here through regulating the sulfuric agents with mutative activities to rationally vulcanize cobalt MOF we fabricate hierarchical CoS

@highlight Unique hierarchical CoS
@highlight nanosheet arrays coated on carbon cloth are fabricated.
@highlight The formation mechanism and influence of vulcanizing agent activity are meticulously analyzed.
@highlight The structural superiorities of the electrode are explored by electrochemical characterization.
@highlight An all solid state flexible HSC delivers ultrahigh energy and power densities.
@highlight The HSC also exhibits good reliability under mechanical deformations and thermal circumstances.
