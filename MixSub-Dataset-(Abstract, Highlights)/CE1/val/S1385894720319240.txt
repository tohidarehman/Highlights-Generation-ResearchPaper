 Engineering low Pt membrane electrode assembly without sacrificing performance is essential to accelerate the commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells . The increased oxygen transport resistance however limits the performance improvement in the low Pt fuel cell . Herein a cross dimensional agglomerate model focusing on oxygen transport behaviors is proposed and developed by coupling a 1 D oxygen transport sub model with a 2 D two phase multicomponent PEMFC sub model . The oxygen dissolution adsorption and diffusion from gas pore to active sites in cathode catalyst layer are considered in the 1 D sub model . With the aid of the developed 1 2D model the oxygen transport characteristics under different structural parameters and operation conditions are analyzed . It is found that the oxygen transport resistance in cathode backing layer is larger than the OTR in cathode microporous layer and both are much higher than the OTR in the gas pores of the CCL . When changing the structural parameters and operation conditions the CBL OTR CMPL OTR and the bulk OTR remain almost unchanged . While the OTR in the CCL that is caused by the oxygen transport penetrating through ionomer film from water film to active sites is markedly varied . The local OTR possesses a largest contribution to the total OTR which is more than 50 . When Pt loading goes to 0.1mgcm
