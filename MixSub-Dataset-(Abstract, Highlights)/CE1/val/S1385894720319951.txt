 In contrast to conventional fluorescent polymers featured by large conjugation structures a new class of fluorescent polymers without above conjugations are gaining constant interest owing to their significant academic importance and promising applications in diverse fields . These unconventional fluorescent polymers are in general composed of heteroatoms under different forms . Here we report our recent study on polyurea prepared by a very simple one step precipitation polymerization of toluene diisocyanate in a binary solvent of water acetone . This polyurea basically consisting of phenyl ring and urea group shows fluorescent emission in a broad concentration range from very low 10

@highlight Toluene diisocyanate TDI based polyurea TPU is prepared by TDI reaction with H
@highlight O.
@highlight TPU shows strong fluorescent emission as solid powder and in its solution.
@highlight The emission in UV region is intrinsic due to its phenyl and the adjacent urea group.
@highlight The emission in visible zone is owing to the formation of molecule clusters.
@highlight Paper strip dipped in TPU solution is used for easy detections of Fe
