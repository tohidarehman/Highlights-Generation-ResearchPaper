 Hypothermal photothermal therapy employs hyperthermia to destroy tumor cells with negligible side effects to the surrounding normal tissues . Despite extensive studies the clinical translation of HPTT is severely hindered owing to the discounted therapeutic effect and maximum permissible power of near infrared laser by food and drug administration . Herein we report a rational design of red blood cell membranes coated FeS

@highlight A biomimic FeS
@highlight @RBCs with long blood circulation and negligible immune response is reported.
@highlight The obtained FeS
@highlight @RBCs exhibits favorable hypothermal PTT with a clinical approved NIR light.
@highlight The chemodynamic effect of FeS
@highlight @RBCs is significantly augmented by the PTT effect.
@highlight FeS
@highlight @RBCs shows self enhanced MRI to achieve the imaging guided PTT CDT synergistic therapy.
