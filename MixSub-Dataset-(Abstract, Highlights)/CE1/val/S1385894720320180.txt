 Realizing versatile and recyclable adsorbent for removing contaminants with charge diversity from water remains challenging . Herein amphiprotic cellulose with both cationic and anionic groups was developed to mediate self assembled gelation of graphene oxide and Fe

@highlight Amphiprotic microcrystalline cellulose AP MCC was exploited as aerogel framework.
@highlight AP MCC enables self gelation of graphene oxide and Fe
@highlight to construct magnetic aerogel.
@highlight Magnetic aerogels with amphiprotic groups can adsorb anionic and cationic pollutants.
@highlight Magnetic aerogels show good recyclability via magnet separation and desorption.
