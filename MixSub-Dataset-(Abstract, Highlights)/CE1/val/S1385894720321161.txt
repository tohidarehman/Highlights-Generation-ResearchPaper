 As an alternative to the photocatalyst research it is a promising approach by optimizing the macrostructure and reaction conditions to improve the photocatalytic performance of the TiO

@highlight CFD and DEM are introduced to model the packing bed photoreactors with Raschig rings.
@highlight Modelling is verified by void fraction velocity irradiation and concentration data.
@highlight Lower
@highlight leads to a better performance but inlet concentration affects little.
@highlight Close cells perpendicular to container axis weaken the photocatalytic performance.
@highlight Reaction rate rises as rings to container diameter ratio drops and thickness rises.
