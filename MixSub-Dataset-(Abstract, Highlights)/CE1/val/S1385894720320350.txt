 Efficient removal of arsenic from acidic industrial effluents is still a challenge because of the high arsenic concentrations and low pH . Herein a millimeter sized nanocomposite Ti 201 with excellent acid resistance in acidic arsenic contaminated water was synthesized by dispersing the nanosized titanium oxides inside the networking pores of a commercial anion exchanger . Negligible titanium dissolution was observed from Ti 201 in the solution of acidic pHs . The resulting nanocomposite exhibited superior adsorption capacity and selectivity for As removal from acidic solution even in the presence of coexisting Cl
