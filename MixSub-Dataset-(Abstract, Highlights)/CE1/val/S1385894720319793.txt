 The severe issues facing conventional therapies for triple negative breast cancer such as poor response rate and side effects calls for new strategies to realize better prognosis . Owing to the merits of good efficacy safety and facile implementation phototherapy represents an attractive modality for this goal . Black phosphorus is a class of novel interesting materials for biomedical uses with advantages of biodegradability and optical activity . However its stability safety and biological performance remained to be further optimized . In this work we report a novel light responsive nanosystem named

@highlight Hyaluronic acid modification enhances the stability and prevents degradation of black phosphorus nanosheets BPN .
@highlight HA modified BPN HBPN has an acceptable safety profile for potential biomedical applications.
@highlight NIR dye loaded HBPN 
@highlight  possesses superior photonic performance.
@highlight would effectively inhibit the growth and regeneration of 3D tumorspheres.
@highlight would preferentially accumulate in tumor tissues and exert tumor ablation upon laser irradiation.
