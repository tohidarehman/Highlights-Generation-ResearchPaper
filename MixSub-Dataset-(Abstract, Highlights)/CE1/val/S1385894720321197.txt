 In this work two hypercrosslinked hydroxyl rich polymers were facilely prepared through a one pot Friedel Crafts polymerization of phenol resorcinol and formaldehyde dimethyl acetal respectively . HCP P and HCP R were investigated for their ability to separate Cs

@highlight New hypercrosslinked hydroxyl rich polymers HCP P and HCP R were facilely prepared.
@highlight HCPs exhibited high Cs
@highlight adsorption capacities and fast adsorption kinetic.
@highlight HCPs could selectively adsorb and separate Cs
@highlight in the presence of high concentrations of K
@highlight HCPs demonstrated excellent recycle performance 5 cycles .
@highlight The Cs
@highlight adsorption mechanism of HCPs was ion exchange between Cs
@highlight and O
@highlight Na
