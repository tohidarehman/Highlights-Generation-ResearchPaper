 Iron oxide supported on silicatite 1 was synthesized as a novel oxygen carrier for biomass chemical looping gasification with additional functionalities of its reduced form as a catalyst for tar decomposition and an adsorbent for capturing CO

@highlight Iron oxide supported on silicalite 1 served as oxygen carrier to partially oxidize biomass for syngas.
@highlight Reduced oxygen carrier exhibited outstanding tar catalytic cracking performance and high CO
@highlight adsorption capacity.
@highlight The silicalite 1 support was resistant to undesired compound formation at high temperature.
@highlight The novel material is suitable for cyclic process with high thermal and chemical stability.
