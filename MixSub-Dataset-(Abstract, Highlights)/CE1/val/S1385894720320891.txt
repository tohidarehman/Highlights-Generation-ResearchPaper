 The ever growing contamination of water resources generated by heavy metals is posing significant threat to sustainable development and urging the necessity of safe disposal . In this work we designed a facile method to prepare carbon dots Mg

@highlight Petaloid array carbon dots Mg OH 
@highlight was prepared by a facile method.
@highlight DFT study recognized the composite structure and explored interfacial property.
@highlight Cd II was removed at a controllable
@highlight None
@highlight rate by synergistic effect of composite.
@highlight Cd OH 
@highlight was recovered as 1D nanowires.
@highlight The removal capacity of composite reaches 1015.4mgg
