 Serial Al Ti SBA 16 materials with highly ordered degree were successfully synthesized by a simple two step method . The characterization results showed that incorporation of Al and Ti atoms into SBA 16 silica could obtain the supports with different acidities and modulate the distribution and dispersion of active phases for NiMo catalysts . The dibenzothiophene hydrodesulfurization evaluation results disclosed that the synergistic effect of enhancing acidity and properties of active metals could significantly improve the HDS performance . Importantly it was the first time that the ratios of S edge and Mo edge concentrations were found to be well linked with the hydrogenation pathway direct desulfurization pathway ratios . The HDS result showed that the acidity of S H groups in S edge sites could be promoted by B acid and further facilitated the DDS selectivity . As the Al and Ti contents in the support were 7.5 and 2.5 respectively the NiMo AT 7.5 catalyst exhibited the highest HDS performance due to its appropriate acidity highest proportion of MoS
