 In this paper a composite oxide catalyst consisting of NiO and ZnO was prepared by homogeneous precipitation method which was used to activate peroxymonosulfate to remove bisphenol A in water . 95.26 BPA removal and 67.11 total organic carbon removal were obtained under the optimum condition . Characterization and theoretical calculations of the catalyst proved that electron rearrangement occurred in oxygen vacancy modified heterojunction catalysts . It resulted in the formation of acidic sites and alkaline sites on the surface of the catalyst thus promoting the adsorption and activation of PMS . According to the quenching experiments a typical surface bound radical reaction system was proposed . The reactive oxygen species in the system were surface bond SO
