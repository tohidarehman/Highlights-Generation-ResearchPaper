 In this study a novel peroxymonosulfate activation method by visible light excited humic acid was developed and applied to degradation of bisphenol A . Results showed that in HA PMS VL system the degradation rate of BPA could reach 95.4 within 30min which was much higher than that of HA VL system and PMS VL system . Meanwhile the concentration of HA was also decreased in this process and the original structure of HA was obviously destroyed . Reaction mechanism accounting for the effect of HA on BPA degradation in the PMS HA VL system was explicated by the quenching experiments electron paramagnetic resonance detection and HA fractionation experiments . Results showed that singlet oxygen

@highlight was the main reactive species for BPA degradation in PMS HA VL system.
@highlight HA was damaged and transformed to the low weight molecular fractions.
@highlight Phenolic groups of HA played the role of electron donator.
@highlight Quinone moieties of HA accelerated the electron transfer between HA and PMS.
