 Pd HZSM 11 prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method was applied as a passive NOx adsorber at low temperatures . The NO storage and release properties of Pd HZSM 11 have been investigated by cyclic operation . It was found that the NO storage capacity of Pd HZSM 11 at 100C significantly increased with repeated adsorption release cycles . The NOx storage capacity increased by 49 between the first and 5th adsorption release cycle . Encouraged by these results the fresh sample was pretreated in the feeding reaction gas for 2h . This pretreatment resulted in highly enhanced NO storage capacity comparable to the storage capacity of the sample after 5 adsorption release cycles . The nature of Pd species in the sample has been characterized by XPS NH

@highlight Pretreatment by reaction gas activates PNA.
@highlight NO storage capacity increased by 53 after reaction gas pretreatment.
@highlight Pd species can be well re dispersed via reaction gas pretreatment.
@highlight Brnsted acid sites very small PdOx clusters promote oxidation of NO at lower temperatures.
@highlight Larger PdO
@highlight clusters contribute to NO
@highlight formation at higher temperatures.
