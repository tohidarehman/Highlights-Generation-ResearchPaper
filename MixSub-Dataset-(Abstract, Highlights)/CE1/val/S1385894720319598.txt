 Developing the transition metal based electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction under large current density is crucial for industrial electrolysis of water . However most of reported HER electrocatalysts in alkaline solution are tested under the current density of less than 100mAcm

@highlight The hydrogen evolution under large current density is tested for industrial electrolysis of water.
@highlight F doping may facilitate the intrinsic activity for HER at the large current density.
@highlight The fluorine doped Co
@highlight P Fe
@highlight P IF shows the excellent activity for HER at large current density.
@highlight The iron foam as substrate may bear the high current density during industrial water electrolysis.
