 The development of photothermal agents with high photothermal conversion efficiency and good biocompatibility is important for the potential clinical application of photothermal therapy . There are few reports on the application of photothermal agents with the helical structure in photothermal therapy . Herein helical bowl like nanostructure assembled by SnS
