 Nanoscale zero valent iron supported on rice stalk derived biochar composite was synthesized as persulfate activator achieving efficient adsorptive and catalytically oxidative removal for monochlorobenzene . Development of porous structures and enhanced aromaticity of RS with increased pyrolysis temperatures promoted MCB adsorption with removal efficiencies of MCB rising from 11.2 for nZVI RS300 to 72.3 for nZVI RS700 after the adsorption for 14h . The best PS activation performance was achieved for nZVI RS500 with MCB removal efficiency being further increased to 98.8 after the oxidation for 3h and reaction stoichiometric efficiency reaching a maximum of 4.1 under conditions of 0.2gL

@highlight Adsorptive catalytic capability of nZVI biochar for MCB removal was demonstrated.
@highlight The activation of nZVI RS500 outperformed other nZVI biochar composites.
@highlight SO
@highlight  OH and
@highlight were identified in the nZVI biochar PS system.
@highlight Both nZVI and biochars graphitic carbon structures were involved in PS activation.
@highlight Possible MCB degradation pathways in the nZVI biochar PS system was proposed.
