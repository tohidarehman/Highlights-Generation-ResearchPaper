 The separation of methane a commercially important fuel and greenhouse gas from nitrogen is a very important and challenging issue . To address this problem we systematically incorporated various functional groups H NH

@highlight UiO 66 was functionalized with various groups H NH
@highlight  NO
@highlight  Br and Br
@highlight  .
@highlight The CH
@highlight  N
@highlight selectivity agreed well with the order of the polarizability.
@highlight UiO 66 Br
@highlight was the best in terms of CH
@highlight  N
@highlight selectivity and CH
@highlight working capacity.
@highlight UiO 66 Br
@highlight showed effective CH
@highlight  N
@highlight separation under dynamic flow conditions.
@highlight The CH
@highlight adsorption capacity of UiO 66 Br
@highlight was unchanged over 15 cycles.
