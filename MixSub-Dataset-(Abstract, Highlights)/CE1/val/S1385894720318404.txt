 A bottom up approach was formulated and used as a strategy in our work to systematically investigate the removal of lignin functionalities and the hydrogenolysis of the typical bonds relevant for lignin . In the previous studies the role of metals and supports of 16 commercial catalysts Pt Pd Rh Ru Ni Cu supported on C Al
