 In search of a descriptor for Brnsted acid catalyzed biorenewable transformations in a complex reaction environment two concepts related to the reactivity of Brnsted acid catalysts are explored . A simple reaction involving the esterification of levulinic acid in three different alcohol mediums is experimented with two different Keggin heteropolyacid catalysts to synthesize alkyl levulinates . On the same HPA catalyst and different solvent medium apparent activation energies of the esterification reaction are observed to increase by an average of 5kJ mol on increasing the alkyl chain length of the alcohol medium by one carbon . Obtained apparent activation energies are corresponding with the solvation energies of the Brnsted proton in the respective alcohol medium . In contrast on changing the HPA catalyst and keeping the same alcohol medium the apparent activation energies are observed to differ by an average of 19kJ mol . This directly correlates with the difference in the vapor phase deprotonation energies of the two HPA catalysts . Thus in the solvent environment DPE values and the degree of solvation of the Brnsted acidic protons are describing the reactivity of the HPA catalysts .
