 In this study a novel positively charged nanofiltration membrane was fabricated by incorporating metalorganic frameworks into polyethyleneimine and trimesic acid cross linking system . NH

@highlight A novel MOFs PEI TMA composite membrane is developed for heavy metal removal.
@highlight NH
@highlight  MIL 125 Ti provided preferential water channels to improve permeability.
@highlight New and facile cross linking process provides strong positive charge surface.
@highlight The interaction between
@highlight NH
@highlight and PEI TMA system increases the stability of MOFs.
@highlight Nanocomposite membrane has 369 higher flux than the pristine membrane.
