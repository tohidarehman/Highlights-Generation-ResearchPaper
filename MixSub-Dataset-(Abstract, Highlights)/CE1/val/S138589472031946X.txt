 The advancement of modern carbon based supercapacitor depends strongly on the porous carbons with tailoring pore configuration . To achieve the trade off between power density and energy density enriching small mesopore in PCs is an important but challenging research subject . Herein the PCs with customizable small mesopores were fabricated from cheap coal tar pitch by adjusting their content of light component
