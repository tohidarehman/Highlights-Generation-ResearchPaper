 In this work an approach to integrate the downstream processing of bioactive compounds present in the microalgae cells by combining the use of tensioactive compounds and aqueous biphasic systems is proposed . For this purpose several aqueous solutions using solvents with and without tensioactive nature were investigated on their capacity to disrupt the microalgae cells as well as to extract the different classes of biomolecules namely pigments chlorophylls

@highlight The recovery of various biomolecules from
@highlight was studied.
@highlight The aqeuous solution of P
@highlight  Cl was selected as the best solvent.
@highlight PEG 8000 NaPA 8000 P
@highlight  Cl water ABS had the highest performance.
@highlight A single step including cell disruption and biomolecules extraction was developed.
@highlight Proteins carbohydrates chlorophylls and lutein were separated.
