 Cobalt mediated activation of peroxymonosulfate has been widely investigated for the effective oxidation of organic contaminants in wastewater . Herein monometal and bimetal doped MCM 41 catalysts were synthesized by using one pot hydrothermal method and attempted to degrade artificial methyl orange dye wastewater via PMS activation . The influences of initial PMS concentration pH catalyst dosage and reaction temperature on the degradation efficiency of MO were systematically examined . Compared with the contrasting catalysts FeCo MCM 41 exhibited extremely higher activity and lower amount of metal leaching in the degradation process . The excellent catalytic activity of FeCo MCM 41 was ascribed to the high dispersion of metals and the synergistic effects of Co
