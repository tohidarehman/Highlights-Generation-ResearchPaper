 The development of smart structured hybrid materials with superior electrical conductivity are vastly desired for the depletion of unwanted electromagnetic interference . Herein novel multilayered two dimensional MXene Metal Oxides Ag ternary hybrid nanostructures with various heterogeneous assemblies were constructed by self reduction and oxidation of MXene Nb
