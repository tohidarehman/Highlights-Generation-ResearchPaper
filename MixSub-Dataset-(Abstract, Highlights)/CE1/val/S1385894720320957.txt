 Covalent triazine based frameworks are promising capacitive storage polymers due to their porosity and structural controllability at the molecular or atomic level . However the intrinsic low electron ion conductivity and severe stacking effect between adjacent layers greatly impede their electrode performance in supercapacitors . Herein we deploy a halogen functionalized strategy to promote the electrochemical performances of CTFs . Theoretical calculation indicates a lower energy gap E

@highlight Triazine based organic frameworks CTFs with halogen substitution are constructed.
@highlight Halogen substitution boosts energy storage behaviors of the CTFs.
@highlight The fluorine substitution plays more roles on the electrode performances.
