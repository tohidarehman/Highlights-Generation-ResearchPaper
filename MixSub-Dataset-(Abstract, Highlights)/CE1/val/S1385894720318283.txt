 Macrophages are one of the main host cells of intracellular pathogens and the elimination of intracellular bacteria relies on sufficient antibiotic concentrations inside infected macrophages . Current antibiotic delivery systems are confronted with challenges in identification of infected macrophages from normal cells and responsive release to intracellular cues . In the current study bacterial ghosts are constructed from

@highlight Bacterial ghosts are developed to load ciprofloxacin for destruction of intracellular bacteria.
@highlight Bacterial ghosts have high drug loading capabilities and are advantageous in scalable production.
@highlight Rapid ciprofloxacin release from bacterial ghosts in response to elevated intracellular lysozyme.
@highlight Bacterial ghosts show high targeting capability to infected tissues and macrophage internalization.
@highlight Ciprofloxacin release and cytokine secretion cause synergistic destruction of intracellular bacteria.
