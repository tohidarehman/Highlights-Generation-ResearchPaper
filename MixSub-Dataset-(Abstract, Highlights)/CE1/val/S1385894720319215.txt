 Applying direct bio oil derived from lignocellulosic materials via thermochemical processes i.e . pyrolysis to internal combustion engines is challenging due to its high oxygen content and thermal and chemical instability . Despite numerous efforts the hydrodeoxygenation processes have encountered a number of issues such as rapid catalyst deactivation large amount of hydrogen required high pressure high temperatures and long reaction time . In this study cold plasma operated at atmospheric conditions was applied for hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol a model compound to understand the mechanism effect of operating conditions and interactions between catalyst and cold plasma on oxygen removal . Approximately 82 of guaiacol was converted into catechol phenol benzene and toluene within 34s without catalysts . Adding the catalyst of cobalt supported on silica dioxide in the plasma zone enhanced the production of phenol to 44 at H
