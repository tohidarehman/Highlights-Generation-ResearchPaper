 In this study a distinct type of nanoscale copper produced by iron copper replacement was used to reduce ARGs from post treated swine wastewater . The effects of several key parameters were investigated in details . The contribution of nanoscale copper in mFe nCu system towards ARGs removal was determined . Furthermore the removal mechanism of ARGs by mFe nCu was examined by SEM TEM and living dead cell staining . Results indicate that the mFe nCu process can promptly remove the absolute abundances of ARGs from post treated swine wastewater . The outstanding performance of this approach could be attributed to the use of nanoscale copper itself rather than the oxidation by Fenton like reaction of mFe nCu bimetallic system . Moreover the mFe nCu process exhibited an excellent activity in regards bacterial killing and destruction of ARGs structure and function which ultimately could serve as a plausible mechanism of ARGs removal . Reactivation experiments showed that ARGs removal by mFe nCu was permanent and irreversible . Altogether our findings suggest that mFe nCu treatment can be a promising advanced method for ARGs removal from post treated swine wastewater .
