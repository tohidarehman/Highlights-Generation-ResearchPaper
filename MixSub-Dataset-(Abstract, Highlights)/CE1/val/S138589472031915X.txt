 A broad spectrum of microbial persistent infections is associated with bacterial biofilm which is difficult to be eliminated . In the clinic diagnosis of biofilm associated infections is heavily dependent on culturing methods which are difficult to identify pathogenic bacterial infection

@highlight A bacteria activated nanoplatform imaged and eliminated biofilm in situ.
@highlight This nanoplatform could specifically bind on bacteria surface.
@highlight Bacteria microenvironment triggered cargo release and red fluorescent emission.
@highlight The bioinspired approach shows great potential in therapy of bacterial infection.
