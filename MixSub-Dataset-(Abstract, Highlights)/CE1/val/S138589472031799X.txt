 Porous carbon with unique nanostructure high heteroatom doping as well as large specific surface area is regarded as an attractive candidate for supercapacitor applications yet high yield and free template synthesis of such material remains a great challenge . Herein a facile free template activation method is adopted to transform a nanorod like N rich polymer into a new type of N doped porous carbon by activation of copper chloride CuCl
