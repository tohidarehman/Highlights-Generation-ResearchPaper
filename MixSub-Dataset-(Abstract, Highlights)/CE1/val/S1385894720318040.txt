 In this study bimetallic layered double hydroxides with carbonate interlayer construction were prepared . Various characterization methods were carried out to investigate phase structure microscopic morphology textural performance and near surface element chemical states for catalysts . Meanwhile corresponding layered double oxides were fabricated by calcination treatment and determined as metal oxide composite material . It was demonstrated that Cu
