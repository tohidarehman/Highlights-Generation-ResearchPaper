 Photodynamic therapy is an effective approach for tumor treatment which converts oxygen into reactive oxygen species through light irradiation upon a photosensitizer . Due to the low instability of most current photosensitizers nanocarriers for loading and delivering photosensitizers were specifically needed to be developed . However most nanocarriers such as polymer based lipid based vehicles only act as a carrier without antitumor activity . Thus development of suitable nanocarriers for photosensitizers with integrating multi antitumor functions will improve the efficiency of PDT . Here we reported two different kinds of Pt carbon nanozymes as the nanocarriers for chlorin e6 loading . Besides the PDT based on Ce6 Pt C nanozymes could mimic the activities of peroxidase and oxidase to transfer H

@highlight The Pt C nanozyme with Ce6 loading were prepared successfully.
@highlight The Pt C nanozyme killed tumor cells through exerting enzyme like activity.
@highlight The synergistic catalytic and photodynamic tumor therapy can be achieved.
