 Electrokinetic remediation is an effective technology for soil contaminated with heavy metals . However little is known about the fate of antibiotic resistance in the process under heavy metal stress since antibiotic resistance genes are widely distributed and can be co selected with heavy metals . This study focused on antibiotic resistant bacteria and ARGs over different remediation periods voltages 0.4 and 0.8Vcm

@highlight First study on the fate of antibiotic resistance in EKR process with heavy metals.
@highlight Heavy metals were reduced with the transformation from stable to reactive forms.
@highlight Anti SMX bacteria was more resistant to EKR than anti OTC bacteria.
@highlight Efflux pumps
@highlight genes were difficult to be removed than cellular protection genes.
@highlight Cu was more closely associated with ARGs than Zn.
