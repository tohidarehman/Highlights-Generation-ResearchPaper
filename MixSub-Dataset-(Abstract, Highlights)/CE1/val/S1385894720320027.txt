 Aqueous Ni Fe batteries show promise for grid level energy storage due to their high safety and low cost . However high capacities of Fe based anodes can only be achieved under slow discharging rates . Moreover an activation process is often required the mechanism of which has not been fully understood . Herein we present a facile and controllable method to uniformly deposit Fe

@highlight Fe
@highlight  FeOOH heterostructure is constructed during electrochemical activation.
@highlight A built in electric field is formed near the Fe
@highlight  FeOOH interface.
@highlight The activated electrode shows an enhanced capacity of 634 mAh g
@highlight The assembled Ni Fe cell shows a high energy density of 161.3 Wh kg
@highlight at 5.7kWkg
