 Eco friendly exfoliation of two dimensional nanosheets from their layered bulks is very attracting but still remains a big challenge . Here we report a novel preparation route of two dimensional nanosheets through soaking the bulk layered material in the C

@highlight A green and eco friendly technical route of two dimensional nanosheets was proposed.
@highlight The conversion from natural graphite to few layer graphene is 100 .
@highlight No water washing and effluent treatment are involved during the exfoliation process.
@highlight The graphene paper behaves excellent electrical conductivity to 7.3610
@highlight S m.
@highlight The 4 um thick graphene paper exhibits a record high EMI SE value to 61 dB.
