 A carbazole extended 15H dibenzofurocarbazole was developed as a propeller type strong donor moiety of thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters . Two TADF emitters 2 carbazol 15 yl 5 benzonitrile and 15 phenyl 15H dibenzofurocarbazole were synthesized using the dBFCz donor and diphenyltriazine acceptor . The dBFCzCNTrz and dBFCzTrz emitters showed high external quantum efficiency of 27.5 and 22.6 with short excited state lifetime respectively . In particular the dBFCz donor was much better than a common carbazole donor and benzofurocarbazole donor in enhancing the external quantum efficiency and device lifetime which proposed that the dBFCz worked well as a donor moiety for TADF emitters .

@highlight A propeller type 15H dibenzofuro 3 2 a 3 2 c carbazole donor moiety.
@highlight High external quantum efficiency over 27 and lifetime extension by 6 times.
@highlight Short delayed fluorescence lifetime and suppressed non radiative pathway by the rigid donor structure.
