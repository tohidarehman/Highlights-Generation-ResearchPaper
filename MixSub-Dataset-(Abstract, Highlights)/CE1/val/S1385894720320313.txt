 Recycling of valuable secondary source of materials from spent batteries brings great opportunity for recyclers at end of life but a challenging issue . Peroxymonosulfate based advanced oxidation has been considered an efficient approach to eliminate refractory antibiotic in wastewater . In this study a cathode material recovered from spent lithium ion batteries was explored to serve as a direct catalyst to activate peroxymonosulfate for the first time . The CM catalyst included 94 LiCoO

@highlight A method of recycling cathode materials from spent LIBs was provided.
@highlight Recovered CM materials was a catalyst for efficient activation of PMS.
@highlight Antibiotic contaminant was efficiently removed in the CM PMS system.
@highlight Stable catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic ability in pH 210.
@highlight The non radical and radical process govern the PMS activation.
