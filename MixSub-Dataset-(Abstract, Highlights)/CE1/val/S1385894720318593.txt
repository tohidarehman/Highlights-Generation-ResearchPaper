 Few studies integrate catalytic membrane in photocatalytic fuel cell with peroxymonosulfate activation process . In the present work a novel PFC membrane reactor system integrating PMS activation was constructed for wastewater treatment consisting of CNFs CoFe

@highlight A CNFs CoFe
@highlight  PVDF catalytic membrane was synthesized by phase inversion method.
@highlight A PFC integrating PMS activation with CNFs CoFe
@highlight  PM cathode was designed.
@highlight The PMS PFC MR shows favorable degradation performance with electricity production.
@highlight The PMS PFC MR performance is further enhanced under membrane filtration mode.
@highlight The Co II PMS oxidation with filtration and photo electrocatalysis are achieved.
