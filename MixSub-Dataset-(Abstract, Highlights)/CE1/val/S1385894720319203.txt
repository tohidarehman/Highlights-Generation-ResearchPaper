 Promoting the catalyst reducibility is the key to the breakthrough of the catalytic oxidation technology . We prepared the layered double oxides spinel catalysts utilizing the layered double hydroxides as precursors . Innovatively cobalt was applied as A B sites double occupying cations . By introducing Cu into the A sites we created a pushing effect towards the A sites Co . The binding energy of Co 2p and the projected density of states energy of Co 3d shifted higher . The Co gained greater momentum to convert to Co . The same pushing effect towards B sites Co were generated using B sites occupying Ga promoting Co transfer towards lower valence state . Thus the converting between Co and Co were speeded up . Moreover the ionic radius differences between Cu and Co caused lattice distortion enhancing the adsorbed oxygen species and surface oxygen defects . These contributed to the great improvement of reducibility and enhanced catalytic activity towards toluene oxidation .
