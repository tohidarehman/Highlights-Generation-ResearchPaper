 Au Cu nanostructures offer unique optical and catalytic properties unlike the monometallic ones resulting from the specific interaction . Among others they have the ability to exhibit surface plasmon resonance electrochemical activity towards the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction as well as improved photoresponse in relation to monometalic but those properties depend highly on the substrate where bimetallic structures are immobilized .

@highlight Au Cu nanomosaic onto titanium dimples formation via facile approach.
@highlight Shift in the absorbance band maximum for the bimetallic materials from 470nm to 900nm.
@highlight Combination of Au and Cu metals results in current density almost 15 times higher than for pure Au nanostructures.
@highlight Synergistic effect between the Au and Cu can be achieved via simple thermal treatment of sputtered films.
