 Nowadays indoor air pollution of low concentration formaldehyde is threatening seriously human health . In this work a carbon cloth supported MnO

@highlight The carbon based MnO
@highlight nanocomposites were synthesized effectively by electric enhanced hydrothermal method.
@highlight Formaldehyde can be removed from 7ppm to 0.074ppm by static test at room temperature.
@highlight The possible mechanism of HCHO decomposition is the synergistic effect of manganese oxides MnO
@highlight  Mn
@highlight  and MnO .
