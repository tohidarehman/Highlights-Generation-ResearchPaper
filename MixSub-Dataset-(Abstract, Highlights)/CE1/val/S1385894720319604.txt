 Nickel based oxides for aqueous rechargeable nickel zinc batteries typically suffer from the low capacity and inferior stability due to their slow electron ion transportation rate and poor electrochemical reversibility . Here we rationally design a free standing Ni C nanosheets from Ni metal organic framework as conductive scaffold for NiMoO

@highlight The Ni C nanosheets provide high conductivity and high surface area for NiMoO
@highlight nanowires.
@highlight The MoO
@highlight additive effectively suppress the structural collapse and dissolution of the NiMoO
@highlight The NiMoO
@highlight  NC electrode yields a high capacity of 221.0 mAh g
@highlight and extraordinary durability.
@highlight An advanced aqueous Ni Zn battery constructed by NiMoO
@highlight  NC is achieved.
