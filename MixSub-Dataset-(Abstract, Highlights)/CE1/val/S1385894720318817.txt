 The design of novel cryogels containing NmethylDglucamine group was herein reported . The macroporous materials were prepared via sustainable and feasible cryopolymerization by using as co monomers NmethylDglucamine and 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate at different percentages . Particularly cryogel containing 100 of VbNMG showed excellent ability in fast water uptake removing arsenic and chromium metal ions from it . Reusability up to six cycles was also demonstrated . The as prepared materials were characterized by spectroscopic thermal and morphological analyses . The effect of initial oxyanions concentration kinetic profiles interfering anions were investigated and adsorption desorption studies were carried out . Equilibrium sorption results well fitted the Langmuir isotherm for both ions tested showing a startling aptitude in arsenic as well as chromium sorption properties if compared with similar polymers as well as other materials . Exploiting its spongy nature only 5 mins were needed to absorb contaminated medium releasing purified water by a simple squeezing . Most importantly the sponge can be easily regenerated and reused again up to three times without the depletion of its efficiency .

@highlight New NmethylDglucamine sponges were designed by using cryo polymerization.
@highlight Macroporous structures provide an outstanding uptake of metal ions in water.
@highlight Sponge soaked in contaminated medium releases purified water by a simple squeeze.
@highlight As V and Cr VI sorption capacity of 76.3 and 130.9mg g respectively were reached.
@highlight The material can be reused and recycled maintaining its uptake efficiency.
