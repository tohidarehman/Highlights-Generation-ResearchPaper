 Red mud is a typical mass quantity of solid waste generated from industrial alumina production and usually consists of valuable metals such as Al and rare earths . This work mainly investigated the extraction of Al and REs from RM via aerobic and anaerobic bi stage bioleaching by

@highlight Aerobic and anaerobic bi stage bioleaching of red mud was first studied.
@highlight Bio redox of Fe S significantly drove the extraction of Al and rare earths.
@highlight could couple the anaerobic S
@highlight oxidation to jarosites reduction.
@highlight A new cost effective way was provided for recovery of rare earths from RM.
