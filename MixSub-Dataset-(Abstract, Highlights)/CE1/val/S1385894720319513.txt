 Magnetic nanoparticles induced cell necrosis under rotating magnetic field has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years . However the smooth structure of MNPs largely limits their necrosis efficiency . In this study we aimed to synthesize novel urchin like nickel nanoparticles and evaluate their high efficiency in cell necrosis and tumor inhibition under a low frequency RMF . The unique UNNPs were prepared via a one step solvothermal process under an external magnetic field of 0.6T . The as synthesized UNNPs exhibited a size distribution from 350 to 700nm with a peak of 450nm and ferromagnetic behavior with a magnetization saturation of 49.88emu g. The

@highlight The paper report the one step synthesis of urchin like nickel nanoparticles UNNPs .
@highlight Results show that the UNNPs manifest nontoxic properties and good biocompatibility.
@highlight The UNNPs have a higher cell death than SNNPs under the same rotating magnetic field.
