 This research presents a simple and versatile procedure for in situ surface functionalization of Polyethersulfone membrane through covalent attachment of aniline oligomers . The process involves gradual reduction of oligomer diazonium salts which yields a superhydrophilic layer of branched aniline oligomers grafted on the membrane surface . With this procedure the PES nanofiltration membrane alter facilely from hydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity . The structural characteristic nanofiltration performance antifouling behavior and chemical mechanical and long term permeation stability of prepared membranes were evaluated . The modified membrane showed great performance with high water flux 93.6L m
