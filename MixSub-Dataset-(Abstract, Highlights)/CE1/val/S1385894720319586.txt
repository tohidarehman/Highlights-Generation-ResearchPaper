 In this study the thermodynamic inhibition effects of choline chloride urea and their mixture on CH

@highlight  profiles of substances by COSMO RS were used to pre screen potential inhibitors.
@highlight ChCl urea and DES contributed to the shift of hydrate equilibrium temperature.
@highlight The QTAIM analysis validated the experimental results of potential inhibitors.
@highlight ChCl urea and DES had great potential for use as hydrate inhibitors.
