 The naturally scarce and costly precious metal as catalysts for electrochemical water electrolysis have prevent the large scale applications in the transition of this technology . Therefore it is emergency to explore for much cheaper and superior active scalable materials in making this technology to be more promising . The perovskite oxides with rich constitutions and structures can be easily to tune of the electrocatalytic applications by tailoring compositions . Herein a highly efficient catalyst composed of nitrogen doped carbon coated multi metals core decorated Ruddlesden Popper type structure Pr

@highlight growth of CNTs strategy is used to trigger perovskite electrocatalysts.
@highlight The optimal perovskite exhibits a remarkably enhanced catalytic performance on HER.
@highlight The interaction between CNTs and perovskite modifies the electrochemical activity.
