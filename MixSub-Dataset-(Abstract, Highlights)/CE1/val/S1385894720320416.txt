 Developing excellent photocatalysts to mineralize pollutants and reduce toxicity is an urgent problem in current environment purification research . Here we synthesized a novel 2D 2D Cu

@highlight Cu
@highlight WS
@highlight  BiOCl displayed high photocatalytic activity in the degradation of BP1.
@highlight Assess toxicity combined with intermediates prediction and biological tests.
@highlight Apparent indexes of zebrafish are more sensitive than gene expression.
@highlight The intimates 2D 2D interface possess faster charge transfer than 3D 2D system.
@highlight 2D 2D Z scheme charge transfer is proposed based on in depth mechanism study.
