 The hydrogenation of levulinic acid to valerolactone was performed in perfluoroalkoxy alkane capillary microreactors packed with a carbon supported ruthenium catalyst with an average particle diameter of 0.3 or 0.45mm . The reaction was executed under an upstream gasliquid slug flow with 1 4 dioxane as the solvent and H

@highlight Hydrogenation of levulinic acid over Ru C was tested in microreactors.
@highlight 100 levulinic acid conversion and 84 valerolactone yield were obtained.
@highlight A microreactor model was developed to describe mass transfer and kinetics.
@highlight Reaction rate was limited by external liquidsolid mass transfer of H
@highlight A microreactor optimization strategy was proposed.
