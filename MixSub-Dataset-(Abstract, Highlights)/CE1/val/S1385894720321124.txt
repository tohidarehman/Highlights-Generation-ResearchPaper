 Trees are made of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin linked by covalent bonds and supramolecular interactions . Among them the lignin with three dimensional structure plays a role in supporting the structure of the tree . Inspired by the nature of the tree we have designed and synthesized a novel lignin poly composite hydrogel dressing with excellent mechanical strength self healing properties bactericidal activity and antioxidant activity . This self healing hydrogel dressing is obtained by the supramolecular interactions between the lignin poly compounds . The introduction of lignin can effectively improve the mechanical properties of the hydrogel dressing . And the bactericidal poly modified on the lignin surface through covalent bonds endows this hydrogel dressing good antibacterial activity and self healing properties . Wound healing model of rats and histomorphological evaluation results suggest that this hydrogel dressing promotes wound healing . Furthermore the hydrogel dressing still maintains its excellent performances after simple high temperature disinfection and can be reused for many times .

@highlight Hydrogel dressing exhibits excellent self healing properties and bactericidal activity.
@highlight The recovery percentage of self healing tensile force reaches 95.6 .
@highlight After simple treatment hydrogel dressing can be reused more than 5 times.
