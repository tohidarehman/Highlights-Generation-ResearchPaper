 The cycling life of rechargeable metal cells is mainly restricted by dendritic growth of metals . Herein N O dual doped 3D porous carbon architectures are designed on commercial Cu foam current collector

@highlight Metal organic framework arrays are controlled grown on copper foam.
@highlight The heteroatom doped 3D porous carbon is obtained by a one pot vacuum heating method.
@highlight The heteroatom doped 3D porous carbon can be wetted in both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolyte.
@highlight The heteroatom doped 3D porous carbon can suppress the dendrite growth of both Li and Zn.
