 Stationary or spatio temporal patterns of catalytic reactions can cause operating challenges in shallow packed bed reactors with large diameter to depth aspect ratios . Partial ignition patterns were observed in a pilot scale oxidative coupling of methane reactor operating on the ignited branch near the extinction point . A three dimensional computational fluid dynamics model was developed for the down flow shallow packed bed reactor using porous media approach with user defined functions for heterogeneous heat transfer and Langmuir Hinshelwood form reaction kinetics . The CFD simulation results show that once the operating condition is nearing or beyond the extinction point 3D temperature patterns form due to either thermo flow or thermo kinetic steady state multiplicity . The simulations provide insights into the pattern locking mechanism that stems from the non linear hydrodynamic kinetic thermal coupling in the bed . Specific pattern observed in the CFD solution depends on perturbation sources such as unstructured space discretization local heat loss through refractory walls variations in catalyst activity or porosity of the packed bed as well as non uniform initial conditions such as preheating among others . The results indicate that the non uniformity of bed physical and chemical properties can dominate the pattern in practical reactor operation . Based on parametric studies methods to mitigate pattern formation are recommended such as more uniform incoming flow uniform catalyst bed uniformly preheated bed higher catalyst activity and or higher bed thermal conductivity .

@highlight OCM packed bed reactor operated close to extinction exhibits temperature patterns.
@highlight 3 D CFD model represents pattern formation due to thermo flow multiplicity.
@highlight Patterns tend to lock because of the hydrodynamic kinetic thermal coupling.
@highlight Nonuniform boundary initial conditions and bed properties affect specific patterns.
@highlight Pattern are mitigated by bed uniformity higher activity and thermal conductivity.
