 In this study oily sludge was pyrolyzed into an environmentally friendly OS carbon material which was used as the carrier of CoFe

@highlight Carbon based nanoparticles CoFe
@highlight  OSC were fabricated as peroxymonosulfate activator.
@highlight Norfloxacin could be effectively degraded by CoFe
@highlight  OSC PMS system.
@highlight Redox potentials of Fe II Fe III and Co III Co II were involved in the system.
@highlight CoFe
@highlight  OSC nanocomposite provides new insights into the resource utilization of OS.
