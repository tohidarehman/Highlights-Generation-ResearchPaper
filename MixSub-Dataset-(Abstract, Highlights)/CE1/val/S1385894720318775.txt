 Fiber membranes for pollutants removal have attracted more and more attentions owing to their high adsorption performance and easy recovery properties . However some adsorption membranes are short of reusability performance due to lack of environment friendly regeneration approach and low regeneration efficiency especially in terms of chemical adsorption . Herein a polyacrylonitrile titanium dioxide polyaniline PAN TiO

@highlight PAN TiO
@highlight  PANI hybrid fiber membranes were fabricated.
@highlight The membrane exhibited selective adsorption and easy recovery properties.
@highlight The adsorption mechanism was investigated to be chemical adsorption.
@highlight The membrane could be recycled by environment friendly visible light photocatalytic regeneration with high efficiency.
