 Edible superhydrophobic surface for food related application has been fulfilled on various substrates however the independent edible superhydrophobic material has yet to be realized . Here we report the edible artificial lotus leaf fabricated through combination of superhydrophobic beeswax coating and tomato waste recycled cutin pectin membrane mimicking the antifouling ability of lotus and oxygen barrier ability of tomato . Moreover additional heating was introduced for stability enhancement increasing adhesion and water vapour blocking ability . Through the combination of Merits of both lotus leaf and tomato skin results indicated that AL could be presented as an independent food packaging and form straw cup and dissolvable bag as plastic replacement material . Furthermore AL could serve as recyclable functional packaging for underwater storage oxidation blocking selective release bags . Additionally AL holds similar mechanical strength to tomato peel . Therefore edible AL can provide new insights for future edible superhydrophobic material and food packaging designs .

@highlight An edible superhydrophobic AL achieved the wettability of lotus surface.
@highlight Experiment results indicated the ALs possessed repellence for various food liquids.
@highlight The 60s heated AL hold better stability against water impact.
@highlight The 60s heated AL can serve as edible seal for freshly cut apple.
