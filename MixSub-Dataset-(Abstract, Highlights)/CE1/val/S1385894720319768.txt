 High power generation with low capital cost is still a great challenge for the practical application of microbial fuel cells . In this work the efficient three dimensional N doped macroporous carbon foam anodes were fabricated using naturally abundant nitrogenous corncobs and successfully adopted in microbial fuel cells with mixed culture inoculation . The optimized three dimensional N doped macroporous carbon foam bioanode achieved a power density of 4.990.02W m

@highlight 3D N doped carbon foam anodes were fabricated using naturally abundant corncobs.
@highlight MFCs with optimized N doped bioanodes achieved highest power density of 4990mW m
@highlight Pyrrolic N contents might have more significant impact on MFC power generation.
@highlight 3D N doped carbon foam anodes had good biocompatibility for
@highlight enrichment.
@highlight DFT calculation implied enhanced
@highlight EET particularly with pyrrolic N doping.
