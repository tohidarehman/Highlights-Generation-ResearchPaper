 In this paper aluminium chloride crystal was used as precursor to prepare silica alumina aerogel support by sol gel method and the active component K

@highlight Adsorbents for CO
@highlight capture were prepared by sol gel surface modification.
@highlight Experiment and kinetic simulation were combined to conduct the research.
@highlight The microscopic characteristics of the adsorbents were good.
@highlight Shrinking core model was used to simulate reaction kinetics.
@highlight Avrami fractional kinetic model was used to simulate adsorption kinetics.
