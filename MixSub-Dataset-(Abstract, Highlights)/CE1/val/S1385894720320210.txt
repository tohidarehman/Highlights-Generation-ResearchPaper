 Introducing anammox technology into low ammonia sewage treatment offers sustainable nitrogen removal but there remain challenges to its future applications . Here anammox bacteria were enriched by integrating into partial denitrification NO

@highlight Anammox 
@highlight  0.69 were enriched in biofilms markedly higher than flocs.
@highlight N isotope tracer tests showed partial denitrification is a prerequisite for anammox.
@highlight Anammox contributed to 68 of the nitrogen loss via anoxic biofilms in batch tests.
@highlight Nitrogen removal efficiency improved 16.9 by combining denitrification and anammox.
@highlight Mainstream partial anammox might has great potential of engineering application.
