 Thermoacidophilic Cyanidiales are capable to survive in extreme environments with concentrated metals allowing them to serve as promising green materials applied in metal remediation . It is the first attempt to determine the capacity and related mechanisms for Pb ions sorption on three Cyanidiales genera

@highlight  Cc showed superior sorption capacity 298mgg
@highlight  for Pb II .
@highlight Modulation of Pb tolerance by Cyanidiales was classified into four mechanisms.
@highlight Formation of organic complexes promoted Pb II ion sorption capacity of Cyanidiales.
@highlight Cyanidiales are innovative green materials for the environmental remediation.
