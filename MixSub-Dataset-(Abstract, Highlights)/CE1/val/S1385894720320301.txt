 The efficient degradation of fluoroquinolone antibiotics and the reduction of their antimicrobial activity were achieved in different water matrices through the photocatalysis of inverse opal potassium doped carbon nitride . The IO K CN photocatalyst with optimum doping ratio of potassium performed much better than bulk carbon nitride and pure inverse opal carbon nitride for removing fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as levofloxacin and norfloxacin . The remarkably narrowed band gap resulting from potassium doping and the unique properties of the inverse opal construction jointly contributed to enhancing the activity of the photocatalyst . A possible mechanism and degradation pathway for LVX was proposed on the basis of a series of characterizations including electron spin resonance experiments and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis . Meanwhile the byproducts during the LVX photocatalytic degradation were shown to have much lower sterilization effect implying that the toxicity and the potential risk of LVX were excellently reduced . The potential application for the treatment of antibiotic containing wastewater was indicated by the excellent treatment efficiency and favorable durability of this photocatalyst .
