 Covalent organic framework based proton permselective membranes are for the first time designed to break through the trade off between proton permeability and selectivity for improved efficiencies of acid supporting redox flow batteries . The precise hydrated proton vanadium sieving is achieved originating from the appropriate pore size of COF prepared here . As a result no vanadium permeation can be detected for the membrane . While the presences of micropores and the amino groups in COF lead to a low area resistance . The cell assembled with this membrane presents very high coulombic efficiency and energy efficiency at 40180mAcm
