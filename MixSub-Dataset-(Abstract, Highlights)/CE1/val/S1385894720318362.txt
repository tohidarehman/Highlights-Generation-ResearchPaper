 Surface properties of cathode materials play important roles in the transport of lithium ions electrons and the formation of surface passivation layer . Optimizing the exposed crystal facets of cathode materials can promote the diffusion of lithium ions and enhance cathode surface stability which may ultimately dominate cathodes performance and stability in lithium ion batteries . Here polycrystalline LiCoO
