 This study developed a novel method based on piezoelectric catalytic persulfate activation for water advanced disinfection . Silver modified barium titanate was synthesized and utilized as a piezoelectric catalyst to activate PS under ultrasonic vibration for

@highlight A novel disinfection method via piezo catalytic persulfate activation was developed.
@highlight After 5min about 99 of
@highlight inactivation was reached.
@highlight The successive generation of radicals greatly enhanced the disinfection efficiency.
@highlight A synergism between ultrasonication and radical oxidation for inactivation was found.
@highlight High process efficiency was observed in real wastewater effluent and surface water.
