 Fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces by simple techniques is of significant interest . Herein inspired by the stomata effect of plant leaves a superhydrophobic surface with bionic stomata randomly on polydimethylsiloxane is fabricated by a facile swelling vesiculating cracking method . Neither multistep modification of nanostructure nor introduction of low surface energy substance is carried out during the fabrication . The water contact angle of the bio inspired superhydrophobic surfaces with stomata like structures can reach 168.41 with 8.9 sliding angle and less than 10 contact angle hysteresis . The structure and wettability of the BSSS are characterized by scanning electron microscopy Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy energy dispersive spectrometry and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy . The effects of swelling ratio heat treatment temperature and surface morphology on the hydrophobicity of the BSSS are investigated systematically . Noticeably the BSSS are provided with wonderful durability in organic solvents ice water and strong acid solution . Furthermore a theoretical model for BSSS based on the Cassie Baxter relation is established to elucidate the stomata effect . The model reveals that the water contact angle will reach 180 when the stomata like structure is suitable . The fabrication of BSSS provides a potential strategy for the development of novel superhydrophobic materials .
