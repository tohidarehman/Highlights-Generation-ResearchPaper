 The development of effective and stable catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction is desired for hydrogen production . Herein we report a facile solvothermal approach to fabricate P doped triangular PtPdCu nanodarts using trioctylphosphine as phosphorus dopant . The PtPdCu P NDs with separated branches can provide high surface areas and sufficient active sites for HER . Moreover the incorporation of phosphorus into alloys can tailor the electronic structure and the

@highlight P doped triangular PtPdCu nanodarts are prepared via a solvothermal approach.
@highlight The PtPdCu P catalysts possess multiple components and triangular structure.
@highlight The PtPdCu P catalysts show high performance for hydrogen evolution reaction.
