 Nanomaterials have attracted significant attention in biomedical and environmental science in recent years due to their unique thermal optical electrical and magnetic properties . The properties of nanomaterials are highly correlated with their size and morphology . Consequently efficient methods for synthesizing nanomaterials with a consistent size and shape are urgently required . Compared to conventional large scale synthesis systems microfluidic systems offer a far better control over the growth nucleation and reaction conditions . As such microfluidic synthesis has emerged as a key enabling technology for the rapid low cost and reliable preparation of nanomaterials with complex properties and functions . This review provides a detailed overview of advances in the microfluidic synthesis technology field over the past five years . The review commences by describing the main microfluidic control mechanisms and microfluidic synthesis of particles . Some of the more common applications of microfluidic synthesized micro and nanomaterials are then introduced including drug delivery bioimaging biosensing environmental analysis and cell analysis . The review concludes with a brief overview of the challenges facing the microfluidic synthesis field in the coming years together with possible research directions aimed at overcoming these challenges .
