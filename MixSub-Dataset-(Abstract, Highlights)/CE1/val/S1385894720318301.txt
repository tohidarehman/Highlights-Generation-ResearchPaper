 In the present study a novel directly irradiated fluidized bed autothermal reactor for solar driven chemical processing is presented . The reactor exploits the very concept of the autothermal reactor applied to multiphase flow of fluidized solids a gas solid suspension is preheated in a tubular riser prior to being exposed to radiative flux and further heated up in a concentrated solar receiver . Preheating is accomplished by solids leaving the receiver as they flow countercurrently in an annular dipleg coaxial to the riser . The dipleg may be designed so as to make the receiver section gas leak tight with respect to the other zones of the reactor . An experimental campaign was performed under non reactive conditions and at moderate radiative flux hence moderate temperatures with the purpose of demonstrating the feasibility and operability of the autothermal reactor as a preliminary step toward a full proof of concept . Solids circulation rates and temperatures were measured as a function of the gas superficial velocity in the riser under given simulated solar irradiance . Infrared thermography was applied to further characterize multiphase flow and thermal patterns in the receiver . Experimental data were worked out to calculate the annulus to riser heat transfer coefficients . The reactor demonstrated excellent autothermal operation thanks to very efficient heat transfer across the riser annulus interface . Collection of solar energy was fairly good with maximum thermal efficiency close to 70 despite the design of the receiver was not specifically optimized to minimize radiative and convection losses . A preliminary analysis aimed at the scale up of the autothermal reactor is presented . Altogether results obtained are quite promising and stimulate further research on the development of reactors based on the proposed design for solar chemistry applications .
