 The integration of high strength high toughness and excellent flame retardancy in polymer materials is highly desirable for their practical applications in the industry . However existing material design strategies often fail to realize such a performance portfolio because of mutually exclusive mechanisms between strength and toughness and low flame retardancy efficiency of nanofillers in polymers . Here we reported the preparation of a multifunctional nanohybrid Ti

@highlight Ti
@highlight @MCA nanohybrid was successfully prepared
@highlight hydrogen bonding interactions.
@highlight TPU Ti
@highlight @MCA nanocomposites were prepared by solution mixing and melt blending.
@highlight TPU nanocomposites show outstanding tensile strength toughness and fire safety.
@highlight Ti
@highlight @MCA outperforms reported other nanofillers in properties improvement.
@highlight Interfacial hydrogen bonds and labyrinth effect lead to properties improvement.
