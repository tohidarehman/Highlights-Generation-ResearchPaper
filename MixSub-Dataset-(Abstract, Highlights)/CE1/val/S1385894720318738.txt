 In this study a novel cost effective Fenton biological combined process performing at initial neutral pH was proposed to avoid or reduce the chemicals for acidification and neutralization its performance and preliminary operational cost were evaluated in the lab scale . By virtue of acidic intermediates Fenton oxidation was performed at initial neutral pH without acidification by adding acid . After removing the dissolved Fe by ion exchange resins acidic Fenton effluent was treated by a fungal consortium without pre neutralization . Our results demonstrate that several phenolic compounds representing target pollutants could be effectively oxidized by Fenton at initial neutral pH through endogenous acidification by formed carboxylic acids in some cases phenolic complexation with Fe

@highlight A novel cost effective Fenton biological combined process was proposed and its treatment cost was evaluated.
@highlight By virtue of acidic intermediates Fenton was performed at initial neutral pH without acidification by adding acid.
@highlight Acidic Fenton effluent was treated by a specially screened fungi consortium without pre neutralization.
@highlight The novel combined process could reduce the operational cost by at least 20 compared to classical operation.
