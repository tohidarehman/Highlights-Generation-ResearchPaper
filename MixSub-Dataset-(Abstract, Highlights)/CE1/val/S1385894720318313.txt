 Various tellurium red phosphorus carbon composites with different Te to P ratios were prepared via high energy mechanical milling for application as anode materials in sodium ion batteries . Highly conductive Te was added to increase the electrical conductivity and improve the mechanical strength of the P C composite . The optimized Te P C composite exhibited a reversible capacity of 593 mAh g

@highlight Te does not react with red P under mechanical milling conditions.
@highlight Te P C composites are worthy of fast charging electrodes due to the conductive Te.
@highlight Expansion formulae and low frequency limits of EIS circuits are declared.
@highlight Rearranging the low frequency limits results in new linear restrictions.
@highlight The restrictions improve the EIS fitting reliability applied on Te P C composites.
