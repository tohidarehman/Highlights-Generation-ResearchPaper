 Commercial magnetite nanoparticles were used to immobilize As and organic pollutants mainly PAHs in a polluted soil . The composition structure and morphology of the NPs were examined by means of electron microscopy X ray analysis infrared spectroscopy dynamic light scattering thermogravimetric analysis and magnetic property determination . To evaluate the immobilization of As and organic pollutants soil subsamples were treated with the magnetite NPs at different doses . The availability of As was then examined by the TCLP test and the Tessier sequential extraction procedure whereas TPH and PAHs were measured by GCMS . Notable results for As immobilization were achieved at a dose of 1 NPs although the best result was obtained at the highest dose of 5 without significant variations in As speciation . Regarding organic pollutants a decrease in TPH and PAHs content was detected even at the lowest dose of NPs tested . The treatments had no negative effects on soil parameters such as soil pH and electrical conductivity . In turn the increase in Fe availability after application of NPs was insignificant whereas soil phytotoxicity assessed by germination test was reduced . In conclusion the use of magnetite NPs opens up new nanoremediation options to treat soils affected by both organic and metal pollution .

@highlight Magnetite NPs to remediate a soil polluted by As and PAH were successfully tested.
@highlight As availability PAH content were reduced both more than 90 at the highest dose.
@highlight Phytotoxicity decreased at 1 dose of magnetite NPs due to As immobilization.
@highlight PAH immobilization was caused by adsorption phenomena onto the nanoparticles.
