 The design of shape stable phase change composites with electrothermal conversion storage performance provides a new direction for their potential applications in advanced electric energy storage . Herein a cellulose nanofiber sponge coated with polypyrrole

@highlight The phase change composites PCCs were prepared from polyethylene glyclol and polypyrrole coated cellulose.
@highlight The PCCs had excellent load bearing capacity and could support 440 times its own weight.
@highlight The PCCs exhibited high electric to heat conversion efficiency 85.1 at low voltage 1.9V .
@highlight This study paved the way for thermal management applications of PCCs.
