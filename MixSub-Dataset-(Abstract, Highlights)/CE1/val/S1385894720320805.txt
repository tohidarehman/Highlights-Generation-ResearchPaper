 The removal of tetracycline by novel magnetic graphene oxide ZnO nanocomposites was explored . In order to study the feasibility of MZ as an adsorbent and photocatalyst to remove tetracycline a series of experiments were carried out . Fortunately MZ shows outstanding adsorption capacity for TC and can be easily separated from water . The pseudo second order kinetics model can explain the adsorption process of TC well and the maximum adsorption capacity is 1590.28mgg

@highlight Magnetic graphene oxide ZnO nanocomposites were fabricated.
