 Hydrogen production via water electrolysis for large scale application is still limited majorly by the huge energy consumption and high cost of catalyst materials . In this work with rationally designing V Co metal organic framework as a precursor a series of V

@highlight  CoP were prepared through pyrolysis and a subsequent phosphidation.
@highlight  CoP exhibits a splendid electrocatalytic activity toward HER OER and UOR.
@highlight A V
@highlight  CoP AAAE was set up for energy saving electrolytic hydrogen production.
