 Two dimensional materials such as graphene have been of interest owing to their outstanding properties . For the application in various fields development of methods to prepare high quality 2D materials is indispensable . One of the attractive methods uses a mechanical force in the liquid phase especially high shear force in a Taylor Couette flow device . In this work we analyzed the flow numerically in the Taylor Couette fluidic device with a narrow gap for the efficient mechanical exfoliation of 2D materials . Calculated wall shear stress applied to the particles in the Taylor Couette fluidic device was as high as 68Pa at 2000rpm in particle number average . Since the critical shear stress for the exfoliation of graphite was estimated as 58Pa the Taylor Couette fluidic device could provide enough shear stress for the exfoliation of graphite . We also conducted the experiment to exfoliate graphite into graphene to confirm the flow effect on the exfoliation of graphite . Graphene with a low degree of defects was prepared in the Taylor Couette fluidic device at the available operating rotating speed . The highest exfoliation efficiency was observed at 2300rpm as the effect of increasing shear force on the exfoliation was dominant until 2300rpm and above 2300rpm turbulence effect lowered the exfoliation efficiency .

@highlight Taylor Couette device can provide high shear stress especially near the walls.
@highlight Stress on particles in the device exceeded the critical stress for the exfoliation.
@highlight Higher exfoliation efficiency was shown in the shear effect dominant regime.
@highlight Small eddies at high rotating speed lowered the exfoliation efficiency.
