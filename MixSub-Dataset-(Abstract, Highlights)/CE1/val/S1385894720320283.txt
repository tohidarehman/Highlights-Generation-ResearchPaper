 Recently sulfidation of nanoscale zerovalent iron has become a potential remediation technology . However the impact of sulfidation methods and actual sulfur content

@highlight Sulfidation method affected the Fe
@highlight content and Fe crystalline structure.
@highlight Sulfidation method affected the S speciation and distribution.
@highlight Co sulfidized S nZVI incorporated more sulfur than post sulfidized S nZVI.
@highlight S in Fe 110 can block more H adsorption sites than S on Fe 110 .
@highlight Sulfidation blocked the H
@highlight evolution and enhanced the florfenicol dehalogenation.
