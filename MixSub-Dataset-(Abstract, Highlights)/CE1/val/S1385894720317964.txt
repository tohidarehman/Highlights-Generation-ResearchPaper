 Multifunctional hydrogels with self adhesive self healable sustained drug release and anti infection properties could be attractive candidates in biomedical and relevant applications . Here inspired by mussel adhesive mechanism we developed a series of novel super adhesive hydrogels by incorporating polydopamine intercalated silicate nanoflakes into chitosan gelatin hydrogels . The intercalation of dopamine into silicate prevented its over oxidization and preserved sufficient free catechol groups in the hydrogel . The hydrogel with optimal content of DA and silicate showed excellent adhesiveness to various substrates with over 20kPa of adhesive strength to porcine skin . To endow the hydrogel with antibacterial activity the tetracycline hydrochloride loaded electrospun nanofibers were inserted into the gel solution with optimal content of DA and silicate to form the sandwich like nanofibers hydrogel composite in situ . The NF HG displayed higher bacterial kill ratio than original hydrogel and the sustained released TH could provide long term protection minimizing drug toxicity related with burst release . Besides NF HG exhibited good cytocompatibility and favored cell proliferation . Taken together this multifunctional hydrogel composite may inspire new aspects for potential biomedical materials .

@highlight Silicate serves as a protectant to prevent the over oxidation of PDA.
@highlight The tissue adhesive strength of the hydrogel is as high as 21.3kPa.
@highlight The sandwich like structure enables a sustained TH release.
@highlight Synergistic antibacterial effect of TH and CS of the composite.
