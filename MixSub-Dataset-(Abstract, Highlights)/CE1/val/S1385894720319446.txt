 We systematically explore a range of model conversions of mono and disaccharides and of linear and branched polysaccharides under the catalytic action of metal trifluoromethanesulfonates in ethanol . This highlights the preferred reactivity of specific carbohydrates and the interplay between selectivities of the reactions and the dominating catalyst activity . It unambiguously delineates that selectivities of acid catalysed transformations of carbohydrates into value added platform chemicals rely on the origin of the substrate any treatment the acidic catalyst and the reaction conditions . The optimised catalytic systems enable very efficient conversion of cellulosic carbohydrates into significantly value added ethyl glucosides ethyl xylosides ethyl levulinate ethyl lactate ethoxyacetaldehyde diethylacetal and furfural diethylacetal depending on the substrate and reaction conditions .
