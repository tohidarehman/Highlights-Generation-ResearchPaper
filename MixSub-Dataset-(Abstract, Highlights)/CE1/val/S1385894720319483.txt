 The interfacial and structural instability of Ni rich ternary cathode materials impedes its practical application in lithium ion battery with high energy density . Herein a thin coating layer of lithium borate which is confirmed robustly by the surface characterization techniques including TEM FE EPMA and TOF SIMS forms onto the primary particles of LiNi
