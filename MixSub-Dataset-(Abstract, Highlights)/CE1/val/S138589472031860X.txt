 Electrically conductive and mechanically stretchable materials based on liquid metal embedded elastomer compositions have been widely studied for stretchable sensors . However liquid metal in plastics possessing outstanding mechanical properties have not been reported . Here we fabricated a super tough force sensor based on liquid metal polyvinyl alcohol composites which exhibited unique sandwich structure with conductive LM composites between two insulated layers . Uniform dispersion of LM in PVA matrix was achieved due to the high viscosity of PVA solution and the surface interaction of PVA and oxide layer of LM . Besides soft LM droplets remarkably toughened the PVA plastics with 12.3 times increase in toughness 74 vs 6MJ m
