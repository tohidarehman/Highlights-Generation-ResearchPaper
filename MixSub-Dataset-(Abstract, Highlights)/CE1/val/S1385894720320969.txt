 Titanium nitride nanoparticles hybridized with Fe and N co doped carbon nanosheets composite is constructed by a facile in situ self template strategy . During the low temperature pyrolysis process uniformly TiO

@highlight TiN nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on Fe N co doped carbon nanosheets.
@highlight TiN Fe N CNS exhibits highly efficient ORR activity in acidic and alkaline media.
@highlight TiN Fe N CNS displays remarkable tolerance to methanol and outstanding durability.
@highlight Excellent ORR activity is credited to synergistic effect of TiN and Fe N CNS.
