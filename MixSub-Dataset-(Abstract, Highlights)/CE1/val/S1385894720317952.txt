 The treatment of bone metastases remains an enormous challenge in clinical application . Strategies utilizing reactive oxygen species to induce cell death show great potential for enhanced cancer therapy . Thus for the first time a versatile alendronate functionalized and cinnamaldehyde loaded nanoscale coordination polymer denoted as CA

@highlight A bone targeted oxidative stress nanoamplifier CA 
@highlight was constructed.
@highlight CA 
@highlight can increase generation and simultaneously reduce elimination of ROS.
@highlight CA 
@highlight can generate and maintain sufficiently efficient hydroxyl radical.
@highlight CA 
@highlight realized synergetic chemo chemodynamic therapy of bone metastases.
