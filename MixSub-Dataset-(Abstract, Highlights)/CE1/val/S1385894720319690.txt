 Long term heat storage provides an efficient way to utilize solar energy . Hydroxides are potential candidates for this purpose by dehydration hydration . In this study we investigated the effect of doping calcium hydroxide with ZrO NO

@highlight Onset dehydration temperature decreased by 61C by doping with 10wt ZrO NO
@highlight Dehydration rate of Ca OH 
@highlight increased by
@highlight 15 times at 310C.
@highlight Heat storage capacity of Ca OH 
@highlight increased by 8 times at 310C.
@highlight Activation energy for Ca OH 
@highlight dehydration remarkably decreased by ZrO NO
@highlight doping.
@highlight Kinetic model was elucidated and can be applied to reactor design and simulations.
