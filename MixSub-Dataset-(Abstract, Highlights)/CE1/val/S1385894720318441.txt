 Acid Mine Drainage has been of environmental concern for decades but found to be a viable source of critical Elements including Rare Earth Elements . The current AMD treatment methods typically use hydroxide base chemicals for neutralization which results in precipitation of ions from the solution . In these methods up to 70 of REEs precipitate at the target treatment pH of AMD and the rest is discharged with the treated water . To address this issue a novel staged precipitation process was investigated for efficient low cost and environmentally friendly recovery of REEs and other CEs while treating AMD for environmental compliance . This process incorporates CO

@highlight mineralization used for extraction of rare earth elements from acid mine drainage.
@highlight Precipitation of rare earth carbonates followed the trend of hydration energy of ions.
@highlight A two step AMD treatment process was formulated for recovery of critical elements.
@highlight More than 90 Al and 85 REEs were recovered through the proposed process.
