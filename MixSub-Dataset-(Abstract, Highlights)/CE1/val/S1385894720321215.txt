 Advanced oxidation processes based on activation of peroxydisulfate typically require energy or chemical input for which ultraviolet light and metal catalyst are commonly adopted . However the sluggish reaction kinetics due to insufficient catalyst redox cycling and limited solar energy utilization remain a key challenge to be addressed . Here we report a visible light driven Ru

@highlight Visible light drives PDS Ru bpy 
@highlight interactions to degrade pollutant.
@highlight Ru bpy 
@highlight is regenerated via one electron transfer between Ru bpy 
@highlight and RhB.
@highlight Ru bpy 
@highlight intermediate predominantly accounts for RhB degradation.
@highlight The catalyst shows ultra high activity and robust catalytic performance.
