 Anaerobic digestion is widely used to recover energy and nutrients from organic wastes and adding conductive materials has been reported to be an effective way to enhance AD efficiency . However the process performance and environmental sustainability of adding conductive materials into AD under different temperature conditions have not been addressed . In this study four different groups of lab scale reactors were operated under both mesophilic and thermophilic conditions and with without activated carbon addition . Based on the lab scale results a pilot scale reactor was used to highlight the effectiveness of activated carbon addition and the derived data was used for a life cycle assessment study . The results showed the enhancement of methane production by adding AC particularly under thermophilic conditions . At the organic loading rate of 4.7gVS L d the average methane yield of the thermophilic AD reactors with AC was 550mL CH

@highlight Methane yield increased by 150 by adding activated carbon into thermophilic AD.
@highlight Activated carbon enhanced hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in thermophilic digestion.
@highlight Activated carbon improved environmental impacts of anaerobic digestion based on LCA.
@highlight The dosage of activated carbon is a crucial parameter to determine LCA profile.
