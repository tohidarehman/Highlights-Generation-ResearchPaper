 The effect of different bioaugmentation strategies on anaerobic digestion related to the alleviation of ammonia inhibition was investigated in a long term operation . The long term operation confirmed that bioaugmentation is a stable method . A 35 increase in methane production was observed in bottles bioaugmented with

@highlight Bioaugmentation was confirmed stable to mitigate ammonia inhibition in long term operation.
@highlight 49 increment was achieved in MSH SS MBS with both two pathways enhanced.
@highlight Bioaugmentation stains should be properly selected to achieve a synergistic effect.
@highlight spp. performed different methanogenic pathway in different bottles.
@highlight Methanogenic pathway simulated by ADM1 is consistent with the microbial analysis.
