 Total organic halogen is a surrogate bulk organic parameter indicating a variety of fluoridated chlorinated brominated and iodinated organic compounds either formed in water wastewater disinfection processes or present in the environment derived from natural products and anthropogenic activities . Since its introduction in the 1970s TOX analytical methods have developed rapidly in parallel with the advances of disinfection byproducts studies . Thanks to the contributions of numerous researchers tremendous progresses have been made to refine or revolutionize existing methods . However unlike other bulk parameters an extensive and routine use of TOX methods is still lacking currently largely due to issues like high costs associated with instruments and consumables tedious and trivial operations undesirably high blank error and unsatisfactory halogen recovery . In this review we summarized a chronicle of advances for available TOX analytical methods and compared several standard methods issued by global authorities to help better understand their specific requirements . Then we discussed each step in the key procedures employed in the detection of adsorbable organic halogen specifically the separation conversion and determination processesto identify the important factors that deserve careful consideration and in depth understanding . Finally we proposed some research challenges and opportunities such as developing online and automatic system for TOX analysis exploring more robust methods to enable fluorinated compounds detection and lowering the method detection limit of iodinated species at affordable cost . The results of our study may aid in better understanding and implementing existing AOX analytical methods for practitioners and meanwhile motivating more researchers to develop cheaper more convenient reliable and automatic alternatives in the future .

@highlight Since the 1970s TOX analytical methods have been growing maturing rapidly 
@highlight Some standard methods are issued but further thorough refinements are needed 
@highlight Adsorbable TOX is equivalent to TOX now and its analysis has been commercialized 
@highlight Many factors affect accuracy along separation conversion and detection processes 
@highlight Online automatic cheaper and handy equipment is needed to enable routine use.
