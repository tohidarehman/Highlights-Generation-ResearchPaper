 Hydrothermal liquefaction wastewater can be used for biogas production through anaerobic digestion . Nevertheless it generally contains refractory and toxic organics which causes low methane production . The present study showed that the methane yield and methane production rate were increased by 3252 and by 5184 respectively with the addition of hydrochars derived from different feedstocks including sludge corn straw poplar wood and

@highlight Hydrochars promoted the methane yields and methane production rates of HTLWW.
@highlight The degradation of fluorescent components were enhanced.
@highlight The degradation of nitrogenous aromatic and phenolic organics were also enhanced.
@highlight Hydrochars enriched more bacteria that could degrade aromatic and phenolic organics.
@highlight Hydrochars enriched
@highlight and certain methanogens which are involved in DIET.
