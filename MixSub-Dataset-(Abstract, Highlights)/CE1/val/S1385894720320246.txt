 In this work an efficient VUV Fe PMS process was developed to degrade pharmaceutical compounds in contaminated waters . The effect of addition of low Fe and PMS amounts individually and simultaneously was scrutinized for treating metformin as a model contaminant . Co addition of 0.05mg L Fe and 20mg L PMS to the bench scale VUV photoreactor emitting both UV

@highlight PMS and Fe individually improved the rate of MET oxidation in the VUV photoreactor.
@highlight A notable synergy was obtained between Fe and PMS on MET removal by VUV light.
@highlight VUV Fe PMS consumed considerably less electrical energy than the plain VUV process.
@highlight Continuous flow VUV Fe PMS was an efficient process for complete MET oxidation in water.
