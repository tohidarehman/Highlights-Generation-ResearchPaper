 We herein developed a facile method to prepare PEI grafted amino functionalized graphene oxide nanosheets which exhibit a high selectivity in capturing Cr contaminants from aqueous solutions with an ultrahigh adsorption capacity of 1185mg g and fast kinetics to reduce trace Cr concentrations below the allowed safe levels for drinking water defined by the WHO within 15min in the presence of other coexistent ions . To the best of our knowledge the adsorption capacity of the composites is highest among all PEI functional adsorbents reported so far . Furthermore the cycle experiments indicated that the composites still exhibited excellent adsorption performance after 40 cycles . The adsorption reduction mechanism of Cr on composites was further confirmed . Moreover the separation performance of the composites was further improved by introducing magnetic nanoparticles on the surface of the composites . Finally the composites were successfully utilized in dealing with the actual industrial effluent .
