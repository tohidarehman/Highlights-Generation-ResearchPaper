 With the aim of achieving fire safe epoxy a hierarchical hybrid was designed with metal organic framework as the core structure self assembled prussian blue analogues as surface layers and polydopamine as the link between the two . The tailored hierarchical structure equipped with target functions enabled the enhancement of the intrinsic fire retardancy of the inner UiO 66 through the significant interfacial catalytic effect . The results demonstrated that with the addition on of 3 UiO66 PDA PBA EP composites exhibited a 50 decrease in peak heat release rate and a 66 decrease in production of carbon monoxide accompanied with the suppression of smoke . Meanwhile the adequate characterizations showed that the interfacial catalyst of nickel species derived from PBA exhibited high activity transforming into residue with a polyaromatic structure and exhibited catalytic oxidation effect for CO through Py GC MS and XRD results . The interfacial engineering between this hierarchical fire retardant and polymer may enhance quality of the char residue which attributed to the ability for efficient catalytic effect thus enhancing the fire safety of EP . In perspective constructing the structure tailored hierarchical fire retardants with target functions is an effective means of achieving fire safety in epoxy .
