 Manganese doped bismuth oxychloride photocatalysts were facilely synthesized for the photodegradation of metronidazole and the as prepared Mn BiOCl was systematically characterized . The results show that the introduction of Mn

@highlight The Mn doping in BiOCl generates a Mn 3p O 2d intermediate state in its band gap.
@highlight The Mn doping in BiOCl enhances OH
@highlight generation by increasing water adsorption.
@highlight A photodegradation pathway of metronidazole was proposed.
