 Phosphorus recovery from sewage sludge is necessary to promote the sustainable recovery of agricultural fertilizer products and prevent the negative environmental problems . In this study an innovation procedure of FeCl

@highlight FeCl
@highlight  assisted HTC treatment could elute above 88 of AP from the sludge solid.
@highlight The content of Ortho P in hydrochar of HFe 2004 accounted for above 95 of TP.
@highlight Long HTC time high HTC temperature were effective for OP and Pyro P decomposition.
@highlight P extraction amount and efficiency with FeCl
@highlight was much better than without FeCl
@highlight About 92.6 of TP in sewage sludge could be recovered as higher purity K struvite.
