 Aerogels with low density and excellent thermal insulation are seriously plagued by poor mechanical properties with low compressive moduli in the kPa range especially in extreme conditions such as high temperatures and fires . In this work a new double chemical cross linking and physical cross linking strategy is developed to synthesize ultrahigh modulus aerogels with extreme condition resistance from low cost polyvinyl alcohol bio based phytic acid and montmorillonite . The resultant aerogels consist of interpenetrating networks with chemically cross linked domains between PVA and PA and physically cross linked domains among PVA PA and MMT leading to an ultrahigh compressive modulus of 41.9MPa and a specific modulus of 455.4MPacm

@highlight Novel aerogels with chemically and physically double cross linked networks were fabricated.
@highlight The aerogel showed ultrahigh compressive modulus of 41.9MPa.
@highlight The aerogel maintained high modulus at high temperatures.
@highlight The aerogel showed excellent fire resistance and high temperature thermal insulation.
