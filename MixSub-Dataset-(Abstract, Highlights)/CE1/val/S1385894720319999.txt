 Photocatalysis is generally considered as a promising candidate to treat antibiotics in wastewater . The weak adsorption of target molecule makes the degradation largely depend on the dissociative hydroxyl radical oxidation pathway . In this work porous BiVO

@highlight Porous BiVO
@highlight microtubes photocatalysts are multiply modified with inorganic acids.
@highlight The modified sample carries more surface negative charges compared with pristine one.
@highlight Chlortetracycline degradation rate could be enhanced by 3 times up to 88 in 2h.
@highlight It is due to promoted OH generation by negative field according to degradation path.
