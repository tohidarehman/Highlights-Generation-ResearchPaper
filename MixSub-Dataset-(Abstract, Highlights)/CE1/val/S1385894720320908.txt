 Herein we report synthesis and properties of new multifunctional materials containing quinoxaline as an acceptor core and differently substituted carbazole moieties as the donors within unsymmetrical D A D type structures . The compounds exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence luminescence variation in response to external stresses and emission enhancement in the aggregated state . The effect of substitutions on the different properties is discussed . The investigation suggests that the strength of the donor determines the optical properties of unsymmetrical bipolar emitters . Density functional theory calculations revealed that in the ground and the excited state electrons of the highest occupied molecular orbitals are mainly localized on the stronger donor . Mechanochromism studies demonstrated that the bulky
