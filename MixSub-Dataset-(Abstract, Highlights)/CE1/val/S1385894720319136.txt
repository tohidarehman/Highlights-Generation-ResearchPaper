 The interface defects caused by lattice mismatch between semiconductors and the homogeneous doping of dopants in host semiconductors without layered structure are the challenges in the construction of high performance photocatalysts . Herein a smart template induced in situ growth method is developed to synthesize a quantum dot level Cu In co doped CdS hetero phase junction with multi arm nanorod morphology for the first time . Due to the in situ growth of CdS induced by Cu doped In

@highlight Homogeneous doping of Cu and In in CdS was easily realized due to in situ growth method.
@highlight Cu In co doped CdS hetero phase junction with multi arm nanorod was developed.
@highlight Lattice mismatch and interface defects were greatly minimized due to hetero phase junction.
@highlight The optimal CuIn CdS exhibited a photocatalytic H
@highlight evolution rate of 105.44mmol g h.
