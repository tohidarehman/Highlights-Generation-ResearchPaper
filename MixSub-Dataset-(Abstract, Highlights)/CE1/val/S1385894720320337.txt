 Traditional simultaneous nitrification and denitrification process was restricted by the stringent operation conditions and the inhibition of heterotrophic bacteria to ammonia oxidizing bacteria . To address these problems a long term simultaneous nitrification and denitrification moving bed biofilm reactor was successfully started by inoculating heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification bacterium

@highlight An efficient HSND MBBR was established successfully by inoculating HNAD bacteria.
@highlight The HNAD via shortcut process dominated in HSND MBBR and enhanced at low C N.
@highlight HNADs 
@highlight  DPAOs and GAOs were the main function genus.
@highlight HSND MBBR could regulate nitrogen metabolic pathways to adapt various C N ratios.
