 Two dimensional nanosheets are promising interlayers for enhancing the electrical conductivity and hindering the lithium polysulfide shuttling in lithiumsulfur batteries . However their dense 2D nature limits the electrolyte infusion and lithium ion transport thereby decreasing the rate performance . Herein we demonstrate that three dimensional crumpled carbon nanosheets decorated with a few nanometers of cobalt heterostructures Co

@highlight heterocatalysts on crumpled carbon nanosheets were developed from 2D ZIF.
@highlight A polar carbon nanosheets interlayer provided superior adsorption of lithium polysulfides.
@highlight Cycling stability and rate capability were improved by introduction of interlayer.
@highlight Excellent performances are attributed to the polarity and conductivity of interlayer.
