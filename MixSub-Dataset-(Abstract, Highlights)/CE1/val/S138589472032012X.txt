 Rational modification of coordination environment on metalorganic frameworks have a strong impact on the performance of heterogeneous catalysis . Here we demonstrate how tuning the surrounding environment on metals centers of MOFs can substantially enhance the oxygen evolution reaction efficiency . The MIL 59 Co NSs nano heterostructure was formed by anchoring MIL 59 MOFs on urchin like Co nanosheet arrays . Metal metal synergistic effect was validated to influence the coordination environment on MOFs DFT calculations suggests that the charge transfer from the Co substrate to MIL 59 on a formed COOCo geometry should be responsible for excellent activity . Acting as OER electrocatalyst the MIL 59 Co NSs requires a low overpotential of 216mV to arrive at 20mAcm
