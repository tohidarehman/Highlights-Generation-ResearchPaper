 In recent years with the rapid development of flexible electronic devices flexible energy storage devices have attracted more and more attention . In numerous energy storage devices battery supercapacitor hybrid devices have been widely studied due to their high power density and energy density . Apart from high electrochemical performance for battery supercapacitor hybrid devices mechanical flexibility of which is getting more and more attention nowadays . In this work we designed and fabricated a novel cathode based on nickel plated cotton cloth which is coated with Ni Co selenide nanowires for flexible energy storage devices . This Ni
