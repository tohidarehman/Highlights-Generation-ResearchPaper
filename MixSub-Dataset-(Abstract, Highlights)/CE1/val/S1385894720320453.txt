 Most of existing nanocontainers suffer from tedious complicated and unsustainable assembly process which restricts their application in corrosion protection as smart inhibitor carriers . In this study we adopted the framework hybridization approach to prepare a smart anticorrosion system

@highlight Ph HPMO was obtained by generic and facile framework hybridization method.
@highlight Interaction between Ph HPMO framework and inhibitor served as nature valve.
@highlight exhibited excellent inhibitor loading releasing properties.
@highlight showed robust anticorrosion performance.
