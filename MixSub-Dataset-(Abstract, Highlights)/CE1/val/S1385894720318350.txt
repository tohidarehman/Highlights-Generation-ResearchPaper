 In cogeneration plants with wet scrubbing of exhaust gases the resulting flue gas condensate passes through various treatment steps prior to its discharge to recipient water body or for use as boiler feed water . The present investigation examines membrane distillation as an alternative treatment method potentially overcoming bio fouling and other known drawbacks of established membrane technologies while making efficient use of available heat sources and sinks . Laboratory and pilot scale experiments are performed using air gap MD system where acid neutralization has been considered as a pretreatment step in order to avoid ammonia slip . Separation efficiency transmembrane flux specific heat demand and net heat demand were determined at different operating conditions . Resultant separation efficiency of the contaminants shows the successful application of MD for flue gas condensate treatment achieving results that are comparable or even better than separation with reverse osmosis . The obtained transmembrane flux varied between 1.6 and 7.2L m

@highlight Performance of proposed MD process is better than that of existing RO process.
@highlight Ammonia removal efficiency was enhanced by pH adjustment.
@highlight 92 water was recovered from real flue gas condensate during reconcentration study.
@highlight Clean condensate cost 1.7 m
@highlight for district heating driven MD system.
