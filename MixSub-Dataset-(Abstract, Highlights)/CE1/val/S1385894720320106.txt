 On demand delivery of drug to deep tumor tissues with long term tumor retention has directly influence on therapeutic efficiency and prognosis of patients which still remains challenge in cancer therapy . Here we introduce metallo supramolecular nanoflowers through multi drugs and metal coordination effect for near infrared or acidic triggered multi drugs release long term accumulation at tumor tissues and NIR II fluorescence imaging guided photo chemotherapy . The nanoflowers are constructed by epigallocatechin 3 gallate Cu

@highlight A metallo supramolecular nanoflowers was assembled for photo chemotherapy.
@highlight Nanoflowers were superior stable in physiological conditions.
@highlight Nanoflowers could effective depth penetrate into tumors through microvesicle.
@highlight Nanoflowers could be long term retention in tumors above 8days.
@highlight Nanoflowers could effective inhibit tumor growth upon the laser irradiation.
