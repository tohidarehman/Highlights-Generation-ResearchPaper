 High fire safe aerogel with multi functionality is urgently desirable due to the frequent fire disasters . However it is still a challenge to afford both excellent flame retardancy and sensitive fire warning in combustible aerogels . Herein we fabricated an ultrasensitive fire warning and high fire resistance chitosan montmorillonite carbon nanotube composite aerogel via freeze drying . Benefiting from the rapid decrease of the electrical resistance for amino functionalized carbon nanotube when being burned CCA achieved a hitherto shortest fire warning response time . Importantly the aerogel exhibited excellent flame retardancy and self extinguished in the vertical burning test . Besides owing to the hierarchical porous structure of the aerogel and the excellent barrier effect of the montmorillonite nanosheet CCA could resist a high temperature flame up to 1200C and effectively prevent the temperature of the nonexposed side from increasing exhibiting excellent thermal insulation . Furthermore the mechanical resilience anti fatigue performance electrical conductivity and unique three dimensional network endowed the aerogel with good piezoresistivity . This work provides a facile environmentally friendly and cost effective approach to fabricating multifunctional fire safe aerogel showing promising applications in exterior wall insulation vehicle interior firefighting and wearable electronics .
