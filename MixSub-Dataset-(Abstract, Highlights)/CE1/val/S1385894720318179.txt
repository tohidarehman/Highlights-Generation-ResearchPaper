 Na ion batteries are considered as the most promising candidate for next generation large scale electrochemical energy storage . However the design of such a rocking chair battery has intrinsic defects . During the first charge process of a SIB irreversible reduction occurs at the carboneous anode to form solid electrolyte interphase which would inevitably consume precious Na resource in the Na rich cathode and result in a considerable capacity loss . Such an issue has also long existed in LIBs and particularly complicated prelithiation procedures are indispensable in commercial LIB fabrications . In the present study a novel Mg Na hybrid battery design is introduced with a Na intercalation cathode of Na
