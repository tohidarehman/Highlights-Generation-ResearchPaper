 Integrating dual modal imaging and photothermal effect within a single nanosystem is an enormous challenge for current nanomedicine application . Herein non toxic amorphous Ag

@highlight Amorphous Ag
@highlight Cu
@highlight S QDs with NIRF and photothermal PA properties are designed.
@highlight The photothermal conversion efficiency of amorphous Ag
@highlight Cu
@highlight S QDs is 44.0 .
@highlight NIRF of a Ag
@highlight Cu
@highlight S QDs is tuned to the lowest absorption region in first biowindow.
@highlight a Ag
@highlight Cu
@highlight S QDs as all in one nanomedicines demonstrate long term non toxicity.
@highlight Under a low power irradiation NIRF PA imaging guided PTT has been achieved.
