 It is very imperative to develop cost effective nonprecious metal containing materials with efficient oxygen evolution reaction activity . Herein a series of novel composite catalysts

@highlight Porphyrin coordination polymer TiCP PCP decorated Co
@highlight S composite was designed.
@highlight The introduction of TiCP PCP provides abundant active sites for oxygen evolution.
@highlight The composite exhibits excellent electrocatalysis with ultralow overpotential.
@highlight The improved electrocatalysis is assigned to a combination of mechanisms.
