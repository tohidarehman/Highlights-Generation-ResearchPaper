 Fluoride anion pollution is one of the main problems that needs to be addressed in contaminated water . Herein we have developed a novel sensing platform using a pyrene boronic acid and carbon dots for the selective detection and removal of fluoride F

@highlight A pyrene boronic acid based CDs CDs PyB ratiometric nanosensor was fabricated.
@highlight CDs PyB showed a sensitive selective and a low detection limit towards F
@highlight of 5.910
@highlight M.
@highlight A cellulose film containing CDs PyB CPC was prepared for F
@highlight recognition and removal.
@highlight The CPC displayed more than 90 uptake efficiency and good reusability for F
@highlight MTT assay revealed the excellent biocompatibility of the CPC.
