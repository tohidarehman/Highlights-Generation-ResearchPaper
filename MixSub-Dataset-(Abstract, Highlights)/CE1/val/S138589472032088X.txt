 In the present work we report on the synthesis of new class of nitrogen rich energetic polymers based on tetrazole acetate modification of pristine cellulose and microcrystalline cellulose as well as their nitrated derivatives . All compounds were fully characterized using series of analytical tools . Furthermore the detonation properties of the nitrated polymers were predicted using the EXPLO5 V6.04 computer code . Their heats of combustion and sensitivity characteristics against impact and friction were also evaluated . Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the performed chemical modification to synthesize nitrated tetrazole acetate functionalized cellulose and microcrystalline cellulose from their precursors with great nitrogen contents elevated densities good thermal stability interesting detonation properties and low sensitivity characteristics compared to conventional nitrocellulose and emergent microcrystalline cellulose nitrate . Therefore this investigation provides a novel and sustainable methodology to develop promising high energy dense materials from natural products which may further promote their use as new nitrogen rich energetic polymers in composite explosives and high performance solid propellants .
