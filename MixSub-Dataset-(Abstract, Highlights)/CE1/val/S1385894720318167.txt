 Long persistent phosphors can maintain luminescence for an appreciable time after terminating the excitation light which can be compared to an optical battery . This intriguing optical phenomenon has attracted a lot of attention in numerous areas such as safety display biomedicine and data storage technologies . Owing to the efficient elimination of autofluorescence interference from biological samples and the ultra long near infrared afterglow emission NIR LPPs show deeper tissue penetration depth offering a bright prospect for various bioapplications such as
