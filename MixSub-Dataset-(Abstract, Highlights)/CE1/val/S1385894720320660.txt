 This study aimed to investigate pollutant concentration and membrane fouling characteristics of a forward osmosis process using aquaporin biomimetic membrane for concentrating black odorous water . The membrane cells were operated in active layer facing feed solution mode with 2M NaCl solution as the draw solution . The system was continuously performed for 64 batch cycles and each cycle duration was 24h . At the end of each cycle physical cleaning with deionized water was employed as the membrane recovery strategy . The results showed that the rejection ratios of chemical oxygen demand total phosphorus and nitrate NO

@highlight Black odorous water was concentrated by aquaporin biomimetic membrane for further treatment.
@highlight TN rejection ratio was largely dependent upon the NH
@highlight  N TN ratio.
@highlight AOB community affected NH
@highlight  N transformation and caused TN rejection fluctuation.
@highlight The elements P Na and the blackening metals Fe and Mn accumulated in the fouling layer.
@highlight Water flux decline was not observed with physical cleaning only.
