 Although wastewater treatment plants can retain a high percentage of microplastics arriving at the facilities no method for extracting and characterizing these microparticles has been still standardized in these units . This study investigated three protocols of chemical digestion prior to analysis of microplastics one directed to the effluents using peroxidation and two for activated sludge . The samples were collected from a wastewater treatment plant located in Valencia . In addition four common types of polymers were used to assess the influence of reagent exposure on microparticle integrity . Peroxidation was effective in treating the studied effluents and was also identified as the ideal protocol for activated sludge . The analysis showed that the use of H

@highlight A procedure for MP analysis was developed for different types of samples in WWTPs.
@highlight  90 removal of suspended solid was achieved with chemical digestion using H
@highlight Identification of MP by ATR FTIR was not compromised by the use of H
@highlight More than 90 of the identified microparticles corresponded to microfibers.
@highlight Mainly fragments of PE and PP and polyester and cotton fibres were identified.
