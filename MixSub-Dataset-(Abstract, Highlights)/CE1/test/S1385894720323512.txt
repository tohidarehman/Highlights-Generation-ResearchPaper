 Pesticide residues in the aquatic environment pose a threat to ecological environment and human health . The considerable concerns make it necessary to develop efficient strategies for the detection and degradation of pollutants . In this work a multifunctional membrane was fabricated on the self assembly of graphene oxide nanosheets with g C

@highlight The GO g C
@highlight  Ag membrane could simultaneously detect and degrade organic pollutants.
@highlight The membrane shows high SERS sensitivity owing to the enrichment ability and SPR.
@highlight The membrane shows high photocatalytic activity and
@highlight OH is prominent active radical.
@highlight Recyclable enrichment detection and photodegradation of paraoxon ethyl was achieved.
