 lithium sulfur batteries have been regarded as one of the most promising systems for next generation rechargeable batteries owing to their high energy density and low cost . However the Shuttle effect of polysulfides and low sulfur utilization upon cycling are still hindering their practical applications . Herein we report a series of marine organism like hollow nanoarchitecture consisting of nitrogen doped 1D carbon nanotubes which were derived from binary Fe Ce Prussian blue analogs and melamine . This nitrogen doped 3D hollow scaffold offers large inner space

@highlight 2D Prussian blue analog nanosheets were employed as precursors.
@highlight 3D marine organism like scaffolds were manipulated during synthesis.
@highlight Dissolved lithium polysulfides were absorbed and anchored by Fe CeO
@highlight particles.
@highlight The mechanism of performance improvement was revealed on an atomic level.
