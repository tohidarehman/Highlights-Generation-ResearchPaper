 Thermoelectric materials with efficient heat energy conversion have been widely considered as potential electrical energy sources . Herein we propose an anion exchanged porous SnTe nanosheets as a high performance thermoelectric material with ultra low thermal conductivity . The solution phase reaction mechanisms for porous SnTe NSs are proposed and the reaction conditions are carefully manipulated in order to determine the optimal morphology and excellent thermoelectric performance . The porous SnTe NSs which consist of extremely small nanoparticles of only 3nm in size with defective shapes lead to a substantial reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity and a higher Seebeck coefficient compared to bulk SnTe caused by the introduced nanointerfaces pores and defects . An impressive
