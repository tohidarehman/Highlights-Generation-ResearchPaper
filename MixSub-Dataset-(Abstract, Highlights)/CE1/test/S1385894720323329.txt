 The tissue targeting delivery and intracellular transportation of therapeutics have been highly demanded for effective cancer therapy but remains challenging . We hereby report an implantable scaffold consisting of composite fibers with unique particle on fiber microstructure for localized synergistic chemo starvation therapy . In this system silica nanoparticles are loaded with glucose oxidase and protected by a polydopamine coating . A hypoxia activated prodrug is absorbed at the particle surface . Meanwhile biodegradable fibrous scaffold composed of polycaprolactone and gelatin are incorporated with hyaluronidase and self assembled with MGPA nanoparticles . When the composite scaffold is implanted at the tumor site particle liberation occurs in a pH dependent manner . HAase released effectively decomposes extracellular matrix and thereby promote the cellular uptake of MGPA nanoparticles . Subsequently MGPA exhausts intracellular glucose and O
