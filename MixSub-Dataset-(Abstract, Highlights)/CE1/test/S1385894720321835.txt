 In this work an ultra sensitive amyloid beta oligomer sensor is presented in the detection range at atomolar level . A hierarchical gold dendrite was electrochemically prepared on a gold substrate . Poly was electrodeposited on AuD to maintain the outstanding electrochemical properties such as high conductivity and large surface area . After immobilization of the cellular prion protein PrP

@highlight Synergy effect of gold dendrite and PPy 3 COOH to enhance the conductivity of the electrode.
@highlight The first amyloid oligomer AO sensor based on highly conductive dendritic PPy 3 COOH composite electrode.
@highlight The ultrasensitive sensor can be used in the diseased mice and blood test for the early diagnosis of Alzheimers disease.
