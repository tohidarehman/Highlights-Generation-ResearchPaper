 Ammonium dibutyl dithiophosphate is one of the most important flotation reagents in sulfide mineral processing causing severe environmental pollution . In this study natural pyrrhotite activated peroxydisulfate was applied to treat ADD which can alleviate mine tailing problems and reduce the cost of treating mine wastewater . PDS can be efficiently activated by NP for ADD degradation achieving complete ADD removal with 0.35g L NP and 1.0mM PDS . The PDS activation not only occurred in solution but on the NP surface . Dissolved Fe

@highlight ADD was degraded by natural pyrrhotite activated peroxydisulfate effectively.
@highlight Effects of NP dosage pH dissolved O
@highlight  and Fe
@highlight on ADD degradation were studied.
@highlight The primary oxidizing species were examined by EPR studies.
@highlight DFT was employed to analyze ADD degradation path.
