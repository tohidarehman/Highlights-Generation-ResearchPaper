 Levulinic acid is one of the most important platform chemicals as it is a versatile building block for a variety of high value added products fine chemicals and pharmaceutical intermediates . Catalytic esterification of LA with alkyl alcohols leads to levulinate esters which can be used as fragrances flavoring agents and fuel additives . In the present work the kinetics of the levulinic acid esterification with ethanol in the presence of Amberlite IR120 was investigated in a batch reactor . The collected experimental data were interpreted with a reliable model taking into account also for the mass transfer phenomena involved in the reaction network . The kinetic model was further validated by conducting experiments in a fixed bed reactor . The reactor was characterized in terms of fluid dynamics and the collected kinetic data were interpreted with a reliable reactor model considering the extent of the reaction and fluid solid mass transfer limitation .
