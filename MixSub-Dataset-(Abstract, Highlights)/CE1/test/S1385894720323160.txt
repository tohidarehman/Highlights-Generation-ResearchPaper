 From theoretical calculations validated by the results of experiments it was shown that the properties of the washing liquid that flows into biotrickling filters at livestock facilities determine the maximum ammonia removal efficiency that can be achieved . For a well designed biotrickling filter not limited by hydrodynamic conditions the ammonia driving force is mainly controlled by the pH and also by the electrical conductivity EC

@highlight The theoretical ability of a biotrickling filter to treat NH
@highlight is proposed.
@highlight Theoretical calculations are validated by experimental results.
@highlight The removal efficiency depends on the physical properties of the washing liquid.
@highlight pH electrical conductivity and temperature are the main influencing parameters.
@highlight Theoretical RE could be used as a diagnostic tool to identify apparatus failure.
