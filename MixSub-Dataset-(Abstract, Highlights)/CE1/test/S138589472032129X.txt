 It is of significance to replace Pt based electrocatalyst with high activity and low price non noble metal oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysts for large scale application of fuel cells . Herein we display a kind of coreshell hybrid composed of Fe Fe

@highlight A MOF derived route was reported to synthesize Fe Fe
@highlight ORR electrocatalysts.
@highlight The loading amount of Fe influenced the properties of Fe Fe
@highlight Fe Fe
@highlight shows obvious mesoporous which gives positive impact on ORR activity.
@highlight Fe Fe
@highlight could catalyze ORR via a direct 4e
@highlight pathway.
@highlight Fe Fe
@highlight presents admirable catalytic activity for ORR.
