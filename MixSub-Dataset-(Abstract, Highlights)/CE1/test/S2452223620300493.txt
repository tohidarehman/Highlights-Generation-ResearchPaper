 The palladium catalyzed Heck arylation of olefins using arenediazonium salts known as the HeckMatsuda reaction constitutes an effective green and sustainable way to synthesize functionalized aryl intermediates for organic synthesis . The present review highlights this strategy focusing on some selected examples from our laboratory . The examples include the substrate directed arylation of olefins covalent and noncovalent strategies and their application in the total syntheses of many pharmacologically active compounds commercial drugs and or functional compounds .

@highlight Effective Heck arylations using arenediazonium salts.
@highlight A practical reliable and sustainable process for constructing complex molecules.
@highlight An enantioselective method for obtaining enantioenriched functional and pharmacologically active compounds.
@highlight Extensive use of novel chiral N N ligands.
@highlight Unprecedented noncovalent control by polar functional groups in the substrates.
