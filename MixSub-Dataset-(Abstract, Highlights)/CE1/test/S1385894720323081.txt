 Introducing defects into metal oxides is considered as an effective method to improve their performance . However to fully understand the role of oxygen vacancies in the adsorption of organic dyes is still a challenging target . Herein defective alumina microspheres were synthesized and used as adsorbents for removing organic dyes . In contrast to ordinary Al

@highlight DF AlOx has abundant oxygen vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated Al species.
@highlight The DF AlOx exhibits enhanced adsorption performance for CR MB and MO.
@highlight A vacancy capture mechanism for enhanced adsorption performance was proposed.
@highlight Oxygen vacancies can be easily generated on the DF AlOx compared with Al
@highlight Oxygen vacancies mainly act as capture centers and facilitate dyes adsorption.
