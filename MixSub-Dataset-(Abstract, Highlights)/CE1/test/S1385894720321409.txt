 Photocatalysts based on copper doped bismuth oxybromide were synthesised using a solvothermal method and assessed for their ability to degrade norfloxacin under visible light . The Cu atoms were successfully doped into the crystal lattice of BiOBr yielding Cu doped BiOBr microflowers with a morphology and crystal structure identical to that of pristine BiOBr . The as prepared Cu doped BiOBr showed activity superior to BiOBr in the photocatalytic degradation of norfloxacin under visible light irradiation which was attributed to its improved light harvesting properties enhanced charge separation and interfacial charge transfer . Furthermore we found for the first time that the introduction of Cu into BiOBr enhanced the adsorption capacity between the photocatalyst and norfloxacin which we considered to be the main contribution to its improved performance . Cu doped BiOBr containing the optimal proportion of Cu and Bi had a photocatalytic degradation constant of 0.64 10

@highlight Copper doped BiOBr Cu doped BiOBr was synthesized using a one step hydrothermal method.
@highlight Cu doped BiOBr showed much higher visible light driven photocatalytic activity for norfloxacin degradation.
@highlight The doping of copper in BiOBr enhance the norfloxacin adsorption on photocatalyst surface.
@highlight The photocatalytic activity of Cu doped BiOBr in the fifth cycle easily maintained 95 of the activity in the first cycle.
