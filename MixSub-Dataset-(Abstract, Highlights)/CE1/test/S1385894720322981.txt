 Cell sheets play a vital role in gene therapies . Nonetheless gene delivery platforms based on cell sheet technology are restricted to small genes . Here we produced a rapid and efficient light activated gene delivery nanodot platform for large genes . Due to its large gene sequence low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 5 is rarely used for gene therapy

@highlight Light activated gene delivery nanodot system was constructed for the first time.
@highlight A novel fabrication of LRP5 overexpressing BMSC sheet coating was developed.
@highlight It was first reported that LRP5 enhanced osteogenic differentiation of BMSC sheets
@highlight and
