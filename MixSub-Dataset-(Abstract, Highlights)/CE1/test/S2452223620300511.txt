 Heteropolycompounds especially heteropolyacids have received important attention as solid acid catalysts in recent decades . They have a strong Brnsted acidity and redox properties that make them important for the study of transformations of industrial and academic interest . To go toward suitable synthesis heterogeneous catalysts are currently being developed with especial focus on these materials . The design of catalysts for biomass conversion entails important challenges from the point of view of carbohydrate feedstock complexity and to develop environmentally friendly methods . This minireview aims to illustrate a number of very recent examples that show the significant potential of the heteropolycompounds in feedstock valorization and the transformation of some building blocks in multicomponent reactions .
