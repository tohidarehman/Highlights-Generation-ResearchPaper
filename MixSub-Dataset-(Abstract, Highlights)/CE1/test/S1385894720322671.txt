 Here by virtue of the natural merits of covalent organic frameworks we report the rational design of a novel reaction based recyclable fluorescent COF for both sensing and removal applications . The design concept is demonstrated by constructing allyl together with hydroxy groups functionalized COF material AH COF for the exclusive detection and effective removal of mercury the densely and well distributed allyl cooperated with hydroxy groups as the Hg

@highlight Allyl cooperated with hydroxy groups fluorescent COF AH COF are signed and synthesized.
@highlight Allyl cooperated with hydroxy groups on AH COF behave as privileged sites for Hg
@highlight AH COF shows excellent recycling capacity for both detection and removal of Hg
