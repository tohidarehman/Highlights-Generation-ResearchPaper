 The family of perovskite oxides is a promising class of catalysts for diverse energy conversion processes including water splitting . In this work a facile two step manipulation strategy was proposed and applied to LaCo

@highlight The B site cations in perovskite is manipulated to facilitate water splitting.
@highlight The decoration of CoS
@highlight and oxygen deficiency enhance the catalytic activity.
@highlight The evolution of reactive sites was studied by experiments and DFT calculation.
