 Functional doping enables conjugated polymers to be prevalent electrodes through enhancing the charge transport . However conventional inactive dopants inevitably weight the electrode and block the access to the theoretical capacity . Herein we demonstrate the versatile role of sodium anthraquinone 2 sulfonate in boosting the charge storage of CPs as both redox dopant and electrolyte additive . Reversible faradic reactions are supplemented both in the bulk polymer and on the interfaces with electrolyte resulting in battery like energy storage . As a result poly exhibits greatly improved specific capacity from 0.4 mAh cm
