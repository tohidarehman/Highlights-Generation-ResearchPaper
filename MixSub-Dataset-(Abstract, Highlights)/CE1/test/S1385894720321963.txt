 To tailor the electronic behavior of catalytically active species in heterogeneous catalysts is beneficial for regulating their catalytic performance in various reaction including hydrogen generation . Herein we rationally synthesize a series of antenna reactor type catalysts with the combination of plasmonic Cu spheres with catalytically active Co or Ni nanoparticles which are used for hydrogen generation from aqueous ammonia borane NH

@highlight Plasmonic Cu spheres are integrated with Co or Ni nanoparticles in the antenna reactor type catalysts.
@highlight Cu spheres with different sizes lead to the tunable activity of catalysts in the H
@highlight generation.
@highlight The visible light driven synergistic electron effect accounts for the efficient H
@highlight generation.
@highlight The optimal nonprecious catalyst has the highest activity with TOF value of 164.8min
@highlight The obtained results may promote the application of NH
@highlight BH
@highlight as an on demand H
@highlight carrier.
