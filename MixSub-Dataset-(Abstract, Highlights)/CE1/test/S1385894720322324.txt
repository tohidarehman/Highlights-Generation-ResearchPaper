 Concerns over considerable solid waste production increasing environmental pollution and the energy crisis have assigned a high value to solid waste recycling . Solid waste can be recycled as a potential substitute for some chemical substances . Additionally a promising strategy is the conversion of solid waste into heterogeneous catalysts for use in environmental remediation and renewable energy production . Hence this article aims to provide a state of the art review of recent developments in solid waste derived heterogeneous catalysts for organic contaminant removal and biodiesel production . First the types and characteristics of solid waste that are suitable to be processed into catalysts are summarized . This is followed by a brief description of the recycling technologies and processes of solid waste derived environmentally friendly catalysts . Next the applications of these new valuable heterogeneous catalysts in organic pollutant removal and biodiesel production are emphasized . Finally some future research directions are proposed .
