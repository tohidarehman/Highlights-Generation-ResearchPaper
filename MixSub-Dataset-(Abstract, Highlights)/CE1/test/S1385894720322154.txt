 Multi functional materials were synthesized by on chain modification of dimethyl methylvinylsiloxane copolymers with mercaptopropionic acid and Disperse Red 1 . After cross linking transparent free standing films were obtained showing at the same time light responsive and electromechanical properties . Different characterization tools such as DSC dielectric broadband spectroscopy dynamic contact angle and indentation were applied to investigate the impact of polymer functionalities on the intrinsic material properties . The molecular grafting of DR1 enhanced the dielectric permittivity by 63 compared with the starting vinyl silicones while high breakdown strength of 84V m was achieved . The films exhibited actuation on three different mechanisms electrical piezoelectric and photo induced . Through the use of specific analyzing techniques direct evidence of these features was brought in each case . The lateral actuation strain reached 8.7 at 40V m as a consequence of increased dielectric permittivity . The piezoelectric coefficient d
