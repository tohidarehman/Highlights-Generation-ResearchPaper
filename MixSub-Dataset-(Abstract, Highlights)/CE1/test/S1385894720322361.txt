 Interfacial solar vapor generation is promising and sustainable for seawater desalination . However the performance degradation caused by salt accumulation has hindered the development of the interfacial solar vapor generator severely . In this paper we have designed a lotus leaf like vertical hierarchical solar vapor generator for stable evaporation of high salinity brine . The LSG is assembled by Si PPy PVA sponge and multi root columnar PVA sponge by mimicking the structure of the lotus leaf . The Si PPy PVA sponge is fabricated by successively depositing the PPy layer and silane layer on the PVA sponge and acts as the absorber of LSG . LSG enables a stable evaporation rate of 1.350.02kgm

@highlight Si PPy PVA sponge has been prepared as the top hydrophobic layer and the bottom hydrophilic layer.
@highlight A lotus leaf like vertical hierarchical solar vapor generator LSG has been designed.
@highlight LSG enables a stable evaporation rate of 1.35kgm
@highlight in 26.6 brine for over 15days.
@highlight The model for salt transport in the porous sponge has been proposed.
@highlight The produced condensed water from the industrial dying wastewater reaches Class IV Surface Water Standards.
