 Recently biochar was frequently applied in catalysis field and it has been regarded as an efficient carbon rich material to degrade organic pollutants in water . Various functional structures of biochar have been reported to be valid in catalysis . Whereas the complexity of biochar structure and composition hinders the further exploration of specific functions of biochar . To address this problem selective inactivation experiment was first involved to investigate the role of oxygen containing groups in catalysis . In this study swine bone derived biochar was adopt as catalyst in persulfate activation system to degrade acetaminophen . Both non radical and radical pathway worked in BBC PS system . ACT could be completely degraded in 60min and the removal rate could reach 0.3111min

@highlight Selective inactivation method first applied in the biochar persulfate system.
@highlight Ketone groups have proved to be the active sites for non radical pathway.
@highlight Inorganic component might be able to simulate persulfate to produce O
@highlight and
@highlight Acid treatment is an effective means to enhance the stability of bone char.
