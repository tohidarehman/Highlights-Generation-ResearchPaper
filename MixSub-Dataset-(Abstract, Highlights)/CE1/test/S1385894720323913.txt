 In this research a facile fungal biomineralization method was developed for the synthesis of nanoscale zerovalent iron with a unique N doped branching structure which showed excellent stability and mediated high degradation of carbon tetrachloride CCl

@highlight Fungal biomineralization provide a facile method of synthetizing nZVI.
@highlight Iron coral exhibited better degradation ability for CCl
@highlight than commercial nZVI.
@highlight Geochemical simulation can be applied to predict the precipitation of biominerals.
