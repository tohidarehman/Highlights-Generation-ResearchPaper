 A series of xerogels with a properly designed porous structure and surface chemistry have been synthesized and evaluated as a host structure to promote the nucleation and growth of methane hydrates . Organic xerogels have been synthesized from resorcinol formaldehyde mixtures using a sol gel approach and microwave heating . These xerogels are hydrophilic in nature and possess designed meso macrocavities in the pore size range 555nm . Carbon xerogels have been synthesized from their organic counterparts after a carbonization treatment at high temperature . Interestingly the carbonization process does not alter modify substantially the porous network of the parent xerogels while developing new micropores . Under water supplying conditions the two types of xerogels exhibit a large improvement in the methane adsorption capacity compared to the pure physisorption process taking place in dry conditions and associated with a significant hysteresis loop . These excellent values must be associated with the promoting effect of these xerogels in the water to hydrate conversion process . The comparison of OGs and CGs as a host structure anticipates that surface chemistry total pore volume and pore size are critical parameters defining the extent and yield of the methane hydrate formation process .

@highlight Organic and carbon xerogels are promising platforms to promote confined hydrates.
@highlight Hydrate formation yield depends on the porous structure and surface chemistry.
@highlight Carbon xerogels with a poor surface chemistry exhibit a high conversion yield.
@highlight Cavities around 18nm give rise to the largest improvement in the methane uptake.
