 Operation of supercapacitors at sub zero temperatures with reasonable performance is of great importance for their outdoor applications . Herein the sub zero performance of supercapacitors assembled from nitrogen doped porous carbon electrodes with interconnected tubular structure using ionic liquid as electrolyte is reported . The carbon based electrode materials are synthesized by pyrolysis of poly networks in the presence of titanate nanotubes and potassium nitrate followed by removal of titanate nanotubes . Benefiting from the interconnected hierarchically porous structure and large surface area the synthesized electrode materials exhibits a gravimetric capacitance of 333Fg
