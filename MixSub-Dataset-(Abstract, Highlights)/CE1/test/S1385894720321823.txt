 The significant role of some natural enzymes in tumor therapy is recently widely explored due to their catalyzing specific endogenous substrates in tumor part . However the catalytic activity of these natural enzymes differs in various and complex tumor microenvironment which eventually is difficult to be guaranteed . To address this issue a new wonton like

@highlight The wonton like
@highlight @AuPt NPs formed by a simple self assemble process.
@highlight In the absence of natural enzymes 
@highlight @AuPt NPs have dual enzyme activities.
@highlight The enzymatic cascade reaction of
@highlight @AuPt NPs can produce ROS stably in the tumor.
@highlight @AuPt NPs have a good therapeutic effect by combining photothermal nanocatalytic treatment.
@highlight @AuPt NPs can perform triple mode imaging to assist tumor diagnosis.
