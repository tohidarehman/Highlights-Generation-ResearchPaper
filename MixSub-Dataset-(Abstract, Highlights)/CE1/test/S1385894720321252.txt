 A novel technology combining liquid phase absorption catalytic ozonation and sulfur autotrophic denitrification was proposed for the treatment of pyridine waste gas . The LA process was used to quickly fix the pyridine waste gas to attain a 500mg L pyridine solution . Then catalytic ozonation was used to break the heterocyclic structure of pyridine in solution to form organic by products and NO

@highlight A novel combined technology LA CO SLAD was built to treat pyridine waste gas.
@highlight Avoids NOx pollution during the treatment of pyridine waste gas.
@highlight The absorption solution of this novel technology can be reused multiple times.
@highlight The pyridine was oxidized to CO
@highlight  H
@highlight O and NO
@highlight  N in CO process.
@highlight The remaining NO
@highlight  N can be completely removed by the SAD process.
