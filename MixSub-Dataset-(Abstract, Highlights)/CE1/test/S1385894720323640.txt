 Micro resolution range finder is an essential tool in various cutting edge fields such as shooting macro precision instrument vibration monitoring and micro collision avoidance systems . Desirable MRRF requires micro scale precision high accuracy rapid response and long term cycling stability . Yet conventional MRRFs based on optical feedback precise machining piezoelectric effects and magnetostriction are still limited by complicated designs precise sequence of tasks and cumbersome device volume . As such for the first time we present a new type of micro distance sensor consisting of reduced graphene oxide high oriented polypyrrole foam for MRRF . Based on the distance resistance property of the as prepared foam the micro distance sensor has shown advantages of easy operation low cost miniaturized device . Here large rate resistance change and great mechanical stability are realized in rGO HOPPyF thus allowing precise and accurate micro distance detection . The micro distance sensor demonstrates ultrahigh sensitivities of 386.7 1260 and 546.7m

@highlight The rGO foam was modified with highly oriented PPy.
@highlight The rGO HOPPyF based micro distance sensor present ultrahigh sensitivities.
@highlight The precision and long term accuracy was revealed to surpass those of commercial spiral micrometer and laser range finder.
