 Rational construction of non noble metal based electrocatalysts for energy generation and environmental electrooxidation receives attention because of their simplicity versatility and high efficiency . In this study a novel coreshell electroactive material architecture is developed by electrodepositing cobalt sulfide shell over core NiCo

@highlight A three dimensional coreshell NiCo
@highlight @CoS NF electrocatalytic electrode has been designed.
@highlight NiCo
@highlight @CoS NF has been synthesized by a two step hydrothermal and electrodeposition method.
@highlight Enhanced exposure of electrochemically active surface areas leading to synergistic activity.
@highlight Chrysanthemum like NiCo
@highlight @CoS NF exhibits superior electrocatalytic OER and UOR activity.
