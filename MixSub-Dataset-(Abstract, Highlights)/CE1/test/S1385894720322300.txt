 Arsenic and copper causing water pollution is a worldwide problem and simultaneously achieving water decontamination from arsenic and copper is immensely attractive . In this study an economical and eco friendly light enhanced removal system was proposed to simultaneously alleviate water contamination from arsenic and copper where nascent copper hydroxides acted as nano absorbers and electron acceptors for As removal . According to the mechanism studies the nascent CHO effectively capture As forming surface CuAs complex formation constant log

@highlight A photo enhanced removal of As III and Cu II was achieved.
@highlight As III removal was through a combination of photooxidation and coprecipation.
@highlight As III photooxidation relied on the formation of the Cu II As III complex.
@highlight As III complexed with Cu II is photooxidized via direct electron transfer.
@highlight Procedures to realize the light enhanced water s purification were proposed.
