 The polysulfone based ultrafiltration membranes were synthesized by the phase inversion method with the varying ratios of composites for the efficient removal of heavy metal ions from their contaminated solutions . The membranes were characterized in terms of porosity permeability average pore size contact angle zeta potential flux regeneration and mechanical strength . The surface morphology of the membranes were analyzed by the field emission scanning electron microscope . The fluxes of the membranes were tested at the different transmembrane pressures of 1.53.5kgcm
