 Compared to conventional chemotherapy with subcutaneous and intravenous injection injection of self healing hydrogel drug delivery system to tumor site brings less toxicity for normal tissues but also better specificity for tumor cells on account of spontaneous repair and better retention . More importantly it is essential to introduce multifunctional nanomaterials into self healing hydrogel loading chemotherapeutic drugs to significantly enhance tumor treatment effect . Therefore Rhodamin B isothiocyanate labeled mesoporous silica nanospheres with Mn Zn Ferrite Mn

@highlight Self healing hydrogel prepared from Schiff base bonds between polysaccharides.
@highlight Mn Zn
@highlight silica nanospheres reveled unique structure and property.
@highlight Nanocomposite hydrogel was applied for MRI and triple therapies for cancer.
@highlight The system presented high specificity for tumor and low toxicity for normal tissues.
