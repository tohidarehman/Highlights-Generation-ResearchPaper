 The formation identification and reaction mechanism of reactive species in various advanced oxidation processes are crucial for understanding the principles of AOPs and the degradation mechanism of recalcitrant organic contaminants because reactive species are responsible for the degradation of organic contaminants in AOPs . In this review the possible reactive species generated in various AOPs were systematically analyzed and summarized including hydroxyl radicals HO

@highlight Possible reactive species formed in various AOPs were summarized.
@highlight Formation mechanisms and influencing factors of reactive species were analyzed.
@highlight Various methods for identifying reactive species formed in AOPs were introduced.
@highlight Reaction mechanisms of different reactive species with pollutants were discussed.
