 To reduce capacity attenuation during cycling and improve ultrahigh sulfur loading of Li S batteries we have manufactured nitrogen doped hollow carbon nanospheres with interconnected mesoporous shell as conducting frameworks for sulfur loading . One step dual template technique is employed to prepare nitrogen doped polymer silica nanocomposites with interpenetration twins nano architectures at the initial stage . After carbonization and etching of silica the interpenetration twins nano architectures converted into interconnected functionalized mesoporous carbon nanospheres that endow desired micro mesoporous volume 4.75cm

@highlight Interpenetration twin nano framework of S C ensures accessible reaction interface for sulfur species.
@highlight Interconnected open mesoporous channels in N doped hollow carbon spheres facilitate fast transfer of Li ion and polysulfide.
