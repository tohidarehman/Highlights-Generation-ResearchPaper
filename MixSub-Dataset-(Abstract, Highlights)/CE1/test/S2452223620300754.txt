 Research on furfural and 5 furfural concerns all fields of chemistry catalysis mechanistic studies synthetic organic chemistry materials sciences and chemical engineering . The purpose of this account is by picking a selection of the very recent literature to show the vitality of the field and to illustrate how transdisciplinary approaches can help overcoming the strong overlap between catalysts solvent and process issues . It highlights the necessity to encourage researches in two main directions one being the optimization of the access to industrially relevant targets and the second being the commitment of synthetic organic chemists to explorative studies on new reactions and new architectures .

@highlight Furfural and 5 hydroxymethyl furfural offer rare opportunities for designing novel biobased products and will play a central role in tomorrow s chemistry.
@highlight The renewability benefit should not be overstated as it is only a part of the cumulative carbon cost of the derived chemicals.
@highlight Progresses result from subtle combinations of catalyst design solvent and process optimization mechanistic studies and the use of cruder cheaper raw material.
@highlight Explorative synthetic chemistry using furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural must be developed for discovering new architectures.
@highlight Original molecular designs will offer possible novel applicative properties and improved environmental impact.
