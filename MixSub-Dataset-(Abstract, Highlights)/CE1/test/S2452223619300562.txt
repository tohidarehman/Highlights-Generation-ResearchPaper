 Hydrodeoxygenation is one of the important catalytic reactions for the conversion of biomass related substrates to value added fuels and chemicals because the value added products tend to have much lower oxygen contents than the substrates . The combination of noble metals with cations and or oxides of oxophilic metal species has been frequently reported to be very effective catalysts in hydrodeoxygenation and CO hydrogenolysis . The interaction between two components can be strongly dependent on the combination the molar ratio the support materials and so on which can be connected to high catalytic performance . The comparison of various catalysts can contribute to the future catalyst design .
