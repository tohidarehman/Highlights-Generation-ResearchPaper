 The application of battery like electrode materials with complex hollow structures huge surface areas and good redox properties is an appealing approach towards the boosting performance of hybrid supercapacitors . This work proposes a facile strategy for the fabrication of copper cobalt selenide hollow spheres as a new battery type electrode for hybrid supercapacitors . Benefiting from the considerable electrical conductivity and rationally porous structures this electrode exhibits a higher capacitance capacity of 1775.4F g

@highlight Copper cobalt selenide hollow spheres CCSe HSs were synthesized via a facile strategy.
@highlight The CCSe HS sample was chosen as battery type positive electrode.
@highlight A hybrid device is fabricated using CCSe HS and activated carbon with good energy density.
