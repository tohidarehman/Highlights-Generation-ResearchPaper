 Blood contacting devices including implantation devices indwelling medical devices and extracorporeal circuits have been at risk of thrombus and infections which lead to treatment failure and serious adverse clinical events . In this study we have reported a facile and robust mussel inspired superhydrophilic coating for use on these blood contacting devices to combat thrombosis and infections . The coating was fabricated mainly based on the rapid formation and accumulation of polydopamine nanoparticles and in situ synthesized using silver nanoparticles in the presence of sodium periodate . Therefore the stability and long term effects of superhydrophilicity were maintained because of the synergetic contribution of hydrophilic chemical components and surface topography of stacked nanoparticles . Different from mostly reported PDA coatings that have good affinity to protein adsorption and cause blood coagulation the superhydrophilic PDA coating in this work effectively reduced the nonspecific adsorption of proteins maintained the native conformation of the adhered proteins and further inhibited thrombus formation . Meanwhile the superhydrophilic surface with Ag

@highlight The stepwise deposition of PDA induced a robust superhydrophilic coating.
@highlight The superhydrophilic PDA coating was assembled with hydrophilic nanoparticles.
@highlight Suppressed protein adhesion activation contributed to the antithrombotic property.
@highlight PDA Ag had an effective antibacterial ability in a low dosage dependent manner.
@highlight A synergistic antithrombotic and antibacterial functions were obtained on PDA Ag.
