 As a rising star of two dimensional materials single or few layer black phosphorus possess great potential as nanofiller in fabricating polymer nanocomposites due to its thermodynamic stability nano size effect and structural characteristics . Herein few layer BP nanosheets were scalable exfoliated via solvent thermal method the Lithium ion intercalation was achieved during this procedure . Follow by a polydopamine encapsulated BP sandwich nanostructure was developed by oxidationreduction strategy which improved the air stability of few layer BP and its interfacial compatibility with polymer matrix . As could be expected the PDA encapsulated BP can effectively enhance the mechanical properties and flame retardancy of polyvinyl

@highlight Few layer BP was scalable exfoliated by solvent heat method via ion intercalation.
@highlight BP PDA nanohybrids showed remarkable decrease in PHRR THR and the amount of CO.
@highlight Significant tensile strength enhancement was achieved due to the adhesion effect.
@highlight PVA BP PDA exhibited high air stability even after exposed to air for five months.
