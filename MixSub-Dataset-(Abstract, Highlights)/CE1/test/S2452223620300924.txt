 This review deals with the problem of designing safer solvents for chemical transformation and chemical processes . These materials generically defined as neoteric solvents include the well known ionic liquids and more recently deep eutectic solvents . Super critical fluids also pertain to this class but we will restrict our review to the former IL and DES . The main object of this study is the description of properties of these solvents at a molecular level . Both IL and DES share a huge combinatorial flexibility leading to a formidable number of new solvents that can be prepared and it is in this line that theory may help . This is because most of the binding properties to a wide variety of solutes may conveniently be described in terms of the electronic structure of matter using quantum mechanical models classical molecular dynamics and ab initio molecular dynamics . The theoretical approach helps in the task of identifying and predicting optimal structures for specific applications .
