 Visible light activated photocatalysts offer a promising approach to remove recalcitrant organic contaminants from water without adding chemicals using free solar energy . In this study sulfate doped silver phosphate SO

@highlight SO
@highlight  Ag
@highlight PO
@highlight catalyzed the removal of insecticides under visible light.
@highlight Enhanced activity achieved by decreasing band gap and charge transfer resistance.
@highlight Degradation followed the order of TCP NTP ICP CTD ATP TMX DTF.
@highlight Mechanism mainly involves direct ICP oxidation by photoinduced hole.
