 The eliminate of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid was achieved via individual and combination of catalytic hydrodechlorination and AOPs involved peroxymonosulfate activation . The CMK 3 supported monometallic Pd catalysts with varied Pd loadings were prepared and applied in the reactions . The results showed that Pd CMK 3 were highly active and competitive in both the HDC and AOPs of 2 4 D and the removal efficiencies were 91.6 and 95.2 over Pd

@highlight The HDC AOPs and combined HDC AOPs of 2 4 D were conducted over Pd CMK 3.
@highlight Active Pd species exhibited distinct effects in the HDC and AOPs.
@highlight HDC product could be further degraded in the presence of PMS in situ.
@highlight Surface bound free radicals contributed most to the AOPs of 2 4 D.
@highlight Metal Pd was more stable after HDC than that of AOPs.
