 The exploitation of economical efficient and durable electrocatalysts toward the hydrogen evolution reaction is of far reaching significance for the scalable implementation of the water electrolysis technology and associated sustainable energy devices . The rational design of high efficiency HER catalysts requires the overall consideration of both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects . Herein we demonstrated a feasible synthesis of urchin like N doped Ni

@highlight The N doping can regulate electronic structure and enrich active sites of Ni
@highlight The hollow microspheres can provide high contact area and benefit mass transport.
@highlight Designing the catalyst considers the compositional and nanostructural engineering.
@highlight The N Ni
@highlight hollow microspheres exhibit excellent HER performance in alkaline medium.
