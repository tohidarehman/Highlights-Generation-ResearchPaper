 Herein greatly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction performances are obtained under the cooperation of small sized morphological effect and heteroatomic doping activation . Firstly three dimensional nickel cobaltite nanoneedle arrays with smaller diameters were directly grown on the thinner carbon filaments surface . Its derivative the flexible NiCo

@highlight Smaller sized NiCo
@highlight nanoneedles are grown on thinner carbon filaments.

@highlight nanoneedles phosphated illustrate a low OER overpotential.
@highlight The phosphated electrode displays an excellent long term durability.
@highlight Cooperation of small sized effect and heteroatomic doping plays the crucial role.
