 Metal halide perovskite solar cells have made a great progress in recent years however charge recombination and losses at interfaces between the different layers restrict their performance . In the present work we devised an efficient method that not only passivates the interfacial traps but also enhances charge extraction of the PSC . The chlorobenzene with the addition of Poly is used as antisolvent during the spin coating process of the wet perovskite film . In this way P3HT molecules permeate along perovskite grain boundaries to fill the pinholes and repair interfacial defects of the perovskite film . In addition the valence band of the surface of the perovskite layer is thus tuned to form an energy level better aligned with the hole transport layer . Such a gradient heterojunction structure layer containing P3HT and perovskite provides a rapid channel for hole migration and improves carrier extraction efficiency . The power conversion efficiency of the champion solar cell is up to 20.0 with an open circuit voltage of 1.18V a short circuit current density of 22.2mA cm

@highlight A gradient heterojunction structure GHJ layer was in situ obtained.
@highlight The P3HT of the GHJ layer enhances hole extraction ability.
@highlight Gradient energy level alignment of the GHJ improves charge collection ability.
@highlight Long term stability of solar cells is due to the hydrophobic nature of P3HT.
