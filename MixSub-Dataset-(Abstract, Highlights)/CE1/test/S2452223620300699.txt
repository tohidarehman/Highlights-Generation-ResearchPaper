 Cell free enzymatic transformations can overcome some of the limitations of whole cell biocatalysis . While flow chemistry has matured into an established discipline in organic synthesis its use in cell free biocatalysis is just beginning to be explored . Here we review examples of recent advancements between 2018 and 2020 . We particularly focus on enzyme immobilization and cofactor recycling as these are two major research focuses in this field . This review also provides perspective on future directions .

@highlight Continuous manufacturing combined with cell free enzyme transformations provide a green and sustainable route to specialty chemicals.
@highlight Enzyme transformations in continuous systems often have high space time yields.
@highlight Protein immobilization is key when combining continuous manufacturing and cell free technology.
@highlight Cofactor recycling is a major economic determinant of cell free small molecule manufacturing.
