 The artificial photosynthesis system relies on the semiconductors that are chemically stable and can efficiently capture solar energy . However material stability and water splitting efficiency are often poor under the harsh conditions because of thermodynamic and kinetic challenges that hamper its practical use in large scale integrated devices . Here we integrate BiVO

@highlight A novel MIS structured FTO BVO TiO
@highlight  Graphene Ni photoanode for PEC water oxidation.
@highlight Graphene is adopted as hole transport layer to improve hole tunneling efficiency.
@highlight The photocurrent of BVO photoanode can be increased nearly 1.5 times with graphene.
@highlight The BVO photoanode exhibits excellent performance in strong alkaline electrolytes.
