 Mature leachates contain extremely recalcitrant aromatic organic matter and require appropriate treatment before discharge . The combined process for treating mature landfill leachate is a common and proper due to its inexpensiveness and high performance . Identification of refractory components and insights into the physicochemical properties transformations of the organics are essential for the development of efficient treatment process . Optical three dimensional chromatography and electrochemical techniques were applied to characterize aromatic organic matter in leachate from a pilot landfill leachate treatment plant . Results showed that the combination of biological contact oxidation iron carbon micro electrolysis Fenton coagulation and integrated activated sludge system could efficiently remove 95.5 COD and 88.3 DOC in leachate organic matter together with a simultaneous reduction in its molecular weight aromaticity polarity and humification degree . The low MW proteinaceous carboxylic acid and amine containing fractions were preferentially removed in biological contact oxidation process whereas the hydrophilic humic substances with the MW 4.0kDa were the main species against biological treatment . Conversely the advanced oxidation processes could efficiently destroy high MW aromatic rings and conjugated moieties fractions resulting in an increase in the leachate biodegradability . The oxygen containing moieties generated in the AOPs were bridged by the flocculants to promote precipitate during the coagulation process and the polymerized metastable organic fractions formed during the process were partly biodegraded in the integrated activated sludge system . This study highlights the potential of combined optical electrochemical measurements to monitor the intrinsic reactivity of aromatic organic matter and guide the practical leachate treatment .
