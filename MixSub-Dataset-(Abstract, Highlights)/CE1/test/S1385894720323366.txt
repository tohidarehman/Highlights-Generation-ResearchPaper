 Photocatalytic nitrogen fixation is an attractive pathway to produce ammonia which is an important industrial raw material for fertilisers chemicals and energy but still suffers from low conversion efficiency . By virtue of unique electronic structures and unusual physicochemical properties significant research efforts regarding ultrathin photocatalysts have been made to show excellent nitrogen fixation behavior . In this review state of the art progress of ultrathin structured N

@highlight Basic understanding and notice points on N
