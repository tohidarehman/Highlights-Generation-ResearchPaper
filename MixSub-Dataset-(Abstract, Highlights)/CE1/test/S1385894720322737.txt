 Core shell nanostructured compounds are considered as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors in virtue of their facile accessibility to active sites and high electrical conductivity yet always limited by low capacity or poor cyclic stability because of the weak combination or shedding of active materials from the substrate . To address this issue we first synthesize three dimensional CuO cross linked nanosheet aggregates grown on Cu foams by wet chemical oxidation and further demonstrate the growth of ultra thin cobalt nickel layered double hydroxides onto the core of 3D CuO cross linked nanosheet aggregates by electrodeposition . In this way we find that the cross linked
