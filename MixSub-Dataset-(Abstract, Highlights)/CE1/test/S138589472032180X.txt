 Despite the development of advanced photocatalysts the practical application of photocatalytic water disinfection is still under restrictions due to the low reusability of powder photocatalysts . In this paper we synthesized the binary composite heterojunction photocatalyst MoS

@highlight A binary composite MoS
@highlight  TiO
@highlight NTAs was synthesized for photocatalytic sterilization.
@highlight The water disinfection efficiency of MoS
@highlight  TiO
@highlight NTAs was up to 98.5 .
@highlight The water disinfection efficiency still reached 92.1 after 3 times recycling.
@highlight The mechanism is the damage of bacterial by
@highlight produced by photoexcitation.
