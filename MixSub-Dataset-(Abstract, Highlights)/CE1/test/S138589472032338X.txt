 Microbial denitrification can be impaired by the co existence of organic chelating pollutants however information on the potential impacts of nitrate reduction efficiency in response to such pollutants is limited . Herein 1 hydroxyethane was selected as a typical pollutant to investigate effects on biological denitrification in an expanded granular sludge blanket reactor . Results showed that 99.5 99.9 of nitrate was removed after sludge exposure to HEDP . This was due to the protection of microbial cells by an increase in the secretion of extra polymeric substances in response to HEDP stress . However nitrate removal efficiency decreased to 55 with the accumulation of 470mg L

@highlight The effects of HEDP on denitrification in an EGSB reactor were investigated.
@highlight Nearly complete nitrate was removed in the presence of 1.5mM 30mM HEDP.
@highlight Increase in EPSs secretion was observed under 1.5mM 30mM HEDP.
@highlight was the genus responsible for denitrification under 1.5mM 30mM HEDP.
@highlight Accumulation of nitrite after exposure of sludge to 40mM HEDP was observed.
