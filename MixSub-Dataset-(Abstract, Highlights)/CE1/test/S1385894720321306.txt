 Coaxial mixers are efficient in mixing of highly viscous fluids . The main objective of this study was to assess the power consumption for the gas dispersion in carboxymethyl cellulose solution a power law non Newtonian fluid with a coaxial mixer consisting of an anchor impeller and two central impellers as a function of the speed ratio fluid rheology pumping direction of the central impeller and the rotation mode . This goal was achieved using both experimental and numerical approaches . A computational fluid dynamic model was developed and validated using the experimental data . Electrical resistance tomography was employed to measure the gas holdup . New equivalent impeller speed and diameter were defined and two novel correlations for the Power number and Reynolds number were proposed and successfully validated at different operating conditions . Additionally new dimensionless correlations for the ratio of the gassed to un gassed power consumption and the aerated power number as a function of the flow number Froude number and Reynolds number were developed and successfully tested for different coaxial mixing configurations .

@highlight New power Reynolds numbers for gas dispersion in non Newtonian fluids were proposed.
@highlight Gas liquid mixture properties were incorporated into the new correlations for the first time.
@highlight A critical speed ratio in upward pumping co rotating mode was identified.
@highlight Above the critical speed ratio the anchor acted as a barrier against the flow.
@highlight The critical speed ratio was a function of the anchor speed and fluid rheology.
