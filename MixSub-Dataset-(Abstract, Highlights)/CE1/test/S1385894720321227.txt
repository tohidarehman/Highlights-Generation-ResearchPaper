 Hydrogel dressings with good biocompatibility and the ability to maintain a moist environment at the wound site have great potential for clinical application . Multifunctional injectable self healing supramolecular hydrogel with conductivity and photo thermal property as wound dressing to promote wound healing has been not reported . Herein a series of antibacterial injectable self healing and conductive supramolecular hydrogels were fabricated through host guest interaction based on quaternized chitosan graft cyclodextrin quaternized chitosan graft adamantane and graphene oxide graft cyclodextrin polymer solutions which combined the good antibacterial activity of QCS and photo thermal property of reduced graphene oxide . These supramolecular hydrogels wound dressings have a conductivity value similar to that of the skin and a rapid self healing behavior and have great antibacterial property against
