 Microtubular CNT made catalytic membrane contactor is proposed for heterogeneous three phase catalytic processes aimed at hydrogenation and oxygenation of aqueous pollutants . The contactor comprises a mesoporous CNT made microtube with an internal diameter of 1.5mm wall thickness of 0.2mm pore diameter of 30nm loaded with a nano scale metal catalyst . In this study the concept of CNT made contactors was proved for hydrogenation of nitrate ions . The CNT made microtubes were fabricated by infiltration of CNT suspension through the polypropylene microfiltration membrane . The CNT made microtubes were loaded with Pd Cu catalysts using the wet impregnation method followed by reduction by H
