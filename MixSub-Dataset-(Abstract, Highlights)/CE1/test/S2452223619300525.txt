 Through selected examples we report here that ultrasound is capable of assisting a solid catalyst in various reactions . Beside improvement of heat and mass transfer induced by the implosion of cavitation bubbles we show that a synergistic effect can occur between catalysis and ultrasound . In particular the physical and chemical effects locally exerted on a catalytic surface upon implosion of cavitation bubbles can oxidize metal ions provide energy to the catalyst reaction
