 For flexible capacitive energy storage units in wearable devices areal metrics such as areal capacitance and energy density are exceptionally important because of limitations on device volume and weight . One dimensional carbon nanofibers composited with active metal oxides such as cobalt monoxide possess extraordinary electrochemical properties . However low areal metrics and the polarity in the flexible asymmetric supercapacitor device are two crucial challenges . Herein vanadium cobalt oxides on carbon nanofibers are purposely designed and fabricated by electrospinning and controllable post calcination which can be used as a binder free non polarity membrane electrode for the assembly of high performance flexible supercapacitor . Importantly the rational incorporation of vanadium with varying valence states helps promote the formation of CoO phase enriches the reaction sites and enhances the capability of local electron transport . As expected the single electrode of VCO CNFs yields an extraordinarily high areal capacitance of 1.83Fcm
