 The critical sized bone regeneration is still a challenge in regenerative medicine . Periosteum possesses excellent osteogenic capacity because it can provide osteogenic cells and growth factors and guide bone healing . Herein inspired by the nanostructure piezoelectric property of bone and the structure function of periosteum we report a periosteum structure function mimicking scaffolds with piezoelectric signal bioactive ion nanofibrous surface for critical sized bone regeneration . The biomimetic scaffolds have a gradient structure including the piezoelectric polymer layer and bioactive glass nanofibrous surface . The bioactive multifunctional scaffolds could remarkably improve the proliferation adhesion osteogenesis differentiation of bone marrow stem cells significantly enhance the formation of periosteum like tissue and the critical sized bone regeneration at the center of bone defect . Further studies of the molecular mechanism showed that the bioactive piezoelectric nanostructure scaffolds could activate the calcium sensing receptor of osteoblasts by accumulating Ca
