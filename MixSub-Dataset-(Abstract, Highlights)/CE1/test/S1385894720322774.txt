 Development of nonprecious metal based electrocatalysts with highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction has increasingly attracted wide attention in energy conversion and storage systems . In this work we stepwise grow cobalt chelated COF TpBpy on silica nanospheres to form coreshell SiO

@highlight COFs templated Synthesis of Co subnanoclusters dispersed N C Nanocages.
@highlight The high ORR activity due to Co subnanoclusters coordinated N atoms in the carbon nanocages.
@highlight An unconventional five step ORR process without the intermediate OOH 
@highlight The oxygen adsorption dissociation on catalyst surface promote high efficient ORR.
