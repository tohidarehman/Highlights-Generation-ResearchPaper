 The preparation of large aspect ratio nanofillers is challenging due to the complicated and expensive artificial processing procedures and low yields obstructing scale up production of 1D nanofillers polymer dielectric nanocomposites . In this paper a kind of natural sepiolite nanofiber was utilized to fabricate scale up of PVDF based dielectric nanocomposites . The sepiolite nanofibers were modified by aminopropyltriethoxysilane denoted as

@highlight Low cost natural sepiolite was used to develop large scale production of high performance dielectrics.
@highlight Organophilic sepiolites nanofibers possessed well dispersion in the PVDF matrix.
@highlight The maximal U
@highlight of 7.2Jcm
@highlight was achieved in 2.5 
@highlight  PVDF nanocomposites.
