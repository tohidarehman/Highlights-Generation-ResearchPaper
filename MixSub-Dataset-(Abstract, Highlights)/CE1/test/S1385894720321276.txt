 The energy minimization multi scale model has succeeded in describing the mesoscale structures in gassolid fluidization by introducing a stability condition to complete the model viz . the mass specific energy consumption for suspending and transporting the solids

@highlight Explore fluidization by using particle resolved direct numerical simulation PR DNS .
@highlight Propose a feasible way to correlate
@highlight to the local voidage and acceleration.
@highlight Eliminate the impact of initial distribution upon the stability condition by introducing acceleration.
@highlight Verify the stability condition of the EMMS model based on PR DNS.
@highlight Pave a way between EMMS and PR DNS for further study of fluidization.
