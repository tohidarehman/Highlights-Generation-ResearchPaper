 Complementary effect of components in a hybrid photocatalyst is an essential factor for improving solar energy conversion efficiency yet the underlying correlation between nitrogen doped carbon quantum dots and oxygen vacancy is still ambiguous . Herein using BiOBr nanosheets as model photocatalyst we studied the specific roles of N CQDs and OV in antibiotic photodegradation over full spectrum . Electrons were overwhelmingly collected on N CQDs rather than OV achieving prominent separation of photo excitons . However OV could extend the congenitally optical absorption boundary of BiOBr to maximum utilizing the up converted photons by N CQDs . Moreover active radical tests revealed that N CQDs mainly regulated the single electron reduction of dissolved oxygen to produce superoxide radicals

@highlight A novel N CQDs OV BiOBr photocatalyst is prepared for the first time.
@highlight The complementary effect between N CQDs and oxygen vacancy OV is substantiated.
@highlight OV and N CQDs extend the optical absorption of BiOBr synergistically.
@highlight N CQDs and OV respectively promote the generation of superoxide radicals and H
@highlight N CQDs provided prerequisite for the generation of H
