 An economical biochar supported iron copper bimetallic composite was successfully prepared and used to remove tetracycline from water . The experiment results expressed that BC FeCu exhibited higher removal than FeCu under the same condition . Moreover the TC removal by BC FeCu constantly increased with the pH value from 4.50 to 9.03 . Desorption experiments showed that adsorption and degradation accounted for 26.09 and 73.91 of the total TC removal by BC FeCu respectively . N

@highlight TC can be removed by BC FeCu through adsorption direct and indirect degradation.
@highlight EPFRs and transition metals can activate O
@highlight to generate O
@highlight None
@highlight to degrade TC.
@highlight Single electron transfer from BC FeCu to O
@highlight was a possible activation mechanism.
@highlight Sp
@highlight C sp
@highlight CC CO and C
@highlight O in BC FeCu were the active sites for TC degradation.
