 In this work a novel spherical covalent organic frameworks was developed via a simple and facile room temperature solution route . Via in situ growth of Pt nanoparticles on the surface of COFs

@highlight COFs were synthesized via a simple and facile room temperature solution route.
@highlight were used as novel electrode materials for tanshinol detection.
@highlight The sensor was successfully applied to measure tanshinol in real medicinal samples.
@highlight The study paved the way to utilize COFs to design electrochemical sensors.
