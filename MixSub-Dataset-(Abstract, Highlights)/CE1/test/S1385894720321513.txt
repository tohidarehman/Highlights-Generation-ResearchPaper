 Methanol to olefins is an alternative pathway to selectively produce lower olefins on demand . Acid zeolites like ZSM 5 convert methanol to dimethyl ether and water followed by the formation of olefins as well as of paraffins and aromatics as side products . In this study butene was used as model compound for the recycle in the industrial methanol to propylene process and co fed with methanol . During these kinetic experiments both methanol and butene inlet partial pressures were varied as well as the total volumetric flow rates . Temperatures between 708 and 788K were applied as the aim of this work is to model the fundamental kinetics of the MTO chemistry at olefin co feed conditions . For the kinetic model the single event methodology is used in order to reduce the number of estimated parameters while depicting each surface reaction . Olefin interconversion as well as olefin methylation and oxygenate interconversion steps are all covered by the model . Only the formation of aromatics is described in a simplified and thus not fundamental way . Over 4000 reaction steps are modeled using only eleven estimated parameters . The resulting high numeric significance of the activation energies allows a mechanistic analysis of the different reaction pathways and an assessment of the most important propene production steps . This shows high temperatures to be advantageous for fast carbon transfer to the olefin hydrocarbon pool and subsequent cracking of mainly hexenes and heptenes to propene .
