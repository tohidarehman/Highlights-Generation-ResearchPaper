 Carbon nanofibers have exhibited wide applications in the fields of materials science nanotechnology energy storage environmental science biomedicine and others due to their unique structure function and properties . In this review we present recent advance in the production and applications of various CNF based nanomaterials . The methods for the production of CNFs are introduced firstly and then different structures of CNFs related to corresponding synthesis methods are analyzed . In addition the functional tailoring of CNFs by combining with other nanoscale building blocks such as nanoparticles quantum dots carbon materials biomolecules and others are demonstrated and discussed . Finally the potential application of the CNF based functional nanomaterials in the fields of supercapacitors chemical batteries solar cells fuel cells environmental adsorbents sensors biosensors tissue engineering antibacterial materials electromagnetic interference shielding and sharp memory materials are introduced and discussed in detail . It is expected this comprehensive review will not only help the readers to obtain the preliminary information on the production modification and applications of CNFs but also promote the design and synthesis of novel CNF based nanostructures and nanomaterials for advanced applications .
