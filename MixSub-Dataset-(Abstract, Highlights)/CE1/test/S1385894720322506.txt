 Sulfamethazine taken as model compound have been exposed to a photocatalytic system driven by ultraviolet light irradiation with Fe and three carboxylic acids . The kinetic experiments quenching experiments electron paramagnetic resonance species model theoretical calculation density functional theory and intermediates analyses were conducted to analyze the formation of reactive oxygen species and underlying mechanism of Fe carboxylate complexes on photocatalytic degradation of SMT . The results indicated the complexes easily induced the degradation under UV irradiation . Enough hydroxyl radicals

@highlight The photolysis was highly induced by Fe III with citric tartaric or malic acid.
@highlight The SMT couldnt influence the complexation between Fe III and three carboxylate.
@highlight The species of OH played a significant role in the photocatalytic degradation of SMT.
@highlight An interaction among ROS Fe III carboxylate complexes and SMT was first proposed.
@highlight Four degradation pathways were presented based on identified products by UPLC QTOF MS.
