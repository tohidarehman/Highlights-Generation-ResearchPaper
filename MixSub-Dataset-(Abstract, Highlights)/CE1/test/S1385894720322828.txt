 Complete oxidation of volatile organic compounds with high energy efficiency remains a challenge in post plasma catalysis due to insufficient adsorption towards gas and relatively low catalytic activity at room temperature . Three dimensional hollow urchin MnO

@highlight Hollow urchin catalyst is assembled by well defined MnO
@highlight nanorods.
@highlight Hierarchical hollow urchin enlarges surface area and facilitates gas adsorption.
@highlight Oxygen vacancy density and low temperature reducibility are improved.
@highlight Superior ozone conversion capacity is endowed by the unique nanoarchitecture.
@highlight Efficient toluene decomposition with high energy efficiency is achieved.
