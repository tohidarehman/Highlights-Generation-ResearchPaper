 Photocatalysis assist transition of uranium from soluble ions to insoluble nanoparticles is benefit for the extraction of uranium but has been rarely realized under air atmosphere . Here we developed a novel graphene aerogel GA 200 for the photocatalytic removal of uranium from water under visible light and air atmosphere for the first time . By controlling the reduction degree GA 200 remained numbers of functional groups for anchoring uranium and possessed high photocurrent response and narrow band gap to generate and transfer electrons holes readily . Under visible light irradiation neutral UO

@highlight Graphene aerogel GA is synthesized with the controlled reduction degree.
@highlight GA photocatalyst can remove uranium under visible light and air atmosphere.
@highlight The photochemistry property of uranyl was essential during the photocatalytic process.
@highlight The UO
@highlight  O
@highlight 2H
@highlight O products are obtained in air instead of UO
@highlight in oxygen free atmosphere.
@highlight The removal capacity is 1050mg g due to the in situ regeneration of activity sites.
