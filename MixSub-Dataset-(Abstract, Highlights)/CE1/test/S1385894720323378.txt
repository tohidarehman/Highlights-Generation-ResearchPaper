 A low loading microporous boron based intumescent macrocycle flame retardant was prepared and incorporated into PLA to reduce its flammability improve the mechanical properties and enhance its ultraviolet protection . Fourier transform infrared spectrum scanning electron microscope Raman spectroscopy and N

@highlight A low loading intumescent microporous boron based macrocycle flame retardant was successfully synthesized.
@highlight A UL 94V 0 rating with an LOI value of 31.5 was achieved in addition to low CO and smoke production.
@highlight The composites attained excellent UPF rating compared to pristine PLA.
@highlight The tensile strength and the Youngs Modulus were enhanced by topological interlock mechanism.
