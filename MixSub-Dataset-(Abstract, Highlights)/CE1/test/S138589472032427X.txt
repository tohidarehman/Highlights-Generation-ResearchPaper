 A spray coating based on an adsorbent polyvinyl alcohol borax complex was developed to remove radioactive cesium from surfaces by adsorption for wide area surface decontamination . Two aqueous solutions of borax and PVA containing adsorbents namely Prussian blue bentonite and sulfur zeolite were simultaneously sprayed on surfaces which subsequently self generated a gel like coating via a borate diol ester bond between borax and PVA . The spray coating adhered adequately to vertical surfaces for at least 1h due to its good viscoelasticity and displayed

@highlight A new spray coating was developed for wide area surface decontamination.
@highlight This spray coating was composed of low cost polyvinyl alcohol borax and an adsorbent.
@highlight The Cs adsorbent with a high K
@highlight is the main driving force for
@highlight Cs removal from the surface.
@highlight The used coating could be easily removed from the surface by simply rinsing with water.
@highlight Filtration was used to separate the used adsorbent for a subsequent direct solidification procedure.
