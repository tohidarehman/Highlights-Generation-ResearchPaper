 Superomniphobicity repelling both water and organic liquids is an important feature of special wettability material which has received great attention in surface interface area . The bottleneck in the real application is how to develop robust superomniphobic surface by using cost effective scalable facile materials and methods . Here we report a superomniphobic coating by using low cost and scalable spraying suspensions method . The sprayed superomniphobic coating assembles into multi leveled micro nanostructures with very low apparent surface free energy of 12.98 mN m

@highlight The superomniphobic coating was fabricated by scalable spraying suspensions method.
@highlight The coating enables organic liquids bouncing with low surface tension of 21 mN m
@highlight and high viscosity of 297.8mPas.
@highlight The effect of the viscosity and surface tension of organic liquid on the contact time is expored.
@highlight The coating demonstrates resistance to high pressure water impact 27.8ms
@highlight  and highly corrosive aqua regia.
