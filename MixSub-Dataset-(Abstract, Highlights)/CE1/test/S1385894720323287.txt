 Wettability of porous materials is crucial for the separation of emulsified oil water mixtures . Herein high hydrophobicity of polyvinylidene fluoride membrane has been facilely transformed to high hydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity via single step coating of plant derived epigallocatechin gallate and silver ion Ag

@highlight PVDF membrane was facilely modified via coating of EGCG and Ag
@highlight High membrane hydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity were achieved.
@highlight The membrane exhibited desired performance while treating oily emulsions.
@highlight The membrane possessed satisfactory antifouling property and stability.
