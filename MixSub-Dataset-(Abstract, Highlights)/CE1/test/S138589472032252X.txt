 The formation of high valent iron oxo species O Fe O is of vital importance in iron mediated advanced oxidation processes for the rapid removal of organic contaminants and it is mainly derived from the reduction of ferrate or the oxidation of homogeneous Fe . In this study we have shown Fe in the hematite surfaces under light illumination in the presence of sulfite can generate high valent iron oxo species that efficiently degrade refractory organics under alkaline conditions . Interactions between hematite and sulfite under xenon lamp irradiation in aqueous solution were investigated by combination of quenching experiments electron spin resonance high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometer and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques and a possible mechanism was proposed . Importantly this work demonstrates a novel and fundamental breakthrough toward the design synthesis and understanding of the high valent iron oxo species and also might provide potential applications in the treatment of alkaline wastewaters .

@highlight Fe III on hematite generates Fe IV V with sulfite at pH 9 under light illumination.
@highlight Sulfite increases Fe III electron density and induces its reaction with h
