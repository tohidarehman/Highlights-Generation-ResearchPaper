 In this work the degradation of hydroxychloroquine drug in aqueous solution by electrochemical advanced oxidation processes including electrochemical oxidation using boron doped diamond and its combination with UV irradiation and sonication was investigated . EO using BDD anode achieved the complete depletion of HCQ from aqueous solutions in regardless of HCQ concentration current density and initial pH value . The decay of HCQ was more rapid than total organic carbon indicating that the degradation of HCQ by EO using BDD anode involves successive steps leading to the formation of organic intermediates that end to mineralize . Furthermore the results demonstrated the release chloride Cl

@highlight Hydroxychloroquine HCQ has the potential to be a persistent pollutant in water.
@highlight Electrochemical oxidation with BDD anode EO degraded HCQ in all tested conditions.
@highlight EO led to the release of Cl
@highlight ions and conversion of organic nitrogen to NO
@highlight and NH
@highlight EO combined with UV light or ultrasound enhanced degradation kinetics and efficiency.
@highlight Due to higher production of oxidants EO combined with UV light used much less energy.
