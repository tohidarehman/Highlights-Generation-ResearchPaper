 Food waste reduction is fundamental for sustainable development and pursuing this goal recycling and the valorization of used cooking oil can play a major contribution . Although it has been traditionally used for biofuelproduction the oleochemical potential of UCOs is vast . UCOs can be used as feedstock for a large variety of value added green chemicals including plasticizers binders epoxides surfactants lubricants polymers biomaterials and different building blocks . Thus UCOtransformation into functional chemicals can bring long term stability to the supply chain avoiding the current dependence on commodity products . In this regard this work describes some of the potential benefits of using UCOs as feedstock in oleochemical biorefineries . In addition some of the most recent investigations on the valorization of UCOs other than biofuel are presented . Finally major challenges and future directions are discussed .
