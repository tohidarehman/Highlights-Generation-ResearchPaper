 Boosting the energy density of supercapacitors without sacrificing power density and lifespan requires ingenious electrode materials outfitting both sufficient assessable surface area and fast electrochemical reaction kinetics . Herein hierarchically porous core sheath nanoarchitecture was elaborately designed via a robust support coating strategy using a cellulose derived porous carbon aerogel as the conductive 3D skeleton to support a uniform coating of conjugated polyimide . The inner carbon aerogel skeleton ensures a fast electron transfer and the outer conjugated polyimide layer affords abundant micropores and sufficient active sites hence enriching the charge storage in such a porous core sheath nanoarchitecture . The as designed electrode was then applied to a redox electrolyte assisted supercapacitor with the KI doped H
