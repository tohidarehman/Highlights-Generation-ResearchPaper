 Partial nitritation and anammox is the most appropriate process for nitrogen removal from blackwater . However information on control strategies of PN of blackwater is scarce . In this study we selected aerobic duration control with pH and d

@highlight NAR reached 90 via aerobic duration control after two week start up.
@highlight Low DO had no considerable improvement on NAR but significantly decreased ARR.
@highlight pH control strategy has no problems of large noise and multiple values.
@highlight NAR decreased from 95.6 to 88.6 with temperature from 20C to 15C.
