 This study investigated the removal of Acetaminophen using biochars having different physicochemical characteristics . Biochars subjected to post pyrolysis heat treatment at 300C for different treatment times were used . The resulting biochars were characterized using FTIR and X ray diffraction spectroscopy . Experiments for ACT adsorption with different biochars loads 0.0 0.05 1 and 2gL

@highlight Role of biochar hydrophilicity in the removal of emerging contaminants investigated.
@highlight Changes to thermally treated biochar surfaces increased adsorption performance.
@highlight Thermal treatment resulted in changes to biochar surface and crystalline structure.
@highlight Rate limiting steps in removal process were adsorbate monolayer and chemisorption.
@highlight Anions in aqueous solution exert significant influence on the adsorption process.
