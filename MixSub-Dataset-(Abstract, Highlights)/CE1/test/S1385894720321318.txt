 Transformations of the molecular compositions of dissolved organic matter in incineration leachate were investigated . Results revealed that DOM in IL had a lower oxidation degree than that in mature MSW landfill leachate . Moreover aliphatic compounds having the highest bioavailability were the most abundant type of DOM in IL making IL significantly more biodegradable than LL . Under microbial actions etc . DOM composed of phenolic compounds 0.50 and H C 1.5 polyphenols and polycyclic aromatics in MBR treated effluents were enriched and more diverse than in the untreated leachates . Nanofiltration dramatically lowered the relative abundances of phenolic compounds polyphenols and polycyclic aromatics in effluent generated by treatment of IL in a MBR . Although the concentration of DOM in NF effluent was comparatively low the DOM compositions in the resulting NF concentrate were nearly identical to those in MBR effluent but were more complex than those in an international standard DOM due to a higher content of CHOS and CHONS heteroatomic compounds . Particularly coagulation in conjunction with ozone hydrogen peroxide oxidation process were dramatically reduced most polyphenols and polycyclic aromatics from the NF concentrate .
