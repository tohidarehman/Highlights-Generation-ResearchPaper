 Inherent nature of serious fire hazard including considerable heat and toxicants releases have definitely compromised the extensive usage of epoxy resin . In this investigation a three dimensional ternary structure based on SnO

@highlight A 3D ternary structure of NSG P SnO
@highlight is rationally designed.
@highlight Remarkable enhancement in polymer fire safety is achieved by adding NSG P SnO
@highlight The flame retardancy comparison with reported work affirms the superiority of NSG P SnO
@highlight Obviously improved mechanical performance is also observed.
