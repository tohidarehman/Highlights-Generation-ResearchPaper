 To determine the effects of surface chemistry and the pore structure of shale on water vapor adsorption behavior water vapor isothermal adsorption experiments were performed with untreated and 15wt H

@highlight The changes in pore structure components and surface chemistry of shale when treated with 15wt H
@highlight were analysed.
@highlight The impact of surface chemistry and pore structure of shale on water vapor adsorption was experimentally investigated.
@highlight Water vapor adsorption behavior of Longmaxi Formation over mature shale was fitted via Dent s model.
