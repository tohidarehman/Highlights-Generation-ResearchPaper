 The low room temperature ionic conductivity narrow voltage window and poor thermal stability of solid polymer electrolyte hinder the application of high energy density safer solid state lithium batteries . Hence we developed a novel composite solid polymer electrolyte with high room temperature ionic conductivity 2.410

@highlight Free standing flexible composite solid electrolytes are successfully prepared.
@highlight Composite electrolyte shows superior electrochemical mechanical and thermal properties.
@highlight Solid LiFePO
@highlight  Li cell exhibits excellent cycling stability and rate performance.
@highlight Thermal safety of an entire solid Li battery was
@highlight quantitative studied.
