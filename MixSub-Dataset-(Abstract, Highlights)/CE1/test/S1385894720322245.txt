 Outdoor sports or combat missions such as jungle adventures or counter piracy operations often involve bleeding and infected wounds . Due to the poor and limited medical conditions in these outdoor situations patients prefer an easy way to simultaneously treat blood loss and wound infection by using the same outdoor device and the same material . In this study a portable electrospinning device for outdoor use was developed and CuS composite nanofibers could be green synthesized by this portable electrospinning device . These CuS composite nanofibers can be deposited

@highlight A light small in size and portable electrospinning device for outdoor use.
@highlight Green synthesis of CuS composite nanofiber and directly deposited on the skin.
@highlight electrospinning shows superior adhesion thus better therapeutic effect.
@highlight Simultaneous achieving hemostasis and ablating superbug with same nanofibers.
