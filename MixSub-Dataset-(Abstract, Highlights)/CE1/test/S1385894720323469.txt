 Polymer based thermal conductive composites with both excellent thermal and mechanical properties are highly desirable in the thermal management of modern microelectronic industry . However the enhancement efficiency for fillers loaded polymer composite is actually lower than the theoretically predicted value . The significant reasons could be due to the restriction of interfacial thermal resistance at filler polymer matrix interfaces as well as the thermal conductive orientation dependence of anisotropic fillers . In the present study solid state shear milling S
