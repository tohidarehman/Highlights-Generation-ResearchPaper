 With increasing demand for wearable electronics highly sensitive and flexible piezoresistive sensors have received increasing attention . As an important component structural materials with high compressibility and electrical conductivity are a powerful impetus for the development of PRS . Since the structural deformation occurred during high temperature carbonization makes many three dimensional porous structures made from low cost biomass unsuitable for fabricating flexible PRS we propose a convenient carbonization free route to prepare PRS devices based on natural plant fibers . By developing and using a water based conductive ink the surface modification and assembly of plant fibers can be integrated into a one pot foaming process to generate ink modified plant fiber sponges
