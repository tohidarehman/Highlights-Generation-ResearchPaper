 The adsorption of metronidazole and trimethoprim antibiotics from water on nanomaterials synthesized from graphene oxide and graphite was examined thoroughly . The effect of the physicochemical properties and surface area onto the adsorption capacity of the nanomaterials was studied in detail . The nanocarbon materials used were graphene oxide and GO reduced in inert medium or ammonia and four high surface area graphites . The nanomaterials characterization was performed by transmission and scanning electron microscopy N

@highlight Metronidazole MNZ and trimethoprim TMP were adsorbed on nanocarbon materials.
@highlight Four nanocarbon materials were commercial high surface area graphite.
@highlight Three nanocarbons were synthesized from graphene oxide GO and reduced GO.
@highlight Except for GO the nanomaterials adsorption capacity increased with surface area.
@highlight Adsorption of MNZ and TMP was predominantly due to dispersive interactions.
