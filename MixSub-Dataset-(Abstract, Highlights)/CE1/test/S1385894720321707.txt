 Recently lithiumsulfur batteries have been demonstrated as promising next generation energy storage devices . However their practical application is hindered by poor cycling performance and rate capability . In this study we prepared a multifunctional interlayer composed of SnO

@highlight Functional SnO
@highlight nanowires were synthesized on carbon paper through facile CVD method.
@highlight SnO
@highlight  nanowires carbon composite interlayer can suppress the shuttling of polysulfides.
@highlight SnO
@highlight nanowires carbon composite enhanced electrochemical reaction kinetics.
@highlight Functional interlayer enhanced performance of high energy density LiS batteries.
