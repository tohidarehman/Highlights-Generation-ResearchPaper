 Herein we reported a facile tactics for the fabrication of Ni nanoparticles embedded carbon aerogels via water induced self assembly of Ni MOFs and followed by pyrolysis carbonization under nitrogen atmosphere . The water induced assembly mechanism of Ni MOF hydrogel was investigated by adjusting the ratio of water ethanol and molecular dynamics simulation . Utilizing the nanofibers with hierarchical porous structures the Ni C aerogels with low density 27.9mg cm

@highlight Ni C aerogels were developed via assembly of Ni MOFs with pyrolysis carbonization.
@highlight Assembly mechanism of Ni MOF was studied by adjusting the ratio of water ethanol.
