 Ultrathin two dimensional materials are receiving great attention in recent years and search for new ultrathin materials is continued after the isolation of the graphene . The 2D materials have displayed a wide range of different extraordinary properties that considered groundbreaking for various fields . Borophene is another magical 2D material addition to the family of ultrathin materials . Theoretically explained borophene has come into realism after the successful synthesis of 2D triangular structure on the Ag substrates in 2015 . Unlike boron the borophene has displayed a high metallic character . Borophene is a great conductor of heat and electricity . Borophene has exhibited high anisotropy and great flexibility . Most of the work on borophene is still theoretical and very little experimental work is observed . This review provided the current status of borophene synthesis and applications . Borophene is extensively being explored in the field of gas storage batteries catalysis and sensors . It can help to achieve powerful high performance batteries by serving as an electrode material and it has an excellent capacity to sense various toxic gases . It is predicted that borophene has a powerful capacity to store hydrogen fuel and act as a catalyst . In the coming years the rapid surge in the borophene research to experimentally utilize its catalytic electronic and mechanical features is anticipated .
