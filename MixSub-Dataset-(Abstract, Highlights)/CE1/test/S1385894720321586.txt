 Hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass especially that of high moisture such as microalgae macroalgae sludge manure and food waste for the production of bio oil has been widely concerned worldwide . However the contents of nitrogen in these biomasses are commonly high and 2040 of the N in the raw biomasses would distribute into bio oil during the HTL process resulting in a high content of N in bio oil sometimes up to 10wt . The combustion of N rich bio oil will probably induce massive emission of nitrogen oxides . The transformation behavior of N has not yet been fully understood and the denitrogenation is a critical issue during bio oil production and upgrading . This review comprehensively summarized the effects of the type composition and pretreatment of biomass and HTL processing parameters such as temperature residence time solid loading reaction solvent extraction solvent procedure and catalyst on the N content of bio oil . The N conversion mechanisms in the HTL process were also clarified . Research gaps were identified and future research directions were finally proposed to achieve the production of bio oil with low N content .

@highlight 2040 of the N in biomass feedstock would distribute into bio oil during the HTL.
@highlight Effects of biomass and HTL processing parameters on bio oil N were overviewed.
@highlight Pretreatment and co HTL of biomass are effective to mediate bio oil N.
@highlight High bio oil yield is accompanied by high bio oil N content.
@highlight Bio oil extraction solvent procedure are decisive to bio oil N.
