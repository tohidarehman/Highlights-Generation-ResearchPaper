 Circular economy and electronic waste are among today s hot topics for scientists environmentalists and even policymakers . A considerable fraction of e waste is waste printed circuit boards which contains a wide range of metals ceramics and polymers . This variety of substances has made the recycling of WPCB an interesting challenge . Recently there have been trends to not only recover WPCB into raw materials but also add extra value to final products by transforming the products into nanomaterials catalysts composites etc . In this article first a practical model for adding value through recycling processes is defined that is the valorization model . Second the recent studies that offered functional commodities extracted from WPCB with an average value higher than traditional recycling methods are reviewed and compared to conclude a future projection for WPCB valorization .

@highlight An eco efficient model for e waste management is presented.
@highlight This model focuses on WPCB and its recycling into value added products.
@highlight Recent trends on manufacturing of value added products from WPCB are reviewed.
@highlight Nanopowders catalysts composites and carbon based materials are the most common products.
