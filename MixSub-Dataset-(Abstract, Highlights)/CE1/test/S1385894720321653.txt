 Exploring the low cost and high efficient electrocatalysts with Pt like activity for alkaline hydrogen evolution through water splitting is imperative yet challenging . Herein a simple synthesis combined with electrodeposition and facile electro oxidation is developed to construct the hollow dendritic self supported electrode . X ray photoelectron spectroscopy X ray absorption fine structure and electron paramagnetic resonance reveal that the surface of HDSE contains the abundant NiO which is further decorated by fluorine doped and oxygen vacancies after electro oxidation process . The resultant HDSE achieves an excellent electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline condition leading to the extremely low overpotential of 13mV to drive a current density of 10mAcm
