 In this work electron withdrawing groups functionalized few layer graphitic carbon nitride nanosheet was prepared and utilized for photocatalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate . Experimental characterization and density functional theory calculation reveals that the electronic structure of FCN 12 is efficiently adjusted by forming an upward band bending as the functionalized carbonyl and carboxyl groups can withdraw the electron from the C N C skeleton . With the addition of PMS FCN 12 displays superb photocatalytic activity for chlortetracycline hydrochloride degradation where 83.4 CTC can be degraded within 120min under visible light irradiation much higher than that of bulk g C
