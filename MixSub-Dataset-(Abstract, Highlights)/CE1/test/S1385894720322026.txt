 The huge energy release and highly adjustable combustion characteristics of nanoporous silicon make it one of the most attractive inorganic energetic materials . However nPS will be oxidized slowly from its surface when it is left in ambient air to be aged . Explanations vary as to the aging mechanism and the corresponding anti ageing strategy remains to be fully investigated . The present study provides an efficient strategy of a thermal induced hydrosilylation to improve the long term chemical stability of H terminated nPS . The nPS of 75m in depth was etched with a pore diameter of 52.5nm and a gravimetry determined porosity of 79.6 . The DSC and FTIR data confirm that oxygen is able to infiltrate the H terminated layer and preferentially attack the weak Si Si over Si H bonds . The prime oxidizer is not sodium perchlorate but oxygen from the air to cause a backbond oxidation . After a modification the heat of reaction is determined to be 1436Jg
