 The bioaugmentation is crucial to improve the energy efficient process for anaerobic digestion of organic wastes at high ammonia levels . Genomic insights into the intricate microbial networks at a high ammonia level remain underexplored . The present study showed that the addition of

@highlight The bioaugmentation with

@highlight The volatile fatty acids were decreased by 10 compared to the period before bioaugmentation.
@highlight and
