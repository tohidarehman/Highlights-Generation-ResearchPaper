 Structuring MOF materials is a fundamental step towards their commercialization . Herein we report intensive characterization of 3D printed UTSA 16 monoliths facilitated by the development of a new non aqueous ink formulation employing hydroxypropyl cellulose and boehmite to adjust the rheology of the ink . What makes this formulation and printing process different from the printed adsorbents and catalysts published previously is that the resulting structures in this work were not sintered . The presence of the binder matrix not only produced the physical properties for printability but also ensured a homogeneous dispersion of UTSA 16 in the structures as well as gas adsorption characteristics . The monoliths were tested for the adsorption of different gases N
