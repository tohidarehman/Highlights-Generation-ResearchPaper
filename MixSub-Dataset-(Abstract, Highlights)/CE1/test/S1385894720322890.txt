 Ice accretion on airplane surfaces power lines or wind turbines can cause operational difficulties and disastrous events . Great efforts have been made to develop environmentally friendly anti icing or deicing surfaces over the last several decades but a high efficient robust and energy saving surface for both anti icing and deicing still remains a challenge . Herein a sunlight responsive and robust anti icing deicing coating is designed by integrating photothermogenic nanocarbon fibers with an amphiphilic material which is based on hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane and hydrophilic polyvinylpyrrolidone segments . The resultant coating represents an excellent and energy saving anti icing deicing performance a 34 fold increase of freezing delay time compared with control steel and 18KPa of ice adhesion strength enabling easy removal by a natural wind action attributable to the intrinsic material properties . Moreover nanocarbon fibers can further reduce the ice adhesion strength and endow the coating with a rapidly sunlight sensitive photothermal deicing performance presenting the superiority of outdoor applications especially for high altitude equipment and vehicles . After 30 icing deicing cycle simulated acid rain scouring sand dropping and 200 abrasion cycle tests this coating also exhibits an extraordinary durability and robustness . This work makes a promising anti icing and deicing coating for a large scale operation and practical applications in particular outdoors .
