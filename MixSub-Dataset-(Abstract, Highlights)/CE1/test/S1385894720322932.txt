 Pharmaceutical wastewater has become a severe tremendous threaten to ecological environment and human health . Semiconductor photocatalysts have emerged as potential candidates for degrading pharmaceutical pollutants . Construction of highly efficient stable and recyclable Z scheme photocatalysts that are superior to individual constituents or widely studied heterojunction photocatalysts is very fascinating yet challenging . Herein we report an efficient stable and recyclable visible light driven Bi
