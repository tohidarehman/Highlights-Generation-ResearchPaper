 Over the past extensive works executed to treat anionic and cationic heavy metal ions from wastewater . Although very few adsorbents were developed to adsorb anionic and cationic heavy metal ions from the same system . In this study we explored the pH tunable complete reduction plus adsorption mechanism of Pb

@highlight Pb
@highlight and Cr
@highlight were eliminated by
@highlight via pH tunable reduction plus adsorption mechanisms.
@highlight Adsorption of Pb
@highlight optimized at pH 5.5 and reduction coupled adsorption of Cr
@highlight enhanced at pH 3.
@highlight Various techniques and models were employed to understand the adsorption mechanisms.
@highlight Pb
@highlight and Cr species were adsorbed on
@highlight with the aid of the CS
@highlight and NH functional groups.
@highlight Adsorption mathematical models were applied for
@highlight fixed bed columns to predict industrial applicability.
