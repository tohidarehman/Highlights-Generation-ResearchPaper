 Among the major challenges of the century reducing the world s dependence on fossil fuels is the most important . In this context several approaches have been considered including the production of lignocellulosic ethanol or second generation bioethanol . After this preprocessing second generation bioethanol is produced using a process involving four primary steps . Different processes of hydrolysis and fermentation are highlighted and then technology trends and barriers to industrial development are commented .

@highlight Lignocellulosic ethanol has received increasing attention because of the depletion of fossil resources.
@highlight Lignocellulosic ethanol can be produced in four main stages with hydrolysis and fermentation steps that can be simultaneous.
@highlight An overview of lignocellulosic ethanol production is summarized.
