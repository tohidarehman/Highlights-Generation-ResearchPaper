 Recently green chemistry for the development of sustainable production systems requires tremendous research efforts on the design of catalysts through resource efficient ways . The improvement of their catalytic performances is a key goal in modern society . Several approaches using environmentally friendly chemicals and materials for less hazardous synthesis and catalysis were analyzed . In this review we focus on the synthesis of nanomaterials and catalytic applications to reduce the environmental impact especially by reducing waste solvents precursors and derivatives . In addition we highlight the special efforts towardthe use of renewable feedstocks and their applications as well as the synthetic routes to develop nanocatalysts using a greener chemistry .

@highlight Green and sustainable nanomaterials strategies were analyzed.
@highlight Solvent free routes were explored for high surface area nanomaterials.
@highlight Sustainable approaches in 2D nanomaterialsynthesis were studied.
@highlight Green chemistry was effective for nanoparticlesynthesis using extracts.
@highlight Nanocatalysts were discussed for renewable feedstock applications.
