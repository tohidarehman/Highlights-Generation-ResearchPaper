 The design and synthesis of high performance materials for the recovery of gold are of paramount importance to alleviate its high consumption and protect the environment . Herein three different ratios biosorbents CS MoS

@highlight Different mass ratios chitosan MoS
@highlight biosorbents used for the first time to recover gold ions from solution.
@highlight CS MoS
@highlight complex exhibited ultrahigh sorption capacity up to 3108.79mg g only in 300min.
@highlight The three biosorbents possess superior selectivity and reusability.
@highlight Adsorption mechanism of CS MoS
@highlight  1 2 3 for Au III is electrostatic attraction and complexation.
