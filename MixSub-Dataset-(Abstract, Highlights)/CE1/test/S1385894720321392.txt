 Oxytetracycline fermentation residue can be managed by bioprocesses to recycle organic substances . However the organic materials present are resistant to biodegradation due to protection by the OFR matrix structure and the high levels of residual oxytetracycline have unavoidably negative impacts on microorganisms in bioprocesses and result in the poor biodegradability of OFR . Hydrothermal treatment is promising for processing OFR to improve its biodegradability but there is still insufficient practical experience with HT of OFR . To explore the applicability of employing HT as a pretreatment to improve the biodegradability of OFR HT processes at temperatures varying from 90C to 180C were performed on OFR to disintegrate its matrix and inactivate the high levels of residual oxytetracycline . The results demonstrated that performing HT clearly enhanced the production of hydrophilic matter including soluble chemical oxygen demand soluble carbohydrates and soluble proteins . Nevertheless the drawbacks of HT for degrading soluble organics and mineralizing total organics were clearly observed at 180C . Efficient destruction of the OFR matrix structure was speculated based on the release of carbohydrates and proteins and was visually confirmed by photomicrographs and scanning electron microscopy graphs . The disappearance of oxytetracycline fit a pseudo first order kinetics model and the toxic intermediates of oxytetracycline including 4 epi oxytetracycline

@highlight HT significantly destroyed OFR matrix structure and produced hydrophilic matters.
@highlight The high levels of residual oxytetracycline were almost completely removed by HT.
@highlight The antibacterial activity was reduced to a negligible level after HT.
@highlight It is feasible to improve the biodegradability of OFR by HT.
