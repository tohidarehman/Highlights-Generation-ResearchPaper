 Polymer electrolyte is favored in battery research because of its good flexibility light weight and preferable interfacial contact . However the development of which is hindered by the low ionic conductivity at room temperature . Herein a flexible PPEGMA based gel polymer electrolyte was prepared via in situ thermal cured technique plasticized by nonflammable triethyl phosphate and supported by glass fiber . The optimized flame retardant electrolyte PGT32 5 exhibits a high ionic conductivity 0.91 mS cm
