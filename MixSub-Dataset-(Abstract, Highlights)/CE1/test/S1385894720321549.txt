 Features of rapid loss and inadequate bone mass of alveolar bone after teeth extraction are still great obstacles for a successful subsequential dental implantation . MicroRNA based therapy though an advantageous strategy in tissue regeneration is still not available for alveolar bone due to the unique complicated oral environment which is full of enzymes and electrolytes . In this paper a microRNA activated scaffold constituted of microRNA 21 nanoparticles combined with porous Bio Oss particles was designed for the use of accelerating the early stage healing of the alveolar bone . It was noteworthy that the regeneration of alveolar bone was rapidly promoted to be shortened from the ordinary 3months to 2weeks . The nanoparticles designed by us according to the oral environment could protect microRNA from various enzymes and electrolytes attack leading to a steady continuous and efficient delivery of gene . With the aid of porous Bio Oss microRNA 21 released

@highlight A system of miR 21 nanoparticles loaded on a Bio Oss scaffold is constructed.
@highlight The system greatly reduces the recovery time of alveolar bone from 2months to 2weeks.
@highlight The special nanoparticle vector protects gene from invalidity in complicated oral environment.
@highlight The vector enables effective miRNAs delivery thus realizing gene therapy on alveolar bone.
@highlight MiR 21 is demonstrated for the first time to promote early healing of alveolar bone.
