 Hydroxylated fullerene Fullerol has applied in many areas because of its high electron affinity and antioxidant potential while it was few used in wastewater treatment . In this study the mechanism involved that Fullerol accelerated the regeneration of Fe in the Fe H

@highlight Fullerol obviously enhances Fe III H
@highlight system to degrade CAP under dark condition.
@highlight OH plays a main role in Fullerol Fe III H
@highlight system.
@highlight Fullerol accelerates Fe III Fe II cycles by two non photochemical pathways.
@highlight Fullerol complex with Fe III and decrease the redox potential of Fe III Fe II .
@highlight Fullerol reduces Fe III directly because of its high electron affinity.
