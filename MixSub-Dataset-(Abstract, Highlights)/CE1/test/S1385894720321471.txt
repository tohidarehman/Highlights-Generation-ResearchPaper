 A mechanistic and phenomenological model for multi component cation exchange has been applied in order to describe the dynamic behavior of barium removal by seaweeds in batch and fixed bed systems instead of the empirical models usually applied . Initially four macroalgae were tested as natural cation exchangers for barium removal

@highlight Mathematical multi component model for ion exchange considering a stagnated film.
@highlight Brown algae are a natural cation exchanger with a Ba
@highlight uptake capacity of 1.7mEq g.
@highlight showed a useful capacity of 1.85mEq Ba g 237 BV .
@highlight A model based on the mass action law fitted well the ion exchange equilibrium.
@highlight Elution using 5 BV of 1M HCl as eluent was fast and close to 100 effectiveness.
