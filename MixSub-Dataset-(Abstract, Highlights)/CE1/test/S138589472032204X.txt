 It is extremely challenging to achieve a high volumetric energydensity lithium sulfur batteries for sulfur carbon cathodes due to their low volumetric density and many invalid pores .

@highlight A dense sulfur monolith cathode with high conductivity was fabricated.
@highlight Dense sulfur monolith cathode gives a high volumetric energy density of 2067 Wh L.
@highlight High areal capacity of 4.92 mAh cm
@highlight was obtained in lean electrolyte of 4.2L mg
@highlight Dense structure plus ultrafine sulfur immobilizers achieve high volumetric energy density Li S batteries.
