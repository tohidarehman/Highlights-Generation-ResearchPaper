 One of the most urgent concerns for supported catalysts is to enhance their thermal stability against sintering upon high temperatures . In this work we decorated the rough surface of TiO

@highlight The surface uniformity of substrate was optimized toward sinter resistant catalyst.
@highlight TiO
@highlight nanofibers were decorated with well defined rutile nanorods as substrate.
@highlight 3nm Pt NPs were stabilized under sinter promoting situations over 600C.
@highlight Pt NPs on the nanorods decorated TiO
@highlight nanofibers were active for soot oxidation.
