 The possibility of enhancing the electrochemical activity of multilayer graphene films formed by a simple drop casting method by the inclusion of a moderate amount of boron doped diamond powder into the immobilized active material was investigated . Raman spectroscopy experiments suggested that for electrodes covered with GR BDDP edge planes of the graphene platelets are better exposed compared to the case of the GR modified ones . Cyclic voltammetry measurements performed by using an outer sphere redox system as test compound demonstrated that BDDP addition results in an apparent electrocatalytic effect which was ascribed to a larger fraction of pores in the GR BDDP coating induced by its more loose morphological structure . The investigation of the methanol oxidation at the Pt decorated electrodes demonstrated that the use of a GR BDDP composite as support for the electrocatalyst facilitates the overall process allows lower Tafel slopes and provides to the supported platinum a better resistance to fouling

@highlight Boron doped diamond powder BDDP was embedded in a drop casted graphene GR layer.
@highlight The GR BDDP composite exhibits higher porosity and better electrochemical activity.
@highlight BDDP incorporation enables better exposure of graphene platelets edge planes.
@highlight At Pt GR BDDP methanol oxidation is facilitated and the CO tolerance is improved.
