 Fischer Tropsch synthesis may be a solution for converting volatile renewable energies into storable liquid fuel . Microstructured reactors have been proven to cope with varying operation conditions and are able to adapt to fluctuations in this circumstance . In this regard a suitable kinetic model for chemical synthesis is essential for the prediction of reactor and catalyst behavior . The assessment and description of the reactor and plant response during dynamic operation must also be considered to develop a control system for varying operating conditions . In this work a time resolved model for the description of relevant processes inside a pilot scale microstructured Fischer Tropsch reactor and the associated test rig including the product condensation stages is presented . A residence time distribution model describes flow and mixing behavior for all system components . Time and temperature dependent product concentration in the product traps is determined by vaporliquid equilibrium calculation . Phase equilibria models with ideal and real phase behavior assumptions are compared . A micro kinetic model was adapted with good agreement to a variety of experimental data . When coupled the overall model is able to predict time resolved product characteristics based on process conditions and feed only . This mathematical description may be of use for decentralized plants in the future .
