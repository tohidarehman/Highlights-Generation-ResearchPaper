 Herein in order to promote the scaled up manufacturing of efficient nanostructured electrocatalysts we pioneer a novel ultrafast wet chemistry engineering to turn bulk Co Ni foam into S activated hydroxide based nanosheets with short period less than six minutes . The uniform nanosheets morphology is in situ formed through designed nitro hydrochloric acid enhanced corrosion within 30s then the nanosheets are naturally oxidized to CoOOH Ni

@highlight Minute class ultrafast wet chemistry strategy to construct nanoarrays is proposed.
@highlight The wet chemistry method ensures the large scale preparation of electrocatalysts.
@highlight The CoNi OH S derived within 6min exhibits good electrocatalytic activities.
