 The development of nanothermites with adjustable reactivity has always been the research hotspot in the field of energetic materials and its key issue is to control the interfacial contact extent and diffusion length between fuel and oxidizer . Here the 3DOM CuO Al 3DOM CuO Al NPs and CuO NPs Al NPs nanothermites which show a gradual decrease in contact extents between reactants were firstly prepared simultaneously using magnetron sputtering P4VP self assembly and ultrasonic mixing respectively . The DSC thermograms show that the heat release of the 3DOM CuO Al can reach 2541.4J g much larger than either value of the prepared 3DOM CuO Al NPs and CuO NPs Al NPs . The activation energies of these CuO Al systems also exhibit the similar results as the heat releases . However the 3DOM CuO Al NPs can lead to the highest combustion pressure the shortest pressure rise time and the fastest pressurization rate followed orderly in corresponding values by the CuO NPs Al NPs and 3DOM CuO Al . All data indicate that the contact extent between CuO and Al plays a great effect on the overall reactivity and their differences in structure and volume are responsible for the diverse combustion pressure performance . Furthermore the presence of reaction voids between components can promote the O diffusion to enhance the continuous mass and heat transfer for an efficacious reaction . Hence it is believed that similar methods can be used to improve the contact extent and diffusion length between fuels and oxidants so as to achieve an adjustment in reactivity for various nanothermites .
