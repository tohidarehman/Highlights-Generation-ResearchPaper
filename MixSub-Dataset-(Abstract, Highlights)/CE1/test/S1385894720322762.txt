 Owing to the less energy consumption positive impact on the environment and prospect of providing clean water resources anion exchange membranes are promising materials for acid recovery from various industrial wastewater effluent . Based on the diffusion dialysis process AEMs selectively allow rapid proton permeation while efficiently retaining metal ions . To enhance the efficiency of the acid recovery process precise control of macromolecular architecture and chemical composition that enables high hydrophilicity proton conductivity through the membrane and ion exchange capacity is required . In this direction we report on the one step fabrication of novel poly based AEMs by the free radical polymerization of 1 butyl 3 vinyl imidazolium bromide acrylic acid styrene and acrylonitrile under sunlight . The effect of monomer composition in an AEM matrix on the structural physicochemical surface thermal and proton conductivity is investigated . The experimentally determined acid dialysis coefficient
