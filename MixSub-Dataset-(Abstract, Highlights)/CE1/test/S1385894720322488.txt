 Metal halide perovskites nanocrystals are emerging as competitive alternatives for semiconductor NCs in the fields of consumer optoelectronic devices however boosting their long term stability still needs extensive study . Encapsulation of perovskite NCs with polymer becomes a promising strategy yet the dielectric screening effect on the excitons of perovskites from the polymer matrix has seldom been considered . Here we demonstrated this effect in high permittivity poly encapsulated CsPbBr

@highlight nonuniform growth mechanism of CPB crystals in PVDF is revealed.
@highlight Dielectric screening effect enables an exceptional long fluorescence lifetime up to
@highlight  731ns.
@highlight Comprehensive physical properties with respect to microstructures are fully discussed.
@highlight A wLED device was assembled generating saturated and bright white emission.
