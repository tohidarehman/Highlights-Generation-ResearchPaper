 Over the last few decades the application of photocatalysis for mineralizing persistent organic pollutants and other new emerging contaminants has gained increasing research and industry attention . However the integration of catalyst fabrication and reactor design has not yet been realized for photocatalytic water decontamination applications . Herein we present for the first time a facile scalable and eco friendly strategy for the direct synthesis and integration of hairy

@highlight Scalable and holistic strategy for synthesizing hairy ZnO based photocatalysts is proposed.
@highlight Integration of ZnO based immobilized photocatalysts in continuous flow tubular type reactor.
@highlight Excellent UV filtered continuous mineralization of persistent organic pollutants.
@highlight heterostructure improved UV filtered light absorption and photocorrosion resistance.
@highlight Recyclability of photocatalysts and system are also discussed.
