 Interface engineering is a very important issue in achieving high efficiency in heterojunction photocatalysts . Herein we report an originally designed heterojunction photocatalyst with seamless contact . Its novelty includes the following two respects two Fe based oxides i.e . SnFe

@highlight The micro octahedrons SnFe
@highlight  Fe
@highlight heterostructure was fabricated by an in situ reaction.
@highlight The heterostructure significantly enhanced the photoreduction of CO
@highlight The intimate contact was found between SnFe
@highlight and Fe
@highlight Z scheme charge transfer and close contact interface are supposed to explain the excellent performance of the heterojunction.
