 Efficient separation and transport of charge is a critical issue in solar driven water oxidation . Herein we developed a novel facile controllable method based on zero valent iron reduction to in situ and synchronous generate oxygen vacancies O

@highlight In situ and synchronous generation of O
@highlight and FeO
@highlight is achieved by facile ZVI reduction.
@highlight Ultrafast electron transfer is due to the reducing of trap assisted recombination.
@highlight Ultrathin FeO
@highlight layers provide more sites and dramatically accelerate OER kinetics.
@highlight BiVO
@highlight  O
@highlight  FeO
@highlight exhibits excellent performance in the PEC water oxidation.
