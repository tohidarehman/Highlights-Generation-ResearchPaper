 Antimony and copper pollution pose significant threat to water quality security and their advanced treatment is still a great challenge . In this study we fabricated a hybrid adsorbent through dispersing manganese oxide inside a biochar with enlarged pore structure . The used carrier L BC possessed a high proportion of large pores and thus lowered the diffusion resistance of target pollutants in pore region of MO L BC . Consequently Sb and Cu adsorption onto MO L BC achieved equilibrium within 15min and their effective coefficients of intra particle diffusion were calculated to be 8.610

@highlight MO L BC was fabricated using a biochar with enlarged pore structure as the carrier.
@highlight Sb III and Cu II adsorption on MO L BC can achieve equilibria within 15min.
@highlight Oxidation of the sorbed Sb III to Sb V caused by the loaded MO was identified.
@highlight MO L BC can effectively treat synthetic wastewater in high flow column settings.
