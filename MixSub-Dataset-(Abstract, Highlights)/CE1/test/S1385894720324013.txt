 Persistent excessive inflammation and oxidative stress are main causes for the impaired wound healing in diabetic patient . To reduce the excessive reactive oxygen species and inflammatory response of wound in acute inflammatory phase is a key strategy for diabetic wound healing . In this work a kind of metal organic frameworks with curcumin as ligand and Zn

@highlight Curcumin was encapsulated into zeolitic imidazolate frameworks through drug eutectic.
@highlight The drug loading efficiency stability and bioavailability of curcumin was greatly improved by the as prepared
@highlight The hierarchical micro nanofibrous scaffolds release curcumin and zinc ions on demand during the stage of wound healing.
@highlight The as prepared scaffolds exhibited an outstanding anti inflammatory anti oxidant and promoting the diabetic wound healing.
