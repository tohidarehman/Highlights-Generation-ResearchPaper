 As a prominent member of two dimensional materials MXenes have shown encouraging photophysical properties and so there is highly desirability to explore their phototherapeutic potential in cancer . Herein we demonstrate a facile top down strategy for the synthesis of nitride based MXene titanium nitride quantum dots Ti

@highlight Ultrasmall biodegradable nitride MXene quantum dots Ti
@highlight N QDs are prepared.
@highlight Ti
@highlight N QDs exhibit excellent PA and PTT performance in both NIR I II biowindows.
@highlight Ti
@highlight N QDs show appropriate degradation rate and excretion rate from the body.
@highlight The prepared QDs are promising for precision cancer treatment.
