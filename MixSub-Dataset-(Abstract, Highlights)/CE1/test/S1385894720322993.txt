 Although biochar is widely recognized as a multifunctional material developing high performance carbon materials from biochar for both energy and environmental applications remains challenging . In this work torreya grandis inner shell a widespread lignocellulosic biomass waste was used to synthesize hierarchically porous carbon materials via a designed carbonization activation approach . The prepared biochar exhibited excellent energy storage performance in 1M Na
