 In this study N doped bamboo like carbon nanotubes encapsulated with Fe nanoparticles on the surface of soybean dregs derived biochar

@highlight N doped bamboo like CNTs containing Fe nanoparticles 
@highlight  were synthesized.
@highlight in situ grown on the surface of soybean dregs derived biochar 
@highlight BC .
@highlight BC exhibited a superior catalytic performance for PS.
@highlight Singlet oxygen
@highlight  was the dominant ROS during the degradation process.
@highlight Both radical and nonradical mechanisms were involved in the
@highlight BC PS system.
