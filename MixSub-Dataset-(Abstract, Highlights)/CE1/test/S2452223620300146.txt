 Traditionally rural areas are locations where food and feed are predominantly produced . Nowadays farmers are also converting biogenic resources such as biomass and biowaste into bioenergy which creates an additional income . The biologization of the economy relies not only on food feed or bioenergy productionbut also on a holistic use of the potential of biogenic resources . It remains however to be shown whether rural areas also properly materially use biogenic resources which requires special knowledge in pretreatment conversion and downstreaming to obtain pure products of choice and create high value . This contribution sheds light on the chances and challenges foodfeedmaterialfuel competition coming along with the biologization of the economy of rural areas .
