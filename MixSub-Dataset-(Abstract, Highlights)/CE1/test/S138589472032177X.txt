 Host development is crucial and challenging for thermally activated delayed fluorescence organic light emitting diodes which requires accurate modulation of host dopant energy transfer and host dopant dopant quenching . Here we demonstrate that phosphine oxide groups can be used to simultaneously facilitate carrier transport positive energy transfer and quenching suppression . Two diphenylphosphine oxide groups at carbazole and N phenyl of 3 6 di
