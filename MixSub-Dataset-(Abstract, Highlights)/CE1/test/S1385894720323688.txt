 Aerogels with low density high porosity and exceptional mechanical properties have attracted great interest as adsorbents . Preparing bio based aerogels with high porosity and outstanding mechanical performance via a facile and green strategy is in a growing demand . In this paper an effective approach was put forward to prepare porous lightweight bio aerogels by introducing extensive microbubbles during gelation of gelatin which not only endows aerogels with abundant and interconnected pores to ensure the low density and high adsorption capability but also improves the elastic resilience and fatigue resistance of the formed aerogels . In addition after further going through silylation treatment the hydrophobically modified porous aerogels maintain the good mechanical stability and efficiently collect oils organic solvents from water . Considering the low cost greenness of the preparation process and high performance of the prepared aerogels this approach holds a promising potential in preparing porous bio based aerogels with excellent mechanical properties for controlling environmental pollution caused by petroleum products and toxic organic solvents .

@highlight Lightweight bio aerogels with interconnected pores were prepared in a facile way.
@highlight The introducing of microbubbles apparently improves the mechanical performances.
@highlight The adsorption capacity of the MGS aerogels for oils could be up to 68130g g.
@highlight The further modified MGS aerogels can selectively collect oils from water.
@highlight Offering a way for preparing porous bio aerogels with good mechanical properties.
