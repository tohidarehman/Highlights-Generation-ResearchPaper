 Bioethanol and biodiesel are the most important biofuels worldwide . Although the production processes of these two biofuels are well established there is still room for improvements . The integration of these two processes would allow the use of their wastes or by products for increasing productivity or generating additional products . This would make it possible to improve the economics and sustainability of both processes . This article presents an overview focusing on a soybean biodiesel plant integrated into a sugarcane biorefinery . The process integration was evaluated considering agricultural logistic geographic industrial process stream equipment administrative and commercial aspects . The integrated plant offers the opportunity for cost effective and environmentally friendly biofuels processing while expanding the portfolio of potential products .
