 Severe multidrug resistance has frequently compromised the therapeutic efficacy of one first line chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin . Here we report cocktail polyprodrug nanoparticles that can concurrently pump out nitric oxide and peroxynitrite ONOO

@highlight Cocktail polyprodrug of nitric oxide and cisplatin can reverse cisplatin resistance.
@highlight Highly cytotoxic peroxynitrite is specifically generated inside cancer cells.
@highlight Cocktail polyprodrug design is applicable for other diseases in precision medicine.
