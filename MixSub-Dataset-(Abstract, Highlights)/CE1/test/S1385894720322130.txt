 Preparations of catalysts for sulfate radicals based advanced oxidation are usually time consuming and costly . This study developed a short cut method for preparation of AOPs catalyst directly from electrolytic manganese slag . MS N3H PMS could effectively remove levofloxacin from solution . Phase transformation and active sites exposure after modifications facilitated the adsorption and catalysis capacities . Both radical and non radical pathway contributed to the degradation of LVF in which abundant Mn and Fe on MS N3H surface contributed to the generation of SO

@highlight This study developed a short cut method for preparation of AOPs catalyst.
@highlight Phase transformation and active sites exposure facilitated the removal capacities.
@highlight Pre adsorption was one of key steps to facilitate catalytic reaction.
@highlight Radical pathway played a dominant major role in LVF molecules decomposition.
