 Highly stable emulsified water in oil mixtures from industrial processes have severe impact on the environment . As their abundance is increasing worldwide the methods to effectively separate these emulsified wateroil mixtures have attracted significant interest in recent years . Herein a durable superhydrophobic cotton based material using poly 1 3 phenylene bisoxazoline and raw cotton was developed . The as prepared SCM possesses superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity . The SCM has excellent repellence not only toward pure water but also hot water and corrosive aqueous liquids . The superwetting composite also exhibits durable superhydrophobicity after long term immersion in organic solvents . Moreover after the compression process the superwetting material exhibits a remarkable oilwater separation performance . Very high permeation flux values of up to 10 400400Lm

@highlight Superhydrophobic cotton based materials SCM were prepared by a simple dipping method.
@highlight The SCM was stable under different chemical and physical tests keeping its superhydrophobicity.
@highlight The compressed SCM showed an outstanding performance for water in oil emulsion separation.
@highlight The flux is up to 867 500Lm
