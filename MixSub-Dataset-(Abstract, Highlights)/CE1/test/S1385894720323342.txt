 The friction and wear of amorphous diamond like carbon films will dramatically increase with the increment of ambient humidity . This drawback can lead to lubrication failure which greatly impedes the practical applications of DLC films in humid environment . Herein a simple method is proposed to improve the tribological performance of DLC films in humid environment by adding hexagonal boron nitride nanosheet wrapped carbon nanoparticles

@highlight Hexagonal boron nitride nanosheet wrapped carbon nanoparticles
