 Metal free carbon based polymer nanocomposite membranes were employed for the first time for activated persulfate oxidation in continuous mode of operation . For that purpose reduced graphene oxide doped with nitrogen by using melamine as source was included as catalytic active phase in a poly matrix . The performance of the resulting composite membrane was compared against that obtained with supported membranes prepared by simple filtration of rGO M into a PTFE substrate . The uniform distribution of rGO M within both the surface pores and cross sectional channels of the composite rGO M PVDF membrane was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy while its main structural features were studied by X ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy . The quite good performance of this composite membrane was demonstrated by the degradation of three fluoroquinolone antibiotics at ppb level in ultrapure water 100g L
