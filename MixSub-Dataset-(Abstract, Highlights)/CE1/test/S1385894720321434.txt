 The development of an economically viable solar thermochemical fuel production process relies largely on identifying redox active materials with optimized thermodynamic and kinetic properties . Iron aluminate FeAl

@highlight F1 kinetic model first order reaction describes CO
@highlight reduction by spinel aluminates.
@highlight Highest fuel production measured for FeAl
@highlight Highest reaction rate measured for Co
@highlight Fe
@highlight Al
@highlight Activation energy and pre exponential factor increase with increased cobalt content.
@highlight XPS shows Co doping of hercynite leads to metallic Fe Co at surface upon reduction.
