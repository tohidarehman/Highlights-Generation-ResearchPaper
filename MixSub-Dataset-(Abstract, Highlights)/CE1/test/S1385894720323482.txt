 Photocatalytic oxidation processes are a promising technology for controlling the pollution of working environments namely the low concentrations of volatile organic compounds generated in industrial processes and improving the efficiency of this process is an important issue . In this study the photocatalytic oxidation of gas phase benzene was carried out with TiO

@highlight Ti
@highlight self doped TiO
@highlight microsphere with sea urchin like structure was synthesized.
@highlight The Ti
@highlight self doping improved the activity for photocatalytic benzene oxidation.
@highlight The Ti
@highlight self doping suppressed the recombination of electrons hole separation.
@highlight The Ti
@highlight site on the TiO
@highlight surface suppressed the build up of byproducts.
