 Chlorobenzene is a typical chlorinated volatile organic compound and the degradation of chlorobenzene frequently produces high toxic byproducts such as dioxins in the treatment process . To prevent this complete oxidation of chlorobenzene into harmless CO

@highlight SO
@highlight was predominant in the initial oxidation of chlorobenzene CB in UV PDS.
@highlight HO
@highlight played important role in the formation of CO
@highlight during the oxidation of CB.
@highlight The synergetic effect of SO
@highlight  O
@highlight and HO
@highlight led to efficient mineralization of CB.
@highlight Highly toxic dimeric
@highlight None
@highlight products were produced in UV PDS in the absence of O
@highlight The oxidation pathway was proposed based on the intermediates and DFT calculation.
