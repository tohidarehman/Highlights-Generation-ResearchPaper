 Pillared interlayered clays are materials that show a two dimensional layered porous structure with properties that could be interesting alternatives to zeolites and other microporous solids . Some of the properties that make these materials interesting arespecific surface area high exchange capacity low permeability swelling ability relatively good heat resistance stability high acidic properties and relatively low price . PILCs have attracted intense research among several years in relation to the possible control of these properties and environmental applications . The current short work is devoted to the tendencies and new insights in to the last five years of PILCs as adsorbents and heterogeneous catalysts . The work finishes considering the future application prospects .

@highlight Pillared interlayered clays PILCs form a family of solids which are widely studied.
@highlight New applications of PILCs in environmental adsorption and catalysis are explored.
@highlight New preparation methods and uses of PILCs meet goals of circular economy.
@highlight A flourishing time in the application of PILCs is expected in next years.
