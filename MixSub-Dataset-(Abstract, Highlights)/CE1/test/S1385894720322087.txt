 While nanotechnology assisted cocktail therapy has emerged many advantages in anti cancer treatment significant challenges remain as regards efficiently and simultaneously loading two or more drugs with completely different physicochemical properties . The emergence of supramolecule offers an unprecedented opportunity to overcome this pharmaceutical bottleneck . Herein an engineered Janus cyclopeptide was designed to self assemble with hydrophilic miR 30C and hydrophobic carnosic acid into a supramolecular nanosphere 100nm in diameter termed iNanosphere that possessed excellent dimensional stability and satisfactory resistance against nuclease and peptidase . Moreover iNanosphere showed an integrin mediated cellular uptake followed by GSH triggered disassemble and release payloads . As expected iNanosphere
