 Rational design of efficient bifunctional air cathodes towards oxygen evolution reduction reaction is of central importance for energy efficient metal air batteries but remains an ongoing challenge . Here N element doped NiSe

@highlight The self supported cathode electrode can satisfy the flexibility for solid state zinc air batteries.
@highlight Nitrogen doping can optimize the electronic structure and absorption feature of NiSe
@highlight The open and porous structure provides more active sites and facilitates the mass transfer process.
@highlight N NiSe
@highlight  CC exhibits outstanding performance for oxygen evolution reduction reaction and zinc air batteries.
