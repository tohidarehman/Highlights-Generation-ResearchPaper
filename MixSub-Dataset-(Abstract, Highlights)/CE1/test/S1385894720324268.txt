 It is a very important task of searching for novel hole transporting materials along with effective building blocks on the way towards commercialization of the perovskite solar cells . 9 10 Dihydrophenanthrene is a rigid conjugated system whose skeleton is closely analogous to the widely used fluorene unit in developing HTMs . Herein for the first time DHP employed as a promising building block in the construction of HTMs for PSCs is presented . Two readily available DHP cored small molecules namely K DHP 1 and K DHP 2 were synthesized and characterized . An attractive bridged ketal pattern of the two molecules was revealed by the X ray crystallography of K DHP 2 . Afterwards the two compounds were applied as HTMs in conventional PSCs with a FA

@highlight Two ketal derivatives of 9 10 dihydrophenanthrene DHP were developed as HTMs for PSCs.
@highlight The K DHP 1 based PSCs delivered a high PCE of 20.52 with negligible hysteresis.
@highlight Improved stability was achieved in K DHP 1 
@highlight spiro OMeTAD based PSCs.
@highlight DHP was first revealed as an effective building block for further development of HTMs.
