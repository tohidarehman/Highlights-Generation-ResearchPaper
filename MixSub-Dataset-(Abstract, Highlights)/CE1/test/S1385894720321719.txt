 The goal of this study was to determine oxidation kinetics for biochar produced from fast pyrolysis of various biomass feedstocks . In particular the role of inherent ash content on the oxidation rate was evaluated . Thermogravimetric analysis and fluidized bed combustion experiments were used to explore oxidation kinetics of six fast pyrolysis produced biochars with diverse ash content . Reaction rates varied by a factor of three under chemical kinetic limited conditions demonstrating inorganic content impacts oxidation rate . Chemical kinetic rate coefficients were proposed as a function of compositional parameters to determine overall fit and impact . Potassium content was found to have a positive correlation best describing the differences in the oxidation kinetic rate coefficients . Additionally feedstocks were subjected to a 1M HCl acid wash mitigating the catalytic activity of the metals . Acid washed biochars had lower oxidation kinetic rates compared to their unwashed counterparts indicating the removal of catalytically active metals reduced oxidation rate . Gas composition CO CO
