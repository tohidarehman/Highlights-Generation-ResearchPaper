 Developing low cost yet highly efficient earth abundant electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction is of great significance for industrial scale water splitting for clean hydrogen production as well as for rechargeable metal air batteries . In searching for advanced catalysts it is equally important to fundamentally understand working mechanism and be able to rationally design and manipulate catalytic sites . Starting from the density functional theory calculations as a guidance our theoretical model revealed that chromium substitution in nickeliron hydroxides Ni
