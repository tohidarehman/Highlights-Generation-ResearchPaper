 Attachment and colonization of bacteria on surfaces seriously impact human health as well as numerous technologies . In this contribution a new zwitterionic monomer 3 ammonio butanesulfonate was synthesized and a polymeric coating that not only kills bacteria but also releases them afterwards was constructed through rapid deposition of polydopamine followed by

@highlight Polyzwitterion coating conjugated with Ag nanoparticles is facilely synthesized.
@highlight The coating kills bacteria and can release the killed ones upon exposure to saline.
@highlight The coating can adhere to various substrates.
