 Existing waste oriented bioeconomy approaches do not always account for the additional environmental impact caused by the treatment itself which can be quite high . Search for efficient and sustainable multi cascading bioeconomy solutions dealing with residues are calling for holistic impact assessment which should include accounting for potential rebound effects and indirect consequences nexuses and interactions with other industries and selection of the specific functionable niches for novel production and processing technologies . This contribution highlights recent environmentally sustainable solutionssuitable for integration in multicascading biowaste treatment approach .
