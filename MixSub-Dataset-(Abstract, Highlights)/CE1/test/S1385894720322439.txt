 Tritium as the fuel of fusion reactor must be stored in a metal hydride tank at a desired absorbing rate . This requirement must be fulfilled by proper design of the MH tank which can be assisted by numerical simulation . In this work a numerical model is proposed to couple hydrogen absorption kinetics and the heat and mass transfer of the MH tank . A novel kinetic model at constant flows for the gas solid reaction is developed to analyze the complex hydrogen absorption kinetics of a MH at different pressures which is the core of the numerical model . Kinetic analysis is performed to obtain the hydrogen absorption rate equation of LaNi
