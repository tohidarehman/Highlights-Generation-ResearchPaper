 The performance and possible mechanisms of iodinated contrast medium diatrizoate removal by sulfide modified nano sized zero valent iron without the presence of oxygen were investigated in this study . It was shown that the degradation efficiency of 30M DTA was observably enhanced by 2g L

@highlight Sulfide modified nano sized zero valent iron exhibited higher diatrizoate removal.
@highlight Three step diatrizoate deiodination was fitted by pseudo first order kinetics.
@highlight More H accumulation by iron sulfides accounted for enhanced diatrizoate removal.
@highlight Continuous flow systems showed the superior properties for diatrizoate removal.
