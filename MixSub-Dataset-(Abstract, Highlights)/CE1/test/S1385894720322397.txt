 Low energy desalination technologies capable of continuous throughput at reasonable operating and maintenance cost are now critically needed . Herein we present a continuous desalination process with average energy consumption as low as 2.14kJmole

@highlight Less than 150ppm water product can be obtained by one time continuous charge process in batch mode.
@highlight The removal efficiency is up to 95.5 for single continuous batch mode treatment.
@highlight An unlimited salt removal capacity was demonstrated.
@highlight A relatively low average energy consumption down to 8.34kJmole
@highlight salt removed is achievable.
@highlight No electrode regeneration is required to realize the full continuous desalination.
