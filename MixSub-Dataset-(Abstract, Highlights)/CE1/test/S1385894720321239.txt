 Immune checkpoint blockade strategy based on suppressing programmed death 1 programmed death ligand 1 pathway has been proved to be promising and effective in cancer immunotherapy . However its potential risk of immune related adverse events places stringent requirements on the precise loading of anti PD L1 agent in nanomedicine . Precise control of the loading content of anti PD L1 antibody is a difficult task since physical encapsulation has inevitable drawbacks like batch to bath variation and chemical modification is limited by the low stability of the antibody . Herein we proposed a molecular engineering strategy to develop the nanomedicine with precise control of anti PD L1 agent content by using anti PD L1 peptide as the substitute to anti PD L1 antibody . The APP was chemically bonded with a photosensitizer IR780 to obtain IR780 M APP a molecule able to self assemble into nanoparticles with a precise APP loading determined by the molecular structure . Specifically the IR780 moiety in IR780 M APP NPs endows the nanoparticles with photodynamic therapeutic effect as well as the ability to trigger immunogenic cell death while the APP moiety can block the PD 1 PD L1 pathway for promoting immunotherapy . The proposed photodynamic immunotherapy nanoplatform not only killed primary tumors directly but also eradicated the metastatic and invasive tumors effectively . The present molecular engineering strategy combined with anti PD L1 peptide might provide more opportunities for the design of advanced nanoplatforms for cancer therapy .
