 A current fossil resourcebased world economy is in translation to a sustainable biobased model which requires a replacement of nonrenewable resources with the renewable ones . The lignocellulosic biomass because of its abundance and availability around the globe is one of the most important renewable sources of carbon on Earth . Here we discuss recent discoveries and studies of the molecular mechanisms of the enzymes used in lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysis valorization and transformation into biofuels and sustainable materials . Special attention is given to progress in enzymatic hydrolysis of recalcitrant plant polysaccharides by glycoside hydrolases and their oxidation by lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases as well as to application of those enzymes for the production of nanoparticles and nanomaterials .

@highlight Recent advances in studies of enzymes for lignocellulose degradation are discussed.
@highlight New families of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases and their specificities are briefly presented.
@highlight Recent applications of enzymes for nanoparticle production are reviewed.
