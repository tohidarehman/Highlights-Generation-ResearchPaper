 Immobilizing liposomes in the hydrogel matrix network has become an effective strategy to protect liposomes against rapid clearance in the body thus facilitating their localized drug delivery in a controlled and sustained manner for a long period . However the low efficiency of drug delivery and short joint retention time seriously weaken its therapeutic efficacy . Herein an efficient delivery platform was designed to anchor liposomes by integrating them with photo crosslinkable GelMA matrix rapidly forming monodisperse

@highlight Proposing a novel strategy for preparing liposomes anchored microgels.
@highlight Ensuring stable immobilization of liposomes within generated microgels.
@highlight Realizing the high capacity loading of hydrophobic drugs within microgels.
@highlight Achieving controllability of extended drug delivery in the localized areas.
