 A continuous flow process using heterogeneous catalysts like zeolites was developed for the conversion of crude glycerol with acetone to solketal . It was found that BEA zeolite and the hierarchical zeolite of MFI structure exhibit a high catalytic activity in solketal production for 3 hr on stream . Almost 85 of glycerol conversion and 98 selectivity to solketal was achieved after 1h of the reaction . The regeneration of spent catalysts by means of calcination with following ionic exchange restored the initial activity of the applied samples . The effect of particular impurities present in crude glycerol on the deactivation process of catalysts was also explored . Analysis of carbon balance and low temperature nitrogen adsorption desorption measurements as well as FT IR spectra of applied materials evidenced that the concurrent presence of MONG and alkaline cations reduce the zeolite catalysts activity .

@highlight A crude glycerol acetalization over zeolites was studied in continuous flow system.
@highlight Beta and hierarchical ZSM 5 zeolites showed interesting catalytic performance.
@highlight Water does not affect the acetalization over Beta and hierarchical ZSM 5 zeolites.
@highlight MONG and ash are responsible for catalyst deactivation in crude glycerol acetalization.
