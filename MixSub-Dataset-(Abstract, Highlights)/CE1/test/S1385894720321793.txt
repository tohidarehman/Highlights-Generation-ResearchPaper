 Monolithic macroporous hydrogels was prepared from oil in water high internal phase emulsions and heparinized using polydopamine and polyethyleneimine as mediators and then used as a support of affinity chromatography to purify Enterovirus 71 from culture supernatant . Our innovative strategy was characterized by two remits . Interconnected macropores and high porosity of hydrophilic hydrogels ensured an excellent permeability 6.9510

@highlight Affinity chromatographic column is fabricated for specific capture of EV71.
@highlight Macroporous hydrogels with high porosity ensure an excellent permeability.
@highlight PDA PEI composite improves density of immobilized heparin.
@highlight The column presents high capacity 986ng and recovery 79.9 for EV71.
