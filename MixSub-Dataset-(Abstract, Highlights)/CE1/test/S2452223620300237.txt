 Industry agriculture and residential areas generate increasing volumes of waste streams enriched with organic pollutants . Without proper treatment they threaten the environment but can be valorized with suitable microalgal biotechnologies . Although their development has a long history recent years are marked with a boom of research in this field . This trend is fueled by the transition to circular bioeconomy gaining momentum all over the world . Current trends include the conversion of nutrients including organics nitrogen and especially phosphorus from waste streams to environmentally friendly biofertilizer detoxication of dangerous xenobiotics as well as the implementation of advanced omics methods for monitoring of treatment and designing of robust algalbacterial consortia . Here we review the recent developments highlighting the trends mentioned above .

@highlight Organic rich wastewater is a growing environmental and social concern.
@highlight Microalgal biotechnology is a promising approach to waste stream treatment.
@highlight Microalgal cultures efficiently cope with xenobiotics antibiotics and pesticides .
@highlight Using wastewater grown algal biomass as a biofertilizer gains momentum.
