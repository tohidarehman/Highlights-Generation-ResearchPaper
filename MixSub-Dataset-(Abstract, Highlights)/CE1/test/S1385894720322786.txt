 Frequent occurrence of oil spill accidents and heavy discharge of oily wastewater lead to serious environmental pollution . The sustainable utilization of natural materials offers non toxic and renewable methods for oil waste adsorption . A new oil absorbent wood material was therefore developed using the deep eutectic solvent treatment and subsequently hexadecyltrimethoxysilane hydrophobic coating . Compared to the conventional chemical approach using NaOH Na

@highlight Novel high capacity oil absorbent wood is prepared by eco friendly approach.
@highlight Surface area increases 19 folds after deep eutectic solvent delignification.
@highlight Hexadecyltrimethoxysilane endows a superhydrophobic delignified surface.
@highlight The maximum absorption of silicone oil as example of oil waste reaches 37gg
@highlight This approach shows potential for economically sustainable large scale production.
