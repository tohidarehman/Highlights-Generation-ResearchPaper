 Pollutants being discharged into water body from unknown sources are one of the major threats to environmental sustainability and human health . Herein a plasmid DNA based tracing system for multiplexed detection of potential hydrological processes of pollutants is developed . pDNA is incorporated with magnetic nanoparticles and then the pDNA MNPs nanocomposites are encapsulated inside polylactic acid microspheres as pDNA tracers . pDNA produced in large quantities by engineering bacteria

@highlight An environmental tracing system based on plasmid DNA pDNA is developed.
@highlight pDNA tracer possesses tremendous advantages compared with traditional tracer.
@highlight pDNA can be produced in large quantities by engineering bacteria.
@highlight The rational design allows pDNA tracers floating and being concentrated in water.
@highlight The application strategies of pDNA tracer in real world rivers are envisioned.
