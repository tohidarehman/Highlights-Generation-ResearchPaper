 The development of drug carriers with advanced functions to overcome the low bioavailability of conventional eye drops is critical for the effective treatment of chronic ocular diseases . This paper reports a functional strategy for developing a new hydrogel eye drop with strong mucoadhesive tight junction opening and antioxidant properties which play important roles in improving the topical treatment of glaucoma . The eye drop carrier was rationally designed through the conjugation of gelatin with poly

@highlight Glutathione functionalized hydrogel is utilized as long acting eye drop formulation.
@highlight Topically administered carriers have good biocompatibility and therapeutic benefits.
@highlight Rational biomaterials design can improve ocular retention and paracellular delivery.
@highlight Glutathione level is crucial to improve drug bioavailability for glaucoma treatment.
@highlight Single dose instillation is sufficient to alleviate disease progression for 14days.
