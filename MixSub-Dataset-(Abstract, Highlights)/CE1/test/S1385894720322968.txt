 The desulfurization by product treatment and water pollution are two widespread concerns while the sulfite activation by transition metals can be adopted to solve both of them simultaneously . In this study a silica supported cobalt catalyst was used to activate sulfite for the degradation of organic pollutants in an electrochemical system which demonstrated remarkable water treatment efficiencies due to sulfate radical oxidation . The synergy mechanisms of the EC CoSi sulfite system were revealed . The as prepared CoSi played the dual roles as an electro adsorbent and a catalyst for sulfite activation . The electrolytic oxygenation supported the conversion of cobalt species and the chain reactions of oxysulfur radicals . The anodic oxidation of sulfite also generated oxysulfur radicals . The influencing factors and operating parameters were investigated and optimized systematically . Moreover the efficient degradation of highly concentrated X 3B and non selective oxidation of various organic compounds confirmed the promising application of the EC CoSi sulfite system in practical water treatment . Overall the EC CoSi sulfite system created new value of the industrial waste for further application in the environmental remediation .
