 Multifunctional wearable heaters are highly desirable for the growing demand in the field of personal thermal management . Herein we present an efficient and feasible strategy to construct wearable heaters using waterproof and breathable composite aerogels made from cellulose nanofibers aerogel polypyrrole fluorinated finishing agent and polyurethane . The named composite aerogels exhibited a lightweight structure 0.14g cm

@highlight Robust and stretchable multifunctional aerogels were constructed.
@highlight The aerogels exhibited a maximum surface temperature of 173C within 70s at 4V.
@highlight The aerogels display hydrophobicity with a water contact angle up to 135.
@highlight The aerogels possess excellent breathability.
