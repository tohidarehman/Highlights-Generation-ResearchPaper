 This study explored the removal of total organic carbon from the highly polluted pulp and paper industry black liquor effluents by utilizing the mesoporous tenorite nanomaterials prepared by ultrasonic irradiation . The catalyst prepared was fully characterized in terms of chemical structural microstructural and surface characteristics . The optimization of the TOC removal was performed using the Taguchi methodology and by manipulating the operational parameters such as reaction time initial pH temperature sonication time the dosage of NMs as well as the effect of solar irradiation on the activation of tenorite NMs 3035nm and BET surface area 35m

@highlight Tenorite nanomaterials were synthesized by ultrasonic assisted method.
@highlight The prepared nanomaterials were used for treatment of black liquor effluents.
@highlight The treatment process was optimized using Taguchi experimental design.
@highlight TOC removal of 84 was achieved using nanomaterials under solar irradiation.
