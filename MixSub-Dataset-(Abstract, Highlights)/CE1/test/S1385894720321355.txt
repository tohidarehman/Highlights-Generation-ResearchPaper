 Sulfamethoxazole and acetaminophen are classed as common Contaminants of Emerging Concern that have been detected in significant quantities in sewage treatment plants in Malaysia and other countries . Unfortunately the conventional sewage treatment plants are not effective to reduce the concentrations of these compounds . Therefore this study introduces a novel Contaminant Emerging Remover to face the pollution caused by these CECs . This COATER was formulated using epoxidized neutral rubber and poly chloride as binders besides activated carbon as an adsorbent which was coated on white cotton fabric via brushing technique . Characterization analysis of this COATER was performed using SEM EDX FTIR and BET quantifications to study the surface chemistry and to obtain insights about the adsorption mechanism . Results of surface morphology analysis showed a good distribution of activated carbon onto the substrate where the surface area and pore volume of the COATER were 64.3m

@highlight Adsorption of sulfamethoxazole and acetaminophen on thin coated adsorbent was reported.
@highlight Chemical bonding and electrostatic forces were involved in the pharmaceuticals adsorption.
@highlight Adsorption geometry of pharmaceuticals was described via physical modelling analysis.
