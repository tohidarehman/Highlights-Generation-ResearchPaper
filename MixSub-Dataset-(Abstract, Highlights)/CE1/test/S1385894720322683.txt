 Phenolic endocrine disrupting chemicals such as bisphenol A 4 chlorophenol and nonylphenol are the most commonly detected pollutants in natural environments . The transformation of mixtures of the three phenolic pollutants during chlorination process was studied for the first time in this work . Single phenol can be effectively removed by free chlorine via electrophilic substitution and electron transfer reactions with the generation of chlorinated phenols and self coupling products . In mixture solution the apparent second order rate constants

@highlight Transformation of mixtures of 4 CP BPA and NP by chlorination was investigated.
@highlight Effects of free chlorine dosage solution pH and humic acid were examined.
@highlight Large abundance of cross coupling products generated in mixture solutions.
@highlight Theoretical analysis of DFT calculations rationalized the reaction mechanism.
