 Cu modified Y zeolite adsorbents have performed excellent adsorption desulfurization performance . Adsorption selectivity of thiophenic sulfur compounds however still remained a lower level in the presence of aromatics and olefins . In this work we aim to address the above challenge using Cu NH

@highlight The new adsorption sites Cu
@highlight NH
@highlight  species in Cu I NH
@highlight Y can be fabricated.
@highlight The Cu I NH
@highlight Y shows good adsorption desulfurization and regeneration performance.
@highlight Thiophene adsorption selectivity of adsorbent is improved in the presence of aromatics or olefins.
@highlight The S M bonding mechanism between thiophene and Cu
@highlight NH
@highlight  species can be proposed.
@highlight This work breaks out traditional high temperature preparation concept of adsorbents.
