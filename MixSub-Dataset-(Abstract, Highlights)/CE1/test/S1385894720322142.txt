 Silicon is extensively researched as an substitute for carbon as the anode material in Li ion batteries . However the cycle life of Si is very short because of its high volume expansion . Herein we propose SiN

@highlight Exploration of transparent SiN
@highlight thin films by reactive sputtering at RT.
@highlight The capacity of SiN
@highlight thin films is 1018 mAh g.
@highlight The capacity retention of SiN
@highlight thin films is 95.4 after 100 cycles.
@highlight Transmittance of SiN
@highlight thin film exhibits 88 .
