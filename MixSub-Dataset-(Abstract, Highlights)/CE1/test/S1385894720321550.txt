 In this work we first thoroughly probed the structure activity relationship between the wrinkled degree of microsphere and the microwave absorption performance . Wrinkled carbon microspheres were fabricated through soap free living controlled radical emulsion polymerization and interfacial initiated emulsion polymerization followed by a carbonization process . Tuning the polymerization reaction time carbon microspheres with different wrinkled degree were obtained . The results confirmed that the wrinkled degree had a significant impact on the absorption performance . As the polymerization time and absorber loading were 8h and 50 the wrinkled carbon microspheres showed superior application performance . The reflection loss was 49.45dB with a thickness of 1.9mm and the effective absorption bandwidth was 4.75GHz . The maximum effective absorption bandwidth could reach 4.84GHz . Designing rationally the surface microstructure of materials was extremely critical . It provided a new strategy for the improvement of the fixed absorbing materials on microwave absorption performance .
