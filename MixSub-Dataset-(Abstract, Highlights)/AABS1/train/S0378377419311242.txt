 Manure application in agricultural systems has demonstrated improvement on physical chemical and biological soil properties as well as on crop production however it may generate environmental problems such as transport of pollutants associated with surface runoff . The aim of this work was to evaluate if the improvement on soil properties with the long term liquid dairy manure application can reduce the water soil and nutrients losses by surface runoff under intense simulated rainfall . The intense simulated rainfall 60mm h
