 Understanding water productivity on a regional scale is useful for identifying and managing inefficiencies in irrigated crop production systems . However relevant WP analyses are not available for maize production systems in China . A meta analysis was conducted of maize WP in Northern China that included 2354 observations from 282 articles published between January 2000 and March 2018 . Our goal was to quantify the current WP and its constraining factors and estimate the boundary function for WP in the different maize agro ecological zones of Northern China . The Northern China average WP across the large set of field experiments was 22.3kg ha
