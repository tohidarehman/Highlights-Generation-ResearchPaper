 The production of nutrient rich livestock products consumes large volumes of water while polluting aquatic systems however there has been little quantitative research globally on the spatiotemporal evolution of both water consumption and water pollution for livestock products at an intra national scale . Here we quantified the annual green blue and gray WFs for pig feeding and pork production as the most important animal product in China at the province scale in mainland China over 20042013 and distinguished four farming scales scatter feed small scale medium scale and large scale . The gray WF estimation is more comprehensive that pollutants in pig excreta is considered . Over the study period the average unit consumptive and degradative WF of pig was 349 m

@highlight Developments in Chinese provincial water footprints of pigs and pork are estimated.
@highlight Large scale systems had the smallest unit water footprints of pigs.
@highlight Water consumption of pigs in China could be reduced by 6 if fully large scaled.
@highlight Local water scarcity and pollution levels are essential for pig farm locating.
