 Shade and drought are considered the most drastic abiotic stress factors which restrict normal crop growth especially for those high density and intercropped crops in arid and semi arid areas . However relationship and mechanisms of the interactive effects of these two stress factors on crops are elusive . Here we report our identification of relationship between shade and drought and their interactive effects on soybean plants . Our quantitative real time PCR results showed that shade significantly up regulated Abscisic Acid biosynthesis

@highlight Shade 12hours up regulated the ABA biosynthetic 
@highlight 3 and
@highlight 3 and signaling 
@highlight I4 and
@highlight I5 genes and hence the ABA contents.
@highlight Pretreatment of shade resulted in increased activity of osmoprotectants and antioxidant enzymes.
@highlight Pretreatment of shade enhanced the scavenging of ROS and protects plants from deleterious effects of drought stress.
@highlight Collectively pretreatment of shade could serve to mitigate the drastic effects of drought in soybean grown under dense cropping systems.
