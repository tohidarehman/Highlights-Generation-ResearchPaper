 Methylglyoxal is an endogenous toxic compound that plays a vital role in diabetic complications such as diabetic neuropathy . Moscatilin is a bibenzyl component from Dendrobium species has been shown to possess a wide range of pharmacological activities . To clarify whether moscatilin prevents rat pheochromocytoma cells from damage induced by MGO cells were pre treated with moscatilin and then stimulated with MGO . Moscatilin inhibited MGO associated cytotoxicity in a concentration dependent manner and downregulated the formation of advanced glycation end products and reactive oxygen species . Moscatilin attenuated MGO induced mitochondrial dysfunction involving the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and depletion of adenosine triphosphate . MGO induced cell apoptosis via the upregulation of p53 caspases 3 and polypolymerase enhancement of cytochrome

@highlight Methylglyoxal caused oxidative stress and cellular damage in neuron like PC12cells.
@highlight Moscatilin ameliorated methylglyoxal induced cytotoxicity in PC12cells.
@highlight Moscatilin prevented PC12cells from methylglyoxal induced mitochondrial dysfunction.
@highlight Moscatilin downregulated p38 and JNK MAPK signaling pathways in PC12cells exposed to methylglyoxal.
