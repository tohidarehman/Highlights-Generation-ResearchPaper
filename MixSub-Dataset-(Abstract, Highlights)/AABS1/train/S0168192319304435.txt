 This paper explores the idea of combining Trigonometric Exponential Smoothing State Space model with Box Cox transformation ARMA errors Trend and Seasonal Components with Support Vector Machine model to estimate time series of the minimum and maximum daily air temperatures in a period of six years for various climatic localizations in Europe . It was found that a combined SVM TBATS model can predict not only seasonality but also local temperature variation between subsequent days observed in daily data . Because the SVM sub model uses not only results of TBATS prediction as an input data but also several meteorological values such modelling can not be treated as a future time series estimation . Therefore it has a potential to be used for filling gaps in the air temperature data . As is shown in our results the precision of air temperature prediction improves when using the combined SVM TBATS modelling compared with pure TBATS or SVM modelling . For various locations which can be related with different climatic conditions this improvement ranged from 3 up to 14 for the maximum daily air temperature and from 5 to 25 for the minimum daily air temperature . The temperature sums calculated on the base of air temperatures predicted with SVM TBATS models and from measured values did not differ more than 300
