 Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphorus pesticide widely and extensively used in agriculture in more than one hundred countries and found ubiquitously in the environment . The present study was aimed at providing a better understanding of the obesogenic potential of CPF and its metabolites as well as to evaluate their effects on the adipocyte differentiation process . For it during the initial differentiation process 3T3 L1 mouse preadipocytes were exposed to different concentrations of CPF CPF oxon or 3 5 6 trichloropyridinol which did not affect cell survival . Results showed how CPF and to a lesser extent its metabolite TCP had a positive metabolic influence over the adipogenic process by fostering an increase in the number of differentiated 3T3 L1 preadipocytes and by enhancing the capacity to store lipid droplets . These processes seem to occur through the upregulation of the transcription factors CCAAT enhancer binding protein and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor which are related to a significant higher expression of the fatty acid binding protein 4 adipokine . Based on this finding CPF exposure could be one of the many factors that contributes to the worldwide increase in the incidence of obesity . However additional investigations are clearly needed .

@highlight The obesogenic activity of CPF and its metabolites CPO and TCP were determined.
@highlight CPF and to a lesser extent its metabolite TCP promotes an increased ratio of hyperplastic and hypertrophic differentiated 3T3 L1 preadipocytes.
@highlight CPF and TCP upregulate the expression of the transcription factors C EBP and PPAR and of the FABP4 adipokine.
@highlight CPO apparently not have a significant metabolic influence over the adipogenic process.
@highlight CPF and its metabolites have no effects on the levels of phosphorylated AKT protein.
