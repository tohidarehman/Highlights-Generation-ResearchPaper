 In areas with low availability of irrigation water it is necessary to improve water use efficiency in crops especially if their profitability is low . This is the case of barley in the Castilla La Mancha region where farmers are demanding methods to achieve adequate harvests with a supply of low amounts of irrigation water to this particular crop . The optimized regulated deficit irrigation methodology was developed to maximize the yield of annual crops under water scarce conditions . The objective of this study was to determine the effect of ORDI for a limited amount of available irrigation water on yield water productivity and water footprint of a barley crop under semiarid conditions . To this end five irrigation treatments were performed over three years on an experimental farm located in Albacete province no deficit and four with different volumes of available irrigation water corresponding to 100 90 80 and 70 of barley net irrigation requirements 2500m

@highlight ORDI for limited volumes of irrigation water can be used in real farms.
@highlight Highest barley yield was reached by the no deficit treatment.
@highlight ORDI treatments improved the water productivity and reduced the water footprint.
@highlight ORDI increased the use of soil water and rainfall and reduced percolation.
@highlight For the same irrigation amount ORDI increases total yield by increasing irrigable area.
@highlight ORDI may be recommended for areas with low availability of irrigation water.
