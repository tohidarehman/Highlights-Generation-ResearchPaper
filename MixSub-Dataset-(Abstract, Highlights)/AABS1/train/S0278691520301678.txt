 Prenatal caffeine exposure induces developmental toxicity of multi organ and susceptibility to multi disease in offspring . However the effects of PCE on osteoarthritis susceptibility in adult offspring and its intrauterine programming mechanism remain to be further investigated . Here we found that PCE induced susceptibility to osteoarthritis in male adult offspring rats which was related to the inhibited function of cartilage matrix synthesis from fetuses to adults . Meanwhile PCE consistently downregulated the H3K9ac and expression levels of transforming growth factor receptor 1 and then blocked TGF signaling pathway which contributed to the suppressed cartilage matrix synthesis . Moreover the high level of corticosterone caused by PCE reduced the H3K9ac level on TGFR1 promoter region through acting on glucocorticoids receptor and recruiting histone deacetylase 2 into the nucleus of fetal chondrocytes . Taken together PCE induced osteoarthritis susceptibility in male adult offspring rats which was attributed to the low functional programming of TGFR1 induced by corticosterone
