 This study was designed to demonstrate that prenatal ethanol exposure can induce low functional expression of the hypothalamus in male offspring rats and explore the underlying mechanism . Pregnant rats were administered 4g kg ethanol or normal saline by oral gavage each day from gestational day 9 to GD20 . Male GD20 foetuses and postnatal day 120 adult offspring rats were sacrificed under anaesthesia . Hypothalamic cells from male GD20 postnatal day 7 rats were treated with different doses of corticosterone and the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone for 5 days . In this study we found that PEE induced overexposure of maternal glucocorticoids enhanced the expression of L glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus by activating the glucocorticoid metabolic activation system further inducing the conversion of glutamate to L gamma aminobutyric acid and developmental imbalance of glutamatergic GABAergic projections to the PVN . The imbalance change was maintained until after birth resulting in the inhibition of parvocellular neurons and low functional expression of the hypothalamus in PEE offspring rats . Our study indicated that low functional expression of the hypothalamus in male PEE offspring rats was associated with developmental programming of an imbalance of glutamatergic GABAergic projections to the PVN .

@highlight PEE induced activation of the hypothalamic glucocorticoid metabolic activation system of 11HSDs GR C EBPa.
@highlight PEE induced the upregulation of hypothalamic GAD67 expression by activating GR.
@highlight Enhanced expression of hypothalamic GAD67 led to a developmental imbalance of glutamatergic GABAergic projections to the PVN.
@highlight The imbalance of glutamatergic GABAergic projections mediated hypothalamic low functional expression in male offspring rats.
