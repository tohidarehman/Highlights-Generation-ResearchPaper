 Accumulating evidence suggests that species sensitivity to climatic change is strongly related to their ecological niches which are somewhat evolutionary conserved . Insofar as this is true climate change driven extinctions may be non random with respect to phylogeny and entire branches of the tree of life might be lost . In mountainous regions where macroecological conditions change abruptly with elevation evolutionarily lineages may show deep phylogenetic turnover along elevational belts and such layering of the phylogeny may lead to disproportionate losses of phylogenetic diversity . Here we explored phylogenetic alpha and beta diversity patterns of plant assemblages among six elevational belts at Kilimanjaro i.e . savanna woodland lower montane forest middle montane

@highlight Plant evolutionary lineages show deep turnover along the elevational gradient of Kilimanjaro.
@highlight A great wealth of phylogenetic diversity PD is encapsulated in lower montane forest remnants.
@highlight The phylogenetic layering of Kilimanjaro flora may result in great losses of PD.
@highlight Land use transformation and climate change induced fires are pervasive threats to PD.
