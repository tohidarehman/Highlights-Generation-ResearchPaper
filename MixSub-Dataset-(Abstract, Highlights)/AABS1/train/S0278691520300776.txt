 L. green husks are an important fraction of waste resulting from the walnut production thus representing an interesting natural matrix to explore as a source of bioactive compounds . In this work the hydroethanolic extract of walnut green husks was studied considering the phytochemical composition and the biological activity using different cell model assays most of them evaluated for the first time for this matrix .

@highlight The hydroethanolic extract of walnut husks from NE Portugal was studied.
@highlight Phenolic acids flavonoids tetralones and naphthoquinone were the main compounds.
@highlight Tetralone derivatives were found in higher amounts.
@highlight A dihydroxytetralone was found to be the major compound.
@highlight Husks exhibited antioxidant anti inflammatory cytotoxic and antibacterial properties.
