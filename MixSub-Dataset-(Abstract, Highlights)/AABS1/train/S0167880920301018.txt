 The northeastern U.S. is projected to experience more frequent short term droughts interspersed among larger precipitation events . Agroforestry practices such as silvopasture may mitigate these impacts of climate change while maintaining economic benefits of both agricultural and forestry practices . This study evaluated the effects of forest to silvopasture conversion on the components of evapotranspiration during the growing season of 2016 . The study coincided with a late summer drought throughout the northeastern U.S. which allowed us to also evaluate the effects of forest to silvopasture conversion on drought responses of multiple tree species including

@highlight Forest to silvopasture conversion alleviated drought stress for
@highlight Conversion also increased stem growth for
@highlight and
@highlight Evapotranspiration was lower in the silvopasture than the reference forest.
@highlight Silvopasture provides a management option for mitigating climate change impacts.
