 Global declines in pollinator populations and associated services make it imperative to identify and sensitively manage valuable habitats . Coastal habitats such as saltmarshes can support extensive flowering meadows but their importance for pollinators and how this varies with land use intensity is poorly understood . We hypothesised that saltmarshes provide important bee foraging habitat and that livestock grazing either suppresses or enhances its value by reducing the abundance or increasing the diversity of flowering plants . To test these hypotheses we surveyed 11 saltmarshes in Wales under varying grazing management over three summers and investigated causal pathways linking grazing intensity with bee abundance and diversity using a series of linear mixed models . We also compared observed bee abundances to 11 common terrestrial habitats using national survey data .

@highlight Livestock grazing in saltmarshes reduces bee abundance and diversity.
@highlight Reductions are driven by decreased cover of two key food plants.
@highlight Increased plant diversity with grazing does not compensate for negative effects.
@highlight Negative effects are stronger at higher grazing intensity.
@highlight Ungrazed saltmarshes rank highly for bees compared to terrestrial habitats.
