 The objective of this study was to determine the immunotoxic effects of deoxynivalenol in weaning piglets and potential efficacy of a modified hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate adsorbent to reduce DON toxicity . Four groups of 21 day old male piglets were fed a control diet or diet containing 1.0 or 3.0mg DON kg or 3.0mg DON kg plus 0.05 modified HSCAS for 4 weeks . Compared to the control the DON diets decreased serum porcine circovirus antibody titer and the dermal hypersensitivity response to OVA at day 21 or 28 . DON also induced focal necrosis and proliferation of cortical lymphocytes and apoptosis and increased the total antioxidant capacity and reduced glutathione protein carbonyl concentrations in thymus . DON increased thymus mRNA protein and enzyme levels cytokines

@highlight DON 1.0 and 3.0mg kg altered the pig vaccine responses.
@highlight DON 1.0 and 3.0mg kg altered thymic histology and induced apoptosis.
@highlight Redox status and inflammation and apoptosis related genes were dysregulated by DON.
@highlight A modified HSCAS adsorbent reduced the toxicity of DON in piglets.
