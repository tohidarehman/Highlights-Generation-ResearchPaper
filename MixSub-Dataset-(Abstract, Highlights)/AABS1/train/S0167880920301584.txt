 Soils can act as a carbon sink and the chemical and biological transformation of vegetal litter into soil organic matter is widely influenced by land use and other biogeochemical parameters . However the increase of new carbon inputs to soil has the potential to trigger the mineralization of stabilized SOM a process called priming effect .

@highlight Frequent land use changes stimulate priming effect hampering carbon storage targets.
@highlight Temporary grassland rotations modify SOM quality and shape microbial communities.
@highlight Variance partition models identified predictors of priming effect at landscape scale.
@highlight Fluorescence analyses of water soluble SOM identified markers of priming effect.
@highlight Rotations including grassland for 4060 of time were the less prone to priming effect.
