 Chilling and heat requirements of peach cultivars and spectrums of chilling accumulation over the last 100 years were evaluated to determine phenological characteristics for dormancy break in Republic of Korea . Chilling requirement was calculated by using Chill Hours Utah Dynamic North Carolina and Low Chilling models and heat requirement was estimated in growing degree hours . Chilling requirement of 15 cultivars ranged between 263 and 2123 chill hour 377 and 1134 chill unit and 21.3 and 74.8 chilling portion . The Dynamic model showed the highest precision with the smallest variation among years followed by the Utah model . Heat requirement ranged from 4824 to 5506 GDH and was positively correlated with flowering date . During last 100 years the initiation date of chilling accumulation had been delayed for 1012 days in Chill Hours and Utah models . In contrast the Dynamic model showed no significant changes in chilling accumulation spectrum . Although the chill accumulation was enough to fulfill the chilling requirement so far in Republic of Korea reduced chills were monitored from 100 year data . Therefore continuous monitoring or estimation of chilling accumulation in the future is needed .

@highlight Chilling requirement varied among species and cultivars.
@highlight The dynamic model was the most precise model followed by the Utah model.
@highlight Flowering date was significantly related with chilling requirement.
@highlight Initiation of chilling accumulation had been delayed during last 100 years.
@highlight Chilling accumulation was reduced during 100 years in chill hours model.
