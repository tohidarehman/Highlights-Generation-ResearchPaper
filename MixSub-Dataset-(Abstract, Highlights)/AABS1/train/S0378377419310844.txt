 Coconut palm is an important crop explored as a rich source of oil fiber milk and water in most tropical areas . Brazil is the fifth largest producer in the world and extensive coastal areas of Northeastern Brazil are planted with tall coconut . However the sustainability of these coconut plantations can be affected by different abiotic stresses including drought mineral nutrition and salinity . So the objective of the present study was to evaluate the ecophysiological responses of tall coconut

@highlight Coconut palm is an important crop explored in most tropical areas.
@highlight Different abiotic constraints impact tall coconut yields in coastal areas.
@highlight Physiological response can be indicators of sensitivity to abiotic stress.
@highlight Waterlogging is an additional stress factor in coconuts high tide areas.
@highlight Permanent hindrance on photosynthesis is observed in severe stressful areas.
