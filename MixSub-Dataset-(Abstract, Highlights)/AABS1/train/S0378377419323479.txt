 Drip irrigation has been widely used in arid regions in recent years . However how the drip irrigation technology can affect soil evaporation and crop transpiration and whether it can save water under the sufficient irrigation condition are still of great controversy in the world .

@highlight Drip irrigation had similar daily evapotranspiration rate against the traditional border irrigation.
@highlight Drip irrigation averagely decreased daily evaporation rate by 0.13 mm d
@highlight but increased daily transpiration rate by 0.19 mm d
@highlight Drip irrigation effectively promoted crop growth and reduced growth period length and soil evaporation.
