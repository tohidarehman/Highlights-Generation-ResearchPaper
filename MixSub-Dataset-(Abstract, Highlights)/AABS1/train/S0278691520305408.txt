 The harmful effects of food occurring oxidized amino acids namely aminoadipic acid dityrosine L kynurenine kynurenic acid and 3 nitrotyrosine were studied on differentiated CACO 2cells by flow cytometry and quantification of glutathione and allysine . Cells were exposed to food relevant doses of each compound for 4 or 72h and compared to a control . All oxidized amino acids induced apoptosis and results indicated that underlying mechanisms depended on the chemical nature of the species . AAA KN and KA caused ROS generation and severe oxidative stress in 96 98 and 89 of exposed cells leading to significant GSH depletion and allysine accretion . DTYR and 3NT induced significant apoptosis to 29 and 25 of cells and necrosis to 28 and 26 of cells at 72h by ROS independent mechanisms . KN and KA were found to induce a cycle arrest effect on CACO 2cells . These findings emphasize the potential harmful effects of the intake of oxidized proteins and amino acids and urge the necessity of carrying out further molecular studies .

@highlight Effects and mechanisms seemed to be related to chemical structure.
@highlight Dityrosine and 3NT induced apoptosis and necrosis by ROS independent mechanisms.
@highlight Oxidized tryptophan and lysine induced ROS protein oxidation and glutathione depletion.
