 Plant trait variation in bioenergy crops is hypothesized to affect crop biomass production . The extent of this trait variation and its relationship to production should be explored to inform cultivar selection in different environments and with environmental change . Switchgrass

@highlight Traits differed among 12 cultivars of
@highlight in a common garden experiment.
@highlight Composite trait variables correlated with variability in productivity over eight years.
@highlight Composite trait variables better predictors of yield than cultivar ecotype or climate.
@highlight Taller cultivars with more leaf nitrogen had highest yield only in establishment years.
@highlight Composite traits had highest explanatory power during severe drought year.
