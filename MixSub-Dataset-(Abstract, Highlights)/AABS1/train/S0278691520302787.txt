 This study investigated the effect of two communication strategies in reducing chemophobia the irrational fear of chemicals . In an online experiment participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups . The following dependent variables were assessed chemophobia knowledge of basic toxicological principles affect towards chemicals benefit perception of the use of chemicals and preference for natural substitutes in consumer products . The results showed that only the informational approach which conveys knowledge of basic toxicological principles significantly decreased chemophobia and the preference for natural substitutes in consumer products . The affect based approach significantly increased positive affect towards chemicals and the benefit perception of their use but did not decrease chemophobia . This suggested that the provision of relevant information about basic toxicological principles is a more effective strategy than merely addressing laypeople s affect towards chemicals to reduce chemophobia . Relevant knowledge could be taught in schools or disseminated by toxicologists and scientists who are trusted by the public .
