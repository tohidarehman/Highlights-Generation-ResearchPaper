 Improved plant performance under salt and drought stresses has been a challenging task to the plant due to the complexity and multitude of genes that govern them . We describe here isolation and characterization of an

@highlight overexpression lines enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stress at seedling stage.
@highlight Transgenic exhibits increased photosynthetic performance under salt stress.
@highlight transgenic could ameliorate photosynthesis by augmenting the antioxidant system and ROS detoxification.
@highlight Constitutive expression was associated with co expression of
@highlight and antioxidant genes in transgenic plants.
@highlight can be used as potential gene to modulate salt and drought tolerance in major crops as it reduced cell death.
