 Measurements of water consumption by plants are not often used in irrigation management due to the high cost and difficulty of measurement however new methods based on sap flow monitoring enable accurate estimation of plant transpiration . The objective of this work was to develop a sap flow sensor to reliably evaluate crop water stress index CWSI

@highlight New methods based on the sap flow allow estimating the actual plant transpiration.
@highlight The present work proposes a new methodology for estimating the CWSI for coffee.
@highlight A critical value of coffee CWSI allows estimating the moment to start irrigation.
