 Accidental ingestion of household cleaning products frequently results in emesis but the physicochemical properties responsible are not known . To investigate whether data collected during

@highlight Nausea and vomiting are frequently reported symptoms of accidental ingestion of xenobiotics.
@highlight Analysis of historic
@highlight studies identified emetic properties of liquid cleaning products.
@highlight A high percentage of non ionic surfactants high ionic strength and pH of 10 are linked to emesis.
@highlight A mechanism based on activation of gut enterochromaffin cells and vagal afferents is presented.
@highlight We discuss using historical data to make
@highlight models as an alternative 3Rs to animal testing.
