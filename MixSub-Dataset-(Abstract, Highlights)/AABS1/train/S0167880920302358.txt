 Understanding the abundance of organic P in soil is a prerequisite for predicting the effects of climate change on P dynamics and availability in cold alpine regions . We sampled plant roots and soils in grasslands along a 2300 m altitude gradient from 9 to 0.3 C between alpine steppes on the Loess Plateau and alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau . A modified Hedley P fractionation in combination with root and microbial P alongside phosphatase activity was used to characterize P transformations depending on climate . Both the roots and microorganisms stored more P and produced higher phosphatase activity in cold meadow than in warm steppe soils . Total inorganic P content decreased in cold meadow compared with warm steppe soils because of the decrease of moderately labile Pi in cold meadow soils . Available P NaHCO

@highlight We sampled plants and soils 1 m depths in grasslands altitude 12863589 m 
@highlight We analyzed Hedley P fractions root and microbial P and phosphatase activity
@highlight Total soil inorganic P decreases but total organic P increases with altitude rise
@highlight Greater root and microbial accumulation in cold soils increase P shift to organic pool
@highlight Climate warming may stimulate P cycling more in cold than in warm grassland soils
