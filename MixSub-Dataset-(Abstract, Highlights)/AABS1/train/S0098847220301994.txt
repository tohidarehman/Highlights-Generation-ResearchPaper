 The integration of different environmental cues and the harmonization of proper responses require molecular communication at different levels . Enzymes belonging to the large superfamily of 2 oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases use for their catalytic activity different cofactors including molecular oxygen 2 oxoglutarate and ascorbic acid . In plants 2 ODDs are involved in the synthesis of hydroxyproline gibberellins ethylene zeaxanthin and many more relevant molecules . In addition 2 ODDs operating in the epigenetic control of gene expression by regulating cytosine and histone methylation have been recently identified in both animals and plants . It is here hypothesized that each of the cofactors required for the complex catalytic mechanism of 2 ODDs provides specific molecular information . Such information is integrated by 2 ODDs which in turn regulate the synthesis of information bearing metabolites and control epigenetic processes . The evolutionary success of the catalytic mechanism shared by 2 ODDs is possibly related to the parallel activation of different biosynthetic pathways .

@highlight 2 oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases 2 ODDs require an unusual number of cofactors for their catalytic activity.
@highlight The list of cofactors include oxygen 2 oxoglutarate iron and ascorbic acid vitamin C .
@highlight Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that each cofactor provides molecular information that is integrated by different 2 ODDs.
@highlight The peculiar role of ASC in this possible integrative signaling mechanism is discussed.
