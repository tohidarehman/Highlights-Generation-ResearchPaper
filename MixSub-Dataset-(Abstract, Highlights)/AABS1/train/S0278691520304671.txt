 Arsenic is a well known potent toxicant affecting people by causing various human diseases . Long term exposure to arsenic has strong adverse health effects on liver and kidney disorders and various forms of cancer . Contrarily curcumin and D pinitol are bioactive dietary compounds that have antioxidant properties . Both are used to treat a broad variety of human diseases . Thus we hypothesized that both may have synergistic effects against arsenic induced toxicity in PC12cells . Cells were pretreated with curcumin D pinitol alone or in combination then exposed to sodium arsenite . The final concentration of curcumin 2.5M and D pinitol 5M was selected for combination treatment based on their highest protection at lowest concentration against arsenic toxicity . Results demonstrated that pretreatment of curcumin and D pinitol and their combined treatment with arsenic rescued PC12cells . Western blot analysis results showed that pretreatment of curcumin and D pinitol and their combined treatment with arsenic significantly inhibited arsenic induced cell death through up regulation of pro survival proteins and down regulation of cell death related proteins although these protein expressions were negatively regulated by arsenic . Furthermore the effect of combined treatment with curcumin and D pinitol was stronger than individual treatment .

@highlight Curcumin 50 and 100M decreases cell viability of PC12cells unlike D pinitol.
@highlight Arsenic induced cell death
@highlight both mitochondria mediated intrinsic apoptosis and autophagy.
@highlight Curcumin and D pinitol alone or in combination efficiently protects PC12cells from arsenic induced cytotoxicity.
@highlight The combined cytoprotection of curcumin and D pinitol against arsenic toxicity was higher than their individual protection.
