 Afghanistan has an arid to semi arid climate where irrigated agriculture largely depends on scarce irrigation water supplies from snowmelt from the high raised mountains . Under growing water scarcity farmers not only need to use the available water more wisely but have to develop alternative options for coping water scarcity . Deficit irrigation schedule can be one of the options to mitigate the adverse impacts of water scarcity on crop production . In the current study FAOs crop water productivity model was calibrated and validated with field data in Kabul River Basin for wheat crop to simulate four different water scarcity scenarios for resultant yield water productivity and biomass production . Two wheat fields namely A and B were monitored intensively for soil moisture content meteorological situation irrigation application and post harvest data . Results show that the measured WP was 1.4 kg m

@highlight AquaCrop model is a useful tool in deriving crop water use efficient strategies for enhanced water productivity.
@highlight The farmers irrigating behavior could be improved through innovative adjustments to the irrigation schedule Irrigation roster .
@highlight The farmers would get better results in terms of yield increment and irrigated land expansion if irrigation application is adjusted to demand based application.
