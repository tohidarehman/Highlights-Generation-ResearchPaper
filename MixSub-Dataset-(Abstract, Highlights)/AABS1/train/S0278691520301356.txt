 The co presence of more than one mycotoxin in food is being evidenced in last food surveys as reported in the literature . Beauvericin is a non legislated emergent mycotoxin while Ochratoxin A has been widely studied and legislated . Concentration range individually studied was from 2.5 to 0.3M for BEA and from 25 to 3.1M for OTA binary mixture comprised concentrations of 1 10 ratio from to M. Potential of toxicity of BEA in HepG2 cells was the highest at all times assayed . LPO was performed through malondyaldehyde detection denoting in the binary mixture for M and at 24 and 72h the highest disturbance values . ROS denoted differences respect to the control at different times specially for OTA while in binary combination only for few point times was denoted . Effects detected for ROS and LPO were connected with alterations detected for glutathione levels of oxidized and reduced form . A real scenario of consumers chronically exposed to different mycotoxins and their mixtures is here presented highlighting the good methodology to assess the risk from exposure to combinations of chemicals in food .
