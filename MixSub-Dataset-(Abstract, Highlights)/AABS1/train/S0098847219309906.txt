 Removing fruit from horticultural trees and vines is a common practice in source sink studies . What effect removal of sinks as fruit growth commences has on photosynthesis is much less addressed . The objective was to remove Shiraz bunches at the rapid growth stage and compare photosynthetic performance of vines with and without fruit . Photosynthetic responses to CO

@highlight Seasonal assimilation was modelled with seasonal climate including a heat wave.
@highlight Grape bunches removed in mid season caused reduced assimilation.
@highlight Loss of fruit sink demand was exacerbated by the heat wave.
@highlight Carbon acquisition indicated assimilation was unaffected by the heat wave.
