 Calcineurin B like proteins and CBL interacting protein kinases play critical roles in mediating plant responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses . However the underlying molecular mechanisms by which these complex functions and the potential cross talk between the diverse downstream signaling networks are regulated still remain elusive . Here we characterized a
