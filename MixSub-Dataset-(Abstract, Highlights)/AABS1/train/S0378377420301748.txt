 East African region is susceptible to drought due to high variation in monthly precipitation . Studying drought at regional scale is vital since droughts are considered a creeping disaster by nature with devasting and extended impact often requiring long periods to reverse the recorded damages . This study assessed drought exceedance and return years over East Africa from 1920 to 2016 using Climate Research Unit precipitation data records . Meteorological drought where precipitation is the central quantity of interest was adopted in the work . Standardize Precipitation Index was used to study long term meteorological droughts and also to assess drought magnitude frequency exceedance probability and return years using Joint Probability Density Function . Also Mann Kendall trend analysis was applied to precipitation and SPI to investigate the trend changes . Results showed that years with high drought magnitude ranged from 192022 192629 194246 and 194751 with values corresponding to 2.2 3.2 3.4 and 2.6 respectively while years with low drought magnitude ranged from 193031 198889 and 200102 with values as 0.2 0.12 and 0.15 respectively . The longest droughts occurred from 192629 193741 194246 194751 195256 and 195861 with values in years as 3 4 4 4 4 and 3 years respectively while the shortest droughts occurred in time period of 1year and ranged from 193031 196465 197980 198182 198384 198889 199192 199394 199697 and 200102 . Also it was demonstrated that probability of drought occurrence is high when severity is low and such droughts occur at short time intervals and not all severest drought took longer periods . The SPI trends indicate high positive pixels above the zero trend mark indicating that drought prevails in both low and high elevation areas up to 2000m . There was no direct link between ENSO and drought but arguably the association of drought in most El Nio and La Nia years suggests that the impact of ENSO can not be ruled out since peak ENSO events occur during October to March periods which coincides with the short and long rainy seasons of East Africa . The study is particularly relevant in being able to depict continuous and synoptic drought condition all over East Africa providing vital information to farmers and policy makers using very cost effective method .
