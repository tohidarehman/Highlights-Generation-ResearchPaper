 The central renin angiotensin system is implicated in Alzheimer s disease . Here induction of experimental AD simulation was performed by D galactose injection to ovariectomized rats fed on high fat high fructose diet . Telmisartan administration to OVX HFFD D Gal rats lowered the expression of hippocampal angiotensin 1 and 2 receptors and glucose transporter 2 in addition to lowering of the peripheral and central glucose levels . Furthermore it improved cognitive impairment and suppressed hippocampal amyloidogenic markers including amyloid

@highlight Efficient induction of Alzheimer s disease AD simulation could be performed in OVX rats fed on HFFD exposed to D gal.
@highlight AD progression is related to disturbed glycemic control central RAS activity and central estrogenic activity.
@highlight Telmisartan showed efficient protective effects on experimental AD model concerning behavioral and biochemical evidences.
@highlight Modulation of central RAS and ER in addition to improvement of glycemic control may explain telmisartan effects.
@highlight Suppression of neuronal apoptosis inflammation and oxidative stress may also explain telmisartan beneficial effects.
