 Heat waves are problematic for grazing livestock systems in regions dependant on temperate pasture species owing to the often minimal heat tolerance of these pastures . A field experiment in north west Tasmania Australia tested the hypothesis irrigating more frequently reduces detrimental heat wave effects on perennial ryegrass

@highlight Benefits of irrigating perennial ryegrass more frequently during heat waves tested.
@highlight Novel outdoor heater system designed for evaluating heat wave mitigation options.
@highlight Irrigating more frequently suppressed crown temperature elevation under heaters.
@highlight Simulated heat wave conditions reduced perennial ryegrass growth by 23 .
@highlight Heat wave effects on growth were independent of irrigation frequency.
