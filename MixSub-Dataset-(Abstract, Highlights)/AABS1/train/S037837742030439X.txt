 Soil and water conservation is an important and based work of sustainable agricultural development . However how to estimate the real condition of quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development has become a problem . In this paper an evaluation system and method provides powerful tools for the soil and water conservation based on induced ordered weighted averaging operator and incomplete information . Firstly a new quality evaluation system of soil and water conservation for sustainable agricultural development is build based on IOWA method with multiple attributes . Secondly the method of multiple attribute comprehensive evaluation method with incomplete information is presented to determining variation coefficient and calculating overall evaluation weights . Then the priorities of quality evaluation are obtained based on the calculating weight of acceptable degree . And the result of quality assessment reveals inner difference of sustainable agricultural development . Finally the rationality and feasibility of new quality evaluation system is demonstrated by the case study from China .
