 Plant Growth Promotion Rhizobacteria control plant development by modulation of their phytohormone activities . To probe how PGPR trigger plant growth and mitigate stress induced by aluminum the beneficial effect of

@highlight Bt04 promotes maize root growth and produces auxins and cytokinins.
@highlight Colonisation by Bt04 increases active cytokinins and phenylacetic acid in roots.
@highlight Bt04 itself shows tolerance to high aluminum levels.
@highlight Inhibitors of auxin transport abolish the growth promotion induced by Bt04.
@highlight The auxin transport pathway is needed for the Bt04 induced aluminum tolerance.
