 Large old trees are keystone organisms that generate a highly connected network of interactions because they provide refuge and feeding sites to mammals with different habitat requirements through their under canopy structure and deadwood . In dry woodlands these keystone trees are found within agricultural landscapes where grazing and deadwood removal are the main subsistence activities carried out by local people . These activities can modify the structure of trees and in turn affect small mammal communities . Our objective was to assess how different land management types modify the structure of

@highlight Tree structure reflects grazing and deadwood removal history of areas.
@highlight Deadwood and grass cover favor rodent species that need complex habitats.
@highlight Protection provided by trees was differentially perceived by rodent species.
@highlight Different land management scenarios allow for conservation of the whole rodent assemblage.
