 Soil erosion has a significant impact on the distribution and sequestration of soil carbon affecting the global C cycle . Although the transport and transformation of soil organic carbon during the erosion process have been widely studied there is still a lack of understanding of the impacts of soil erosion on soil inorganic carbon and its relationships with SOC . In this study 62 erosional sites and 35 depositional sites on the Chinese Loess Plateau were selected . Partial least squares regression was carried out to explore the main influential factors of SIC variation . The results showed that compared with erosional sites the mean SOC and SIC content in depositional sites increased by 24.4 and 15.4 respectively . Both SOC and SIC contents in depositional sites exhibited a decreasing tendency with depth . SIC was significantly negatively correlated with SOC R

@highlight Sediment deposition contributed to the sequestration of SOC and SIC.
@highlight A negative relationship between SOC and SIC was observed in erosional sites.
@highlight SOC was positively correlated with SIC in deep depositional soil.
@highlight Sediment transport and deposition changed the relationship from negative to positive.
@highlight Increased SOC contributes to pedogenic carbonate formation in depositional sites.
