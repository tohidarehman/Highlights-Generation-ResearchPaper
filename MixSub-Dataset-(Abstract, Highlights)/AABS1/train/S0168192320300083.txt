 All over the world there is increasing demand for wood and other goods from seasonally dry tropical forests the Caatinga forest in northeast Brazil is a case in point . In order to set up sustainable forest management protocols a comprehensive understanding of the main drivers of forest growth is needed but few studies have focused on this subject in the Caatinga biome . Traditionally periodic annual increment has been calculated by dividing standing stock by the legally imposed minimum cutting cycle of 15 years but it is doubtful that this guarantees sustainability . We use data from 20 coupes spread over 10 managed areas and apply both multiple regression and tree regression techniques to correlate PAI with 27 environmental variables including mean annual rainfall and many soil properties . We find that neither the time since harvesting nor the stock before harvest are significantly related to PAI . Instead using a simple linear regression model we show that rainfall can explain most of the variation while a tree regression model which captures non linear relations between rainfall and PAI explains 96 of the variation . On the other hand no soil factors contribute significantly to the overall explanation of growth after harvest . We conclude that planning of sustainable management could be greatly improved by use of our regression models and rainfall data which are widely available at local level across the Caatinga . Moreover this would obviate the need for costly forest inventories .

@highlight Caatinga management promotes low GHG emission and sustainable wood fuel supply.
@highlight Growth depends on rainfall and hardly on soil or original standing stock.
@highlight Forest management practices regulations should be based on local rainfall patterns.
@highlight Available rainfall data are an accurate tool to predict growth of managed stands.
