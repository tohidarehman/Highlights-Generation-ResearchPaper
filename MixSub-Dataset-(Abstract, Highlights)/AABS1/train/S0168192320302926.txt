 Extreme drought events exert both immediate and prolonged influences on terrestrial ecosystems yet the patterns and mechanisms of the delayed effects of extreme drought on alpine ecosystems remain largely unknown . In this study we use satellite derived normalized difference vegetation index data to examine the legacy effect of severe drought events on vegetation greenness across the Tibetan Plateau . A pervasive negative drought legacy effect lasting about one year is detected for all plant functional types including forests shrubs and grasslands on the TP . The magnitude of the identified legacy effect namely the reduced growing season NDVI in the first year post drought is spatially heterogeneous and exhibits a clear altitude dependence while divergent relationships between elevation and the legacy effect are observed between alpine meadow and steppe . For alpine meadow more pronounced legacy effects occur at higher altitudes with lower precipitation and temperature suggesting a weaker drought resilience of alpine meadow under dryer and colder conditions . Whereas for alpine steppe the magnitude of the negative legacies reduces as precipitation decreases along the elevation which might be due to a greater adaptability to drought under more arid conditions that enables plant communities to recover to their normal state faster in these very dry regions . Our results advance the understanding of drought legacy effects on TP alpine ecosystems and highlight future avenues for research into how different alpine ecosystem types will respond to drought stress .

@highlight Pervasive drought legacy effects on vegetation greenness were detected on the Tibetan Plateau.
@highlight Magnitude of the legacy effect is elevation dependent across the plateau.
@highlight This elevation dependence differs between alpine meadow and alpine steppe.
@highlight Distinct legacy effects may be due to diverse hydrothermal conditions across the altitude.
