 Allergic conjunctivitis resulting from conjunctival reactive inflammation is a common ocular surface disease . Quercetin is known for its anti allergic properties but its effects on conjunctivitis are less well understood . In this study we evaluated the anti allergic effects of quercetin in animal models of conjunctivitis and explored its molecular mechanism of action in cultured human mast cells . Quercetin inhibited the ovalbumin induced expression of IgE HA IL 4 TNF and substance P in the peripheral blood of AC mouse models . Quercetin also attenuated OVA induced MC degranulation eosinophil number substance P concentrations and mRNA IL 4 TNF expression in the conjunctival tissue of AC models . In vitro analysis showed that quercetin reduced DNP HSA IgE induced calcium influx and suppressed degranulation and chemokine release in LAD2 cells . Quercetin also inhibited DNP HSA IgE induced Lyn PLC IP3RCa2 activation Lyn ERK1 2 signaling and Lyn NF B activation in LAD2 cells all of which promote inflammation . When added alone quercetin had no effect on PLC1 phosphorylation or expression but potently inhibited Lyn and phosphorylation Lyn . Quercetin and Lyn inhibitors inhibit the activity of Lyn kinase and quercetin can reduce the activation of Lyn kinase by Lyn agonist . These data can be preliminarily determined that quercetin can inhibit allergic conjunctivitis as a Lyn kinase inhibitor . This study illustrated the use of quercetin for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis which might act through its ability to inhibit Lyn PLC IP3RCa

@highlight Quercetin can be use as a treatment for allergic conjunctivitis.
@highlight Quercetin treatment of allergic conjunctivitis acts through Lyn Fyn PLC IP3RCa
@highlight signaling.
@highlight Quercetin acts as a Lyn kinase inhibitor to dampen the inflammatory response.
