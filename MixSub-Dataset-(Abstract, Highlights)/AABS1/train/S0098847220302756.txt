 Nuclear factor Y is composed of three subunits NF YA NF YB and NF YC and plays important roles in the regulation of plant abiotic stress response gene expression . However the function of individual soybean NF YA proteins in response to drought stress is unclear . In this study the soybean NF YA subunit gene

@highlight The
@highlight gene encodes an NF YA transcription factor located in the nucleus that responds to PEG and ABA treatment at the transcription level.
@highlight Overexpression of the
@highlight gene increases the drought resistance of transgenic
@highlight by accumulating osmotic substances slowing membrane lipid peroxidation enhancing photosynthesis regulating ABA mediated stomatal closure reducing the leaf water loss rate and affecting the transcript levels of stress related genes.
@highlight gene participates in
@highlight response to drought stress through two pathways ABA dependent and ABA independent.
