 This study explores temporal trends and spatial patterns in adverse birth outcomes in the state of Massachusetts from 2000 to 2014 . ABO include low birthweight and preterm births . This research evaluates if there are areas in Massachusetts that have experienced statistically significant increases or decreases in ABO throughout the study period . Birth data was obtained from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and only singleton live births were included for the analysis . The data were aggregated to census tracts and the total number of births and the number of ABOs were calculated for each census tract for each year . In total 1478 census tracts were included in this analysis . Trends and patterns of ABO were evaluated using the Space Time Cube and the Mann Kendall statistic and a multiple linear regression was conducted to identify potential associations between socioeconomic factors and prevalence of ABO . Results showed that there were associations between the socioeconomic indicators and the ABO rate though there were no conclusive racial disparities present throughout the state or 15 year study period . Results of this study can be used to identify areas that are experiencing an increase in ABO to potentially allow for more effective targeted intervention methods .

@highlight Rates of adverse birth outcomes increased more in white women than in black women.
@highlight Socioeconomic variables associated with rates of adverse births differ between races.
@highlight Socioeconomic variables explain little of high rates in adverse birth outcomes.
@highlight Spatiotemporal evaluation can lead to targeted health interventions.
