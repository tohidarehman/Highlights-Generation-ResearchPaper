 Groundwater over extraction is a problem facing many countries around the world . Water pricing and developing property rights to enable groundwater trade are potential demand based approaches to address the over extraction of groundwater resources . However successful implementation of groundwater trading requires knowledge about groundwater demand and its interaction substitutability with surface water and given the paucity of empirical data on groundwater markets price elasticity of groundwater demand is rarely estimated in the literature . We analysed 10 years of monthly surface and groundwater temporary market data within the Murrumbidgee catchment of the Murray Darling Basin Australia to explore a the lead lag relationship between surface and groundwater temporary markets and b the price elasticity of groundwater market demand . Results illustrate that surface water markets show price leadership to groundwater temporary markets and that groundwater demand is price elastic with a 1.05 price elasticity estimate in our time period .

@highlight We analyse price dynamics in surface and groundwater markets in the Murrumbidgee.
@highlight Surface water markets show price leadership to groundwater markets.
@highlight Groundwater demand is found elastic to price changes 1.05 using market data.
