 Mycotoxins are toxic compounds produced by the metabolism of certain fungi that threaten the food and agricultural industry . Over hundreds of mycotoxins one of the most common toxins zearalenone has toxic effects on human and animal health due to its mutagenicity treatogenicity carcinogenicity nephrotoxicity immunotoxicity and genotoxicity . In this work attenuated internal reflection spectroscopic ellipsometry combined with the signal amplification via surface plasmon resonance conditions that were proved to be a highly sensitive analytical tool in bio sensing was developed for the sensitive and selective ZEN detection in cereal products such as corn wheat rice and oat . Combined with the oligonucleotide aptamer for ZEN recognition our proposed method showed good performance with yielding 0.08ng mL LOD and 0.011000ng mL detection range . A mini review was also introduced in to compare various methods for ZEN detection .
