 Increasing both grain yield and water use efficiency nitrogen partial factor productivity of winter wheat is crucial to realize the sustainable development of agricultural production in the North China Plain . This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that a trade off between yield and efficiency could reduce water and nitrogen inputs of winter wheat in the NCP . Wheat yield WUE and NPFP under three production levels i.e . the potential high yield and high efficiency and on farm and their gaps were investigated with APSIM Wheat model . The results showed that simulated potential yields were close to observed potential yields with RMSE of 1150 kg ha

@highlight Yield and water nitrogen use efficiency under three levels were determined by APSIM.
@highlight To achieve potential yield irrigation needs to be increased rather than nitrogen.
@highlight WUE and NPFP could be increased significantly by reducing water nitrogen inputs.
@highlight This implies a high potential for wheat yield and water nitrogen efficiency win win.
