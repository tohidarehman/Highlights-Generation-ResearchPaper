 As one of the major nonbiological stresses soil salinity negatively affects agricultural productivity microbial communities and agricultural economics in impacted areas and is a significant agrarian problem worldwide that has expanded in the last few decades . The use of glycophytes is the primary limitation to such an agricultural approach . However halophytes which are proficient at obtaining essential micro macronutrients from exceedingly saline environments and thrive under conditions in which salinitysensitive crops are either unproductive or inefficient are prime candidates for utilization in these circumstances . In addition the bacterial microbiome associated with the roots of halophytic plants is a useful resource for the isolation of salttolerant bacteria with multiple plant growthpromoting characteristics such as the production of different phytohormones dissolution of insoluble inorganic phosphates siderophore production molecular nitrogen fixation the activity of 1aminocyclopropane1carboxylic acid deaminase enzyme and pathogen suppression which enhance salinity tolerance of these plants as well as glycophytes and thereby stimulate the growth of plants under salinityinduced stress . The most dominant among reported halotolerant bacterial genera in most of the halophytic plants are
