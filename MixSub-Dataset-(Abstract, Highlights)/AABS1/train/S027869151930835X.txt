 Cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity due to the abnormal production of free radicals have been observed in patients treated with the anticancer antibiotic adriamycin . The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of the heart of palm extract in preventing oxidative stress cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity induced by ADR . In this work an aqueous ethanolic extract of the heart of the

@highlight Novel heart of palm extract HP was prepared then evaluated by GC MS and HPLC.
@highlight Improvement of antioxidant enzymes and biochemical parameters in the plasma heart and kidney tissues observed in rat model treated with low and high doses of the HP against adriamycin induced cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.
@highlight Increased PD 1 in heart and kidney of treated HP groups compared to adriamycin induction group protects from oxidative organ damage.
