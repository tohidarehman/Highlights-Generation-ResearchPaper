 Soil organic carbon storage and stabilization under land use change including agricultural abandonment are critical for the recuperation of soil productivity and feedback to climate change . A space for time substitution approach was applied to investigate the responses of soil aggregation SOC storage and stabilization to agricultural abandonment in a small karst catchment in Southwest China . Soil aggregate distribution SOC concentration and

@highlight Soil aggregation SOC storage and stabilization in karst soils were evaluated.
@highlight Soil aggregation was recovered rapidly after agricultural abandonment.
@highlight Macro aggregates controlled SOC storage recovery in abandoned cropland.
@highlight SOC stabilization was enhanced following agricultural abandonment.
