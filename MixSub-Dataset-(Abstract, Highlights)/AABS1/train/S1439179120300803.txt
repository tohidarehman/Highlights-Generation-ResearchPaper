 Decomposing litter is regarded as the most important source of allelochemicals released into soil . In this study a greenhouse experiment was designed to assess the net effect of differently aged leaf litter from exotic

@highlight Phytotoxic effects of leaf litter from exotic and native trees predominate over positive effects on the growth of understory herb species.
@highlight Leaf litter from exotic tree species did not exert a more negative effect on the growth of understory herb species than litter from native trees not supporting the Novel Weapons Hypothesis.
@highlight The concentration of total phenolics and flavonoids of litter decreased while acid detergent fiber lignin and ergosterol increased as litter age increased.
@highlight Ergosterol concentration was the strongest constrictor of inhibitory effects of litter on understory species.
