 Defoliation can enhance tree water status by reducing canopy transpiration under drought . During long lasting insect outbreaks however this effect can be transient as reduced foliage affects not only transpiration but also the entire soil plant atmosphere continuum . In this study we investigated the effects of defoliation and vapor pressure deficit on plant and soil water status in balsam fir and black spruce defoliated by spruce budworm

@highlight Environmental factors and defoliation affect tree transpiration.
@highlight Long lasting defoliation reduces tree water potential

@highlight As the water status decreases soil moisture increases under defoliation.
@highlight Defoliation and VPD independently alter the soil plant air continuum.
