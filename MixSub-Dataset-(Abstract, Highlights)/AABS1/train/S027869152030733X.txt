 Epidemiologic evidence promote the inclusion of flavones in diet due to their inhibitory effects on certain types of cancers particularly in women . Among the naturally occurring plant flavonoids Apigenin 7 O glucoside is endowed with anti inflammatory anti oxidant and anti cancer activities . However its mechanism of action on cervical cancer the fourth largest cancer in women has not yet been clarified . In the current study we have determined the effect of AGL on human cervical cancer cells and studied its molecular mechanism against cervical cancer . The results showed that AGL inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells IC
