 The existing information supports the use of this material as described in this safety assessment . Hexyl isovalerate was evaluated for genotoxicity repeated dose toxicity reproductive toxicity local respiratory toxicity phototoxicity photoallergenicity skin sensitization and environmental safety . Data from read across analog hexyl isobutyrate show that hexyl isovalerate is not expected to be genotoxic . Data on read across analog propyl 2 propanoate provide a calculated MOE 100 for the repeated dose toxicity and reproductive toxicity endpoints . Data from read across analog hexyl 2 methylbutyrate do not indicate that hexyl isovalerate is a skin sensitizer . The phototoxicity photoallergenicity endpoints were evaluated based on UV spectra hexyl isovalerate is not expected to be phototoxic photoallergenic . The local respiratory toxicity endpoint was evaluated using the TTC for a Cramer Class I material and the exposure to hexyl isovalerate is below the TTC . The environmental endpoints were evaluated hexyl isovalerate was found not to be PBT as per the IFRA Environmental Standards and its risk quotients based on its current volume of use in Europe and North America are 1 .

@highlight Hexyl isovalerate a safety assessment based on RIFM s criteria.
@highlight A safety assessment based on 7 human health endpoints plus environmental.
@highlight All endpoints were cleared using target data read across and or TTC.
