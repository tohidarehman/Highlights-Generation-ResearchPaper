 Nicotine transfer via breast milk induces obesity in the adult offspring . We hypothesize that sympathetic nervous system activity brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and white adipose tissue lipogenesis adipogenesis are altered in adult rats that were exposed to nicotine exclusively during the breastfeeding period . Lactating Wistar rats were separated into two groups nicotine dams implanted with osmotic minipumps containing 6mg kg of nicotine at postnatal day 2 control dams were implanted with saline containing minipumps . Euthanasia occurred at PN120 or PN180 . NIC offspring had lower BAT SNS activity and higher BAT lipid content . NIC males showed lower UCP1 3 AR and CPT1a while NIC females showed lower UCP1 TR1 CPT1a suggesting lower thermogenesis . NIC males showed higher WAT SNS activity WAT 3 AR adrenal catecholamine FAS PPAR and adipocytes area while NIC females showed higher ACC FAS CEBP and PPAR . These findings indicate increased lipogenesis adipogenesis in both sexes with a possible compensatory sympathetic activated lipolysis in males . NIC males had higher hypothalamic pAMPK AMPK explaining the lower BAT sympathetic activity . Neonatal nicotine exposure reduces BAT SNS activity and thermogenesis and only in males increases WAT adipogenesis lipogenesis despite higher WAT SNS activity . These alterations can be associated with obesogenesis in this programming model .

@highlight Early nicotine exposure influences the brown adipose tissue in adult progeny.
@highlight Nicotine exposure increases lipogenesis adipogenesis in offspring of both sexes.
@highlight The decrease in thermogenesis in the NIC offspring may be related to late obesity.
