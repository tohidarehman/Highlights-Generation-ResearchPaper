 Land urbanization caused by human activities is increasingly converting natural land surfaces to artificial ones and modifying land surface parameters . This can lead to changes in weather conditions and further effects on air pollutants . This study examines the influence of land urbanization on meteorology and air quality in the Yangtze River Delta by simulating the impacts of land use land cover changes on meteorology and air quality . Our results show that the temperature at 2m increases by 0.20.7C and the planetary boundary layer height exhibits a maximum growth during the daytime of 116.74m after updating LULC . The average reduction of 10 m wind speed is 0.29m s and the maximum decrease is 0.52m s which occurs in the daytime due to increased surface resistance . Furthermore PM
