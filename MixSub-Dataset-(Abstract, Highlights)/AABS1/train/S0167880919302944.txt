 Neonicotinoids are considered a superior insecticide for agricultural pest management although their impacts on non target insects is a rising concern . Aside from laboratory and mesocosm studies limited research has been directed towards the role neonicotinoids may have in structuring aquatic invertebrate communities in field settings . Therefore we simultaneously collected aquatic invertebrate and surface water samples from 26 wetlands within a highly modified agricultural landscape of Nebraskas Rainwater Basin during spring 2015 . Water samples were tested for six different neonicotinoids nutrients and physical properties . Trace levels of clothianidin and imidacloprid were the only neonicotinoids detected occurring in 85 and 15 respectively of wetlands sampled . All measurements for clothianidin and imidacloprid were below chronic toxicity benchmarks set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency . Neonicotinoid concentrations were significantly lower W

@highlight Neonicotinoids are frequently detected in wetlands during early spring prior to planting.
@highlight Low concentrations are observed during early spring and likely not associated with direct mortality of aquatic invertebrate species.
@highlight Sub lethal effects of neonicotinoids likely influence nektonic biomass during early spring.
@highlight Vegetative buffer strips can prevent a significant amount of neonicotinoids from entering wetlands.
