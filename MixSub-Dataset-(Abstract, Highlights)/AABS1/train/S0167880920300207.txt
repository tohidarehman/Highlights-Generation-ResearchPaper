 Mounting evidence suggests that increasing within species crop diversity by planting mixtures of cultivars is a promising tactic for managing herbivorous pests . The soybean aphid

@highlight Aphid pressure and yield in cultivar mixtures were intermediary vs. in monocultures.
@highlight Potato leafhopper populations were higher in mixtures via non additive effects.
@highlight Cultivar mixtures increased or decreased predator abundance.
@highlight Effect of diversity on predators varied with time of season and sampling time.
@highlight Diversity increased
@highlight abundance during the day in one year of study.
