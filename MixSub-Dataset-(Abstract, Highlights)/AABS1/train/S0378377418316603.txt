 Although deficit irrigation may have the potential to optimize crop yields in water limited environments the success of such strategies may depend on the ability to manage variability in profile stored soil water during periods of drought . Understanding variability in stored soil water and crop rooting depth is an important component of successfully managing a deficit irrigation strategy . Traditionally DI is applied at a fraction of the full irrigation requirement but managed deficit irrigation may optimize yield and irrigation by coordinating irrigation timing with the crops reproductive stages through the management of soil water depletion and water stress . The depth of the soil water use by grain sorghum Moench was evaluated in the High Plains of Texas USA under FI DI and MDI strategies during the 20102012 growing seasons . Crop water use during critical growth stages was year specific due to variable precipitation and antecedent soil moisture even though irrigation strategies were maintained as planned in all years . In 2010 soil water contents within the rooting zone were 50 of the potential plant available water

@highlight Deficit irrigation strategies did not stimulate rooting and soil water extraction at deeper depths.
@highlight The depth of soil water extraction varied among years.
@highlight Under all irrigation treatments rooting depth was limited by soil water storage.
@highlight Deep profile soil water that was assumed available resulted in crop water stress.
@highlight Maximum leaf area index did not correspond to the same physiological stage in all years
