 The application of nanotechnology in food packaging is widely considered during the last two decades . In this regard numerous studies have been conducted regarding applying nanomaterials such as zinc oxide clay silver carbon nanotube titanium dioxide and copper and copper oxide in food packaging which were summarized in the current study . The employing of nano food packaging increases the physicochemical quality of food and reduces the microbial load by cell membrane function Trojan horse and reactive oxygen mechanisms while they improve the barrier mechanical properties of food packaging . Although nano food packaging has many advantages for public health the associated toxicity due to migration especially in acidic conditions is considerable . Further studies regarding the advantages and disadvantages of this technique are recommended .
