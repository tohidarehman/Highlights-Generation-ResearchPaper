 The present study was aimed at assessing the exposure of an adult population to nine BPs analogues through a duplicate diet study . Up to 40 canned and non canned food samples were purchased from Tarragona and further analyzed . Three of the nine BPs BPA BPB and BPE were detected in the food samples . BPA was found in 93 and 36 of canned and non canned samples respectively with a mean concentration of 22.49 and 4.73g kg respectively . Only one sample of canned asparagus exceeded the new threshold set by the European Commission . BPB was found in canned and non canned chicken and olive oil samples with lower levels for canned chicken and non canned olive oil . Finally BPE was detected in non canned mushrooms and nuts . Based on the current results dietary intake for BPA was estimated to be 24.9 and 3.11g day for canned and non canned groups respectively . The unexpected occurrence of BPs in non canned products highlights the ubiquity of these compounds along the food production chain beyond to the packaging .

@highlight Apart from BPA other BP analogues may occur in canned and non canned foodstuffs.
@highlight BPA was the most detected analogue in food regardless the kind of container.
@highlight In a high exposure scenario the BPA dietary intake was estimated in 24.9g day.
@highlight BPA levels in canned asparagus exceeded the current threshold set by the EFSA.
@highlight Beyond packaging BPs may be ubiquitously found through the food production chain.
