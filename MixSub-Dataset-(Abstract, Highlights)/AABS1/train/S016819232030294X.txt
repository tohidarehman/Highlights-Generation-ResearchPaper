 The intimate connection between roots and soil particles is a prerequisite for the continuous flow of water and nutrients from soil to trees and carbon flow from roots to the rhizosphere . The soil root interface has been studied in multiple laboratory and greenhouse experiments . Yet its multiple roles and their differential contributions to tree health have rarely been experimentally studied on mature trees in the field .

@highlight The soil root interface accommodates the exchange of water carbon and nutrients.
@highlight Transplantation of mature olive trees was used as a manipulation study.
@highlight Transplanted trees had lower root starch and photosynthesis rate than control trees.
@highlight Soil P and K were lower under transplanted trees that recovered the stress.
@highlight Our observations suggest a long term stress unrelated with water or carbon supply.
