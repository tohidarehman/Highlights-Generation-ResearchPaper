 Urine patches represent hot spots of nitrogen loss in dairy grazed soils . Targeted application of urease and nitrification inhibitors that slow down certain N transformations in the urine patches is a potential method to reduce N losses . However for optimum effectiveness the inhibitors need to be in close physical contact with the urine in the soil under urine patches . In practice there will always be some time delay between urine deposition and application of inhibitors . It is therefore important to understand how the urine is transported in the soil following deposition . In this study we developed an empirical model of urine patch area from thermal images of urine patches applied on two different soil types at two different initial moisture contents and with three different applied urine volumes . Spatial measurements using Spikey R were used to test the model . A linear regression model of the ratio against the soil air filled pore space explained 45 of the variation in the ratio and had a Nash Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.74 in predicting the mean patch area . This regression model was then used to define the boundary conditions for HYDRUS2D 3D simulations of urine movement through the soil after application . These simulations reasonably predicted the amount of urine N in the top 50 and 100mm of the soil 4h after application but the model efficiencies were only 0.18 and 0.14 after 24h . The measurements also had a high degree of spatial variability .

@highlight A model of urine patch area was developed that explained 45 of the variability.
@highlight Patch area was related to urine volume applied and soil air filled pore space.
@highlight HYDRUS simulated urine N depth distribution better at 4h than 24h after application.
@highlight We neglected NH
@highlight volatilisation and denitrification processes.
