 Recent studies showed great variations in both soil inorganic carbon and organic carbon in cropland across the North China Plain . This work was designed to test the hypothesis that hydrological processes associated with the Yellow River may be responsible for the differences in soil carbon dynamics over space . We selected 22 sites from the wheat maize cropland across the Yellow River in the south North China Plain and measured SOC SIC water extractable organic carbon and other soil properties over 020 2040 4060 6080 and 80100 cm . Our results showed that SOC and SIC stocks were 5.82 1.26 kg C m

@highlight SIC stock was positively correlated with SOC stock with soil pH 7.8.
@highlight SOC was significantly lower in the subsoils of Fluvo aquic near the Yellow River.
@highlight WEOC SOC ratio was significantly higher in the subsoils of Fluvo aquic.
@highlight The low SOC near the Yellow River may be associated with hydrological processes.
