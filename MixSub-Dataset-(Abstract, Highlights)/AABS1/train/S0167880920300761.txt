 Riparian buffer strips provide a wide range of ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes with benefits extending beyond those provided by non riparian field margins . For example in addition to enhancing the aesthetic value of the landscape and protecting biodiversity riparian buffer strips also mitigate diffuse pollution and provide inputs to freshwater systems . Their multifunctional nature makes developing management prescriptions complex with the need to identify conflicts interactions and synergies between the services offered . Here we explore how the placement physical properties management and vegetation structure influence the potential of riparian buffer strips to deliver a range of benefits .
