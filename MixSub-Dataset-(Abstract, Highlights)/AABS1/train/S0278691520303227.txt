 Beauvericin and enniatin B are non legislated Fusarium mycotoxins usually found in cereal and cereal based products all around the world . By the proteomic analysis of mitochondria enriched extracts from Jurkat cells exposed for 24h to three concentrations of BEA EN B a number of 1821 proteins were identified and relatively quantified . 340 proteins were statistically significant altered in our samples 1.5 . The protein mitochondrial translational release factor 1 like was the most abundant protein in the three mycotoxin exposures studied . The mycotoxins mixture exposure induced concentration dependent changes at mitochondrial proteins levels that mainly involve inner and outer membrane complexes Electron Transport Chain and ribosomes . These results showed alteration of proteins levels related to oxidative phosphorylation metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases related pathways .

@highlight EN B and BEA mixture provoques mitochondrial toxicity at proteomic level.
@highlight Proteomics analysis revealed 340 proteins significative altered 59 mitochondrial.
@highlight Oxidative phosporylation pathway analysis reported 24 altered genes.
