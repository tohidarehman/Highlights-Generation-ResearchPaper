 Unintentional intake of allergens through food products poses a daily risk for allergic patients . Models estimating the risk of reactions mostly use intake data from general population surveys . Our study evaluates the comparability of food intake levels in the general population to those in the food allergic population . Data were collected by a 24 h recall method on 2 non consecutive days in 38 cow s milk and or hen s egg and 35 peanut and or tree nut allergic adult patients . All products were assigned to food groups previously developed for allergen risk assessment . Food intake distributions from the allergic populations and a matched sample from the Dutch National Food Consumption Survey were compared and risk assessments were performed . Food intake data was obtained for 92 of the food groups . Comparison of the intake showed no statistically significant differences between either of the two allergic populations and the general population . Consequently only small variations in estimated risks were found that would not result in different risk management decisions . In conclusion food intake data from the general population can be used for food allergen risk assessment and will not lead to a relevant under or overestimation of the risk for the food allergic population .

@highlight The current study provides insight into the consumption amounts eaten by allergic patients.
@highlight Food allergic patients and the general population eat equal quantities of food groups.
@highlight Intake data from national food consumption surveys can be used for food allergen risk assessments.
