 Regular consumption of polyphenol rich fruits and vegetables is associated with beneficial health outcomes . To increase polyphenol intakes consumers are increasingly using herbal and botanical dietary supplements containing concentrated polyphenol extracts . However the safety of this consumption modality has not been vetted . To address this ovariectomized Sprague Dawley rats were orally gavaged with purified blueberry polyphenols at 01000mg total polyphenols kg bw d for 90d . No differences in behavior body weight or food consumption were observed . No tumors or macroscopic changes were observed and histopathological analyses showed no differences among groups . Although several statistically significant differences between treatment and control groups were observed in urine and blood analyses these parameters were within normal ranges and not considered biologically significant . Intestinal permeability assessed via FITC dextran showed increased intestinal permeability in the highest dose though no morphological differences were found throughout the gastrointestinal tract . Given the lack of other systemic changes this finding is likely of minimal physiological importance . These results indicate a NOAEL for blueberry polyphenols in OVX SD rats is1000mg total polyphenols kg bw d which translates to a 70kg human consuming 10g polyphenols . Keywords Blueberry Polyphenol Sub chronic toxicity .
