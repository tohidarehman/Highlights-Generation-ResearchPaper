 Insect based foods are starting to enter the EU market raising concerns about their safety . Allergic consumers might be exposed to even a greater risk since insects have proven to trigger allergic symptoms particularly in patients sensitised to crustaceans . Current legislation does not enforce producers to include insects in the list of allergenic ingredients . Food allergenicity risk assessment is still at its infancy and the debate on the need to define allergen thresholds is open . In this paper we aimed at applying the concepts of stochastic quantitative FARA to describe present and future scenarios of exposure to foods containing

@highlight The yellow mealworm
@highlight is a novel food potentially able to trigger allergic reactions.
@highlight We carried out a quantitative risk assessment on the allergenicity of yellow mealworm based food products.
@highlight Individuals allergic to crustaceans are at risk of developing allergy after ingesting few grams of mealworm based foods.
