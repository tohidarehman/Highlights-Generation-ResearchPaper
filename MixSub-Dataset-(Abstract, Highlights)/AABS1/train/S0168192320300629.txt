 Increasing the soil carbon stock by optimizing the grassland management is seen as a potential cost effective mitigation strategy to counteract greenhouse gas emissions from pasture fields associated with the application of fertilizer or cattle excreta . This study presents results of GHG flux measurements in a paired field experiment of two neighboring grazing systems over a full year . Each pasture was grazed by 12 dairy cows in a rotational grazing management . Different feeding strategies resulted in different nitrogen excretion rates . The field scale emissions of CO
