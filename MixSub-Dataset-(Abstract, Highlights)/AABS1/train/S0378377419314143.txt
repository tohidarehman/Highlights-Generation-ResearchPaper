 The plastic mulched ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting system improves precipitation utilization and yield in semi arid regions . For densely planted crops such as winter wheat however the ridges reduce planting area . Thus optimal ridge and furrow configurations for winter wheat cultivation remain unknown . Here we evaluated the effects of various ridge furrow ratios on soil hydrothermal properties winter wheat growth yield resource use efficiency and profitability under different precipitation years in 20142017 . A control and three different ridge furrow ratios 60 60 and 80 60 were tested . Firstly PRFRH increased soil water storage and temperature . The soil moisture content assumed a bell shaped distribution which was centered on the planting furrow in the 080 cm range . The soil water storage increased with mulched ridge width but it will not significantly increase while the mulched ridge width was too wide . The soil temperature of ridge also increased with mulched ridge width whereas the soil temperature decreased in furrow . Moreover precipitation years had no obvious effect on soil water storage or temperature . Secondly the dry matter accumulation was captured quite well by the Logistic

@highlight Excessively wide mulched ridge cannot significantly increase soil water storage.
@highlight Ridge soil temperature increased and furrows decreased with mulched ridge width.
@highlight Appropriate ridge furrow ratio can mitigate the impact of drought on wheat yield.
@highlight Optimal ridge width for the water related resource was higher than thermal resource.
@highlight The optimal mulched ridge and furrow was both 60 cm for winter wheat.
