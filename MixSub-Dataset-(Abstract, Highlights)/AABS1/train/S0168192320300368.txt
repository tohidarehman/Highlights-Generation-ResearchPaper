 A comprehensive understanding of the effects of agricultural management on climatecrop interactions has yet to emerge . Using a novel waveletstatistics conjunction approach we analysed the synchronisation amongst fluxes and seven environmental factors on 19 farm sites across Australia and New Zealand . Irrigation and fertilisation practices improved positive coupling between net ecosystem productivity and evapotranspiration as hypothesised . Highly intense management tended to protect against heat stress especially for irrigated crops in dry climates . By contrast stress avoidance in the vegetation of tropical and hot desert climates was identified by reverse coupling between NEP and sensible heat flux . Some environmental factors were found to be under management control whereas others were fixed as constraints at a given location . Irrigated crops in dry climates showed high predictability of fluxes given only knowledge of fluctuations in climate R

@highlight Predictability of fluxes was evaluated across nineteen agricultural sites.
@highlight High intensity management promoted coupling of carbon water and energy fluxes.
@highlight Some environmental factors were affected by management and others were fixed.
@highlight Temporal complementarity of water and energy limitations degraded predictability.
