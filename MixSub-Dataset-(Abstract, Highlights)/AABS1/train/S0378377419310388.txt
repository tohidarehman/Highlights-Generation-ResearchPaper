 Excessive fertilization in rice paddy fields leads to surface water eutrophication groundwater contamination and air pollution . Determining optimum nitrogen management is essential for maintaining rice yield while reducing the environmental risk caused by N loss . A two year field experiment was carried out in a typical paddy field in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River . The WHCNS model was calibrated and evaluated for simulations of measured ponding water depth evapotranspiration aboveground dry matter yield runoff and crop N. The model was then used to evaluate the effects of different N fertilizer rates and split N application ratios practices on crop growth and N losses . Results showed that the model performed well in simulating rice growth and N losses in the region . Ammonia volatilization and denitrification were the mainly pathways of N loss in paddy field and their two year average losses were 34 and 38 of the total N loss respectively . N leaching accounted for 23 and runoff N loss accounted for 5 of total N loss . N losses were evaluated for two different scenarios and simulated ratios of ammonia volatilization denitrification N leaching and runoff to total N loss under different N management scenarios were 15 53 33 55 6 30 and 4 8 respectively . Ammonia volatilization and N runoff exponentially increased with an increase of N fertilizer rate whereas denitrification and N leaching showed an increasing and then a decreasing trend . Yield increased by 36kg ha

@highlight The WHCNS model performed well in simulating rice growth water and N fates.
@highlight Ammonia volatilization and N runoff exponentially increased with N fertilizer rate.
@highlight Ammonia volatilization and denitrification accounted for 72 of the total N loss.
@highlight Reducing the total N rate and increasing topdressing rate can effectively reduce N loss.
@highlight The optimal N management was recommended to reduce negative environmental impacts.
