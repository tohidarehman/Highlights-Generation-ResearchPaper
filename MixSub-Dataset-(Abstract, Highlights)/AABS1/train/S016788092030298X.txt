 Human activity is thought to perturb the dynamic change of organic carbon but its impact on the transportation and redistribution of erosion induced OC is still poorly understood . Here we use multi source field sampling data and long term hydrological observation data to clarify the transportation and redistribution of OC in an agricultural watershed on the Loess Plateau . The endmember mixing model based on the radiocarbon isotopes

@highlight Land use change significantly reduces the lateral transport of sediment and SOC.
@highlight About 21.642.9 of the mobilized SOC is effectively buried behind the check dams.
@highlight Soil conservation measures generated significant carbon sequestration effect.
@highlight The composition and age of SOC were quantified by radiocarbon isotopes.
