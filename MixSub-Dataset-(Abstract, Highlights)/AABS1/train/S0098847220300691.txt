 Wild soybean is the progenitor of cultivated soybean that has excellent low nitrogen tolerance . This study revealed the mechanism of resistance to low N in wild soybean seedling roots by analyzing the differences in the physiology metabolome and transcriptome . Under low N stress low

@highlight This study used a combination of physiology metabolism and transcription.
@highlight Low nitrogen tolerance mechanism of Low nitrogen tolerant wild soybean.
@highlight This research helps to mine and utilize superior wild soybean resources.
