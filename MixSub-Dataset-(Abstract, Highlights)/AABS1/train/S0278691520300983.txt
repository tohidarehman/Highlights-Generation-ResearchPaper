 6 2 Fluorotelomer alcohol is a short chain polyfluoroalkyl substance in polymeric PFAS used in fast food packaging and stain and water resistant textiles and may be degradation products of some components of aqueous film forming foams . The general population is exposed to 6 2 FTOH by inhalation of evaporates from treated surfaces or ambient concentrations in air ingestion of indoor dust or ingestion of food packaged in materials containing PFAS . Although exposure to 6 2 FTOH is pervasive little is known concerning human health effects of this compound . Some published risk assessments have assumed that perfluorohexanoic acid a metabolite of 6 2 FTOH adequately models the human health effects of 6 2 FTOH . Recently identified studies conducted with 6 2 FTOH and its metabolite 5 3 acid have provided information that enables comparison of the toxicological profiles of PFHxA and 6 2 FTOH . This article summarizes a comparative analysis of the toxicological effects of PFHxA and 6 2 FTOH in rodents to determine whether data for PFHxA adequately models potential hazards of 6 2 FTOH exposure . Our analysis demonstrates that 6 2 FTOH is significantly more toxic than PFHxA . Use of toxicological studies conducted with PFHxA to assess 6 2 FTOH exposure may significantly underestimate human health risk .
