 Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles require stable surface modifications to render safe nanocapsules for biomedical applications . Herein two types of surface modified poly encapsulated SPION were synthesized using either tocopheryl polyetheleneglycol succinate or didodecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide as surfactants by emulsification . SPION TPGS was larger than SPION DMAB and uncoated SPION . Both formulations were positively charged and induced lower cyto genotoxicity and ROS generation than uncoated SPION in human lymphocytes . SPION DMAB was least cyto genotoxic among the three . Based on these results mice were gavaged with the formulations for 5 consecutive days and biocompatibility studies were performed on the 7th and 21st days . ICP AES and Prussian blue staining revealed the internalization of SPION DMAB in brain and spleen and SPION TPGS in liver and kidney on day 7 . This was correlated with high DNA damage and oxidative stress in the same organs . Substantial clearance of Fe was accompanied by reduced genotoxicity and oxidative stress on day 21 . Therefore SPION DMAB can be further studied for oral drug delivery to the brain and imaging of cerebral tissue without any functional ligand or external magnetic field .

@highlight Surface modified SPION show superior colloidal stability than uncoated SPION.
@highlight SPION DMAB and SPION TPGS show lower cyto genotoxicity and ROS generation than uncoated SPION in human lymphocytes.
@highlight SPION induced genotoxicity and oxidative stress is modulated after treatment cessation in mice.
@highlight SPION DMAB shows high internalization in the brain of mice and can be used in brain imaging.
