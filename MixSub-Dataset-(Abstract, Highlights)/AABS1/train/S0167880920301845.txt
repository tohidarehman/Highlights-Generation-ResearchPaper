 Understanding the spatially varying relationships between landscape pattern and water quality in the agricultural karst river system is helpful for landscape planning and management to protect water quality . In this study empirical models were established to examine the impact of landscape pattern on the seasonal water quality at multi spatial scales in a typical karst river basin in Southwestern China . Water samples from the Chishui River basin were collected and analysed during both the wet and dry seasons . KruskalWallis tests revealed significant seasonal variations in water physic chemical parameter variables the values of which were all generally higher in the wet period than those in the dry period except for pH and SO

@highlight The relationships between landscape patterns and water quality are scale dependent.
@highlight Water quality variation is better explained by landscape pattern at catchment scale.
@highlight The influence of landscape pattern on water quality is stronger in the dry season.
@highlight Geographical characteristics influence water quality by interacting with land use.
