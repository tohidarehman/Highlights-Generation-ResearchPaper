 In toxicological health risk assessment epistemic uncertainties often remain preventing definitive statements about whether a chemical constitues a risk . In this study we analyzed public appraisals of uncertain risks of food additives and contaminants . We identified three major characteristics of public appraisal . First hazard appraisals differed consistently from risk appraisals respondents were less disturbed by a possible health risk than by the mere presence of the chemical substance in food . Second while a majority understood that exposure determines whether a chemical constitutes a risk many respondents thought that all chemicals are equally harmful . This suggests a mismatch between beliefs about exposure and beliefs about toxicity . Finally the higher people valued certainty about food safety and the less they considered uncertainty about a risk acceptable the more severe they appraised the presence of the chemical substance in food . This suggests that a mismatch between the level of uncertainty that people expect about food safety and the actual level of scientific uncertainty affects how people evaluate the presence of chemical substances in food . Following the findings implications for risk communication are discussed .

@highlight People are less disturbed by the possible risk of a chemical substance in food than by the mere presence of the chemical in food.
@highlight A large majority of the public understands that exposure determines whether a chemical constitutes a health risk.
@highlight A significant minority of the public thinks that all chemicals are equally harmful.
@highlight A mismatch between expected and actual uncertainty about food safety may affect the evaluation of the presence of chemicals in food.
