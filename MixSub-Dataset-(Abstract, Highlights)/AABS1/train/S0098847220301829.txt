 The search for more productive crops is exploring accessions with reduced chlorophyll accumulation in leaves which would promote plant growth mainly because of a higher light transmittance throughout the canopy . Under continuous light chlorophyll depleted

@highlight A disturbance in photosynthetic electron flow affects the chlorophyll depleted wheat mutants.
@highlight Unexpectedly long term acclimation to light fluctuations can be allowed in mutants.
@highlight Successful development of a fluctuating light phenotype depends on the mutated locus.
@highlight Compensation of the mutation involves use of alternative electron sinks and thylakoid structural re organization.
