 We investigated the effects of tocilizumab on endothelial glycocalyx a determinant of vascular permeability and myocardial function in rheumatoid arthritis . Eighty RA patients were randomized to tocilizumab or conventional synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and glucocorticoids for 3 months . Forty healthy subjects with similar age and sex served as controls . We measured perfused boundary region of the sublingual arterial microvessels pulse wave velocity global LV longitudinal strain global work index using speckle tracking echocardiography and e C reactive protein malondialdehyde and protein carbonyls as oxidative stress markers at baseline and post treatment . Compared to controls RA patients had impaired glycocalyx and myocardial deformation markers . Compared with baseline tocilizumab reduced PBR while no significant differences were observed post csDMARDs GC . Compared with csDMARDs GC tocilizumab achieved a greater increase of GLS GWI and reduction of MDA PCs and CRP . The percent improvement of glycocalyx thickness was associated with the percent decrease of PWV MDA PCs and the percent improvement of GLS and GWI . Tocilizumab improves endothelial function leading to a greater increase of effective myocardial work than csDMARDs GC through a profound reduction of inflammatory burden and oxidative stress . This mechanism may explain the effects of tocilizumab on COVID 19. url

@highlight Tocilizumab improves endothelial glycocalyx and increases effective myocardial work.
@highlight IL 6 inhibition significantly reduces the inflammatory burden and oxidative stress.
@highlight Tocilizumab may have favorable effects on diseases with excess IL 6 release.
