 Sanggenol L is one component of root bark of Morus alba . The molecular and cellular mechanisms of sanggenol L effects on melanoma cells are not well known . Recently melanoma is the most common skin cancer with a high mortality rate not only in United States but also in East Asia . Therefore safe and effective treatments for melanoma treatment are required . In this study we investigated whether or not sanggenol L possesses anti cancer activity in human and mouse melanoma skin cancer cells . Sanggenol L treatment exerted significant cell growth inhibitory effects and inhibited colony formation capacity against B16 SK MEL 2 and SK MEL 28 melanoma skin cancer cells whereas HaCaT human epithelial keratinocyte cells was unaffected by sanggenol L treatment . Sanggenol L treatment resulted in apoptotic cell death in melanoma skin cancer cells which was characterized by accumulation of apoptotic cells nuclear condensation and apoptotic bodies . We also showed that sanggenol L treatment induced caspase dependent apoptosis induction of caspase independent apoptosis in melanoma skin cancer cells . These results suggest that sanggenol L induces caspase dependent and independent apoptosis in melanoma skin cancer cells .

@highlight Sanggenol L induced the apoptotic cell death in various melanoma skin cancer cells whereas normal cells were unaffected.
@highlight Sanggenol L induced up or down regulation of apoptosis related proteins in melanoma skin cancer cells.
@highlight This study is the first to elucidate induction of apoptotic mechanisms by sanggenol L in melanoma skin cancer cells.
