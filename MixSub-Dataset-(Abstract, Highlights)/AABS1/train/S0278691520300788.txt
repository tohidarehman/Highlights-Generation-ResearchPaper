 Acrylamide is a heat induced carcinogen substance that is found in some foods due to cooking or other thermal processes . The aim of present study was to assess the probable protective effects of morin against ACR induced hepatorenal toxicity in rats . The rats were treated with ACR alone or with morin for 10 consecutive days . Morin treatment attenuated the ACR induced liver and kidney tissue injury by diminishing the serum AST ALP ALT urea and creatinine levels . Morin increased activities of SOD CAT and GPx and levels of GSH and suppressed lipid peroxidation in ACR induced tissues . Histopathological changes and immunohistochemical expressions of p53 EGFR nephrin and AQP2 in the ACR induced liver and kidney tissues were decreased after administration of morin . In addition morin reversed the changes in levels of apoptotic autophagic and inflammatory parameters such as caspase 3 bax bcl 2 cytochrome

@highlight Morin protects rats against ACR induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.
@highlight Morin reduces apoptosis and autophagy in the ACR induced toxicity.
@highlight Morin depressed levels of oxidative stress and pro inflammatory cytokines.
@highlight Morin regulated the PI3K Akt mTOR signaling pathway in the ACR induced toxicity.
