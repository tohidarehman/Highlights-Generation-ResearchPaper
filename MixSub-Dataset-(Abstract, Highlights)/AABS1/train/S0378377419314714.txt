 Small and large scale biochar based filtrations were conducted to investigate the potential of biochar as a low cost renewable filtration medium in aquaponics . The small scale experimental design investigated the effects of 2 biochar media sizes and 3 5mm 3 biochar bed heights and 3 loading rates 5 10 and 15 m

@highlight Biochar represents a low cost renewable filtration media in aquaponics.
@highlight Biochar clarifies fish effluent through removal of suspended particles and turbidity.
@highlight The filtration process is affected by filter design and loading rate.
@highlight Biochar is useful as effluent polishing media before discharge to plant growth system.
