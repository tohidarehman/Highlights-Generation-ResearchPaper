 CVD and cancer are the two leading causes of death worldwide . Improvement in cancer early detection and treatment has resulted in an increased number of cancer survivors . However many of the survivors tend to develop CVD often leading to their demise . Conversely people with pre existing CVD conditions especially the elderly have increased chances of developing cancer and dying from the same . The World Health Organization consequently recommends joint management of both diseases . However in Sweden as with many other countries few studies have explored the nature of the associations between the two disease mortalities and their spatial variation at a population level .

@highlight Most elderly cancer survivors tend to die of cardiovascular CVD related diseases.
@highlight It is critical to identify areas where these two main causes of death spatially overlap.
@highlight The Correlation between CVD and cancer crude mortality rates among the Swedish elderly is averagely positive.
@highlight Cancer spatial clusters are enclaved within the bigger CVD spatial clusters.
