 Most strategies for limiting global climate change invoke the use of bioenergy but biofuel crops vary in climate mitigation potential and in the provision of other ecosystem services . The predominant biofuel in North America is ethanol produced from corn

@highlight Native perennial biofuel crops support more biodiversity than corn fields.
@highlight Restored prairies and switchgrass crops support up to 185 more ant species.
@highlight Prairies and switchgrass also provide up to 55 more natural pest suppression.
@highlight Corn fields lack two functional groups of antsseed dispersers and social parasites.
