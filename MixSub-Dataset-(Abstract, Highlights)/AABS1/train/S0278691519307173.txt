 The present study was conducted to examine the influence of dietary canola oil and partially hydrogenated soybean oil compared to soybean oil on the morphology and function of testes using miniature pigs as the test subject . Male miniature pigs were fed a diet containing 10 SOY 9 CAN 1 SOY or 9 HSO 1 SOY for 18 months . The scheduled autopsies revealed no abnormalities in histopathological examination of the major organs except the testes . Atrophy of the seminiferous tubules and hyperplasia in the Leydig cells were found in the SOY and CAN groups . DNA microarray analysis indicated downregulation in the CAN and the HSO groups of genes encoding for gonadotropins in the pituitary gland and of enzymes and proteins involved in steroid hormone metabolism in the testes compared to the SOY group . Plasma levels of sex hormones in the CAN and HSO groups tended to be higher and testosterone and dihydrotestosteorne in the HSO group were significantly higher than in the SOY group . These results demonstrate that testes are morphologically and functionally affected by the dietary oils while the plasma steroid hormone levels do not necessarily reflect the gene expression probably owing to feedback regulation via the gonadal hormones in the hypothalamus pituitary gonadal axis .

@highlight Testis is the target of dietary canola and partially hydrogenated soybean oils in pigs.
@highlight Canola and partially hydrogenated soybean oils modify steroid metabolism.
@highlight Gonadal hormones may be involved in the modified sex hormone levels by dietary oils.
@highlight Toxicity of canola and partially hydrogenated soybean oils show species difference.
