 Inefficient and over use of nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation water are the severe issues with adverse economic and environmental impacts . In present study the effect of buried straw layer coupled with fertigation was investigated on fruit yield water use efficiency and quality of greenhouse grown tomato for two consecutive years . A randomized block design with three factors 1 straw S

@highlight A 2 years field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of fertigation and buried straw layer on greenhouse tomato.
@highlight increased fruit yield by 16.524.7 when compared to S
@highlight Comparing with S
@highlight  the fruit yield was reduced by 28.645.8 under S
@highlight TOPSIS analysis indicated that S
@highlight had the best fruit quality while S
@highlight resulted in the least fruit quality.
