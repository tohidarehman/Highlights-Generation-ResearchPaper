 Alternative water sources for crop production need to be identified in order to meet increasing food demand under climate change scenario . However unconventional water source can contain micropollutants like endocrine disruptors and pharmaceuticals due to their persistence after the most common wastewater treatments . Rice is the staple food of more than half of the world s population which requires high volumes of water to achieve optimal yields . For this reason also low micropollutants concentration can represent a serious problem due to the stack in the trophic chain . At the state of art the effects of these compounds on crops yield and quality remain largely unknown . To fill this gap the aim of this work was to determine the effects of caffeine and ibuprofen on the growth of

@highlight Pharmaceuticals are not sufficiently removed from treated wastewaters.
@highlight Ibuprofen and caffeine are common micropollutants identified in wastewaters.
@highlight reduced caffeine accumulation in rice grains and
@highlight did not interact with the ibuprofen accumulation in rice grains.
@highlight About 0.07 ibuprofen supplied with irrigation water was recovered in the grain.
