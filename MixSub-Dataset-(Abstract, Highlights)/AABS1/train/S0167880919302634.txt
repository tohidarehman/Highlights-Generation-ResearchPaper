 Adaptive multi paddock grazing has demonstrated the potential to substantially improve ecosystems service outcomes relative to the most commonly used grazing management of moderate and heavy continuous grazing . We hypothesize that AMP grazing would decrease net soil emissions of CO

@highlight AMP grazing had lower soil temperature and higher moisture than HC and MC grazing.
@highlight AMP grazing had highest and HC the lowest CO2 emissions.
@highlight AMP grazing had much lower N
@highlight O emissions than HC and MC.
@highlight AMP had lower CH
@highlight emissions and was a stronger N
@highlight O sink than HC and MC grazing.
