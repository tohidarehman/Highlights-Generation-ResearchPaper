 Soil acidification limits crop and pasture production and leads to the degradation of agroecosystems . The dissolution of aluminum in acidic soils can lead to Al toxicity towards plants depending on the species of Al present and can decrease crop yield . Different organic materials have been suggested to alleviate Al toxicity and increase the yields of important crops such as sweet potato

@highlight Organic and inorganic amendments decreased soil acidity and Al toxicity.
@highlight Organic and inorganic amendments increased yield of sweet potato.
@highlight Alleviating Al toxicity and increasing nutrients are important for crop growth.
@highlight Combination of organic with inorganic amendments is a good choice for acidic soils.
