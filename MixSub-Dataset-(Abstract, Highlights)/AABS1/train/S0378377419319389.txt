 A tomato field experiment under deficit irrigation treatments was established to assess the feasibility of nonlinear mixed models to predict the change in the canopy Normalized Difference Vegetation Index

@highlight Tomato canopy
@highlight was calculated for each plant using oversegmented multispectral UAV imagery.
@highlight Irrigation doses 50 70 and 85 ET
@highlight  induced lower LAI EWT
@highlight and
@highlight than control 100 ET
@highlight  .
@highlight Volumetric soil moisture resulted in a decreased trend with decreasing water application along the growing season.
@highlight A three parameter logistic mixed model captured the irrigation treatments effect on
@highlight growth curves.
@highlight Goodness of fit for observed and predicted
@highlight indicated the suitability of the three parameter logistic mixed model.
