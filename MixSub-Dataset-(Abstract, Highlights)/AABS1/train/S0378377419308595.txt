 As an important industry for national development summer maize production occupies a key position in China and globally . However agricultural water consumption is becoming increasingly problematic and global climate change and long term traditional rotary tillage have negative effects on the soil surface layer . Subsoiling has been an effective measure to improve soil surface layer structure and increase yield . In the present study field experiments were conducted to compare the effects of subsoiling and rotary tillage in winter wheat and summer maize double cropping systems . Subsoiling treatments at a depth of 40cm and 35cm and rotary tillage at a depth of 15cm before winter wheat planting were used and the effects of tillage methods on soil stable infiltration rate soilwaterconsumption evapotranspiration grain yield and crop water productivity in summer maize growing seasons were determined . The results showed that subsoiling significantly improved soil infiltration rate . Water consumption in the subsoiling treatments increased significantly and especially promoted the crops to utilize soil water at depths below 60cm in the soil profile . As a result compared with R15 kernel numbers per row and 1000grain weight in S35 were significantly increased therefore both grain yield and CWP were significantly improved . Our results indicate that the S35 treatment is a reasonable subsoiling measure on the North China Plain which can increase both summer maize grain yield and CWP in double cropping systems .

@highlight Soil stable infiltration rate can increase due to subsoiling.
@highlight Soil moisture consumption was higher under subsoiling than under rotary tillage.
@highlight Subsoiling can compensate for a low maize yield and WUE due to rotary tillage.
@highlight Subsoiling of 35cm is better than 40cm in maize yield and WUE.
