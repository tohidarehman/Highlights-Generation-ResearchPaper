 During its life freshwater microalgae need to grow under varying water availabilities such as seasonal dryness of puddles or tidal variations . A vast knowledge of the physiological and molecular responses to osmotic stress is available for land plants however these responses have been scarcely studied in microalgae . In this work we described the acclimation of

@highlight Chlamydomonas has both plant and yeast like osmostress signaling response features.
@highlight The accumulation of glycerol and sugars is a key Chlamydomonas osmostress response.
@highlight Trehalose and 2 hydroxyglutarate might have a signaling function in Chlamydomonas.
@highlight Stress signaling involves redox phosphorylation and epigenetic mechanisms.
@highlight The proteome is actively remodeled to achieve metabolic changes.
