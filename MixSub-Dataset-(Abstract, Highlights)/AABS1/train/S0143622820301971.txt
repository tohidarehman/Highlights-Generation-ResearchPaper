 Fertility is a key process shaping long term population dynamics . Distinctive fertility trends have characterized demographic transitions exhibiting sequential periods of spatial convergence and divergence . This descriptive study investigates the spatiotemporal evolution of Total Fertility Rate and Crude Birth Rate at different geographical scales in Italy between 2002 and 2018 . Descriptive statistics of the TFR and CBR values across geographical scales were computed and the associated maps were prepared for the most detailed spatial levels available specifically down to the municipality level . Spatial analysis at the provincial and municipality level was based on both global and local Moran s indexes . Southern Italy a mostly disadvantaged region was characterized by relatively stable fertility patterns fertility then decreased following an opposite trend with respect to economic conditions . The reverse relationship was observed in Northern Italy . As such economic expansion and recession impacted fertility more intensively in Northern Italy .

@highlight The study represents an attempt to study fertility across space and time in Italy using a multi scale spatial approach.
@highlight The study covers a period of economic expansion 20022009 and recession 20102018 .
@highlight Results show the existence of important local spatial heterogeneities in terms of fertility trends and dynamics.
@highlight The results suggest that fertility trends are in some way associated with economic downturns.
@highlight North South divide is an important issue in terms of spatio temporal variability of fertility trends and dynamics.
