 Determining chemical carcinogenicity in the early stages of drug discovery is fundamentally important to prevent the adverse effect of carcinogens on human health . There has been a recent surge of interest in developing computational approaches to predict chemical carcinogenicity . However the predictive power of many existing approaches is limited and there is plenty of room for improvement . Here we develop a new deep learning architecture termed CapsCarcino to distinguish between carcinogens and noncarcinogens . CapsCarcino is constructed based on a dynamic routing algorithm that requires less data extracts more comprehensive information and does not require feature selection . We find that CapsCarcino provides a significantly improved predictive and generalization ability over and outperforms five other machine learning models . Specifically the best model of CapsCarcino achieves an accuracy of 85.0 on an external validation dataset . In addition we discover that the enhanced predictive capability of CapsCarcino over that of the other methods is robust and can be achieved using sparse datasets . Training on merely 20 of the dataset CapsCarcino performs comparably to the other methods based on the full training dataset . Further mechanism analysis indicates that CapsCarcino could efficiently learn the characteristics of carcinogens even if structural alerts are insufficiently represented . The results indicate that CapsCarcino should be helpful for carcinogen risk assessment .
