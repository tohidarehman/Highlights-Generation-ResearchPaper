 Ridge furrow cultivation is a popular dryland agricultural technique in China but its effects on maize yield total water consumption during crop growing stage and water use efficiency have not been systematically analyzed . Here we conducted a meta analysis of the RF effects on maize yield ET and WUE based on the data collected from peer reviewed literature . Yield ET and WUE varied with climate soil and mulching management . Averaged across all the geographic locations RF increased the yield and WUE of maize by 47 and 39 respectively but no effects on ET . An increase in the yield and WUE occurred under RF in regions regardless of the mean growing season air temperature or a mean precipitation during the growing season although there was a trend that RF is more beneficial under low MP . RF also decreased ET in regions with MT 12 C. RF increased the yield and WUE in regions with medium or fine soil texture . RF increased the yield ET and WUE in regions with low soil bulk density 1.3 g cm

@highlight Ridge furrow cultivation RF effects on maize yield and water use efficiency WUE were evaluated.
@highlight RF increased maize yield and WUE by 47 and 39 .
@highlight The efficacy of RF on maize WUE and yield varied by climate soil and mulching managements.
@highlight Site specific adoption of RF is needed to improve maize WUE and yield.
