 Liquiritin a flavone derived from the medicine food homology plant liquorice possesses neuroprotective . However the neuroprotective mechanism is not clear . In this study metabolomics based LC MS was performed to discover the metabolite changes in PC12cells treated with corticosterone induced neurotoxicity after liquiritin treatment . A total of 30 metabolites were identified as differential metabolites . Among them 11 metabolites were regulated by liquiritin and involved in the D glutamine and D glutamate metabolism and glutathione metabolism etc . Based on the results of metabolomics three cell signaling pathways related to these metabolic pathways were verified . The results showed that the ERK1 2 NF B pathway related to the D glutamine and D glutamate metabolism was attenuated by liquiritin via down regulation phospho ERK1 2 phospho IB phosphoNFB protein expression levels . Furthermore the Nrf2 Keap1 pathway related to glutathione metabolism was activated by liquiritin via up regulation Nrf2 Keap1 HO 1 NQO1 protein expression levels and increased SOD CAT GSH PX enzyme activity thus exerting antioxidant activity . Additionally liquiritin inhibited the mitochondrial apoptosis by decreasing the Ca
