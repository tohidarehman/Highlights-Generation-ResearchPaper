 Eddy covariance based carbon flux datasets spanning decades are becoming available worldwide due to the effort of associated scientists . Tall tower based monitoring stations are relatively rare but provide important information about the carbon balance of a larger region surrounding the tower . In this study we report and analyze the 21 year long dataset provided by the Hungarian tall tower site Hegyhtsl . The daily and annual cycles of net ecosystem exchange gross primary production and total ecosystem respiration are presented . Footprint analysis reveals that the fluxes mostly originate from the surrounding arable lands the main source region is located within 1 km around the tower . Long term mean NEE was 0.467gCm

@highlight 21 years long carbon dioxide flux dataset is presented from a Central Europen tall tower site.
@highlight net ecosystem production NEP increased during the years.
@highlight net biome production NBP estimation suggests that the region is a slight carbon source.
@highlight interannual variability is studied using a novel statistical method relying on monthly mean environmental factors.
@highlight major NEP anomaly during 2001 2003 is explained by the interaction of environmental variables.
