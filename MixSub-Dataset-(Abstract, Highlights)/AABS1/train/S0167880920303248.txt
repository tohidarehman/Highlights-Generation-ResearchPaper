 Deficient dispersal ability due to habitat fragmentation adversely impact demographic connectivity and gene flow among population in a metapopulation and therefore potentially leads to local extinction . A rich body of theoretical work provides distinct predictions regarding the distribution of dispersal abilities in relation to fragmentation gradient . Yet empirical data remains elusive in general and it is lacking for anthropogenic induced landscapes in particular . We collected 9884 seeds of a wind dispersed annual species

@highlight We studied seed dispersal of an annual herb in fragmented grassland agroecosystems.
@highlight Habitat fragmentation affected seed dispersal differently across traits and scales.
@highlight Fragmentation affected means extremes and variations of seed dispersal traits.
@highlight Seed release height and dispersal potential were higher in fragmented patches.
