 In this study we investigated the protective effects of protocatechuic acid against cognitive impairment in an amyloid beta induced Alzheimer s disease mouse model . PA was administered orally for 14 days at 100 and 200mg kg day . To examine effects on cognition we conducted behavior tests including the T maze test novel object recognition and the Morris water maze test . In addition we measured lipid peroxidation nitric oxide production and inflammation related protein expression in mice tissues . The PA administered group showed more use of novel routes better novel object recognition and learning and memory ability compared to the A

@highlight Administration of protocatechuic acid PA improved cognitive impairment in A induced Alzheimer s disease AD mice.
@highlight PA attenuated neuronal oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in AD mice model.
@highlight PA could protect memory and cognition function impairments associated with AD.
