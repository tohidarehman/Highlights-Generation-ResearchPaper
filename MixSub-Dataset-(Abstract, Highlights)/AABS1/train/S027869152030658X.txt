 Flour based products one staple food items of Armenians diet can be major contributors to the total exposure to trace elements . Therefore this pilot study estimated the exposure to potentially toxic trace elements and the related health risks through consumption of the main flour based products in the capital city Yerevan . The TE contents in market samples were analyzed using atomic absorption spectrometry . The product consumption data were obtained via a 24 h recall survey amongst Yerevan adults . Following the K mean clustering test three clusters were determined for each type of the product intake . The daily intakes and margin of exposure of trace elements were calculated by the deterministic approach . Considering the health based guidance values and the obtained daily intakes concerns for consumer safety were identified in case of dietary exposure to Ni . Moreover the estimated of all studied elements highlighted that a consumer health concern can not be excluded in the case of white bread as well as lavash and cookies consumption . This pilot study provides important highlights towards future total diet studies in Armenia .

@highlight Daily intake of trace elements via flour based products consumption was estimated.
@highlight The highest levels of Pb Cd Ni and Cu were in cookie and the lowest in pasta.
@highlight Health concerns were identified in case of white bread lavash and cookies intake.
