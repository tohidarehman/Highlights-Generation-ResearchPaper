 Climate change and resource availability increasingly influence plant phenology . Previous research has shown that global warming and nitrogen enrichment reduce the effectiveness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi . However the mechanism by which global change drivers and AMF interactively affect plant phenology is still poorly understood . We examined the impact of warming N addition and AMF reduction on plant phenology in an

@highlight Climate warming resource and soil microbe changes affect plant phenology independently and consistently over time.
@highlight Year to year variations in the phenology of grasses were more apparent than those caused by the experimental treatments.
@highlight Species which are abundant can track annual climate fluctuations.
