 The study of alternate bearing based on the seasonal changes pattern of tree carbohydrate is the unreviewed issue in the loading physiology of date

@highlight The decrease in yield fluctuations of Mazafati date observed in the RDI trees that were similar to the non alternate bearing trees.
@highlight The RDI and cutting back trees of Mazafati date had the least difference in bunch length and precocity with the normal trees.
@highlight The RDI trees of Mazafati date retained the physicochemical properties of fruit.
@highlight The abscission of Mazafati date increased with the increasing load and this trait of the RDI trees was in the intermediate range.
@highlight Late Kimri was the Mutual displacement stage of carbohydrate reserves of the Mazafati date trees in their On and Off conditions.
