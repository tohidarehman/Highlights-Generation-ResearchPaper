 Evidence accumulated in recent years supports the crucial role of remodeled cell walls in enabling plants to adapt to environmental challenges . However the metal tolerance and alleviation mechanisms involving the CWs by endophyte plant interactions to toxic metals have not yet been elucidated . In the present study these mechanisms are tested by exploring the maize

@highlight The role of CW remodeled by DSE in enabling plants to adapt to Cd stress was assessed.
@highlight DSE enhanced the Cd accumulation in root CWs especially pectin and hemicellulose 1.
@highlight The increased activities of related enzymes contributed to the Cd sink in CWs by DSE.
@highlight RNA seq well verified the alleviation of host to toxic Cd by the remodeled CWs by DSE.
@highlight Plant internal detoxification is achieved via the Cd CW compartmentalization by fungi.
