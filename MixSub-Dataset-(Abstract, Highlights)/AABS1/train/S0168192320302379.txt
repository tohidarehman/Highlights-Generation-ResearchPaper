 Tropical rice production is at risk from rising temperature . Understanding regional and seasonal heterogeneity of optimum temperatures for rice production is important for model simulation to predict rice yield change under climate change . However studies or tools for widely observation of crop responses to temperature over broad spatial scales with long time spans are limited . In this study we detected optimum temperature range for rice gross primary production

@highlight Spatial and seasonal heterogeneity of rice
@highlight was detected by satellite NIR
@highlight Rice NIR
@highlight is lower in the regions with more drought stress.
@highlight ORYZA model modified by NIR
@highlight shows better simulation in rice yield.
@highlight More reduction of rice yield was predicted in the study area under global warming.
