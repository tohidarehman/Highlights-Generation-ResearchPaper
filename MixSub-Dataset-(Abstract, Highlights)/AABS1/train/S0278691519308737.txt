 Prenatal ethanol exposure induces developmental toxicities of multiple organs in offspring . Here we investigate the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on bone mass in postnatal offspring and explore its intrauterine programming mechanism . We found that prenatal ethanol exposure could induce bone dysplasia in fetuses and postnatal osteopenia in female offspring accompanied by the sustained activation of the local renin angiotensin systems and inhibition of bone formation . Additionally we also found that histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation and H3K27ac levels in the promoter region of angiotensin converting enzyme were increased in female offspring exposed to ethanol during pregnancy . In
