 The frequency and severity of night frosts increase during the summer in the alpine environment as elevation increases . Intra specific temporal and elevational variability in the freezing resistance of alpine plants during the active growing period has not been documented especially in regards to the intra specific distribution of plants at their upper elevational limits of growth .

@highlight Foliar freezing resistance FR was intra specifically highly variable in summer.
@highlight FR was significantly increased at high elevational range limits.
@highlight FR was reduced in June although leaves were fully expanded.
@highlight Evergreen leaves had a higher FR than deciduous leaves.
