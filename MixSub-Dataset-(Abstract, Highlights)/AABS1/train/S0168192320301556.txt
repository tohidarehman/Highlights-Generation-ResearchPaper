 This study investigates the spatiotemporal relationships between growing season precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature anomalies on yield for corn

@highlight Explored the influence of growing season climate anomalies on crop yield.
@highlight County level crop data revealed spatiotemporal differences in climate associations.
@highlight Above normal temperatures in July and August result in significant yield decline.
@highlight Late season heavy precipitation can be equally detrimental to yield as drought.
@highlight More work is needed to understand the impact of climate change on regional crops.
