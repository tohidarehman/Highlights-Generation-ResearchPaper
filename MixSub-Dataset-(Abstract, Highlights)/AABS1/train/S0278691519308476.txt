 Prenatal nicotine exposure may lead to offspring s testicular dysplasia . Here we confirmed the intergenerational effect of PNE on testosterone synthetic function and explored its epigenetic programming mechanism . Pregnant Wistar rats were injected subcutaneously with nicotine from gestational day 920 . Some dams were anesthetized to obtain fetal rats the rest were allowed to spontaneous labor to generate F1 and F2 generation .

@highlight Prenatal nicotine exposure showed testicular developmental toxicity.
@highlight The intergenerational effects of nicotine on testicular low steroidogenesis.
@highlight An epigenetic mechanism of StAR and 3 HSD gene repression.
