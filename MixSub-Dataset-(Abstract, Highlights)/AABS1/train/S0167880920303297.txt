 The profile characteristics of soil carbon reflect the combined effects of vegetation and erosion . However the quantitative assessment of soil carbon in profile and its dynamics affected by vegetation restoration and erosion is still extremely inadequate . In this study we synthesized soil and vegetation properties stable carbon isotopic compositions and radiocarbon ages to investigate the soil carbon processes in two temperate forests of different successional stages

@highlight SOC increases in topsoil but declines in subsoil along succession.
@highlight SIC exhibits an opposite variation to SOC along succession.
@highlight Litter input controls topsoil SOC dynamic.
@highlight Historical erosion affects subsoil carbon dynamic.
