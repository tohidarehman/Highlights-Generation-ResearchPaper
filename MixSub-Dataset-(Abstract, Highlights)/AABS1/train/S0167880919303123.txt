 Grassland birds are in decline worldwide and one hypothesis for this decline is habitat loss and degradation through agricultural intensification . The purpose of this study is to investigate the impacts of agriculture on a declining grassland bird the Savannah Sparrow

@highlight An obligate grassland bird was studied in intensive agriculture and natural habitat.
@highlight Fledgling survival was weakly related to land use type.
@highlight The daily survival rate of nests was negatively influenced by agriculture.
@highlight Grassland birds reared on intensive agriculture may experience physiological stress.
@highlight Food supply clutch size and hatching success were not impacted by land use type.
