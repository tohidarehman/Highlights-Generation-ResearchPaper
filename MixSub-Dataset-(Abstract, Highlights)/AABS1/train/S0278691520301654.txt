 T 2 toxin one of the most toxic mycotoxins is commonly presented along with its metabolites HT 2 toxin neosolaniol T 2 triol and T 2 tetraol in foodstuff and feed . The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of T 2 toxin alone and in combination with its metabolites on porcine Leydig cells . Based on the determination of cell viability with CCK 8 toxicological interactions were investigated using Combination Index method . The cytotoxic potency of five tested mycotoxins individual and their mixtures all showed with a dose dependent manner . In view of IC

@highlight The toxicities of T 2 toxin and its metabolites were ranked in the following order T 2 toxin HT 2 toxin T 2 triol NEO T 2 tetraol.
@highlight The synergistic and antagonistic effects of T 2 toxin HT 2 toxin and NEO depend on the various concentrations while only the antagonism was observed in the combinations of T 2 toxin T 2 triol and T 2 tetraol.
