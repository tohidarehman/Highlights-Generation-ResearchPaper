 Dietary exposure of the Italian population to nickel has been assessed in the national Total Diet Study . Occurrence data were combined with national individual consumption data to estimate mean and high level dietary exposure of population subgroups according to age and gender both at the national level and for the four main geographical areas of Italy . The mean chronic dietary exposure of infants and toddlers children adolescents adults and the elderly were 4.00 4.57 2.57 1.55 and 1.47g kg bw per day respectively . These intakes lie in the intermediate range of exposure estimates from TDS carried out in other countries . Main contributors to the total nickel exposure for children and adolescents were sweet products and cereals and cereal products . In adults and the elderly nearly 30 of the exposure was associated to the consumption of cereals and cereal products . Mean and 95th percentile chronic dietary exposure was below the TDI in all age groups . For the risk characterisation of acute oral exposure exposure data for consumers only in the adult population were compared with the reference point for systemic contact dermatitis . Consumption of cocoa chocolate crustaceans and molluscs pulses had remarkable potential to elicit adverse effects in nickel sensitised individuals .

@highlight Dietary exposure of the Italian population to Ni was assessed via the national TDS.
@highlight Chronic dietary exposure lies in the intermediate range of estimates from other TDS.
@highlight Mean chronic exposure of children is three fold compared to those of adults.
@highlight Mean and 95th percentile chronic dietary exposure is below the TDI in all age groups.
@highlight For acute exposure cocoa chocolate crustaceans molluscs pulses are of concern.
