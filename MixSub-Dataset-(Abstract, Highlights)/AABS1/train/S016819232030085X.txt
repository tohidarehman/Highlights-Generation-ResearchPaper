 The accurate estimation of temporally continuous gross primary production is important for a mechanistic understanding of the global carbon budget as well as the carbon exchange between land and atmosphere . Ground based PhenoCams can provide near surface observations of plant phenology with high temporal resolution and possess great potential for use in modeling the seasonal dynamics of GPP . However due to the site level empirical approaches for estimating the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation a broad application of PhenoCams in GPP modeling has been restricted . In this study the stage of vegetation phenology P

@highlight An index of the stage of vegetation phenology P
