 The study of water nitrogen interaction to improve crop drought resistance and reduce environmental pollution has increasingly become a hot topic . However the response of yield and quality of paddy rice and upland rice to N nutrition under different irrigation regimes is little known . Continuous flooding cultivation and bare dry cultivation were used to cultivate paddy rice cultivar Yangjing 687

@highlight Under bare dry cultivation and medium nitrogen rate upland rice and paddy rice can get the higher yield.
@highlight The appearance quality and nutrition quality of upland rice can be improved by bare dry cultivation and medium and upper middle nitrogen rate.
@highlight The effect of increasing nitrogen application on 1000 grain weight of upland rice and paddy rice is different.
@highlight Yield and the cooking and nutrition quality of upland rice were less sensitive to nitrogen than that of paddy rice.
