 Goji berry has recently been introduced in Mediterranean diet and its consumption is increasing . This study aims to determine cytoprotection of lutein zeaxanthin and goji berry extract rich in carotenoids against Beauvericin induced cytotoxicity on SH SY5Y neuroblastoma cells . Both carotenoids and GBE showed cytoprotective effects . Cytoprotection was evaluated by simultaneous combination of the two xanthophylls LUT and ZEAX with BEA as well as using pre treatment assays . The highest protective effect occurred in 16 24 and 12 respectively for LUT ZEAX and LUT ZEAX incubating simultaneously with BEA while by pre treatment assay LUT showed a cytoprotection effect over 30 and ZEAX alone or LUT ZEAX promoted only a slight cytoprotection . Pre treatment assays with GBE showed a cytoprotection between 3 and 20 for BEA concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 6.25M whereas no protective effect was observed when the cells were simultaneously incubated with GBE and BEA . Finally by means of CI isobologram method the interaction between LUT ZEAX and BEA were evaluated and the results showed an synergism effect for almost all combinations tested . The data presented shows a option of using goji berries to potentially mitigate the toxicity of beauvericin eventually present in foods .

@highlight Carotenoids from goji berries showed cytoprotective effect against BEA induced cytotoxicity on SH SY5Y cells.
@highlight Lutein and zeaxanthin individually and in combination showed cytoprotection.
@highlight Zeaxanthin lutein and goji berries extract showed no toxicity on SH SY5Y cells.
@highlight CI isobologram method showed an synergism effect relative to zeaxanthin and lutein combinations.
@highlight Pre treatment assays with goji berries extract showed cytoprotective effect up to 20 against BEA induced cytotoxicity on SH SY5Y cells.
