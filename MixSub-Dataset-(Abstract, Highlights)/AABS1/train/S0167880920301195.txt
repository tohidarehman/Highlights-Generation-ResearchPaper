 Exploring ways to reduce high nutrient agricultural runoff is imperative considering how such runoff reduces water quality and has the potential to cause harmful algal blooms . Ground arthropod communities particularly detritivores are largely ignored as a possible avenue for reducing nutrient runoff . However stimulating these organisms may help maintain nutrient availability with decreased fertilizer application rates thereby increasing application efficiency while reducing nutrient runoff potential . With the aim of stimulating the detrital community and soil microbes to ultimately enhance nutrient availability we added a labile substrate and nutrient source carcasses of

@highlight Insect carcasses boost ground arthropod abundance on corn fields.
@highlight Insect carcasses and corn stover in combination increase predator abundance.
@highlight Insect carcasses increase nitrogen and phosphorus pools and microbial phosphorus.
@highlight Stimulating ground arthropods modestly enhanced nutrient cycling in corn fields.
