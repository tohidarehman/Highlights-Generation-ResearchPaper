 Recent studies have identified the 8C alkyl chain methylimidazolium ionic liquid 1 octyl 3 methylimidazolium in the environment and its potential to trigger the auto immune liver disease primary biliary cholangitis . The toxicity of a range of methylimidazolium ionic liquids were therefore examined . Oxygen consumption was rapidly inhibited with potency increasing with alkyl chain length . This preceded caspase 3 7 induction and DNA fragmentation . Time and dose dependent loss of dye reduction capacities reflected these effects with a 700 fold difference in potency between 2C and 10C alkyl chain liquids . None of the ionic liquids directly inhibited mitochondrial complexes I IV or complex V F

@highlight Methylimidazolium ionic liquids inhibit mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
@highlight Exposure has limited direct effects on mitochondrial complex IV activities.
@highlight Methylimidazolium ionic liquids are reducible under biologically relevant conditions.
@highlight Increasing alkyl chain length results in greater membrane solubility and toxic potency.
@highlight Toxicity is dependent on electron transport chain methylimidazolium reduction.
