 Playa wetlands in the Great Plains USA support a wide variety of plant species not found elsewhere in this agriculturally dominated region due to the ephemeral presence of standing water and hydric soils within playas . If longer dry periods occur due to climate change or if changes in surrounding land use alter sediment accumulation rates and water storage capacity in playas plant communities could experience decreased diversity with lasting effects on ecosystem services provided by playas in the Great Plains and at a continental level in North America . We quantified potential changes in playa wetland plant community composition associated with predicted changes in precipitation and land use in the Great Plains through the end of the 21

@highlight Playas support plant species not found in surrounding agricultural watersheds.
@highlight Plant abundance richness and diversity were unaffected by rainfall and land use change.
@highlight Projected future precipitation benefited native plant species richness.
@highlight Greatest native species richness occurred under control nitrogen loading 0 mg N L .
