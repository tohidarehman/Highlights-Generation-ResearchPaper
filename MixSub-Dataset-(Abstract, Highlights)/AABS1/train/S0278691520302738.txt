 The toxic effect of zearalenone is not fully understood and there is an urgent need for the development of effective agents to protect against the toxic effects of ZEA . In this study we detected whether curcumin can reduce Leydig cells apoptosis induced by ZEA . The Effects of ZEA and CUR on cell viability was evaluated using a Cell Counting kit 8 assay . Apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay and flow cytometry . The protective effect of CUR on oxidative stress induced by ZEA was determined by ROS MDA T SOD GSH and GSH Px levels . In addition we also determined effects of key signaling pathways and proteins involved in the apoptotic PI3K AKT Nrf2 and endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling pathways by Western blotting . The expressions of proteins were measured . The experimental results showed that CUR can alleviate oxidative stress and apoptosis caused by ZEA through the PI3K AKT Nrf2 and endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling pathways . Our results provide a theoretical basis for molecular studies of ZEA toxicology and clinical application of CUR .

@highlight Curcumin can protect Leydig cell from zearalenone induced apoptosis and oxidative stress.
@highlight This specific mechanism of the protective effect of curcumin on germ cells is via PTEN Nrf2 Bip signaling pathway.
@highlight Curcumin can ameliorate the inhibitory effect of zearalenone on testosterone secretion in Leydig cells
