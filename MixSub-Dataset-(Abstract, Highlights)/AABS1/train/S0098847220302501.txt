 Roots are the first plant organ to encounter sense and respond to soil salinity . Like for many moderately salt tolerant species roots of olive

@highlight Roots modified their structural traits to enhance salt compartmentation and exclusion.
@highlight Salts accumulated in enlarged periderm tissue allowing greater compartmentation.
@highlight Two putative apoplastic barriers were identified around the periderm and the stele.
@highlight Xylem vessel diameter distribution shifted to allow higher hydraulic conductivity.
