 Biomarker driven research has been proposed as a successful method to assess the exposure of individuals to xenobiotics including mycotoxins through estimation of their metabolites in biological fluids . A methodology to determine patulin and citrinin in human urine and plasma using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was developed and validated in the present study . Selectivity specificity linearity limit of detection and quantification apparent recovery intraday and interday precision and measurement uncertainty were investigated for validation purposes . Finally the method was used to analyze human urine and plasma case control samples where 50 samples originated from colorectal cancer patients and 50 from age sex matched controls . This case control study revealed that PAT was not detected in urine samples however occurred in 25 of the analysed plasma samples with an average concentration of 11.626.67ng mL in the positive samples . CIT was found in urine samples and plasma samples with average concentrations in the positive samples of 0.450.24ng mL and 0.490.2ng mL respectively . No statistically significant difference of PAT and CIT concentration among colorectal cancer and control patients was observed .

@highlight Development and validation of an LC MS MS method to determine patulin and citrinin in biological fluids.
@highlight Patulin was detected in plasma 25 for the first time.
@highlight Citrinin was present in 74 of Tunisian urine samples.
@highlight Citrinin was present in 36 of Tunisian plasma samples.
