 The future of forests and their productivity in dry environments will depend on both water availability through precipitation and ecosystem and plant water use characteristics . It is increasingly recognized that better understanding water use patterns and their response to change depends on our ability to partition evapotranspiration . Here we use chamber based direct measurements of soil evaporation in a semi arid

@highlight Evapotranspiration in a dry pine forest was partitioned based on soil chambers.
@highlight We provided data on the daily seasonal and long term dynamics of the ET components.
@highlight Nighttime soil adsorption is proposed as protection during long dry summer period.
@highlight Long term relationship between the transpiration ratio and LAI was quantified.
@highlight Et ET was similar to the global mean demonstrating expanding dry land forestation.
