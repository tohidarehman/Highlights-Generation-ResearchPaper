 Since soil water depletion and salinity are major constraints for crop production rice straw mulch could be beneficial for increasing yield and water productivity due to its role in conserving soil water and decreasing soil salinity . Two field experiments were conducted on a saline silty clay soil to determine the effects of mulch and irrigation on the dynamics of soil water content and soil salinity and on the growth and yield of sunflower sown by strip planting . In 2017 the mulching treatments were no mulch rice straw mulch and retaining 1520 of the crop residue of the previous rice crop . In 2018 three irrigation treatments one I

@highlight Grain yield of sunflower increased by 1626 with straw mulch.
@highlight Straw mulch increased grain yield by increasing the soil solution solute potential.
@highlight Straw mulch increased soil water and reduced salinity in the upper root zone.
@highlight Straw mulch decreased the total water used and the irrigation water requirement.
