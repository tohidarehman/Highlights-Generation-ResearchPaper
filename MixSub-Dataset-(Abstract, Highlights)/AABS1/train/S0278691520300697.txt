 In the present study the removal effect of dealuminated jellyfish on Aluminum in mice was evaluated . The results showed that the consumption of dealuminated jellyfish significantly decreased Al accumulation in the liver of mice indicating an Al removing effect of dealuminated jellyfish on Al enriched mice . In addition the effect of dealuminated jellyfish consumption on an Al overload model was further evaluated . The result showed that the Al content in different tissues and organs of mice was significantly reduced but it had no significant effect on the other metallic element content . These results indicated that the samples from oral administration have a certain Al removing effect in Al overloaded mice . Moreover the cluster analysis of differentially expressed proteins in blood and liver showed that a high dose of dealuminated jellyfish improve the expression of amine oxidase B and enhance the effect of Al discharge .

@highlight The Al removing effect of dealuminated jellyfish in mice was evaluated.
@highlight Dealuminated jellyfish has the better Al removing effect and no adverse effect.
@highlight Moreover dealuminated jellyfish could improve the expression of amine oxidase B.
