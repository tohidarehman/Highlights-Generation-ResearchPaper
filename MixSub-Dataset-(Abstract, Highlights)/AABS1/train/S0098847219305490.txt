 Geography and climate have been the main drivers of evolution in recent geological epochs . While new lineages of species have been formed in the last millions of years and others have vanished as a result of historical climate changes some ancient lineages appear to have persisted to the present day without net diversification . In this paper evolution of ancient lineages is addressed by combining phylogenetic and conservation approaches to test the concept of endangered living fossil . Using endangered monospecific genera as starting point we propose three criteria to identify ELFs scarcity and narrow distribution of populations i.e . the species is categorised as either endangered or critically endangered using IUCN criteria evolutionary distinctiveness i.e . phylogenetic singularity of a single species lineage as a result of a null net diversification rate ancient divergence i.e . split from the closest extant relatives predating the dramatic climate changes of particular geological epochs . The vascular flora of the Iberian Peninsula offers a suitable study system to reliably test the ELF concept . Indeed time calibrated phylogenies revealed that five of the six critically endangered monospecific genera endemic to the Iberian Peninsula are ELFs . These five genera appear to have diverged from their closest relatives in the Oligocene

@highlight A new concept endangered living fossil is proposed based on conservation and phylogenetic criteria.
@highlight Endangered monspecific genera are good candidates to test whether they are endangered lineages of great evolutionary heritage.
@highlight California Chile and Mediterranean Basin provide 11 examples.
@highlight They help infer causes for extinction and survival postdating historical climate changes.
@highlight We urge the IUCN to consider evolutionary criteria for species prioritization.
