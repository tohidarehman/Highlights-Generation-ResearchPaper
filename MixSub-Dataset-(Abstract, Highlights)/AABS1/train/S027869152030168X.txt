 A dietary exposure assessment to sum of deoxynivalenol forms sum of T 2 HT 2 toxins and zearalenone was conducted for Czech children 46 years and Czech men and women 1859 years . Retail foods were assessed by LC MS MS methods . The 95th percentile chronic exposure to sum of DON forms was determined in children from 648 to 1030ng kgbw day in men from 362 to 923ng kgbw day and in women from 272 to 490ng kgbw day . The 95th percentile chronic exposure to sum T2 HT2 was determined in children from 6.5 to 31ng kgbw day in men from 1.9 to 11.2ng kgbw day and in women from 2.5 to 11.5ng kgbw day . The 95th percentile chronic exposure to ZEA was determined in children from 11.9 to 24.9ng kgbw day in men from 5.9 to 27.5ng kgbw day and in women from 4.8 to 12.6ng kgbw day . The risk linked with the mean and the 95th percentile chronic exposure to the sum of DON forms sum of T2 HT2 and ZEA is considered to be out of health concern for the selected population groups .

@highlight mycotoxins DON forms T2 HT2 and ZEA were evaluated in 336 food samples.
@highlight Dietary exposure to these mycotoxins of the Czech population was studied.
@highlight Chronic exposure doses of
@highlight mycotoxins didn t exceed TDIs LB scenario .
@highlight There is no potential dietary risk of
@highlight mycotoxins in the Czech population.
