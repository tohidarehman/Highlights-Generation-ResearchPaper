 Determining the response of forest growth and productivity to climate variability is crucial for understanding and modeling forest carbon sequestration in mesic temperate forests . Most tree ring analyses have used monthly climate data . Daily climate data may be more appropriate to use in the determination of tree ring response to climate because cell division enlargement and thickening occur during discrete periods of the growing season . We analyze annual tree ring width and

@highlight Daily climate data reveals differences in response of tree ring width and
@highlight C.
@highlight Precipitation was the best predictor of tree ring width and
@highlight C ratios.
@highlight None
@highlight C integrated climate over longer periods than ring width.
@highlight None
@highlight C showed a more consistent seasonal signal across 10 sites.
@highlight Our work can inform ecosystem productivity carbon cycle and earth system models.
