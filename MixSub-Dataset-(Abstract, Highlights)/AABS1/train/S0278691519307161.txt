 In the present study we investigated the detrimental effects of ethoxyquin on zebrafish embryonic development using different endpoints including lethality malformations locomotion and gene expression . EQ is primarily used as a preservative in animal feed and it has been shown to have negative impacts on different laboratory animals . However studies on the adverse effects of EQ in aquatic animals are still limited . In this study zebrafish eggs were exposed to different concentrations of EQ ranging from 1 to 100M for six days . In the 100M treated groups 95 and 100 mortality was observed at 24 and 48h respectively . Delayed development decreased pigmentation and pericardial edema were observed in larvae . Behavioral analysis of larvae demonstrated a distinct locomotive pattern in response to EQ both in light and dark indicating a possible developmental neurotoxicity and deficits in locomotion . The expression levels of genes involved in several physiological pathways including stress response cell cycle and DNA damage were altered by EQ . Our results demonstrate that EQ could cause developmental and physiological toxicity to aquatic organisms . Hence its toxic effect should be further analyzed and its use and levels in the environment must be monitored carefully .
