 Bisphenol A can inhibit the differentiation and function of regulatory T cells and affect the balance of helper T cell 1 Th2 therefore the immunotoxicity of BPA has attracted widespread attention in recent years but its mechanism is not clear . The main aim of this study was to explore the regulatory mechanism of the PI3K Akt mTOR signaling pathway in the context of perinatal exposure to BPA induced Treg Th17 imbalance in male offspring mice through a combination of

@highlight Perinatal BPA exposure resulted in the imbalance of Treg Th17 in male offspring mice by activating PI3K Akt mTOR pathway.
@highlight Perinatal BPA exposure increased the inflammatory response by activating the AhR and TLR4 NF B pathways.
@highlight The key windows of BPA immunotoxicity were pregnancy and lactation.
