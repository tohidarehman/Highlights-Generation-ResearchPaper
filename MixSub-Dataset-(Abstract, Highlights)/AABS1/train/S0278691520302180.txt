 Developing tailor made fortified farmed fish is a promising solution to overcome nutritional deficiencies and increase consumer confidence in these products . This study evaluated the supplementation of three fortified diets with I rich seaweed and selenised yeast on essential and toxic elements levels in gilthead seabream

@highlight Farmed fish biofortification was successfully achieved through I and Se enriched diets from natural and sustainable sources.
@highlight Biofortified fish fillets yielded a lower exposure to toxic elements including Hg Cd and Pb.
@highlight Iodine fortification was more efficient in common carp while Se biofortification was more efficient in gilthead seabream.
@highlight Consumption of biofortified fish provides higher contribution to the DRI of I and Se without compromising consumer safety.
