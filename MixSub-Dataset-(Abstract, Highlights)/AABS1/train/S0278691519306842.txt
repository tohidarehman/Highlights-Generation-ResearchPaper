 Acrylamide a food contaminant caused islet remodeling and increased hepatic glycogen content in male rats but the effect of AA on glucose homeostasis in female rats remains unclear . In this study female SD rats were orally treated with 0 15 or 30mg kgbw AA for 3 weeks . The levels of fasting blood glucose blood glucose after oral administration of glucose plasma insulin and hepatic glycogen were measured . The histology of the pancreas was observed and the transcription of key genes involved in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling in liver were determined . Compared with the control exposure to 30mg kgbw of AA significantly increased FBG level reduced hepatic glycogen content and impaired glucose tolerance . Moreover damaged islets were observed at 15 and 30mg kgbw AA exposed groups . In addition AA exposure significantly promoted gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis up regulation of

@highlight Acrylamide AA elevated FBG levels and impaired glucose tolerance in female rats.
@highlight AA decreased insulin levels and hepatic glycogen contents and damaged pancreatic islets in female rats.
@highlight Related genes involved in glucose metabolism and insulin signal transduction contribute to AA induced hyperglycemia.
