 Determining changes in tree transpiration and its controlling mechanisms from regions of natural distribution to planted introduction are significantly important for afforestation and forest management . Here transpiration and canopy conductance of Mongolian pine

@highlight Transpiration rate was higher in plantation and sparse forest than in natural forest.
@highlight Transpiration change was explained more by VPD than radiation in the plantation.
@highlight Canopy conductance was higher in sparse forest than in plantation and natural forest.
@highlight Sparse forest had a relatively high sensitivity of canopy conductance to VPD.
@highlight Plantation had high transpiration rate but loose stomatal regulation upon water loss.
