 Robust projections of climate impact on crop growth and productivity by crop models are key to designing effective adaptations to cope with future climate risk . However current crop models diverge strongly in their climate impact projections . Previous studies tried to compare or improve crop models regarding the impact of one single climate variable . However this approach is insufficient considering that crop growth and yield are affected by the interactive impacts of multiple climate change factors and multiple interrelated biophysical processes . Here a new comprehensive analysis was conducted to look holistically at the reasons why crop models diverge substantially in climate impact projections and to investigate which biophysical processes and knowledge gaps are key factors affecting this uncertainty and should be given the highest priorities for improvement . First eight barley models and eight climate projections for the 2050s were applied to investigate the uncertainty from crop model structure in climate impact projections for barley growth and yield at two sites Jokioinen Finland and Lleida Spain . Sensitivity analyses were then conducted on the responses of major crop processes to major climatic variables including temperature precipitation irradiation and CO
