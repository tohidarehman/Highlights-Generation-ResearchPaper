 is a leguminous plant that produces secondary metabolites frequently used in medicinal and food preparation . Here the role of an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal inoculum alone or in combination with methyl jasmonate chemical treatment was evaluated on the production of trigonelline and diosgenin in fenugreek plants grown under mild water limitation . After inoculation fenugreek plants were subjected to several combined treatments i.e . well watered and water stressed both treated with different MeJA concentrations . At the end of the experiment in addition to trigonelline and diosgenin content an array of plant growth parameters and biochemical stress markers were examined . Results mainly showed a significant increase in production of the considered secondary metabolites although they are differentially influenced by the individual factors and their interactions . SYM treatment was more effective on the production of trigonelline independently from growth conditions while diosgenin biosynthesis was influenced by the presence of root symbioses only in combination with MeJA treatment . A differential impact depending on the applied treatment on plant growth and on production of the considered bioactive molecules was revealed providing new information on the effect of biological and chemical priming treatments .

@highlight An AM fungal inoculum was used alone or in combination with MeJA on fenugreek.
@highlight Chemical and biological priming were effective in fenugreek under water deficit.
@highlight Applied treatments differentially affect secondary metabolite accumulation.
@highlight The AM fungal inoculum and MeJA improved trigonelline and diosgenin content.
@highlight MeJA treatment positively affected symbioses development under water deficit.
