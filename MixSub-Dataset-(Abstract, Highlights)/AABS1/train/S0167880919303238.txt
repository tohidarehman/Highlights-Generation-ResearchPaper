 Diazotrophs have potential for fixing atmospheric nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems . The effects of legumes on free living N fixing diazotrophs in the karst grassland were determined to provide a basis for ecosystem restoration . In a field experiment diazotroph responses were examined in five treatments control low and high densities of

@highlight Legumes increase diazotroph abundance in non growing season.
@highlight High density
@highlight decrease diazotroph abundance in growing season.
@highlight Diazotrophs were significantly affected by legume species and planting density.
@highlight Competitive interactions among diazotrophs increased under N poor conditions.
@highlight Rare diazotrophic taxa enhance N fixation in different leguminous shrubs.
