 . Decanoic acid was evaluated for genotoxicity repeated dose toxicity reproductive toxicity local respiratory toxicity phototoxicity photoallergenicity skin sensitization and environmental safety . Data on the target material and from read across analog nonanoic acid show that decanoic acid is not expected to be genotoxic . Data on read across analog octanoic acid provide a calculated MOE 100 for the repeated dose and reproductive toxicity endpoints . Based on the existing data decanoic acid does not present a concern for skin sensitization under the current declared levels of use . The phototoxicity photoallergenicity endpoints were evaluated based on UV spectra decanoic acid is not expected to be phototoxic photoallergenic . The local respiratory toxicity endpoint was evaluated using the TTC for a Cramer Class I material and the exposure to decanoic acid is below the TTC . The environmental endpoints were evaluated decanoic acid was found not to be PBT as per the IFRA Environmental Standards and its risk quotients based on its current volume of use in Europe and North America are 1 .

@highlight Decanoic acid a safety assessment based on RIFM s criteria.
@highlight A safety assessment based on 7 human health endpoints plus environmental.
@highlight All endpoints were cleared using target data read across and or TTC.
