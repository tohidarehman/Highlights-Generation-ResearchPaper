 Extensive research has shown that dioecious plants exhibit sexual dimorphism under extreme environments . However sex specific differences in responses to drought phosphorus shortage or their combination are less known . In our study impacts of drought P shortage and their combination on the performance of

@highlight Effects of drought and P deficiency on diecious
@highlight were investigated.
@highlight Females were more sensitive to drought and P deficiency stresses than males.
@highlight P application ameliorated drought stress more in males than in females.
@highlight P application greatly enhanced root exudation of males under drought stress.
@highlight Greater changes in soil microbes of males may be responsible for higher resistance.
