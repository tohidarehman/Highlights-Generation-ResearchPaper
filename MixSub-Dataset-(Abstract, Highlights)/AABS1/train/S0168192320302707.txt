 Rotation forestry including clearcutting is a common method of practising forestry in Fennoscandia . Clearcutting in peatland forests markedly increases environmental loading leaching of nutrients and methane CH

@highlight Manual and automatic chambers were used to investigate the effect of harvesting.
@highlight Neither methane nor nitrous oxide emissions increased considerably after harvesting.
@highlight Partial harvesting causes less methane and nitrous oxide emissions than clearcutting.
@highlight Logging trails had higher emissions compared to forest soil.
