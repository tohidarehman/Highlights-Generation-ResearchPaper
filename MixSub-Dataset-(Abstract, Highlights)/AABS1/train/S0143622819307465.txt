 National small area classifications in Britain were first produced over 40 years ago using statistics from 1971 Population Census and have now become a regular feature of governmental academic and commercial analysis of census information . These classifications aim to encapsulate the aggregate demographic and socio economic character of small areas by means of a simple thumbnail description . However these pen portraits often also refer to the environmental nature of the different types of area where people live employing terms such as leafy suburb industrial hinterland or agricultural heartland . This paper reports on research that aims to determine whether a set of environmental indicators are capable of discriminating between areas in a way that matches a standard area classification derived from multivariate analysis of demographic and socio economic statistics . The research assesses the impact of adding a set of environmental variables to a collection of Census variables on area classification using k means clustering in two contrasting case study local authorities . The results reveal that clustering with and without the addition of land use variables produce partially overlapping classifications of the small areas and certain of the land use variables are aligned with some area types .

@highlight Assesses the effect of adding land cover variables into area based geodemographic classifications in case study areas.
@highlight Achieved by connecting directly with the methods and data used in a previous national UK geodemographic classification.
@highlight Examines contrasting and complementary case study local authorities.
@highlight Provides a starting point for exploring the impact of incorporating landscape metrics into geodemographic classifications.
