 In dry woodland regions silvopastures have emerged as a promising option to balance cattle production carbon storage and biodiversity . However one of the major challenges in these systems particularly when implemented in a matrix of natural vegetation is the preservation of tree populations in the face of management actions implemented by ranchers to control woody encroachment . Here we investigate the extent of that tradeoff by analyzing the impact of woody encroachment control practices on carbon storage in silvopastures of the Argentine Dry Chaco . First we analyze tree density and carbon storage in aboveground woody biomass for silvopastures and woodlands at 24 sites in five properties across the Argentine Dry Chaco . Then we characterize vegetation management goals and actions of ranchers who have adopted silvopastures in that same region combining field assessments high resolution imagery analysis characterization of site history and surveys . We find that woody biomass in silvopastures retains an average of 64 of the carbon present in aboveground biomass in intact woodlands 28.8Mg C ha

@highlight Silvopastures can reconcile food production and carbon storage.
@highlight Silvopastures retain two thirds of the carbon stored by intact vegetation.
@highlight Tree density decreases through time particularly when initial levels are higher.
@highlight Carbon storage in trees decreases by 12 after each woody encroachment control event.
@highlight Ranchers express concern about tree loss but prioritize encroachment control.
