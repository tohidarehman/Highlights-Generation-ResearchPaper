 Stony karst landscape in the Adriatic coastal area has been cultivated for centuries to grow Mediterranean crops . Shallow and less fertile soils were mostly used for rain fed grapevine and olive production . Native grapevine cultivars are in general well adapted to the warm and droughty climate but a rapid drift in weather patterns characterized mostly by long lasting high temperature events during the growing season urges the producers to apply irrigation . This research studying the effects of different irrigation levels on

@highlight Irrigation was evaluated on grapevine grown on soil obtained by karst reclamation.
@highlight 3050 yield reduction was detected in case of unirrigated vines.
@highlight Most of the negative effects of temperature stress were mitigated by irrigation.
@highlight Deficit irrigation resulted with the balance between grape yield and quality.
