 The objective of this work was to study the effect of the decrease in incident solar radiation on leaf senescence its consequence on the fraction of radiation intercepted by the leaves and on the grain and oil yield in sunflower . Five field experiments were conducted in Balcarce with three hybrids maintaining non limiting soil water conditions and nutritional status and controlling weeds and insects . Treatments of different shading levels were applied during different periods of crop development . Shading levels were more intense than those expected by cloudiness in field conditions . The number weight and oil concentration of grains leaf area incident radiation I

@highlight Sunflower yield was reduced under different limiting incident radiation conditions.
@highlight A diminished solar incident radiation accelerated leaf senescence in sunflower.
@highlight The fraction of radiation intercepted by leaves was not affected by solar radiation.
@highlight Leaf senescence by a decrease in solar radiation did not affect grain and oil yield.
