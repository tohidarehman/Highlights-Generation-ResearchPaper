 It is widely reported that controlled drainage has the potential to reduce outflow and increase crop yield . However many researchers demonstrated that the percentage changes in crop yield drainage water quantity and quality to CD use were variable . A total of sixty one studies with 1050 data pairs were collected investigating ten main variables yield drainage volume the concentrations and losses of

@highlight A meta analysis has been done using 1050 data pairs collected from 61 studies.
@highlight Controlled drainage increased crop yield by 0.11 and decreased drainage volume by 19.23 .
@highlight Controlled drainage greatly alleviated
@highlight loss except dry land crop in surface drainage.
@highlight loss was on average 18.9 lower in controlled drainage than in the control.
