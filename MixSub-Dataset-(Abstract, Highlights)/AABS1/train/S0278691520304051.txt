 Numerous applications of reduced graphene oxide and pervasive cadmium have led concern about their co exposure to the environment and human . We studied the combined effects of RGO and Cd in human liver cells . Initially we found that RGO did not harm to HepG2 cells while Cd induced dose dependent cytotoxicity . Exciting observations were that a non cytotoxic concentration of RGO effectively mitigates the toxic effects of Cd such as cell viability reduction lactate dehydrogenase release and irregular cell morphology . Cd induced cell cycle arrest induction of caspases enzymes activity and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential were also significantly alleviated by RGO co exposure . Moreover generation of pro oxidants and depletion of antioxidants due to Cd exposure was effectively attenuated by RGO co exposure . Mitigating effect of RGO could be due to strong adsorption of Cd on the large surface area of RGO sheets which decrease the cellular uptake and bioavailability of Cd for HepG2 cells . This study warrants future research on potential mechanisms of mitigating effects of RGO against Cd induced toxicity in animal models .

@highlight Combined effects of RGO and Cd was investigated in HepG2 cells.
@highlight RGO alone were not toxic whereas Cd alone induced toxicity in HepG2 cells.
@highlight In co exposure group RGO effectively mitigates Cd induced cytotoxicity apoptosis.
@highlight In co exposure group RGO significantly attenuates Cd induced oxidative stress.
@highlight Toxicity of Cd was alleviated due to its strong adsorption on RGO surface.
