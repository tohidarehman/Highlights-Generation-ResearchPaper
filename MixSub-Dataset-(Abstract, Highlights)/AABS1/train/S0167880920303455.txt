 Ever increasing water food energy demand has led to the depletion of soil resources by mainly inadequate grazing practices . Nevertheless the effects of different grazing practices on hydrological and soil erosion processes have not yet been well understood . Therefore we investigated the influence of different Nitrogen application doses and stocking rates in a pasture under rotational stocking on soil erosion and water infiltration in the Brazilian Cerrado region . The experimental area was a

@highlight High N fertilizer doses provide a decrease in water and soil losses.
@highlight Water infiltration increased by 33 even though the stocking rate increased by 67 .
@highlight Soil erosion decreased by 78 even though the stocking rate increased by 67 .
@highlight Well managed intensive grazing can show SIR and soil loss comparable to cerrado.
@highlight Potential 5 fold increase in meat production with high N doses on intensive grazing.
