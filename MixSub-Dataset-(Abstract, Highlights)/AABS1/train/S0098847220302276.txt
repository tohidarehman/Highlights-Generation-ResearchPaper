 Cadmium is a trace metal without essential biological function due to its high toxicity to plants animals and humans even at low concentrations . On the other hand Zn is an essential nutrient and plays important metabolic functions in plants . The study of the interaction between essential and a nonessential element may be important for understanding analyzing and improving the defense strategies adapted by plants . The main objective of this work was to evaluate the mitigation of Cd toxicity by Zn in young plants of the CCN 51 cocoa genotype grown in soil with different concentrations of Zn Cd and Zn Cd through physiological biochemical molecular and micro morphological responses . It was verified that high concentrations of Zn Cd and Zn Cd in the soil promoted alterations in the enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidative metabolism and expression of genes . This was demonstrated by increase in the activity of antioxidative enzymes proline content and reduction in lipid peroxidation . Leaf gas exchange was affected at the highest soil Cd concentrations 0.4 0.6 and 0.8mmol Cd kg

@highlight High concentrations of Zn Cd and Zn Cd in the soil promoted alterations in metabolism and expression of genes.
@highlight Leaf gas exchange were affected at the highest concentrations of soil Cd combined with different concentrations of soil Zn.
@highlight Cd and Zn Cd promoted thickness reduction of the leaf mesophyll.
@highlight Roots immobilized much of the Cd in their tissues thereby avoiding part of absorbed Cd transported to aerial part.
@highlight Combinations of Zn Cd applied in the soil reduced oxidative stress and programmed cell death.
