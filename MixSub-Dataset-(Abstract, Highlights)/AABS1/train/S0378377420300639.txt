 Evapotranspiration is a major hydrologic flux in water resources planning and irrigation management . While recent advances in remote sensing have enabled availability of high spatial and temporal resolution ET data a lack of information related to error in the estimations has made it challenging to use this data for on farm irrigation management decision making . In this study three commonly used single source RS based ET models were used to estimate daily actual evapotranspiration ET

@highlight RS based ET
@highlight estimates for three crops were compared to surface renewal ET
@highlight measurements.
@highlight pySEBAL and METRIC performed better under full canopy cover than early in the season.
@highlight SEBS performed the best among three remote sensing models for daily ET
@highlight estimation.
@highlight Results show potential of using remote sensing based ET
@highlight in operational irrigation management.
