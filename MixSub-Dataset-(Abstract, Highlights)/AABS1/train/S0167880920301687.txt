 Wetland grazing by livestock once widespread throughout Europe is increasingly used in conservation management . To avoid conflicts and enable cooperation between wetland users and conservationists habitat quality indicators relevant to both stakeholder groups would be useful . We aimed to identify which indicators of grazed wetland habitat quality are important to the two groups and which are the preferred trends for these indicators along a grazing intensity gradient .

@highlight Wetland habitat quality indicators of conservationists and herders were compared.
@highlight Key indicators were tested along a gradient of ungrazed to heavily grazed sites.
@highlight There were no key indicators where the two groups had opposing preferred trends.
@highlight Vegetation height shrub and litter cover decreased with grazing intensity.
@highlight Forage grasses and frequency of rare mud species increased with grazing intensity.
