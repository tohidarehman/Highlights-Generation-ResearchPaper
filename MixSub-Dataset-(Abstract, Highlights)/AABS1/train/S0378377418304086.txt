 In Iran due to arid and semi arid climate groundwater resources play an essential role in food production as well as domestic and industrial water supply . In recent years increasing population scarcity of surface water resources and effects of worldwide and regional climate change have resulted in over exploitation and unsustainability of these resources in the country . The present study aims to estimate groundwater sustainable yield examine effects of spatial and temporal scale and propose a plan for groundwater sustainable use in Nishapur Plain in the north east of Iran . In investigating the effects of spatial scale the area of the plain is divided into several zones with estimation of groundwater recharge and discharge for each zone and the temporal scale refers to the different time scales used to estimate the average value of groundwater recharge and discharge . The results of the transient groundwater model of Nishapur Plain revealed that average annual groundwater storage depletion is about 311 MCM

@highlight Spatial and temporal scale together greatly affect groundwater sustainable yield.
@highlight Appropriate spatial and temporal scales result in the highest equilibrium groundwater level.
@highlight Increasing irrigation efficiency is essential for groundwater sustainability.
@highlight Defining appropriate spatial and temporal scales increases sustainable yield.
