 is unique among homoiochlorophyllous resurrection plants with its ability to tolerate also low temperatures at temperate climate . This study was carried out to elucidate the response and acclimation ability of photosynthetic apparatus to cold and the capacity to tolerate freezing temperatures . Cold acclimated plants experienced short term freezing conditions under controlled environment in climatic chamber and also long term subzero winter temperatures in an

@highlight Cold acclimated fresh leaves of
@highlight survive subzero temperatures.
@highlight Newly observed narrow epidermal channels contribute to the fast water loss upon frost stress.
@highlight Decrease in the efficiency of excitation energy transfer to reaction centers is essential for frost survival.
@highlight Survival of frost conditions is also based on desiccation like readjustment of the photosynthetic apparatus.
