 The evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis assumes that recently introduced populations of alien species are under low pressure from enemies which allows them to reduce investment into defence and re allocate the saved resources into the improvement of characteristics related to competitive abilities . We performed EICA tests to check if the low dispersal potential of

@highlight Only in the youngest population were EICA assumptions partially confirmed.
@highlight Along roadsides low enemy load may allow increasing plant growth and fertility.
@highlight Frequent roadside mowing may significantly reduce
@highlight populations.
@highlight Enemy release may lead to maladaptive habitat choice in
@highlight Streams rather than roadsides may be crucial in future
@highlight invasion.
