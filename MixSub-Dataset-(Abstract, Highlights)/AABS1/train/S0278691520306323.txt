 SARS CoV 2 infection has recently become a worldwide challenge with dramatic global economic and health consequences . As the pandemic is still spreading new data concerning Covid 19 complications and related mechanisms become increasingly available . Accumulating data suggest that the incidence of cardiac arrest and its outcome are adversely affected during the Covid 19 period . This may be further exacerbated by drug related cardiac toxicity of Covid 19 treatment regimens . Elucidating the underlying mechanisms that lead to Covid 19 associated cardiac arrest is imperative not only in order to improve its effective management but also to maximize preventive measures . Herein we discuss available epidemiological data on cardiac arrest during the Covid 19 pandemic as well as possible associated causes and pathophysiological mechanisms and highlight gaps in evidence warranting further investigation . The risk of transmission during cardiopulmonary resuscitation is also discussed in this review . Finally we summarize currently recommended guidelines on CPR for Covid 19 patients including CPR in patients with cardiac arrest due to suspected drug related cardiac toxicity in an effort to underscore the most important common points and discuss discrepancies proposed by established international societies .

@highlight Covid 19 pandemic is associated with increased incidence of cardiac arrest.
@highlight Cardiac non cardiac causes and drug related toxicity may jointly contribute to cardiac arrest associated with Covid 19.
@highlight Recommendations for cardiac arrest management are modified during the pandemic.
@highlight Recommendations for prevention and management of drug related toxicity related to Covid 19 are summarized.
