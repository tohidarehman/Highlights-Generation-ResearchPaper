 Typhoons of varying intensities severely impact ecosystem functioning in tropical regions and their increasing frequencies and intensities due to global warming pose new challenges for effective forest restoration . This study examines the impact of a super typhoon on the regenerating native secondary forest and exotic monocultural plantations in the degraded tropical landscape of Hong Kong . The super typhoon which hit Hong Kong on 16 September 2018 lasted for 10h and was the most severe storm affecting Hong Kong over the past 100 years . Hong Kong s secondary forest is a mosaic of forest patches recovering through natural succession since 1945 and plantation stands of exotic monocultural species . We determine the loss in biomass by performing NDVI difference analysis using two Landsat 8 multispectral images acquired before and after the typhoon . This the assessment of typhoon impacts according to successional age group structural stages of vegetation landscape topography and on stands of exotic plantations . Results indicate that hilltops open shrubland and grassland were hard hit especially on southwest and southeast facing slopes and almost 90 of the landscape showed abnormal change . Patches of exotic monoculture plantation

@highlight All age classes of regenerating secondary forest are affected by typhoon damage.
@highlight Exotic monoculture plantations are most affected with little standing vegetation remaining.
@highlight Typhoon damage arrests the succession due lack of a viable species pool and dispersal agents.
@highlight Competition among large numbers of weak stems regarded as the new normal.
