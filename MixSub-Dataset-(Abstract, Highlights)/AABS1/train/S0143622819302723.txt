 The spatial structure of agricultural landscapes can affect crop resilience to potential pest development . Previous studies have found several spatial landscape metrics related to the abundance of the olive fruit fly

@highlight Spanish rural areas increased in spatial diversity decreasing their spatial grain.
@highlight Spanish olive grove landscapes have increased their concentration and covered area.
@highlight A novel weighted index was developed to quantify spatial resilience to
@highlight Spatial resilience in southern Spain was low throughout the time series studied.
@highlight The weighted spatial resilience index is a useful tool for planning olive landscapes.
