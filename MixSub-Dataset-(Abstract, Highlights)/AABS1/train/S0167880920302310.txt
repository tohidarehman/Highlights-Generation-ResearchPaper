 Nitrogen is an essential ingredient for the production of food in agricultural systems . As the use of industrial fertilizers has risen over time so too have concerns relating to N losses from these systems and the contamination of air and water climate change impacts and biodiversity losses these cause . In order to balance continuing and improving agricultural productivity with the potential for N losses improved estimates of N additions N use efficiency and N losses to the environment are crucial .

@highlight Crop N use efficiency increased from 46.7 to 50.8 over the period 19962016.
@highlight Livestock N use efficiency increased from 21.2 to 22.8 over the same period.
@highlight Overall N use efficiency in Canadian agriculture increased from 58.3 to 59.5 .
@highlight N inputs not exported in crops or livestock rose by over 50 from 1.01 to 1.54Tg.
