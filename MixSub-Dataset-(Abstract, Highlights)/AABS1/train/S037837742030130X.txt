 This study proposes a performance appraisal framework for agricultural water distribution systems based on the Water Food Energy Nexus perspective . To analyze and evaluate agricultural water distribution systems with this framework various methods of improving the operational management were developed and tested under the conventional and water shortages in operational scenarios . The Water Food Energy Nexus indicators were then calculated for performance appraisal of the water distribution systems in a study area located in central Iran . The results indicated that by upgrading the manual operation to an automatic control system gave the best results from the nexus indicators perspectives . The Bayesian Network model was used to present a probabilistic approach that could assist managers and decision makers in evaluating the performance of the system based on the nexus perspective . For this purpose various configurations of the Bayesian Network structures were developed based on an export oriented approach and the most appropriate model was determined for the test case . The calibration and validation process of the selected configuration approved a high accuracy in fulfilling the objective of the study . The developed framework can be employed as a decision support model to prioritize options for modernizing agricultural water distribution systems .

@highlight Inefficient agricultural water distribution can lead to reduced efficiency of water food and energy sectors.
@highlight Operational methods for agricultural water distribution systems are evaluated using WFEN.
@highlight Probabilistic Bayesian network model is developed to analyze the WFEN relationships.
@highlight WFEN framework is employed for performance assessment of the Rudasht irrigation network.
