 The widespread fungal aeroplankton comprises numerous plant pathogens and allergenic components . Here we present the first study describing the airborne spore composition in the Central and Eastern Black Sea region of Turkey against the background of meteorological variables and land use . This region is climatically diverse and there are large differences in altitude and land cover . Using multivariate statistical techniques we assessed the combined effects of the main weather factors on the airborne spore count and temporal patterns of spore season for 30 fungal taxa in five provinces with three different climate types . Moreover we combined meteorological and land use data to search for potential source areas of airborne spores recorded at the study sites .

@highlight Potential spore source areas identified by combining wind conditions with land use.
@highlight Grasslands croplands and coniferous forests are main potential sources of spores.
