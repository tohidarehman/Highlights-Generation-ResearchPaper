 Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease with increasing incidence and prevalence worldwide . Currently used treatments of UC are unsatisfactory while natural bioactive compounds are considered to be emerging therapeutic agents . Luteolin is a natural compound with beneficial effects in a variety of diseases however its effect in UC has been poorly studied . In this study we investigated the effect of Lut in posttreatment and cotreatment of dextran sulfate sodium induced experimental colitis in mice . In addition the role of extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 2 in the mechanism of action of Lut in experimental colitis was investigated using the ERK inhibitor PD0325901 . Lut attenuated symptoms of DSS induced colitis in mice ameliorated colon tissue damage and reduced inflammation apoptosis and autophagy . The effect was more pronounced if Lut was administered simultaneously with DSS . The administration of ERK inhibitor exacerbated DSS induced colitis symptoms and prevented the protective effects of Lut . The results provide new mechanistic details underlying the anti inflammatory anti apoptotic and anti autophagic effects of Lut through the activation of the ERK signaling pathway . This suggested that Lut can be used as a novel therapeutic candidate in the treatment of UC or could be used as a supplement to existing therapy .

@highlight Luteolin ameliorated symptoms of experimental colitis in mice.
@highlight The protective activity of luteolin was achieved through its anti inflammatory anti apoptotic and anti autophagic effects.
@highlight The mechanism of action of luteolin is mediated by the induction of the ERK1 2 signaling pathway.
