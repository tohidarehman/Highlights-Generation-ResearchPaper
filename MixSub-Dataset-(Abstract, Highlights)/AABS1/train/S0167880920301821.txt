 Soil organic carbon dynamics along land use changes influences the terrestrial and global carbon cycle the climate soil fertility agricultural productivity and food security . Taking soils under native forests as an appropriate ecological reference we studied changes in soil organic carbon stock along eight land use types in the highlands of Ethiopia . The general objective of the study was to investigate the dynamics of SOC stock following chrono sequence land use cover systems in the highlands of Ethiopia . The specific objectives were to analyze loss due to land degradation analyze gain due to land restoration and estimate partial balance of SOC stock for the highlands of Ethiopia . The study followed the principle of the Forest Transition Theory . Eleven sub areas were considered from the highlands of Ethiopia . A total of 241 auger composite samples from the topsoil were collected during December 2017 to June 2018 and analyzed at CropNut soil lab in Nairobi . The study results revealed that there were statistically significant variations across the land use types with the mean stocks ranging from 31.4 Mg SOC ha

@highlight Significant variations exist in SOC stocks among the studied land uses.
@highlight The natural ecosystems of the Ethiopian highlands had the highest SOC stock.
@highlight Conversions to cropland and intensively grazed land are sources of CO
@highlight Estimated gains and losses of SOC stock revealed negative partial balance.
@highlight Enclosure and afforestation enhanced carbon sequestration potential.
