 The decline of mountain forests under global change is alarming and conservation is challenged by the need to assemble populations able to deal with the predicted environmental shifts . Assessing intraspecific differentiation in stress susceptibility of tree species along elevational gradients is crucial to identify adequate genetic sources for mountain forest restoration . Here we assessed injury and metabolic responses across cold stress intensity gradients in low and high elevation populations of the endangered mountain tree

@highlight Mountain forests decline under global change.
@highlight Adequate genetic sources must be identified for sustainable forest restoration.
@highlight Elevation gradients can foster divergence in stress resistance among tree populations.
@highlight Metabolic cold stress responses increase with elevation of tree population origin.
@highlight Seed selection for forest restoration should orient towards elevation gradient.
