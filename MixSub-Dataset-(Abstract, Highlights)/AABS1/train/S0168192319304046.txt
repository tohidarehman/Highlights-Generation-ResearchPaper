 Because of its low cost and simple fabrication it is easy to advocate for the single probe method as a method of choice in sap flow studies . An improved single probe method with finite heating duration is verified both in cut stem segments and in the field using mature beech

@highlight F SPHP can measure lower sap flow rates compared to I SPHP.
@highlight F SPHP measures similar diel sap flow patterns as Sapflow in the field.
@highlight F SPHP is relatively insensitive to natural temperature gradients.
@highlight F SPHP causes less physical damage to trees.
