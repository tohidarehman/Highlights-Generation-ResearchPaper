 Soil moisture plays a key role in vegetation restoration and ecosystem stability . Terracing modulates hydrological processes by lowering the slope gradient and shortening the slope length . The response of soil moisture variation to terracing is strongly influenced by land use climate topography and terracing characteristics . In this study we conducted a meta analysis to examine the response of soil moisture to terracing in China . For Chinas landscapes terracing generally improved the soil moisture by 12.9 . Relative to other terracing structures level ditches showed the greatest water conservation benefits especially on steep slopes . Terracing had higher water storage benefits in the northern plains and the southern dry hot valleys of China . The benefits of water storage by terracing rose with increasing slope gradients above 15 and fell with increasing depth of soil layers . Soil moisture in the 0100cm depth differed among terracing structures but not among land uses mainly due to the differences in evapotranspiration under different micro topographical conditions . In contrast soil moisture at the depth of 100200cm differed among land use types but not among terracing structures only because root water uptake always differed across land use types . Regarding climatic factors precipitation played a dominant role in soil moisture variation .
