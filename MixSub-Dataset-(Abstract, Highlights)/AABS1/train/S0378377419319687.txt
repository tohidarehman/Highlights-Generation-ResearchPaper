 A proper prediction of the water table depth in hydrological models highly depends on the accuracy of evapotranspiration estimation . In this study the response of WT fluctuations to changes in ET was investigated involving the DRAINMOD water management model . The WT depth data were measured during three canola growing seasons in a paddy field with two subsurface drainage systems in the north of Iran . For the growing seasons ET was estimated through 17 equations including five temperature based four radiation based three pan evaporation based four combination based and one mass transfer based equations . The estimated ET values was then applied in the calibrated DRAINMOD model to simulate the corresponding WT depths in the drainage systems . The reliability of various ET estimation methods and the model predictions were evaluated using determination coefficient R

@highlight The combination based equations were not suitable for ET estimation in the north of Iran.
@highlight FAO 24 radiation Blaney Criddle Irmak and FAO 24 pan provided the best ET estimations.
@highlight The Rohwer and FAO 24 pan equations provided better simulation of the water table depths in DRAINMOD than Thornthwaite.
