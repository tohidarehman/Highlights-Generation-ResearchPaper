 Despite the evident importance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi associated with the root and rhizosphere system of elevation gradients limit is known about the difference in AM fungal diversity between root and rhizosphere and their influencing factors along elevation gradients . AM fungal Here we designed an elevation gradient experiment which covered six elevations and three vegetation types and collected plant and soil samples . We used Illumina gene sequencing to analyze AM fungal diversity in roots and rhizosphere soils other potential factors such as plant diversity leaf C N and P litter soil and microbial biomass extracellular enzymes activity and the bacterial and ITS broad fungal diversity were also determined . We found that AM fungal diversity differences between root and rhizosphere soil diminished as elevation increased despite that AM fungal diversity had a well known pattern with elevation . Compared with plant characteristics soil properties were stronger effect on AM fungal diversity between root and rhizosphere . Particularly soil extracellular enzymes activity and bacterial and ITS broad fungal diversity explained more variation in AM fungal diversity dynamics along the elevation gradients . Our findings indicate that the diminishment of AM fungal diversity in root and rhizosphere soil are a response to elevation gradients through changes of soil extracellular enzymes activity and the bacterial and fungi communities which provided evidence that AM fungal community dynamics link to climate change .

@highlight AMF diversity between root and rhizosphere soil diminished as elevation increased.
@highlight Microbial diversity followed a unimodal pattern with increasing elevation.
@highlight Soil ecoenzymatic activity explained more variation in AMF diversity dynamics.
@highlight Soil properties were more closely related to the AMF between root and rhizosphere.
