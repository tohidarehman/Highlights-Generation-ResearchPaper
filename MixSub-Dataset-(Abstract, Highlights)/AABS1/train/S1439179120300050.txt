 The conversion of natural lands in urban areas is exponentially increasing worldwide causing a major decline in biodiversity . Environmental alterations caused by urbanization such as land conversion and isolation of natural patches favour tolerant and generalist species causing both species loss and replacement . In addition selective pressure is exerted on particular functional traits driving a functional homogenization or turnover of biotic communities . We sampled ground arthropods within the municipality of Turin wherein an isolated and a connected control subplot were repeatedly sampled at 15 stations distributed along a gradient of increasing urbanization . Such a nested sampling design allowed us to investigate the taxonomic and the functional responses of carabids and spiders to both the urbanization level and patch isolation . First we highlighted the dominant role played by species homogenization

@highlight We studied carabid and spider responses to impervious surfaces and patch isolation.
@highlight The nestedness component mainly explained the total taxonomic and functional diversity.
@highlight Impervious surfaces cause functional homogenization and turnover in both groups.
@highlight Patch isolation homogenizes and shifts species composition in both groups.
@highlight Spider dispersal capacity increases with urbanization density and patch isolation.
