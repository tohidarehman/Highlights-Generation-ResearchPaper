 Doxorubicin or adriamycin is an anthracycline antineoplastic drug widely used in the chemotherapy of a large variety of cancers due to its potency and action spectrum . However its use is limited by the toxicity on healthy cells and its acute and chronic side effects . One of the developed strategies to attenuate DOX toxicity is the combined therapy with bioactive compounds such as flavonoids . This review embraces the role of flavonoids on DOX treatment side effects . Protective properties of some flavonoidss against DOX toxicity have been investigated and observed mainly in heart but also in liver kidney brain testis or bone marrow . Protective mechanisms involve reduction of oxidative stress by decrease of ROS levels and or increase antioxidant defenses and interferences with autophagy apoptosis and inflammation . Studies in cancer cells have reported that the anticancer activity of DOX was not compromised by the flavonoids . Moreover some of them increased DOX efficiency as anti cancer drug even in multidrug resistant cells .

@highlight DOX induces damage in multiple organs and tissues.
@highlight Some flavonoids have shown a protective effect against DOX toxicity.
@highlight Oxidative stress inflammation apoptosis or autophagy alterations were modulated.
@highlight Clinical trials are necessary to validate the results obtained in pre clinical models.
