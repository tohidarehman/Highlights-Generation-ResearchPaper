 To better understand the process of land reclamation in the Dongting Plain this paper reconstructed the spatiotemporal distribution of polders in the area . The images of polder patches were extracted from Google Earth using visual interpretation and the corresponding polder names and times of polder construction were extracted from maps and local gazetteers . Moreover this paper examined the possible relationships between the spatiotemporal distribution of polders and the regional environment change and socio economic history . The results showed that The total area occupied by modern polders is 9703.18km

@highlight In the Dongting Plain 9703.18 km
@highlight wetland were converted into the polders in 1368 1980 of which 23.75 were constructed before 1850.
@highlight The polders constructed before 1850 were mainly distributed along the river banks in the southern and western region.
@highlight The polders expanded in the northern central after 1850 and were strongly affected by the sediments from the Yangtze River or shrunken lakes.
