 Reducing consumption of salt specifically sodium is one of the most effective ways to improve public health . A novel formulation for producing salmon pt with reduced sodium content was investigated . Salmon pts with three different sodium concentrations were evaluated using microbiological sensory and chemical analyses . Saltwell a natural salt containing a mixture of sodium chloride and potassium chloride was used for partial substitution of sodium chloride alone in the formulation . Replacing 80 of the sodium chloride with Saltwell resulted in a 22 reduction in sodium without affecting microbial activity . A trained sensory panel observed minor differences in three of the twelve sensory attributes that were evaluated . However these differences were only weakly significant . Saltwell is a viable alternative to sodium chloride to produce seafood products with reduced sodium content without compromising quality and safety .

@highlight Sodium chloride was substituted with Saltwell to produce salmon pts with reduced sodium content.
@highlight Microbiological and nutritional qualities of salmon pts were maintained while the sodium content was reduced by 22 .
@highlight Sensory profiles of the reduced sodium salmon pts and the original common salt salmon pts were very similar.
@highlight Saltwell is an alternative to sodium chloride in the formulation of salmon pts and can be used to reduce sodium content.
