 Changing climatic conditions can fundamentally alter the interactions between species with important implications for agriculture . The impacts of shifts in precipitation on trophic interactions have been understudied relative to other climate drivers . We carried out field experiments to examine how precipitation attack by parasitoid wasps

@highlight Crop pest herbivores and their parasitoids significantly impact wheat yield.
@highlight Cascading effects of parasitoids on yield were consistent across precipitation levels.
@highlight Tri trophic interactions can be robust to large shifts in a major climate driver.
