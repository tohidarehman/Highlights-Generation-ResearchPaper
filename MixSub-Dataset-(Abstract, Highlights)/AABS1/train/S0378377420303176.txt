 Compost olive mill wastewater and legume cover crops combined with complementary irrigation by saline water were tested under field conditions during 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons

@highlight The effects of compost olive mill wastewater OMWW and the use of legumes as cover crops combined with complementary irrigation by saline water on soil salinity olive tree productivity and phenol contents in fruit and oil were assessed during 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons.
@highlight High interaction between complementary irrigation by saline water and organic amendments was observed on soil salinity nutrients statut and trees performances.
@highlight The use of saline water and OMWW accentuated the soil salinity and the sodium toxicity on olive leaves.
@highlight The use of compost and legumes reduced the negative effects of water salts while only legumes cover crop maintain high phenol levels in fruit and olive oil.
