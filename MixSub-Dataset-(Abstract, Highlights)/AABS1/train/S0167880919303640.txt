 Inappropriate management of pig manure contributes considerably to pollution of waterbodies by nitrogen and phosphorus and to air pollution by ammonia NH

@highlight Dietary manipulations of pigs were systematically evaluated by a meta analysis.
@highlight Lowering dietary crude protein reduces N excretion but may impair pig growth.
@highlight Adding certain additives in feed reduces both NH
@highlight and H
@highlight S emissions.
@highlight Supplementing enzymes in feed decrease N and P excretion while improving pig growth.
@highlight Various feeding strategies have potentials of saving cost and abating N emissions.
