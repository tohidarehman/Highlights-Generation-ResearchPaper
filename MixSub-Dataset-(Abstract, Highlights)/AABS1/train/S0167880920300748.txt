 Ecosystem restoration is an urgent and vital measure to restore degraded land in ecologically fragile regions . The terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity is important to indicate the effectiveness of ecosystem restoration which has attracted the interest of many researchers . Ecologically fragile regions cover a large area in China but few studies have focused on the carbon benefit of ecological restoration in these regions . In this study we investigated the spatial and temporal changes in the carbon benefit indicated by net primary productivity in ecologically fragile regions in China . We evaluated the contributions of ecological restoration and climate change to terrestrial ecosystem carbon sink changes . The results showed that the ecological restoration projects significantly improved the carbon sequestration capacity in most of the ecologically fragile regions . From 20012017 the annual NPP of the entire study region was 460.1 5.4 Tg C yr

@highlight We separate net primary productivity into human induced and climate driven components.
@highlight Ecological restoration increased NPP in 70 of Chinas ecologically fragile regions.
@highlight A plausible restoration effect was found in the area with low carbon capacity.
@highlight Restoration induced agricultural land use changes were vital for terrestrial NPP.
