 Contamination of cereal crops with zearalenone a mycotoxin produced by Fusarium fungi is a worldwide health concern . The study assessed the ameliorative potential of resveratrol a potent antioxidant against ZEA induced toxicity in adult male Wistar rats . Rats with an average weight of 100150g were used for the exposure study for three weeks . The animals were divided into four groups each comprising 10 rats . Group I was kept as negative control and was administered normal saline . Group II and III were exposed to 2mg kg of the mycotoxin ZEA administered intraperitoneally once every week . Group III was treated with resveratrol orally daily . Group IV was treated only with resveratrol as a positive control . The protective effect of resveratrol was evaluated on biochemical variables biomarkers of oxidative stress markers of immunotoxicity and DNA damage . The findings showed that exposure to ZEA elicited oxidative stress and modulated the antioxidant enzyme activities . A disarray in the lipid profile parameters of the humoral and cellular immune response serum cytokines and immunoglobulins was also observed . Further COMET assay showed detectable DNA lesions . Taken together RSV was efficacious in reducing and or reversing the ZEA induced toxicity .

@highlight The study highlights the manifestation of the zearlenone induced mycotoxicosis in terms of oxidative damage hepatotoxicity immunotoxicity and DNA damage.
@highlight Based on a broad assessment of the parameters evaluated the key findings clearly suggest an ameliorative effect of resveratrol against the zearalenone induced immunotoxicity and genotoxicity as the treatment significantly reversed the alterations caused.
@highlight This could be attributed to its potent antioxidant status. Taken together our findings unravelled the use of resveratrol as a possible mitigator in zearlenone induced toxicity in rats.
