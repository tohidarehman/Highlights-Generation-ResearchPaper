 A significant restructuring of vineyards is currently taking place in the European Union as a result of the implementation of a restructuring and conversion of vineyards regulation in southwest Europe so that trellis vineyards are rapidly replacing traditional vineyards . These changes may influence patterns of space use in birds which may avoid modified habitats . We assess how the location of traditional and trellis vineyards might influence the distribution of great bustard

@highlight Great bustards significantly avoid trellis vineyards especially at closer distances.
@highlight Great bustards show a neutral or preference for proximity to traditional vineyards.
@highlight Trellis vineyards surface increases would decrease proportion of suitable habitat.
@highlight Regulation and legislative changes are advised for trellis vineyard.
