 Global changes such as climate and urbanization are strongly entwined and aggravated by the development of human activities which also intensifies the human mediated dispersal of species . However few studies have explicitly considered the combined influence of urbanization and climate on species expansion . We investigated the combined roles of climate urbanization and human mediated dispersal in the expansion of
