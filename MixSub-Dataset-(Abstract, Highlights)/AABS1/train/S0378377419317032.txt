 In this paper we introduce a hydro economic modeling framework for the management of groundwater resources that are used for irrigated agricultural production . The model MOD AT can be used to study the costs of aquifer depletion and the net benefits of specific aquifer management policies . MOD AT is composed of three components namely an economic component a hydrologic component and an agronomic component . A main goal of this paper is to introduce the hydro economic model and describe how it can be transferable to different contexts . With this objective in mind we describe model components step by step so that the process of integration can be replicated easily . We then apply the model to study the efficacy of a pumping tax in Finney County Kansas USA which overlies the High Plains Aquifer . The results show that a pumping tax results in an increase in average well capacities in the county over time relative to the status quo which increases the average profitability of agricultural production . However the increase in profitability is not uniform across producers and some producers gain more than others under the tax .

@highlight We introduce a hydro economic model for agricultural groundwater management.
@highlight MOD AT integrates economic hydrologic and agronomic model components.
@highlight Application of MOD AT shows how a pumping tax impacts groundwater levels and profits over time.
@highlight The benefits of a pumping tax are spatially heterogeneous.
