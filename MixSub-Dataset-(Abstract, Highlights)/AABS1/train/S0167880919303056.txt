 The biodiversity ecosystem function hypothesis predicts that increased richness within a trophic level supports greater resource capture . However higher predator richness commonly found within organic compared to conventional agroecosystems does not always result in enhanced pest suppression . The striped cucumber beetle

@highlight was negatively correlated with pest density.
@highlight Organic crop management enhanced predator density but not biological control.
