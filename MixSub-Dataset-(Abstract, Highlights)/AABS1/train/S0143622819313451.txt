 Although weather is expected to influence human behavior including crime its association with crime has been relatively understudied in an environmental context of small areal and temporal units . This study investigates the association between temperature and assaults in the city of Seoul South Korea . It also examines how interaction between temperature and socio economic variables relates to assaults . Monthly assault counts in small administrative units for a 36 month period are described with Bayesian Poisson models . Employing the space time structure of the dataset these Poisson models are specified with a set of spatial and or temporal effects and estimated with the integrated nested Laplace approximation . Results show that a model specification accounting for spatial and temporal structure better explains the data . Also results indicate that assault risk is higher in high temperatures areas with low economic status and or highly commercialized land use areas . Moreover significant interactions between temperature and environmental variables are found .

@highlight Bayesian spatio temporal modeling integrated nested Laplace approximation INLA enrich temperature assaults insights.
@highlight Finding assaults temperature association positive arising more in lower economic status commercialized land use areas.
@highlight A positive temperature poverty level and a negative temperature commercialized land use interaction effect on assaults.
@highlight Conventional regression ignoring the spatio temporal structure of data might render misleading correlation conclusions.
