 The use of chemical pesticides to preserve food commodities is a global issue of concern due to their negative effect on the environment and public health . In recent years the European Union is trying to reduce their use favoring alternative or complementary approaches based on natural products . In this scenario plant borne essential oils represent valid options for Integrated Pest Management programs . In the present study the insecticidal effect of eight EOs obtained from plants from different parts of the world namely

@highlight EO 500 ppm killed 97 of
@highlight adults within 3 days on maize.
@highlight EO 500 ppm killed all
@highlight adults within 2 days on wheat.
@highlight EO 500 ppm killed 95 of
@highlight adults within 4 days on wheat.
@highlight and
@highlight EOs 1000 ppm killed 93 of
@highlight larvae on wheat after 16 h.
@highlight These EOs may be considered for developing green grain protectants against stored product pests.
