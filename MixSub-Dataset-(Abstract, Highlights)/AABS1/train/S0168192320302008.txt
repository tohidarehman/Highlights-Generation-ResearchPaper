 Photosynthesis is the basis of crop yield and quality . Real time quantitative monitoring of crop photosynthetic parameters is important to assess crop growth status and to predict yield and quality . In the present study we conducted two field experiments using two rice cultivars

@highlight The LRCs of different leaf positions during rice growth stages were constructed.
@highlight The novel SIPIm R720 R550 R800 R680 index estimated photosynthetic parameters.
@highlight The index performed well on ground based hyper spectra and UAV based multi spectra.
@highlight UAV and an LRC model could predict rice leaf layer photosynthetic variation.
