 Phenological observations are important as indicators of global warming and as estimation tools for the terrestrial carbon balance in vulnerable ecosystems such as the last fragments of floodplain forests in the Czechia . The aim of this paper was to compare ground based phenological observations of three dominant species in this ecosystem with the seasonal trajectory of the greenness index G

@highlight 4 years of species oriented phenocamera and ground based phenological observations.
@highlight Confirmed prolongation of growing season length due to a warmer climate.
@highlight Phenocamera derived phenophases corresponded closely with field observations.
@highlight Greenup was advanced by above average warm days but leaf maturation was delayed.
@highlight Cold spell in 2017 showed marked effect on phenological shifts.
