 The choice of coordinate system to calculate eddy covariance fluxes becomes particularly relevant at complex measurement sites . The traditional way is to perform double rotation of the coordinate system i.e . to calculate turbulent fluxes in a coordinate system that is aligned with the flow streamlines within the flux averaging period e.g .

@highlight Non zero vertical wind speeds at complex sites depend on wind direction stability and time of day.
@highlight The planar fitted coordinate system for flux calculation is preferred over double rotation method.
@highlight Continuous planar fitting method can reduce the uncertainty in obtaining the long term averaged coordinate frame.
