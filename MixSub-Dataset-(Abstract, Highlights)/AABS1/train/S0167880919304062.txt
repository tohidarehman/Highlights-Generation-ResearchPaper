 The deposition of pollutants and agricultural fertilizers substantially increases nutrient supply to the environment . Nutrient addition may shift the nutrient limitation type of plants e.g . from nitrogen limited to phosphorus limited . As the nutrient supply is expected to continue to grow it is important to understand the patterns of nutrient limitation and their effects on species composition . The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the long term effects of varied fertilization schemes i.e . N P PK PK 90 kg ha

@highlight In the long term N addition and P addition have the same effect on grassland species composition.
@highlight After nutrient addition productivity increases and then decreases in the long term.
@highlight The diversity of grassland is limited by multiple nutrients.
@highlight N limitation increases legume abundance.
