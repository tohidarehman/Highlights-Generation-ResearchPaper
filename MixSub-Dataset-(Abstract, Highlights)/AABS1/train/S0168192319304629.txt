 Numerous studies have proved that solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence is a good proxy of gross primary production . The SIF spectrum covers the spectral window from about 640nm to 850nm . Due to the strong chlorophyll absorption effect at the red band the red SIF is much more influenced by the radiative transfer effect inside the canopy than the near infrared SIF is . Therefore at the canopy level the NIR SIF shows more potential for use in estimating GPP . However the red band SIF contains more information about PS II which is more sensitive to photosynthesis . So in theory if the canopy radiative transfer effect could be corrected for the potential of the red SIF for estimating GPP would be greatly improved . In this paper we propose a new simple reflectance based method for estimating the photosystem level SIF at both the NIR band and the red band . Long term observations of SIF and GPP at two crop sites in two years were used to investigate the SIFGPP relationship at the canopy or photosystem level . The SIF downscaled by the simple reflectance based approach is found to be consistent with that found using the random forest regression method proposed formerly . For the NIR band the performance of the canopy level SIF and PS level SIF for GPP estimation is similar while for the red band the correlation between the SIF and GPP is greatly improved after downscaling the canopy level SIF to the PS level . For the four test datasets at the red band the values of

@highlight A simple method to estimate SIF emission at the photosystem level is proposed.
@highlight Only canopy BRF and NDVI are needed for SIF downscaling at the red and NIR bands.
@highlight Red band SIF at the photosystem level has great potential for monitoring GPP.
