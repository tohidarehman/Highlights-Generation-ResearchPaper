 Hybrid Maize model was evaluated for its performance for simulating maize growth grain yield soil water content and crop evapotranspiration ET

@highlight Hybrid Maize model was evaluated for maize growth yield SWC and ET
@highlight Model performed unsatisfactorily for estimating for most variables.
@highlight Model estimates were inconsistent for the same variables treatments between the years.
@highlight NRMSE of SWC estimates ranged from 62 in the 0.30m and 47 in 0.60m soil layer.
@highlight ET
@highlight was significantly underestimated up to 167mm in all years and treatments.
