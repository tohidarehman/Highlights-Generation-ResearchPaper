 This study investigated the impact of the coastal industrialization policy which began in 2015 in Indonesia . Because this policy has effected physical change on the environment it requires quantification to determine its driving factors and to formulate solutions to its problems . In doing so this research used remote sensing and machine learning techniques . Satellite data from Sentinel 2A were acquired for the years 2015 and 2019 for LULC model and Landsat 8 OLI for industrial growth model in coastal area . The data were processed using QGIS 3.8 software with machine learning techniques the Random Forest algorithm and sci kit learn library from Dzetsaka tools . The results showed that changes in land use and land cover areas significantly contributed to the loss of blue carbon storage of more than 20 . This finding confirms that the industrialization policy on the coastal area needs to be reviewed and land use monitoring must be more strictly regulated .

@highlight Indonesia plays an enormous role in global climate change.
@highlight Blue carbon data shortages can be complemented by spatial and remote sensing approaches.
@highlight Industrialization on the coastal area as a result of industrial policy in Indonesia in 2015 brought environmental problems to the coast.
@highlight Blue Carbon Storage BCS was significantly reduced by almost 20 due to the reduction in mangrove ecosystems.
