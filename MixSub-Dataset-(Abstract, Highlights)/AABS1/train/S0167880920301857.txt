 The effects of straw incorporation on soil characters are well known however straw incorporation depth impact on corn straw decomposition rate microbial biomass carbon microbial biomass nitrogen soil carbon and nitrogen concentration during straw decomposition have not been documented . A two year field experiment was carried out in a wheat corn cropping system to investigate the effects of straw incorporation depth on decomposition rate of corn straw and soil C and N release . The straw incorporation depths were topsoil 010cm medium depth 1020cm and deep depth 2030cm . The results showed that corn straw decomposition rate was significantly higher in TI by 24.5 and 16.5 than in MI and DI treatments from October 2016 to August 2017 . The average contents of MBC and MBN during the decomposition period of straw were higher in TI than in MI and DI treatments

@highlight Straw incorporation in topsoil layer promoted soil temperature and total porosity.
@highlight Corn straw incorporation in topsoil layer increased straw decomposition rate.
@highlight Higher decomposition rate caused higher availability of mineral N and TOC.
