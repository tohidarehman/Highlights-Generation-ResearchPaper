 Two thirds of human water use is linked to agricultural practices including crop irrigation . Furthermore excess irrigation leads to drainage problems . For this reason reduced irrigation strategies need to be implemented to protect water resources . However low irrigation may lead to crop water stress . A fast and inexpensive way to predict the necessary amount of irrigation required is by a model based approach . With this approach it is possible to explore the relation between irrigation crop water stress and drainage . However parameter uncertainty can reduce prediction accuracy . Therefore the aims of this research were to develop and test a methodology that allows the analysis of uncertainty sources in irrigation strategies to identify how much irrigation can be reduced while maintaining a low risk of crop stress and to explore the influence of uncertainty in soil parameters and evapotranspiration on model predictions . Results from a realistic case considered in this study indicated that while maintaining a low risk of crop stress it is possible to reduce drainage and water use for a conventional irrigation strategy . This reduction is dependent on the type of risk aversion strategy and is specific for a case scenario where variations are certain .

@highlight A methodological framework was developed to explore irrigation and drainage reduction under sources of uncertainty.
@highlight Monte Carlo analysis was used to address uncertain variations in soil and daily evapotranspiration.
@highlight We present four case studies with different uncertainty scenarios.
@highlight Water use and drainage can be reduced if a small risk of crop stress is accepted.
@highlight Certain irrigation strategy predictions advocate the importance of reduced uncertainty.
