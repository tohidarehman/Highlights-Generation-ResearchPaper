 Agricultural expansion and intensification threaten pollinator populations worldwide potentially jeopardizing crop pollination . Although the highest rates of cropland expansion are currently found within the tropics quantifying effects of landscape composition on tropical pollinator communities and the provided pollination services to crops has received relatively limited attention . Here we studied the relationship between land use in the landscape matrix surrounding Ethiopian coffee production forests and their bee communities and coffee pollination services . We used pan traps to collect bees from 20 plots located in small scale coffee

@highlight Extensive agricultural habitat supports bee diversity in coffee production forests.
@highlight Diverse farmer homesteads support bee diversity in coffee production forests.
@highlight Insect pollination contributes to early coffee fruit set.
@highlight Diverse pollinator community may increase temporal yield stability.
