 One plant trait that has been developed in several crop species to increase the effectiveness in water use through the cropping season is limited transpiration under elevated atmospheric vapor pressure deficit . This trait allows water conservation early in the season so that there is more soil water available late in the season for sustained physiological activity during seed development . In sweet corn

@highlight Limited transpiration trait a common occurrence among tested sweet corn lines.
@highlight Loss of transpiration trait at 38C compared to 32C occurred in half tested lines.
@highlight Low hydraulic conductance in lines with limited transpiration breakpoint.
@highlight Silver sensitive aquaporins seemingly in two lines with temperature sensitivity.
