 Determining methods for increasing irrigation water productivity is important for sustaining high wheat grain yields in the irrigated region of the Loess Plateau in China . Plastic covered ridge and furrow planting has been widely applied in dryland farming as it markedly increases precipitation productivity and crop yields . However whether this planting system can significantly increase irrigation water productivity and whether it can reduce the irrigation volume for high yielding wheat production in irrigated regions of the Loess Plateau are unclear . In the present study plastic covered ridge and furrow planting and traditional flatbed planting were performed at four irrigation levels . The objective was to investigate whether applying plastic covered ridge and furrow planting to an irrigated farmland system could reduce the irrigation water requirements and increase water productivity for high yielding wheat production . The results suggested that plastic covered ridge and furrow planting significantly increased soil moisture content and increased both grain yield and water productivity of wheat . At the 0 400 1200 and 2000m
