 The movement and distribution of the soil water and nitrogen are significantly influenced by tillage management . However the dynamics of soil water and nitrogen due to changes in tillage and surface residue cover can be difficult to characterize due to limitations in field experimentation . The objective of this study was to quantify the differences in the soil water and nitrogen balance in the 0100cm soil profile winter wheat

@highlight Studying dynamics of soil water and nitrogen balance under conventional tillage versus conservation tillage by using RZWQM model.
@highlight Quantifying the winter wheat yield water productivity and NUE under conventional tillage versus conservation tillage by using RZWQM model.
@highlight Establishing no tillage as the optimum tillage to replace the conventional tillage for a sandy loam soil in Henan Province of China.
