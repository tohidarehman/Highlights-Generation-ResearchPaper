 With a rapidly growing global population increased agricultural productivity is required to achieve future food security . Efficient use of water and other agricultural inputs such as nutrients and pesticides must underpin agronomic practices to improve crop establishment and increase crop yields . A glasshouse study was conducted to explore the potential of a newly developed sprayable biodegradable polymer membrane applied in bands to reduce soil evaporation and increase soil temperature thus improving germination emergence and crop establishment . The aims were two fold to evaluate the effectiveness of the SBPM in reducing seedbed water loss and its effect on seedling emergence and to determine an effective band width and application rate of SBPM to conserve seedbed water . Our study demonstrated that a high application rate 1kg m
