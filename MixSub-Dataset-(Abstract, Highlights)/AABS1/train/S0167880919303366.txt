 Seed predation by arthropods can contribute in regulating population and community dynamics of weeds . While the role of insects and especially ground beetles as seed predators in crop fields is well studied the drivers of predation stability and the relationships between species diversity and predation are less understood . The aims of the study were 1 to unveil the direct relationships between predator community diversity and seed predation intensity and stability and 2 to test the effects of soil disturbance and distance from field margin on seed predator communities and predation . Seed predation was measured using seed cards and predator communities were sampled using pitfall traps over two years . Granivorous ground beetles ants and crickets were the most abundant seed predators in both conventional and conservation tillage fields . Abundant and diverse predator communities were beneficial to predation intensity and stability . However in communities dominated by large predators an increase in number of species was related to a partial suppression of seed predation . Soil disturbance

@highlight Species rich communities of small predators enhance seed predation.
@highlight Co occurrence of several large species partially suppresses seed predation.
@highlight Soil disturbance does not influence overall level of seed predation.
@highlight Predation is higher and more stable at the field margins in conservation tillage.
@highlight Predation is higher and more stable at the field center in conventional tillage.
