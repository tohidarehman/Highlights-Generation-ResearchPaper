 Pollination services provided by managed honey bee and wild pollinators are essential for a range of crops . Pollination services can be measured as species related services which can be quantified by the combination of each species pollination efficiency and their abundance as well as harvest related services which can be quantified by the pollinator exclusion method . Species related pollination services are poorly documented and have never been directly compared to harvest related services . Here we aimed to quantify the pollination efficiency for common flower visiting species of common buckwheat

@highlight Pollination efficiencies of key flower visiting insects were assessed.
@highlight Managed honey bees were more efficient than wild pollinators.
@highlight Two approaches for estimating pollination services were strongly correlated.
@highlight It is possible to scale up the pollination efficiency to pollination services.
