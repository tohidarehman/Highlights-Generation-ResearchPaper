 We examined the effects of electronic cigarette on platelet and vascular function after 4 months of use compared to tobacco smoking . Forty smokers without cardiovascular disease were randomized to smoke either conventional cigarettes or an electronic cigarette . At baseline and after four months we measured a platelet function by Platelet Function Analyzer PFA 100 and Light Transmission Aggregometry b pulse wave velocity c plasma malondialdehyde levels as oxidative stress index and d the exhaled CO level . After 4 months continuation of conventional cigarette smoking further impaired platelet function compared to vaping as assessed by PFA and by LTA . Conversely compared to smoking vaping resulted in greater reduction of exhaled CO improvement of PWV and reduction of MDA . Switching to electronic cigarette for 4 months has a neutral effect on platelet function while it reduces arterial stiffness and oxidative stress compared to tobacco smoking .

@highlight Electronic Cigarette vaping for four months has a neutral effect on platelet aggregation of healthy smokers.
@highlight Continuation of tobacco cigarette smoking further deteriorates platelet function during 4 months of use.
@highlight Electronic cigarette vaping improves arterial elastic properties and oxidative stress after 4 months of use
@highlight Tobacco cigarette smoking causes further impairment of arterial elasticity and oxidative stress during 4 months of use
