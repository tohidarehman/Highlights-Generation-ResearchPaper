 In addition to their potential against deforestation and climate change agroforestry systems may have a relevant role in biodiversity conservation . In this sense not only species richness per se but also community composition including the distribution range of the species should be considered . The latter is especially relevant in the current context of biotic homogenization where the presence of geographically widely distributed species is increasingly frequent in detriment of native species .

@highlight Species composition depends on management intensity.
@highlight Intensively managed production systems harbor more worldwide distributed species.
@highlight Species with narrow distribution ranges thrive in organic and agroforestry systems.
@highlight Successional agroforestry systems have higher diversity of woody regrowths.
