 A comparative proteomic analysis was carried out to investigate the effects of various Light Emitting Diode light qualities including red LED blue LED red blue LED and white LED on the wounding response in

@highlight Our findings provide new insights in the effects of LED lights on the wounding stress.
@highlight RB LED light shows better capability to tolerate wound stress in
@highlight ROS signaling was possibly involved in the light induced wound responses.
