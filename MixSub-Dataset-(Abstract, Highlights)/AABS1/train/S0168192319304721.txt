 Forest cover creates a specific microclimate by buffering most environmental variables . If the influence of the overstory on microclimatic variables has been well studied the role of the understory has received less attention . In this study we investigated how the shrub layer modifies solar radiation air temperature relative air humidity vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture under different thinning treatments in an Aleppo pine forest

@highlight A buffering effect on T VPD RH was noted for the overstory and the understory.
@highlight This effect was more pronounced in summer due to a stronger shading effect.
@highlight Shrub influence on T RH VPD was higher in low pine cover and in open conditions.
@highlight Soil moisture was reduced in the presence of a developed shrub layer.
