 Intensified rotations and increased reliance on agrochemical inputs in many parts of the Andean highlands generate concern for soil health biodiversity and key ecosystem functions that are essential for maintaining agricultural productivity and the well being of smallholder communities throughout the region . Improved management of perennial vegetation within field margins represents a promising option currently being explored in many Andean communities with the potential to better design these field margins to support multiple ecosystem services . In this study we examined the effect of two types of common woody perennial field margins on crop production and other soil based ES at variable distances from the field edge . Sampling was conducted in twenty potato fields ten with borders dominated by alder trees

@highlight Biodiversity and ecosystem services in potato fields were strongly influenced by woody field margins.
@highlight Weed cover and potato yield increased at a greater distance from field margins.
@highlight Alder based field margins supported pest control and soil fertility more than eucalyptus margins.
@highlight Soil organic matter and macrofauna diversity were higher near alder field margins but not eucalyptus.
