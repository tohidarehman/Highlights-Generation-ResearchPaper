 Many crops are known to be dependent on biotic pollination but knowledge gaps remain regarding the extent of this dependence how it varies between crop varieties and the implications of biotic pollination for crop quality . Data is also lacking on the prevalence and extent of pollination deficits and the ability of the surrounding pollinator community to provide pollination services . Robust and standardised methodologies are crucial for pollination studies . However there has been only limited research into the critical question of the appropriate scale to apply these methods . Here we use a commercially important UK apple

@highlight Gala apples show high pollinator dependency for both yield and fruit quality.
@highlight Experimental scale affects results of pollination manipulation treatments.
@highlight Low apple seed count is an indicator of poor fruit quality and pollination deficit.
