 Saline soil and saline groundwater reduce agricultural productivity on drylands . We are developing a new aquaponics system to improve food productivity on such lands while effectively utilizing saline groundwater . In this study cultivation of Swiss chard

@highlight Effective use of saline groundwater is needed to produce more food in drylands.
@highlight Use of high Na fish wastewater was evaluated for hydroponic growth of Swiss chard.
@highlight Relative to the control fish wastewater was low in microelements and high in NO
@highlight Adding 50 of control microelements to fish wastewater produced sufficient yield.
@highlight NO
@highlight in fish wastewater did not cause unacceptably high NO
@highlight levels in Swiss chard.
