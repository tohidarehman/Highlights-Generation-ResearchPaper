 Use of eddy covariance as part of net ecosystem carbon balance studies of grazed grasslands has the potential to provide valuable insights into the influence of management on soil carbon stocks and opportunities for potential mitigation . However in rotationally grazed systems where the EC measurements extend across multiple paddocks often due to necessity interpretation of results can be complicated by differing paddock scale management regimes despite being the same land use with a single overarching farm scale management approach . Here we calculated separate annual CO

@highlight Footprint analysis allowed estimation of adjacent paddock CO
@highlight fluxes using a single EC system.
@highlight Paddock scale fluxes generally agreed well with site integrated fluxes.
@highlight Day to day farm management decisions impacted annual c budgets.
@highlight Several years data were required to determine the similarity of c budgets between paddocks.
@highlight Paddock scale discrimination of fluxes provide opportunities for testing methods to increase soil C.
