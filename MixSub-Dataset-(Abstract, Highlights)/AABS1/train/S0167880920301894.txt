 Although many grassland species may exist within agricultural landscapes some are still absent from individual grassland patches . Understanding which processes limit plant biodiversity within these landscapes is important and may be better understood if we consider local diversity relative to its species pool size . Here we test how habitat availability dispersal limitation grassland age and local environmental conditions affect the completeness of grassland plant communities at two spatial scales in an agricultural region in Southeast Estonia Northern Europe . We additionally test how species dispersal and persistence traits depend on the landscape and local environmental factors .

@highlight Grassland plant diversity is often low in agricultural landscapes.
@highlight We used co occurrence method to estimate potentially suitable but absent species 
@highlight  .
@highlight was calculated as ratio of
@highlight and
@highlight for each site.
@highlight Dispersal and habitat availability limited grassland completeness at the regional scale.
@highlight Productivity limited completeness at the landscape scale.
