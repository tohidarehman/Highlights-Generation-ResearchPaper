 Insect activity survival and development are affected by climatic conditions that elicit effects at multiple scales . Pruning small fruit crop canopies alters the microclimate which in turn may influence insect pest activity . We investigated the effect of three canopy density treatments on

@highlight Meta analyses reveal low magnitude effects of canopy density on microclimate.

@highlight infestation in caneberries.
@highlight Blueberry canopy can influence immature
@highlight survival.
@highlight Low canopy densities produce lower total yield but similar marketable yield.
