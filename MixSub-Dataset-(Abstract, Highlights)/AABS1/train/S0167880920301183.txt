 Land use intensity is increasing in Andean smallholder systems and innovations are needed to sustain soil fertility and productivity of potato cereal rotations with shortening fallow periods . In collaboration with farmers in central Peru we assessed forage based fallows in 58 fields across three production zones over three years . Fallow treatments selected with farmers tested grass legume mixtures with different combinations of

@highlight 3 year Andean fallows seeded with forages increased soil cover and forage supply.
@highlight Forage was of higher quality than in unseeded control fallows during year one.
@highlight After three years yield of potato was not reduced in forage based fallows.
@highlight Soil carbon trajectories in these fallows depend on the intensity of forage removal.
@highlight Farmers evaluations prioritized forage and potato yields and healthy potato tubers.
