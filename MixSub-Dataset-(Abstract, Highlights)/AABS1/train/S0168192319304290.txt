 The boreal forest will be strongly affected by climate change and in turn these vast ecosystems may significantly impact global climatology and hydrology due to their exchanges of carbon and water with the atmosphere . It is now crucial to understand the intricate relationships between precipitation and evapotranspiration in these environments particularly in less studied locations characterized by a cold and humid climate . This study presents state of the art measurements of energy and water budgets components over three years at the Montmorency Forest Qubec Canada a balsam fir boreal forest that receives 1600mm of precipitation annually . Precipitation evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration at the site are compared with observations from thirteen experimental sites around the world . These intercomparison sites encompass various types of climate and vegetation encountered in boreal forests worldwide . The Montmorency Forest stands out by receiving the largest amount of precipitation . Across all sites water availability seems to be the principal evapotranspiration constraint as precipitation tends to be more influential than potential evapotranspiration and other factors . This leads to the Montmorency Forest generating the largest amount of evapotranspiration on average 550mmy

@highlight Evapotranspiration 
@highlight  from a humid balsam fir boreal site was measured for 3 years.
@highlight Precipitation 
@highlight  and
@highlight from 13 boreal sites were compared to the study site.
@highlight Annual
@highlight ranged from 250 to 1600mm but annual
@highlight was capped to 550mm at all sites.
@highlight Under the greatest annual
@highlight  the main study site hence had large annual runoff.
@highlight could be limited by the canopy hydraulic transfer capacity or low energy inputs.
