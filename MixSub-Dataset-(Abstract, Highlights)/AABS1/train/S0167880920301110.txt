 Intensive management of agroecosystems has been widely indicated as major responsible for soil degradation thus negatively impacting on relationships between agriculture and climate change . Conservation tillage has been recommended for enhancing soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks while having a positive impact on food security biodiversity water quality and the environment . Nevertheless positive responses were mainly reported in hot and semiarid climates with rainfed crops and low N fertilization rates .

@highlight Minimum tillage MT increased grain yield 7 in an 8 year maize monoculture.
@highlight Maize yield was reduced by no till NT during the initial 5 years while increased afterwards.
@highlight NT and MT increased C sequestration by 1.45 and 1.52 Mg ha

@highlight compared with CT.
@highlight C and N associated to microaggregates within macroaggregates accounted for 4165 of total soil C and N under NT and MT.
