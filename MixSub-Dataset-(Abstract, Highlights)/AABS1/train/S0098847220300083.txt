 Past studies indicate that narrower conduits such as those in diffuse porous species are less vulnerable to freeze thaw induced embolism and also facilitate the refilling of embolized xylem conduits early in the spring resulting in an earlier bud break . In this study we investigated if a novel environmental condition associated with climate change induced northward migration will affect the vulnerability to FT induced embolism and spring phenology in white birch . Seedlings were grown under ambient 400 mol mol

@highlight Freeze thaw events reduce stem hydraulic conductivity and delay spring phenology in white birch.
@highlight Longer photoperiods increase hydraulic conductivity.
@highlight Longer photoperiods advance spring phenology under elevated CO
@highlight but delay it under ambient CO
