 The interactions between temperature relative humidity radiation wind speed and their effect on plant transpiration in the context of water consumption for irrigation purposes have been studied for over a century . Leaf area has also been established as an important factor affecting water consumption . We analyzed a multivariable time series composed of both meteorological and vegetative variables with a daily temporal resolution for the growing seasons of 20132016 for

@highlight Grapevine water consumption ET

@highlight Evapotranspiration was measured by lysimeters for five consecutive growing seasons.
@highlight Relative influence of metrological and vegetative factors on ET
@highlight was quantified.
@highlight Time series analysis uncovered interrelations and enabled accurate forecasting.
