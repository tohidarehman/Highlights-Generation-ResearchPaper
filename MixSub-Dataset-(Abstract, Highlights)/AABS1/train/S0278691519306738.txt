 Ochratoxin A is a mycotoxin detected worldwide . Urine biomonitoring is a more realistic and non invasive way to assess exposure when compared to traditional methods based on food occurrence and consumption data . Few studies have investigated children s exposure to OTA although it is a more susceptible population . Our main goal was the OTA biomonitoring in urine of Portuguese children to better characterize the health risk of this population .

@highlight First OTA urine biomonitoring by IAC LC FD of 85 Portuguese children.
@highlight 92.94 of the samples were positive with a mean OTA level of 0.020ng mL.
@highlight No statistical differences between the OTA contamination and anthropometric data.
@highlight Regarding risk assessment the PDI exceeded the TWI.
@highlight Depending on the OTA excretion rate the risk assessed varied from 10 to 194 .
