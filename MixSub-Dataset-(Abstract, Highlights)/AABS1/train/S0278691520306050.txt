 mycotoxins are fungal contaminants found in different crops intended for human and animal consumption . Due to the co occurrence of several of mycotoxins the present study aimed at examining the transfer of these toxins into tissues of broiler chickens and eggs of laying hens fed contaminated diets . After an adaptation period the chickens were fed contaminated diets containing mg kg levels of deoxynivalenol enniatins ENN A A

@highlight Transfer of
@highlight mycotoxins into tissues of broiler chickens and eggs of laying hens fed contaminated diets occurred.
@highlight Deoxynivalenol Zearalenone HT 2 toxin and T2 toxin were not carried out into the tissues of broiler chickens.
@highlight Carry over rates into liver and skin were higher for Beauvericin than for Enniatins.
@highlight Cessation of contaminated feeding helped to eliminate these toxins from the contaminated tissues and eggs.
