 Automated irrigation scheduling of grain crops using a combination of plant and soil water sensing feedback has not been widely investigated . A three year study was conducted at Bushland Texas to investigate irrigation management of grain sorghum

@highlight Thermal stress thresholds automate variable rate irrigation management.
@highlight Irrigation scheduling with soil water and canopy temperature sensors optimize grain yield.
@highlight Time domain reflectometer sensors prevent over and under irrigation of sorghum.
