 The present study evaluated the exposure of children aged from one to 36 months to seven groups of mycotoxins in the context of the infant French Total Diet Study . Exposure was then compared to the health based guidance values for each mycotoxin . The value of the 90th percentile of exposure to nivalenol patulin fumonisins and zearalenone was less than 40 of the HBGV considered relevant for children . On the other hand a risk could not be excluded for ochratoxin A and aflatoxins as exposure was close to the HBGV for ochratoxin A and the margin of exposure was much lower than the critical margin of 10 000 for aflatoxins . The HBGVs for toxins T2 and HT2 and for deoxynivalenol and its acetylated compounds were exceeded . Five percent to 10 of the children aged 512 months exceeded the HBGV considering the lower bound hypothesis for toxins T2 and HT2 and 7.5 27 of the children aged 5 months and above exceeded the HBGV for DON . Consequently the exposure of young children raises safety concerns for T2 HT2 and DON . Efforts should therefore be pursued to decrease their exposure to these molecules .

@highlight French children s exposure to ochratoxin A was close to the health based guidance value.
@highlight The margin of exposure was much lower than the critical margin of 10 000 for aflatoxins.
@highlight The HBGV was exceeded for toxins T2 HT2 deoxynivalenol its acetylated compounds.
@highlight Exposure levels for nivalenol patulin fumonisins zearalenone were safe.
