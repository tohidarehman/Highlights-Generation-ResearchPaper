 Maintaining soil water content within the readily available range is optimum concerning crop production and water use . In this regard the continuous monitoring of soil water content is a crucial element for identifying the key parameters for sustainable agricultural water management .

@highlight Soil water content SWC of Andosol was monitored using capacitance sensor.
@highlight Monitoring results were evaluated regarding critical SWC thresholds for decision supporting in agricultural water management.
@highlight Monitoring results revealed substantial temporal dynamics in SWC.
@highlight The SWC values fell below depletion level for 27 of the monitoring period for the surface soil layer.
@highlight The below depletion level results imply the need to conduct continuous SWC monitoring.
