 Colorectal cancer is among the leading causes of cancer related mortality worldwide . Hexavalent chromium is often present in groundwater . Chronic Cr exposure is suggested to be one of the main factors inducing cancer . However the correlation between Cr and CRC remains unclear . In this study we investigated the role of Cr in CRC by establishing a mouse CRC model induced by 1 2 dimethylhydrazine . The results showed that Cr increased weight loss in DMH induced mice and promoted the formation of tumors . Cr also increased DMH induced proliferating cell nuclear antigen levels . Investigation of the underlying mechanisms found that Cr significantly decreased DMH induced SOD GSH and CAT levels while the MDA level increased . Metagenomic analyses found that the abundance of
