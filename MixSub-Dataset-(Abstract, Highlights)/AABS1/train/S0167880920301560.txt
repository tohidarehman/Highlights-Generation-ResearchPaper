 The integration of trees into agricultural landscapes has a strong influence on plant soil interactions with major impacts on rates of nutrient cycling across multiple spatial scales . Shifts in abiotic conditions owing to agroforestry practices such as changes in soil nutrient and microclimatic conditions are commonly identified as primary mechanisms for these changes . Yet agroforestry systems are also likely to influence litter decomposition rates through their influence on morphological and chemical traits of crop leaves and residues . However explicit evaluations of how agroforestry management results in intraspecific leaf trait plasticity and how this variation then links with litter decomposition remain sparse . Using a 30 year old agroforestry system intercropped with short rotation willow

@highlight Willows express high intraspecific variation in leaf functional traits.
@highlight Canopy position drives significant willow leaf trait variation.
@highlight Resource availability under agroforestry also strongly influences trait variation.
@highlight Changes in morphological and chemical leaf traits do not influence rates of decomposition.
@highlight Functional traits of this woody biomass crop predictably vary in agroforests.
