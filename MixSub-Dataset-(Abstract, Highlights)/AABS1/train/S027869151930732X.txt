 An imbalance in mitochondrial dynamics is strongly associated with Parkinson s disease . The fusion protein optic atrophy 1 is up regulated through the activation of parkin mediated IB kinase p65 signaling . This study investigated whether the neuroprotection of carnosic acid from rosemary is involved in mitochondrial dynamics and OPA1 protein induction by parkin IKK p65 signaling . The neurotoxin 6 hydroxydopamine treated with SH SY5Y cells decreased OPA1 and mitofusin 2 fusion proteins but increased fission 1 and dynamin related protein 1 fission proteins . By immunofluorescence 6 OHDA induced the fluorescence of green spots outside the mitochondria indicating that cytochrome

@highlight Pretreatment of CA attenuated the change of mitochondrial fission and fusion by 6 OHDA.
@highlight The up regulation of OPA1 induced by CA is associated with the activation of the parkin IKK p65 pathway.
@highlight Silencing of OPA1 inhibited the ability of CA to reverse the toxicity of 6 OHDA.
