 Annual Finnish breeding duck surveys over the last 30 years show declining abundance among several species and greater declines on eutrophic waters than oligotrophic lakes . It has been suggested that habitat related differences in the rate of increase in predation pressure is a potential explanation for contrasting duck population trajectories between habitats . We assessed potential duck nest predation risk and predator presence in various duck breeding habitats in Finland and Denmark by monitoring 333 artificial duck nests with wildlife cameras during 20172019 . Predation rates differed between landscapes and habitats nest predation rate and predator diversity were lowest in forested and highest in agricultural landscapes . Forest nests further from water bodies survived better than nests around shorelines of permanent lakes . Of the 16 different predator species detected the most common were Eurasian magpie

@highlight Predation of artificial duck nests was high in agricultural landscapes.
@highlight Shoreline nests had lower survival than nest further away from waterbodies.
@highlight Predation by native predators was typically associated with particular landscapes.
@highlight Alien raccoon dog was a common predator across all habitats and landscapes.
