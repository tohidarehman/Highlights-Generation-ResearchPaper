 Autophagy has been widely reported to play critical roles in plant adaption to various abiotic and biotic stressors . Although many studies have shown that autophagy deficient mutants exhibit sensitivity to salt stress our understanding of the detailed function of autophagy in response to salt stress remains limited . In this study we found that the expression of

@highlight  overexpressing OE apple plants exhibited higher autophagic activity and enhanced tolerance under salt stress.
@highlight  OE apple plants showed reduced shrinkage of stoma and less damaged photosynthetic ability under salt stress.
@highlight  OE apple plants exhibited an increased accumulation of proline arginine and polyamines under salt stress.
