 Carbohydrate metabolism in trees has received considerable attention due to its role in global forest decline . However mobilization storage and allocation of carbohydrates show large variation along tree stems due to various source sink relationships . Currently we have a limited understanding of the causes or consequences of carbohydrate variation on plant chemical defenses . We measured non structural carbohydrates monoterpenes and diterpene resin acids along jack pine

@highlight Soil water availability affects stem vulnerability in jack pine by influencing carbonmobilization and allocation.
@highlight Jack pine uses local carbohydrate reserves to produce defense compounds.
@highlight Jack pine lacks the ability to distinguish between low and high fungal attack densities.
