 Developing climate smart agricultural systems is essential for climate change adaptation and mitigation . In the past decades the typical winter wheat summer maize rotation system in the North China Plain has produced high yield but the overuse of nitrogen fertilizer and over pumping of groundwater for irrigation have caused severe environmental problems . It is necessary to develop climate smart agricultural systems through a comprehensive multiple objective assessment and optimization of alternative cropping systems and agronomic managements . Here with the agricultural system model of APSIM eight alternative cropping systems at four typical sites across the NCP under two climate change scenarios and two tillage managements were comprehensively evaluated in terms of crop yield water use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency evapotranspiration groundwater recharge N

@highlight A multi objective assessment was conducted for alternative cropping systems in the NCP.
@highlight The dominant winter wheat maize system had the largest ET N leaching and N
@highlight O emission.
@highlight Optimized winter wheat maize system could perform best among the eight systems.
@highlight Conservation tillage could mitigate negative impacts of climate change and SOC decrease.
@highlight The study demonstrates a useful framework to develop climate smart agriculture systems.
