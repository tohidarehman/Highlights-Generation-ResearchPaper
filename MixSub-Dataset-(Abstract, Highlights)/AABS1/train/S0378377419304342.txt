 Vietnam is one of several countries that suffer from climate change and is encountering increased frequency and severity of droughts . Its climate risks have led to concerns about water security prompting policymakers to assess the value add of water in irrigation . Here we measure the value add of irrigation water for non compulsory food crops in Vietnam by formalising a crop choice model and fit it to data from a national household survey . Our results indicate that irrigator profits would fall on average by 0.56 US if water diverted for irrigation were reduced by one cubic meter per irrigator . We also find that some 16 of surveyed irrigators could reduce the water they divert for irrigation without reducing their profits . As a response to water scarcity effective water pricing could reduce irrigation water extractions by around 84 while the average profit per farmer would be reduced by some 17 . Our findings highlight the importance of water pricing as a possible policy option and show that setting an appropriate volumetric price for irrigation water extractions offers the possibility of welfare improving water reallocations .

@highlight The value add of irrigation water in Vietnam is estimated with a crop choice model.
@highlight We find a significant value on average but varying across households.
@highlight 16 of surveyed households could reduce water use without reducing their profits.
@highlight Water pricing can promote water conservation with minimal financial impacts.
