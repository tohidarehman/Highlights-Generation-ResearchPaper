 Fertilizer along with water drip irrigation is the process of Fertilizer entering to the field with water a new technology of combination with irrigation and Fertilizer product of the combination with a precise and accurate irrigation and fertilizer.The filed experiments were conducted at two sites in Hei Longjiang province respectively in 2015 and 2016 to compare the effect of precision fertilization management and traditional management on maize plant height aboveground biomass leaf area index and yields . For two years the precision fertilization management reduce the nutrient supply and did not affect maize growth and reduce grain yield . In 2015 the precision fertilization management reduce the nitrogen and phosphorus supply by 8 and 10 but increase potassium supply by 15 . In 2016 the precision fertilization management reduce the nitrogen phosphorus and potassium supply by 9 25 and 17 . The maize plant height leaf area index aboveground biomass and yield did not significantly decrease due to the decrease in fertilizer application . As a result precision fertilization management increased the nutrients and rainfall use efficiency and net profit.Thus proving fertigation help to increase maize production which is of great significance for increasing food production .

@highlight Water drip irrigation fertilization is a precise fertilization method it can save more than 3050 of fertilizer consumption.
@highlight Due to the coordinated effect of water and fertilizer with the water saving effect of facility irrigation itself the water saving is more than 50 .
@highlight Helps prevent fertilizer from leaching into the groundwater and polluting water bodies.
@highlight Precise fertilization management improves the nutrient and precipitation efficiency and net profit.
