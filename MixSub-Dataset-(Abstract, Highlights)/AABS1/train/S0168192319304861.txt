 Understanding how climate and soil hydrology control tree growth is critical to predict the response of Siberian ecosystems to climate change . The general aim of this study was to characterize the soil water budget and identify the factors controlling aspen

@highlight Winter precipitation is crucial for the whole year soil water budget in SW Siberia.
@highlight Aspen growth is limited by temperature in the north and by moisture in the south.
@highlight Under warmer and drier climate moisture limitation will become predominant.
@highlight Increasing winter precipitation could constrain water deficit in the south.
