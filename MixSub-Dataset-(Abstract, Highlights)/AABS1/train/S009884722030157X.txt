 Water stress commonly affects crops grown in arid and semi arid regions . Apart from the direct impact of this abiotic stress on yield a diverse community of herbivores can outbreak under these conditions and plant responses to abiotic stress may alter plant defense responses that deter herbivores . Outbreaks of both generalist and specialist spider mites are strongly associated with hot and dry conditions in the field settings . To understand how water stress impacts maize responses to spider mites we conducted parallel greenhouse and field experiments with maize plants subjected to optimal irrigation and water stress conditions and 25 32 and 10 15 VWC in the greenhouse and field respectively . In addition to recording B73 responses to water stress alone we measured the population growth of the generalist twospotted spider mite

@highlight Population growth of spider mites increased on water stressed plants.
@highlight Water stress altered plant physiological measurements in B73 maize.
@highlight Combined water stress and generalist herbivory increased plant defenses.
@highlight Species specific interactions with abiotic stress may affect plant responses.
