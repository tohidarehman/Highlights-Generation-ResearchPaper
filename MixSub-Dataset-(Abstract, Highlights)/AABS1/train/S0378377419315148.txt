 Grapes are the most important cash crop in Xinjiang . However the effective utilization of agricultural water and fertilizer in this area is relatively low which is very unfavourable for the development of Xinjiang grape industry . At present there is a lack of research based on multi objective water and fertilizer optimization to guide grape production . Field experiments were thus conducted over three consecutive years to study the effects of water and fertilizer coupling on the yield fruit quality water use efficiency fertilizer partial productivity and net profits of

@highlight Three years field experiments of grapes under drip fertigation were studied in the northwest of China.
@highlight Multiple regression and the extremum solution was used to determine the multiobjective optimization.
@highlight Low irrigation level is not conducive to improving fertilizer partial productivity.
@highlight Medium and low irrigation levels are conducive to improving water use efficiency.
@highlight Reasonable water and fertilizer ranges make yield fruit quality WUE reach 90 maximum value simultaneously.
