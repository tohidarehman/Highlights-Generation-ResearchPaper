 Photoperiod and temperature are important environmental factors that regulate many developmental processes in plants . However the roles of different durations of photoperiod and temperature in garlic bulbing and selected endogenous chemical factors are still unknown . This study is focused on morphological and selected endogenous chemical factors associated with garlic bulb formation in response to photoperiod and temperature . Endogenous phytohormones phenolic acids and allicin level were analyzed in garlic when plants were subjected to different combinations of photoperiod and temperature treatments at 10 20 and 30 days after treatment . Garlic plant and bulb morphology was observed maximum under 14 h photoperiod and 30 C at 30 DAT . 14 h photoperiod and 25 C resulted in maximum ABA ZT and ZR at 20 30 and 10 DAT respectively . Maximum GA and JA were observed under14 h photoperiod and 30 C at 20 and 10 DAT respectively . Whereas maximum IAA was detected under 12 h photoperiod and 30 C at 30 DAT . Maximum ferulic and vanillic acids were detected under 14 h photoperiod and 25 C at 20 and 30 DAT respectively . Maximum caffeic

@highlight Garlic responses to combinations of photoperiod light dark 10 14 h 12 12 h 14 10 h and temperature light dark 25 18 C 30 20 C at different durations 10 20 and 30 days after treatment were studied for the first time.
@highlight Longer photoperiods and higher temperatures significantly enhanced garlic pseudostems phytohormones phenolic acids and allicin contents.
@highlight Our study provided new insights into improved bulb performance hormonal balance and contents of phenolics and the organosulfur compound allicin using light and temperature.
