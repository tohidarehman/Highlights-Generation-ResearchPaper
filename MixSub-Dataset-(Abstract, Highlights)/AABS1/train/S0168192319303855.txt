 Dry regions are typically characterized by heterogeneous ecosystems where trees are competing with the surrounding grasses for limited amount of water . In these regions evapotranspiration

@highlight Strong seasonality of eddy covariance evapotranspiration in a tree grass ecosystem.
@highlight Southern edge of tree clumps transpires more than clump centers and northern edges.
@highlight Transpiration of the wild olive tree clumps is nearly constant regardless of season.
@highlight Evapotranspiration of the surrounding grass varies seasonally with soil moisture.
