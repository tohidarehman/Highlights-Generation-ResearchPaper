 Nrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates cytoprotective cellular responses to oxidative and electrophilic stress . Nrf2 is potently activated by the synthetic food additive tert butylhydroquinone which is widely used as a preservative in oils and processed foods . Previously published studies have established that tBHQ has numerous effects on T cell function . The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of tBHQ on B cell function and the role of Nrf2 in these effects . Specifically we investigated T cell independent B cell activation differentiation and IgM antibody production . Murine wild type and Nrf2 null splenocytes were isolated treated with tBHQ and activated by lipopolysaccharide a T cell independent B cell activator . Our findings indicate that tBHQ significantly enhanced IgM production in activated wild type but not Nrf2 null B cells suggesting this effect is Nrf2 dependent . In contrast tBHQ significantly decreased the induction of CD69 CD25 CD22 and CD138 in both wild type and Nrf2 null splenocytes . These findings indicate that the tBHQ mediated increase in IgM is Nrf2 dependent whereas the inhibition of CD69 CD25 CD22 and CD138 is Nrf2 independent . Overall this study demonstrates that in addition to its effects on T cells tBHQ also has potent effects on T cell independent B cell function .

@highlight The food additive tBHQ inhibits induction of CD25 CD69 and CD22 in LPS stimulated B cells.
@highlight tBHQ inhibits plasma cell differentiation as evidenced by decreased expression of CD138.
@highlight tBHQ induces a Nrf2 dependent increase in IgM secretion in LPS stimulated B cells.
