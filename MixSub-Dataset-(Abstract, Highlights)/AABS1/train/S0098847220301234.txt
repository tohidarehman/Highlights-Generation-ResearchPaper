 In seasonal climates with cold winters leaves of deciduous trees and herbs senesce in the fall remobilizing nutrients in a tightly regulated process with hormonal signaling . In contrast to leaves not much data exist about root senescence . There is some indication that also in roots similar processes exist but the available data is scarce and contradictory . Here we investigate senescence in the different plant organs by comparing temporal patterns of phytohormone levels during autumn senescence in two herbaceous perennial species both with senescing leaves but with roots differing in their overwintering strategy . Roots of

@highlight Very little information is available about senescence processes in roots.
@highlight The results indicate senescence signaling in roots similar to leaves.
@highlight ABA levels matched the contrasting senescence processes both in leaves and roots.
@highlight Roots had very little lipid peroxidation and low levels of antioxidants.
@highlight CKs and GAs peaked in overwintering young leaves when other leaves had senesced.
