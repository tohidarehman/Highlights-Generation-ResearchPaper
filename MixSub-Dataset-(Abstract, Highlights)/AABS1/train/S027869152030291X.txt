 The prevalence of metabolic syndrome elevating cardiovascular risks is increasing worldwide with no available global therapeutic options . The intake of plain mineral or biocompatible modified waters was shown to prevent some MetS features . This study was designed to analyze in mice fed a high fat and sucrose diet the effects on MetS features of the daily intake of a reverse osmosed weakly remineralized water and of an OW dynamized by a physical processing compared to tap water . The HFSD was effective at inducing major features of MetS such as obesity hepatic steatosis and inflammation blood dyslipidemia systemic glucose intolerance and muscle insulin resistance . Compared to TW OW intake decreased hepatic fibrosis and inflammation and mitigated hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia . ODW intake further improved skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and systemic glucose tolerance . This study highlights the deleterious metabolic impacts of the daily intake of TW in combination with a high energy diet and its possible involvement in MetS prevalence increase . In addition it demonstrates that biocompatible modified water may be promising non pharmaceutical cost effective tools for nutritional approaches in the treatment of MetS .
