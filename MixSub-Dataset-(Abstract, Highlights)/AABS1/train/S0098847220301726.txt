 Quinoa is a nutritious seed crop with a great potential to grow in saline soils . Here we studied ion concentrations in quinoa tissues throughout the life cycle of the plant and linked ion dynamics to responses in growth parameters seed yield and efficiency of photosynthesis under salinity . Ion dynamics changed from high ion exclusion before flowering to a build up of ions during seed filling . This indicates a change in strategy in maintaining the necessary gradient of water potential from the root medium to the leaves . K

@highlight European sweet quinoa cultivars are extremely tolerant to salinity.
@highlight Quinoa varieties have a high capacity for ion exclusion under salinity.
@highlight Quinoa can adapt to increasing salinity stress by changing salinity response mechanisms.
@highlight Genotypic variation was found for salinity tolerance traits.
@highlight Epidermal bladder cells did not contribute substantially to ion exclusion.
