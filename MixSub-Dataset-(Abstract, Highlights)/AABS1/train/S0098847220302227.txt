 Biological invasion is a global environmental problem that has profound effects on the natural ecosystem . To gain in depth understandings on how biological invasion affects the natural recovery potential of native vegetation this study focused on the soil seed banks of reed

@highlight invasion had remarkable impacts on the soil seed banks of wetland reed communities during less than three years.
@highlight invasion reduced the seedling density of the light requiring species and the terrestrial species.
@highlight Shading and flooding inhibited the seed germination from soil seed bank of weed community.
@highlight These findings showed new lights on the invasion plant management and the native vegetation restoration.
