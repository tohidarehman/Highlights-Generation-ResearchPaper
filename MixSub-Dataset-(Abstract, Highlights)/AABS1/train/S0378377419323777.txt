 The response of both surface runoff and subsurface drainage as affected by water table management practices in tile drained fields is poorly documented . Widely used to simulate management effects on crop production and water quality the Root Zone Water Quality Model has recently been equipped with a subirrigation component . Coupled with Simultaneous Heat and Water model to improve its hydrological responses to cold climates the hybrid RZ SHAW has never been tested for simulating surface runoff and subsurface drainage under controlled drainage with subirrigation system . The objective of this study was to evaluate the model performance in predicting surface runoff subsurface tile drainage and crop yield under regular drainage and controlled drainage with subirrigation for the first time . The RZ SHAW model was calibrated and validated against tile drainage surface runoff and crop yield data collected in a tile drained field in Harrow Ontario from June 2008 to December 2011 under DR and CDS treatments . Despite occasional underestimation in winter and overestimation in summer the model was performing generally satisfactorily in simulating the accumulated subsurface drainage and runoff under both DR and CDS treatments with percent bias within 15 Nash Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient 0.5 and the index of agreement

@highlight The runoff under controlled drainage with subirrigation was firstly tested by RZWQM.
@highlight The RZ SHAW adequately predicted the accumulated and peaks of drainage and runoff.
@highlight The hybrid RZ SHAW was better than RZWQM in simulating water flows in frozen soil.
