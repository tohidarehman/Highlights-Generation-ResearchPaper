 Controlling nitrogen and phosphorus loss from hill slope cropland is crucial to mitigate agricultural non point source pollution in the upper Yangtze River basin . However pathways and loadings of soil N and P loss and their responses to agricultural management practices are not well documented . We conducted a three year field experiment using the free drain lysimeters to evaluate the long term effects of organic amendments on N and P loss from sloping cropland . The field experiment included five experimental treatments mineral fertilizers as a control fresh pig slurry as organic manure only crop residues only organic manure combined with NPK and crop residues combined with NPK . The results show that organic amendment applications decrease discharges of overland flow and interflow compared with NPK treatment . On average annual total N loss loadings ranges from 8.3 to 27.6kg N ha

@highlight Particulate N P and nitrate N dominated total N P loss loadings.
@highlight Interflow acted as the main pathway for N loss loadings.
@highlight Overland flow acted as the major pathway for P loss loadings.
@highlight Manure and crop residue combined with mineral fertilization acts as optimal practices for AGNPS pollution control.
