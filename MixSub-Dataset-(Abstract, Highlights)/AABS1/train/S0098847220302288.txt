 The experiment was designed to characterize fructan and hormone metabolism in a slow growing commercial cultivar Silver Dollar and a fast growing wild accession PI317452 of perennial ryegrass

@highlight The fast growing accession PI32 had higher reductions of leaf dry weight and fructan content than the slow growing SD during submergence stress.
@highlight Submergence did not alter leaf IAA content in SD but increased IAA in PI32.
@highlight Submergence did not affect GA3 content in in PI32 but decreased GA3 in SD.
@highlight Both accessions showed reductions in abscisic acid content under stress especially for PI32.
@highlight Expressions of genes for fructan and hormone metabolism generally increased or remained unchanged during submergence stress.
