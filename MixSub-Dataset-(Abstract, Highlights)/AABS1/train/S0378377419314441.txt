 The effects of climate change have forced to search quickly new strategies to achieve sustainable agriculture in the context of a growing demand for food . Rootstocks have shown to have a key role in the resistance and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses in horticultural and fruit trees species being a way to incorporate these strengths to the cultivated varieties . Here we report the assessment of physiological parameters and growth responses of two commercial interspecific hybrid

@highlight Water deficit and recovery performances were strongly determined by the rootstock.
@highlight Reduction of transpiration was determined by the rootstock regardless the scion.
@highlight R40 rootstock induced a higher WUEwp under water deficit in almond and plum.
@highlight R20 rootstock induced a higher WUE
@highlight in long term recovery in almond and plum.
