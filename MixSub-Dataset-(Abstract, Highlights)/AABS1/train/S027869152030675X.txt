 The drug transporter P glycoprotein is often investigated in drug interaction studies because the activity is modulated by a wide variety of xenobiotics including drugs herbal products and food components . In this study we tested six common arylsulfonate food dyesallura red carmoisine ponceau 4R quinolone yellow sunset yellow and tartrazineas activators and inhibitors of P gp activity

@highlight Consumption of food dyes may modulate clinically relevant xenobiotic transporters.
@highlight Food drug interactions with P glycoprotein are important clinical considerations.
@highlight Six arylsulfonate food dyes do not activate or inhibit P glycoprotein
