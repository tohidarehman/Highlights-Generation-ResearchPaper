 Apple cuticular waxes have important functions in responses to mechanical injury pathogen invasion low temperatures drought salinity and other stresses . In recent years AP2 EREBP type transcription factors have been shown to play an important role in cuticular wax biosynthesis . However it remains unclear whether the apple AP2 EREBP type transcription factor WRI4 has a similar function and the molecular mechanisms of its regulation have not been characterized . In this study we identified an AP2 EREBP type transcription factor MdWRI4 from apple and demonstrated that it was localized in the nucleus . The

@highlight We identified an AP2 EREBP type transcription factor MdWRI4 from apple and demonstrated that it was localized in the nucleus.
@highlight The
@highlight gene was highly expressed in the pericarp and
@highlight transgenic Arabidopsis exhibited an increased cuticular wax load.
@highlight transgenic Arabidopsis had lower epidermal permeability and improved drought and salt resistance.
