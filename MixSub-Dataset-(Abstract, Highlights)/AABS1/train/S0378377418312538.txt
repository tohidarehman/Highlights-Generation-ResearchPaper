 Water is a limiting natural resource for agricultural production . While it is well accepted that crop types differ in their water use efficiency there is no consensus on the main factors affecting WUE of main field crops which was the motivation of the current study . The effects of rainfall pattern soil type and climatic regime on crop WUE were evaluated using data from 514 experiments around the world published in ISI journal papers . The results confirmed that crop type had a significant effect on WUE with cereals producing on average 2.37kg of dry grain per cubic meter m

@highlight 546 trials from different experiments based on crop WUE were considered.
@highlight Summer crops showed higher WUE than winter crops.
@highlight Maize was the most water use efficient crop under optimal growing condition.
@highlight Sorghum was the most efficient under semi arid and arid conditions.
@highlight Crops were the most significant water use efficient crop on clayey soils.
