 Approximately 2 million endoprostheses are implanted annually and metal ions as well as particles are released into the body from the materials which are used . This review describes the results of studies concerning genotoxic damage caused by artificial joints . DNA damage leads to various adverse long term health effects in humans including cancer . Experiments with mammalian cells showed that metal ions and particles from orthopedic materials cause DNA damage . Induction of chromosomal aberrations was found in several in vitro experiments and in studies with rodents with metals from orthopedic materials . Human studies focused mainly on induction of CA . Only few investigations concerned sister chromatid exchanges oxidative DNA damage and micronucleus formation . CA are a reliable biomarker for increased cancer risks in humans and were increased in all studies in patients with artificial joints . No firm conclusion can be drawn at present if the effects in humans are due to oxidative stress and if dissolved metal ions or release particles play a role . Our findings indicate that patients with artificial joints may have increased cancer risks due to damage of the genetic material . Future studies should be performed to identify safe materials and to study the molecular mechanisms in detail .
