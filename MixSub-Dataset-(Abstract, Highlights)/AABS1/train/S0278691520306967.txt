 Chloramphenicol is a veterinary antibiotic that has been banned due to its severe side effects but it is still illegally used in animal husbandry . In this work the fabrication of simple fast response and highly selective ratiometric probe for sensitive visual detection of CLP antibiotic at trace levels in both indoor and outdoor is reported . For the construction of the ratiometric fluorescence probe

@highlight Green source carbon dots with different emission colors were synthesized.
@highlight A novel molecular imprinting ratiometric fluorescence sensor was developed.
@highlight The detection limit of the probe can achieve 0.035 gL
@highlight with high selectively.
@highlight Ratiometric fluorescence technique was adopted to achieve visual signal output.
