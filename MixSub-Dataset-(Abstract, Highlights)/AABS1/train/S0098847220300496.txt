 High salinity is harmful for crop physiology and yield . Accumulating evidences indicate that plant growth promoting rhizobacteria can enhance crop growth and reduce the negative impacts of salt stress through regulation of some molecular biochemical and physiological features . In the present study a novel halo tolerant strain Y1 was isolated from maize rhizosphere soil . Sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene confirmed its identity as

@highlight A novel halo tolerant strain RH1 was isolated from maize rhizosphere.
@highlight 16S rRNA sequencing gene confirmed its identity as
@highlight sp.
@highlight sp. RH1 showed activities of phosphate solubilization and IAA production.
@highlight Inoculation with RH1 strain could protect maize from salt stress.
