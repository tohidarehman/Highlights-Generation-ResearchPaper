 Food additive E551 consists of synthetic amorphous silica comprising agglomerates and aggregates of primary particles in the nanorange which potential nanospecific risks for humans associated to dietary exposure are not yet completely assessed . In NANoREG project aim of the study was to identify potential hazards of pyrogenic SAS nanomaterial NM 203 by a 90 day oral toxicity study . Adult Sprague Dawley rats of both sexes were orally treated with 0 2 5 10 20 and 50mg SAS kg bw per day dose levels were selected to be as close as possible to E551 dietary exposure . Several endpoints were investigated the whole integrative study is presented here along with the results of dispersion characterization tissue distribution general toxicity blood serum biomarkers histopathological and immunotoxicity endpoints . No mortality general toxicity and limited deposition in target tissues were observed . NM 203 affected liver and spleen in both sexes . Proposed NOAEL 5mg kg bw per day in male rats for enlarged sinusoids in liver . In female rats TSH and creatinine levels were affected proposed LOAEL 2mg kg bw per day . Overall these data provide new insight for a comprehensive risk assessment of SAS exposure by the oral route .
