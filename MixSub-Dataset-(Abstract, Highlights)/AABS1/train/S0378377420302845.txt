 Plastic mulching increases crop yield and water use efficiency . However its sustainability in regard to crop productivity and inter annual soil water balance is widely doubted . This study comprises a long term field experiment with spring maize and wheat treated as materials and two treatments of whole field plastic mulching and without mulching . The results showed that the soil water storage in the sowing stage decreased significantly in the 100300cm profile after 10 years of maize planting in both PM and CK but there was no significant difference between PM and CK . For wheat PM on average increased soil water storage by 30.1 mm in the 0300cm profile but CK decreased it by 28.7 mm in the sowing stage in 2019 . These results indicated that soil water depletion was caused by maize water uptake not PM . The PM significantly increased grain yield of maize and wheat by averages of 276.7 and 82.1 compared with CK respectively . Especially in drought years the grain yield of maize increased by 400.0 and 622.2 and of wheat by 405.1 and 231.5 . The relative variation coefficient of yield and WUE of PM decreased by 101.9 and 207.9 in maize respectively and correspondingly by 48.3 and 47.2 in wheat compared with CK . Our findings were that soil water depletion depended on crop water uptake characteristics and the conflict between soil water supply and crop demand was relieved by PM PM stably increased crop productivity and maintained the inter annual water balance and PM should be explored widely in semiarid areas and the plastic waste problem addressed to ensure future food security .

@highlight PM relieved conflict between soil water supply and crop demand.
@highlight PM stably increased crop yield and maintained soil water balance.
@highlight PM should be widely used for improving agricultural productivity.
