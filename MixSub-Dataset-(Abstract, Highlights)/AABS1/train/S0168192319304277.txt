 Kernel number is one of the critical components of maize yield and is sensitive to environment variation around tasseling when the tassel stem and ear grow simultaneously . Similar to other areas in the world the North China Plain faced reduced irradiance during the maize growing season especially the critical window for determinating actual kernel number . Shade stress that occurs between 15 days pre silking and 15 days post silking significantly reduces kernel number and grain yield . In the present experiment detasseling was conducted under 70 and 97 shade treatments to mitigate the environment stress at the 14 leaf and tasseling stages respectively . Shading treatments significantly reduced kernel number per plant especially when shading occurred at VT stage . Tassel removal did not relieve kernel losses under 97 shade but detasseling did dramatically reverse the kernel losses under 70 shade . Removing tassel sink at V14 and VT promoted assimilates being apportioned to ear sink under 70 shade stress thus encouraging more carbohydrates to be made available for ear growth . Consequently detassseling increased soluble sugar concentration in the ear section shortened anthesis tasseling interval accelerated ear growth offering a method to improve kernel number under shade stress .

@highlight Apical dominance of tassel in maize is increased under shade stress.
@highlight Tassel removal increases the partitioning of carbohydrates to the ear.
@highlight Detasseling increases kernel number only under moderate shade condition.
