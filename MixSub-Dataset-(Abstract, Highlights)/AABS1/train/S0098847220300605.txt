 Excess salt in the soil induces oxidative injury in plant cells . Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can impart host plants salt tolerance and mitigate the oxidative injury in the plants exposed to salt stress . In order to clarify the effects of AM symbiosis on antioxidant activities in

@highlight Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis improved biomass production and regulated antioxidant activities in both leaves and roots of
@highlight subjected to salt stress.
@highlight The mitigation of oxidative injury in
@highlight by AM symbiosis was more evident in leaves than in roots.
@highlight Five antioxidant enzymes encoding genes 
@highlight and
@highlight were amplified. Their expression in leaves of
@highlight was upregulated by AM symbiosis.
