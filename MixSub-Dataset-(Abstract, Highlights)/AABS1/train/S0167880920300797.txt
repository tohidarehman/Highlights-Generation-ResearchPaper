 Frequent extreme weather events which jeopardize agriculture by affecting crop health characterize the ongoing climate change . Temporary patches where sown plants are poorly developed are likely to increase with climate change and can be colonized by other plant species . Although perennial non crop habitats can act as refuges for beneficial insects in agricultural landscapes and increase ecosystem services in neighbouring arable fields the relevance of field defects is unknown . Here we quantified two ESs in field defects within oilseed rape crops and related the ES levels with the activity density of ground beetles and temperature . In 10 fields we used artificial caterpillars made of plasticine and seed cards of two weed species

@highlight Pest and weed seed predation were measured in field defects in oilseed rape fields.
@highlight Pest predation did not significantly differ among habitats but increased in summer.
@highlight Weed seed predation increased in summer and varied among habitat types.
@highlight Specific functional groups of ground beetles supported ecosystem service intensity.
@highlight Provisioning of both ecosystem services was affected by ground level temperatures.
