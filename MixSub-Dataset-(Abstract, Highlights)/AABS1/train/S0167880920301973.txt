 Grazing management plays an important role in grassland conservation . Given that grasshoppers are key components in the grassland food web various studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of grazing by large herbivores on grasshoppers at population and community levels . However grazing effects on grasshopper fitness and abundance remain poorly understood . Here using a field experiment in a meadow steppe we examined the effects of sheep grazing with different intensities on grasshopper

@highlight Fitness of female grasshoppers significantly increased with increasing grazing intensities.
@highlight Grazing affected grasshopper fitness through lower plant nitrogen content and better microhabitat condition.
@highlight Higher survival and fecundity of females is responsible for positive effects of grazing by large herbivores on grasshopper abundance.
