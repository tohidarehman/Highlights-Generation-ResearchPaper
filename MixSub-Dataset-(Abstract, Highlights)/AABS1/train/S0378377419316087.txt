 In the southern USA low soil water holding capacity and erratic rainfall patterns create scenarios where plant water stress may occur reducing early peach tree growth . Therefore irrigation management is a key component to ensure adequate water supply during early tree growth stages . The objective of this study was to determine water requirements and crop coefficient K

@highlight Tree water consumption can be estimated by measuring the projected canopy area.
@highlight Tree water demand can be estimated by measuring trunk cross sectional area.
@highlight The highest peach water demand occurs during the shoot development.
