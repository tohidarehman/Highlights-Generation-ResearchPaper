 Atmospheric precipitation removes the majority of biological and chemical pollutants from the lower parts of the troposphere . However some studies infer increasing atmospheric pollen concentrations during precipitation events and or thunderstorms which are known to trigger allergic reactions . The aim of this study was to determine the impacts of precipitation on the diurnal variability of airborne pollen concentrations with particular focus on the timing and intensity of precipitation events . We also considered the impacts of other meteorological elements on atmospheric pollen concentrations . The research was conducted in Rzeszw from 2016 to 2018 . We used two aerobiological and two meteorological stations in this study to determine potential spatial variability in the pollen response to rainfall the diurnal precipitation changes and the precipitation intensity in the city area . We determined the pollen response of four pollen types

@highlight The response of airborne pollen concentrations to rainfall was determined.
@highlight Precipitation intensity was the dominant control on pollen concentrations.
@highlight Concentrations responses to rainfall was independent of taxa.
@highlight The time of day of rainfall events and air humidity also impact concentrations values.
@highlight Rapid increases in pollen concentrations during rainfall occasionally occurred.
