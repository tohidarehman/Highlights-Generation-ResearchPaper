 The vascular endothelium is a continuous monolayer of endothelial cells that are in direct contact with the blood and its dysfunction is the starting process in the development of many pathological inflammatory disorders such as atherosclerosis which can result in death . The expression of adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 is a key stage in modulating vascular inflammation where the adhesion of monocytes and their transmigration into the intima starting a cascade of inflammatory reactions . Looking for natural compounds with inhibitory activity of VCAM1 and ICAM1 we isolated drimenol isodrimeninol and polygodial as the main secondary metabolites from barks of Drimys winteri and evaluated their effects in the adhesion response of monocytes cells to a monolayer of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in coculture assays . The results showed that the molecules and total extract Dw decrease the adhesion of THP1 to HUVECs at 10g mL . The adhesion activity is explained due to the inhibition of VCAM1 and ICAM1 evidenced by qRT PCR and Western blot assays . In conclusion drimane sesquiterpenoids could be used as a molecular scaffold in the development of drugs for inflammatory vascular diseases .

@highlight The sesquiterpenoids Drimenol Polygodial and Isodrimeninol were isolated from barks of the Chilean native tree
@highlight  Drimenol Polygodial and Isodrimeninol reduced the monocyte adhesion to HUVECs at 10g mL.
@highlight  Drimenol Polygodial and Isodrimeninol reduced gene and protein expression of VCAM 1 at 10g mL.
@highlight and Polygodial reduced the protein expression of ICAM 1 at 10g mL.
