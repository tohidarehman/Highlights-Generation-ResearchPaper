 The root system is essential for plant water and nutrient uptake however the functions and roles of different root orders are unclear . We investigated the anatomical and physiological differences among different root orders . Tomato plants were grown in either polyethylene bags or a hydroponic system . Mineral uptake protein profiles respiration rates and anatomical profiles of the different root orders were measured . First order roots absorbed significantly more nutrients than the other root orders . The concentrations of elements surrounding the third order roots remained constant throughout the experiment . Respiration rates were found to be higher in the first and second order roots than in the third order roots . Analysis of anatomical cross sections demonstrated different structures in the different root orders . Protein profile analysis presented differences in different root orders these proteins included element transporters and those related to protein translocation in the cell . Moreover specific proteins related to mineral absorption were found at higher levels in the first and second order roots than in the third order roots . Our results demonstrate that different root orders vary in their nutrient uptake and translocation and that distal root orders play a key role in the uptake and translocation of minerals .

@highlight Tomato root orders are different in their stele structure and size.
@highlight Respiration rate was found to be higher in the first and the second root orders.
@highlight Mineral absorption was higher in the first and the second root orders.
@highlight Proteins profile found to be different between the root orders.
@highlight Mineral transports were found in the first second but not in the third order.
