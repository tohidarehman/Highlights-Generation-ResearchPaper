 Effective irrigation and nitrogen management is crucial for sustainable agricultural development . Controlled release fertilizer has been widely used to improve N use efficiency and save labor in one off application . A specially designed soil column and field trial were conducted to investigate the effect of the interaction of irrigation management and nitrogen on yield N uptake and photosynthetic characteristics of summer maize . In the soil column experiment severe water stress significantly decreased the leaf area index relative chlorophyll content and net photosynthesis and delayed maize growth resulting in significant yield loss . Under mild water stress increased controlled release urea application counteracted the inhibition of maize growth . Under adequate water condition the yield and maize growth exhibited no significant difference between CRN 210 and 315kg N ha

@highlight Controlled release urea with irrigation affects maize biomass and N accumulation.
@highlight Optimum controlled release urea improved photosynthetic capacity for each irrigation level.
@highlight The interaction of irrigation and controlled release urea on maize yield was significant.
