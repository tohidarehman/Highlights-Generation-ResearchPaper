 Climate models predict significant changes in precipitation magnitude and timing in semi arid grasslands where soil carbon release is particularly sensitive to changing precipitation .

@highlight SR was reduced more in DLP than in DEP whereas IEP stimulates SR more than ILP.
@highlight DLP rather than DEP reduced HR whereas increased precipitation had little effect.
@highlight Changes in SR and HR can be attributed to varied plant community cover.
@highlight SR and HR showed nonlinear responses to changed precipitation.
@highlight Soil carbon dynamics are decoupled from soil water availability with increasing precipitation.
