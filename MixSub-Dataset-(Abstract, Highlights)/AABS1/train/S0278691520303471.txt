 The concern for environmental conservation is increasing and a very important factor to consider is the search for alternatives to the use of plastics in the food packaging industry . A good option is the manufacture of containers of biodegradable materials such as the so called biomaterials made of vegetable fibre such as wheat wood bamboo or palm leaf pulp . The migration of compounds from food packaging can cause alterations in food safety and acceptability . Therefore their control through studies of specific migration is definitely important in the food industry . Specific migration has been studied in two types of dishes in contact with three liquid simulants . The analysis of migration extracts have been carried out by solid phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography in the most suitable working conditions . In addition those identified compounds considered of interest according to existing legislation have been quantified in order to assess whether exceed or not the migration limits established for some of them . The results obtained show that the quantified compounds are well below the specific migration limits set by the legislation thereby showing the safety in use of this type of biodegradable dishes .

@highlight Migration tests with simulants 10 EtOH 3 acetic acid and 90 EtOH were carried out.
@highlight SPME GC MS was applied for the analysis.
@highlight Migrant compounds from wheat pulp and wood were identified and quantified.
@highlight The results obtained show that these dishes are safe.
