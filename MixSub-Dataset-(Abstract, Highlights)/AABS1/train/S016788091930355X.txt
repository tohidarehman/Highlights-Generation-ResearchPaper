 Soil properties vary spatially according to land use both because land users have selected specific soil properties for specific land uses and land uses modify the soil properties . However permanent environment factors and land use effects are unlikely to display the exact same spatial patterns . Study of the spatial and historical patterns of distribution of soil properties could help to separate between these two causes . In this aim we studied 22 forest grassland interfaces with controlled historical configurations in northeast France . In each land use three distances to the edge and two land use histories were studied .

@highlight Soil properties vary spatially according to present land use forest or grassland.
@highlight Original choices of land users and land use after effects explain these variations.
@highlight Non random topographic position of forest grassland interfaces is the major effect.
@highlight Beyond this vegetation composition and management practices have a strong impact.
@highlight Traces of land use changes on soil properties are visible after only a few decades.
