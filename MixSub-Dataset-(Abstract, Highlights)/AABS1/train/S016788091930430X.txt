 An eddy covariance system was used over a production scale US mid south cotton field in order to improve understanding of carbon and water flux dynamics in cotton production . Measurement outcomes of NEE and ET from agricultural cropping systems in the humid US mid south may differ from measurements made in arid production regions due to variation in precipitation relative humidity and cloud cover . Local measurements are needed for timely irrigation water management decisions and to assess their impact on the carbon cycle . Measurements were made in a 63 ha field in Northeast Arkansas in the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons . Average daily NEE during the growing season was driven largely by gross primary production measured at 1.80 0.26 g C m

@highlight GPP and ET was highest from the first week of flowering to after cutout.
@highlight Average crop ET was 3.5 mm d
@highlight and peak water use was 7.6 mm d
@highlight WUE at 0.3 kg lint cotton m
@highlight water was 1.52 times that of more arid regions.
