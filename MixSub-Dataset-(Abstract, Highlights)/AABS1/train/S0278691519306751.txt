 This study shows that dietary habits have an impact on contaminant exposures . A tool was developed to calculate chemical exposures for different Danish population groups . First the tool divided the individuals into quartiles using a previously developed scoring system for how well their diet complies with the Danish dietary guidelines . Then the exposure was calculated for several contaminants for both children and adults within the quartiles . Comparisons were then performed between the exposures for the lowest and highest quartiles . The individuals having a diet more in compliance with the dietary guidelines have a higher exposure to contaminants than individuals having a diet less in compliance with the dietary guidelines . Standard deviations for the mean exposure were in general large indicating that the consumption patterns can be very different within each population group . A risk characterisation for each contaminant and population group was performed by calculation of Hazard Quotients . For dioxins and dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls inorganic arsenic and lead all HQs were above 1 indicating a potential risk for all groups . For hexabromocyclododecane and nickel a potential risk was identified for at least one group . For all other contaminants the HQs were well below 1 for all groups .

@highlight Dietary habits have an impact on contaminant exposures.
@highlight A diet more in compliance with the Danish dietary guidelines results in higher contaminant exposures.
@highlight A potential risk of adverse health effects was identified for dioxins inorganic arsenic and lead for all population groups.
@highlight For a few population groups a potential risk was identified for HBCDD and nickel.
@highlight No appreciable risk was identified for the remaining contaminants included in this study.
