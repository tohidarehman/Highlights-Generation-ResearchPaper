 Exposure to complex chemical mixtures requires a tiered strategy for efficient mixture risk assessment . As a part of the EuroMix project we developed an adverse outcome pathway based assay toolbox to investigate the combined effects of the liver steatosis inducing compounds imazalil thiacloprid and clothianidin in human HepaRG hepatocarcinoma cells . Compound specific relative potency factors were determined using a benchmark dose approach . Equipotent mixtures were tested for nuclear receptor activation gene and protein expression and triglyceride accumulation according to the molecular initiating events and key events proposed in the steatosis AOP . All three compounds affected the activity of nuclear receptors but not key genes proteins as proposed . Triglyceride accumulation was observed with three different methods . Mixture effects were in agreement with the assumption of dose additivity for all the combinations and endpoints tested . Compound specific RPFs remained similar over the different endpoints studied downstream the AOP . Therefore it might be possible to reduce testing to a smaller battery of key tests . The results demonstrate the suitability of our

@highlight An AOP wise testing strategy was developed to assess mixture effects of chemicals.
@highlight Equipotent mixture designs were performed considering relative compound potencies.
@highlight The magnitude of effects were consistent with the assumption of dose additivity.
@highlight Compound specific relative potencies remained similar over the endpoints studied.
