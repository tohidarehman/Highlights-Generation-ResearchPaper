 The sustainability of sugarcane farming for biofuel has recently become a subject of debate because its expansion may contribute significantly to global climate change mitigation . Here we report greenhouse gases fluxes measured by the eddy covariance method from a commercial scale rain fed sugarcane plantation representative of the leading bioethanol production area in southeast Brazil . The measurements covered two harvests during which the field received nitrogen fertilization and trash was not removed .
