 In recent years digital repeat photography has received increasing attention as an inexpensive means by which seasonal changes in vegetation canopies can be monitored . Offering automation and an increased measurement frequency colour indices derived from above canopy digital repeat photography have proven a popular alternative to traditional observations of forest phenology . Nevertheless previous work has demonstrated several features in time series of colour indices that are unrelated to canopy structure limiting their utility to track specific biophysical properties such as leaf area index . Whilst techniques such as digital cover photography and the use of radiometric sensors are better suited to this task they are restricted by the need for careful calibration of above and below canopy reference sensors ancillary information on canopy leaf angle distribution and smaller measurement footprints . Using data collected at a deciduous broadleaf forest site in Southern England we investigated a new method to derive continuous measurements of LAI making use of automated digital hemispherical photography from below the canopy . After applying simple data screening procedures the LAI observations derived from our automated DHP system demonstrated very close agreement with those obtained from manually acquired DHP images which were collected under optimal illumination conditions over the surrounding forest plot

@highlight Automated DHP was used to derive daily in situ measurements of forest LAI.
@highlight Screened data demonstrated close agreement with manual acquisitions RMSE 0.20 .
@highlight Relationship between the GCC and LAI was investigated over the phenological cycle.
@highlight Hysteresis effects and discrepancies in derived transition dates were observed.
@highlight Results indicate that the GCC is not easily linked to any one biophysical property.
