 3 Chloro 1 2 propanediol is a food contaminant which has been classified as a non genotoxic carcinogen . Previous studies suggested that oxidative stress might play a role in 3 MCPD toxicity . To elucidate the impact of 3 MCPD mediated organ toxicity in more detail transgenic reporter mice were employed which contain a

@highlight The transgenic HOTT reporter mouse was employed to examine 3 MCPD mediated induction of oxidative stress.
@highlight 3 MCPD induces oxidative stress in mouse kidney testes and brain.
@highlight 3 MCPD leads to the irreversible oxidation of the redox sensor protein DJ 1.
@highlight 3 MCPD does not severely affect Nrf2 dependent gene expression in different mouse organs.
