 High discharge associated with rainfall events causes rapid transport of nutrients to drainage systems in karst terrain . The objective of this study was to understand nitrate dynamics and transport mechanisms during rainfall events in a typical mixed land use karst catchment in Southwest China . High frequency water sampling discharge and hydrochemistry sensor data at a 15 minute interval were collected from a karst agricultural surface river over four rainfall events spanning 40 days at the commencement of the wet season . The results showed that high NH

@highlight Nitrogen accumulated in dry condition and was flushed into river by rainfall events.
@highlight Nutrient dynamics are dependent on interaction of hydrology with source availability.
@highlight Nitrogen transformation processes are more active under the wet conditions.
@highlight Scientific fertilization and planning of cropping are advised for water NO
