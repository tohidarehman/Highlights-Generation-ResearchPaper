 Triphenyltin has been classified as an endocrine disruptor . However whether triphenyltin interferes with the adrenal glands during puberty remains unknown . Here we reported the effects of triphenyltin on the adrenal glands in rats . Male Sprague Dawley rats were orally administered with 0 0.5 1 or 2mg kg day triphenyltin for 18 days . Triphenyltin significantly lowered corticosterone levels at 1 and 2mg kg and adrenocorticotropic hormone at 2mg kg . The RNA Seq analysis detected multiple differentially expressed genes . Four down regulated genes were transcription factor genes
