 Colorectal cancer has been linked to dietary consumption of benzopyrene P . 6 Gingerol a component of ginger has been reported to possess anti inflammatory and antioxidant activities but little is known regarding the mechanism of 6 G in CRC chemoprevention . We therefore investigated the effect of 6 G on BP . and dextran sulphate sodium induced CRC in mice . Mice in Group I and Group II received corn oil and 6 G orally at 2ml kg and 100mg kg respectively for 126 days . Group III were administered 125mg kg of BP for 5 days followed by 3 cycles of 4 dextran sulphate sodium . Group IV received 6 G for 7 days followed by co administration with 125mg kg of BP . for 5 days and 3 cycles of 4 DSS . Tumor formation was reduced and expression of Ki 67 WNT3a DVL 2 and catenin following 6 G exposure . Also 6 G increases expression of APC P53 TUNEL positive nuclei and subsequently decreased the expression of TNF IL 1 INOS COX 2 and cyclin D1 . 6 G inhibited angiogenesis by decreasing the concentration of VEGF Angiopoietin 1 FGF and GDF 15 in the colon of BP . and DSS exposed mice . Overall 6 G attenuated BP and DSS induced CRC in mice via anti inflammatory anti proliferative and apoptotic mechanisms .

@highlight 6 Gingerol s 6 G role on BaP and dextran sulphate sodium DSS induced CRC in mice was investigated.
@highlight 6 G exposure RED tumor formation and expression of catenin in the colon of BaP and DSS exposed mice.
@highlight 6 G increases expression of APC and decreased the expression of of inflammatory markers.
@highlight 6 G inhibited angiogenesis by decreasing the concentration of VEGF.
@highlight Thus 6 G attenuated CRC in mice via anti inflammatory anti proliferative and apoptotic mechanisms.
