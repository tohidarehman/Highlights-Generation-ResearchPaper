 Nitrate and dissolved organic nitrogen leaching are major nitrogen loss pathway for intensive greenhouse vegetable production system . Quantifying the nitrate and DON leaching is essential to develop best management practices . In this study four seasons of tomato field experiments were conducted to test the impact of different water and N management practices and straw incorporation on N leaching and vegetable yield . A soil crop system model was calibrated and evaluated and results suggested that the model performed well for simulating soil water potential water drainage nitrate and DON leaching crop N uptake and yield . The average values of

@highlight WHCNS Veg model performed well for simulating nitrate and DON leaching.
@highlight DON leaching accounted for 21.7 46.6 of total soluble N leaching.
@highlight Drip fertigation reduced N leaching by 68 and maintained crop yield compared to furrow.
@highlight Straw addition reduced nitrate and DON leaching by 13 and 26 compared to no straw.
@highlight The optimal water and N management achieved high yield with less environmental impact.
