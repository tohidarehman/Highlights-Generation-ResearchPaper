 The state of Mato Grosso do Sul located in the Midwest of Brazil is devoid of climatological studies mainly on the characterization of rainfall regime and producers meteorological systems and rain inhibitors . This state has different soil and climatic characteristics distributed among three biomes Cerrado Mata Atlntica and Pantanal . This study aimed to investigate the temporal variability of fire foci in different SMS biomes . Data regarding fire foci and rainfall were obtained on an annual scale collected from 15 municipalities . Boxplot and distribution graphs were constructed for fire foci data and rainfall data associated with the biomes in each year . Subsequently we applied the MannKendall test to verify if there is a significant trend to the rainfall and fire foci data of the biomes . Pantanal revealed the higher occurrence of fire foci in relation to Cerrado and Mata Atlntica . The highest records of fire foci in Pantanal are caused by the longer drought period and anthropogenic activities . There is a tendency for positive growth in the occurrence of fire foci in the Pantanal Cerrado and Mata Atlntica . Therefore it is necessary to establish public policies to mitigate the occurrence of hot flashes in the SMS biomes especially in the Pantanal .

@highlight The state of Mato Grosso do Sul has three biomes Cerrado Mata Atlntica and Pantanal.
@highlight The occurrence of fire foci in this state is higher in the Pantanal.
@highlight The variability of the El Nio Southern Oscillation influences on fire foci dynamics.
