 Fisetin was reported to have various pharmacological activities . But due to its lower aqueous solubility and oral bioavailability it is not in much use . As solubility and bioavailability plays and important role in the pharmacological activity in this research work we tried to improve the oral bioavailability of fisetin . In this research work we developed self nanoemulsifying drug delivery system of fisetin . Developed SNEDDS were subjected for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies against rotenone induced Parkinson s disease model in rats . Higher Cmax and area under the curve during pharmacokinetic study indicated that SNEDDS improved the oral bioavailability of FS and also increased the mean residence time of drug in plasma . Results of behavior parameters biochemical estimation and ELISA confirmed the significantly improved neuroprotection in rats treated with FS loaded SNEDDS as compared to rats treated with nave FS . This study suggests that SNEDDS improved the oral bioavailability of FS which further helped in improving its neuroprotective activity in rat model of PD . It further suggests the potential use of FS SNEDDS in effective management of PD condition .

@highlight FS SNEDDS improved the oral bioavailability of fisetin.
@highlight FS SNEDDS provided significant neuroprotection against rotenone induced neurotoxicity.
@highlight Significant attenuation of alfa synuclein s aggregation was noted for FS SNEDDS.
@highlight Excellent correlation was noted between PK and PD results for FS SNEDDS.
