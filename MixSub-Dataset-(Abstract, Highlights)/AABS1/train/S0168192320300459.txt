 Temperature and precipitation are primary regulators of plant phenology . However our knowledge of how these factors might interact to affect plant phenology is incomplete . The Qinghai Tibetan Plateau a cold and high region has experienced no consistent changes in spring phenology despite a significant warming trend . We conducted a manipulative experiment of warming and precipitation addition in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau in 2015 2016 and 2017 . We found that warming increased annual variability of plant spring phenology . Warming delayed green up of all monitored species in 2016 advanced green up of early flowering species in 2015 and did not alter green up in 2017 . For example green up of the shallow rooted

@highlight Responses of green up to warming were different among years.
@highlight Water addition did not advance community phenology except in a dry and warm year.
@highlight Warming increased annual variability of plant green up and flowering.
@highlight Flowering of
@highlight advanced under warming plus water addition in all three years.
@highlight Soil moisture plays a critical role in determining phenological response to warming.
