 The safety of low and no calorie sweeteners remains a topic of general interest . Substantial evidence exists demonstrating a lack of carcinogenicity of the no calorie sweetener acesulfame potassium . The objective of this evaluation was to conduct a systematic assessment of available mechanistic data using a framework that quantitatively integrates proposed key characteristics of carcinogens into the totality of the evidence . Over 800 KCC relevant endpoints from a variety of

@highlight Identified appraised and integrated mechanistic data to assess potential carcinogenicity of acesulfame potassium Ace K .
@highlight Includes over 800 endpoints collected from literature and high throughput screening data.
@highlight Mechanistic data were evaluated for potential activity related to one or more key characteristics of carcinogens KCC .
@highlight Overall there was a lack of activity for Ace K per KCC supporting the lack of Ace K carcinogenicity in animal studies.
