 Cirsilineol belonging to the flavones category have not been explored in detail for anti proliferative potential therefore selected for the investigation . Hence the antiproliferative potential of cirsilineol has been established in NCIH 520cells . Cirsilineol exhibited good binding energy and inhibited the activity of ODC CATD DHFR HYAL LOX 5 and COX 2 up to 45.14 at 100M . It significantly inhibited the proliferation of NCIH 520cells and likewise the proliferation of other cell lines up to 48.50 . It also induced an increase in the sub diploid cell population which then leads to an increase in apoptosis by 2.64 and 5.12 fold at 10M and 100M respectively . Further the Annexin V FITC assay confirmed the late apoptosis and necrosis in the NCIH 520cell line induced by cirsilineol . The ROS production was enhanced by 1.16 and 2.22 folds at 10M and 100M respectively . Besides cirsilineol revealed acceptable ADME properties non toxic and non mutagenic compound . Altogether these findings provide evidence that cirsilineol inhibited the proliferation of NCIH 520cells by inducing ROS mediated apoptosis and offer new insight into the anti proliferative potential of cirsilineol which can further be exploited to either synthesise new derivatives or its candid usage as a herbal lead for cancer treatment .
