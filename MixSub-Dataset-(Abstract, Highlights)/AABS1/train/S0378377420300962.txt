 Suitable spectral monitoring models of canopy water content provide a scientific basis for real time dynamic accurate non destructive diagnosis over large acreage . This work investigates winter wheat under different water treatments to examine the relationship between canopy water content and spectral reflectance . Principal component regression spectral monitoring models are developed based on the combination of growth stages . The growth stage constraints are divided and the influence of other background noises is removed to achieve accurate and stable spectral monitoring results of canopy water content at all growth stages . The following main conclusions are derived . At the stem elongationbooting bootingmilking and milkingripening stages and during the entire growth period the spectral transforms with the highest correlation with winter wheat canopy water content are

@highlight At different growth stages of winter wheat the most closely related spectral parameters such as trilateral parameters and spectral transformation were obtained.
@highlight The combinational models of canopy water content models specific to individual growth stages are built on spectral transforms or three edge parameters.
@highlight Principal component regression spectral monitoring models are developed based on the combination of growth stages.
