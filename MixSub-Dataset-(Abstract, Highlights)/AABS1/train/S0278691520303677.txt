 The current study explored the efficacy of piperine in attenuating arsenic induced high fat diet aggravated oxidative stress mediated injury in hepatic and cardiac tissues of male Wistar rats . Oral administration of piperine significantly reduced the levels of organ specific and oxidative stress biomarkers in arsenic and high fat diet treated rat hepatic and cardiac tissues in a dose dependant manner with the dose of 60 mg kg b.w . exhibiting maximum protection . Arsenic induced high fat diet aggravated oxidative stress mediated damages in liver and heart tissues led to decreased activities of antioxidant enzymes ROS generation diminished activities of Krebs cycle and respiratory chain enzymes collapsed mitochondrial membrane potential mitochondrial DNA damage along with altered lipid metabolism and inflammatory cytokine levels . Histochemical and histopathological studies supported the above findings . Piperine efficiently counteracted the arsenic induced high fat diet aggravated oxidative stress mediated damages by modulating antioxidant defense mechanism along with free radical quenching ability . These findings indicate that piperine protected the arsenic induced high fat diet aggravated hepatic and cardiac injuries which underline the importance of piperine in providing a possible therapeutic regime for the amelioration of arsenic induced high fat diet aggravated oxidative stress mediated organ damages .

@highlight High fat diet aggravates arsenic induced rat hepatic and cardiac tissue damage.
@highlight Piperine an active component of black pepper protects against such tissue damages.
@highlight Antioxidant mechanism s seem to be behind such protection.
@highlight Piperine prevents ROS generation and ameliorates disruption of antioxidant enzymes.
@highlight Piperine protects activities of metabolic enzymes and mitochondrial health.
