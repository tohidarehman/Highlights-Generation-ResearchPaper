 Plants in arid and semi arid regions are often exposed to adverse environmental conditions such as drought which can affect plant growth . In this study we investigate the physiological responses of

@highlight responds to drought by increasing instantaneous and intrinsic water use efficiency indicating that stomatal closure could limit photosynthesis.
@highlight has a high capacity to restore photosynthesis after re watering.
@highlight Polyphenols flavonoids and total antioxidant capacity enable
@highlight to survive under adverse environmental conditions.
