 Recent studies have shown significant negative effects of long term irrigation with treated wastewater on performance of orchards planted on clay soil . The aim of this study was to evaluate water use and water relations of different mitigation measures to remedy the declining performance of a mature commercial fruit bearing Hass avocado orchard

@highlight Water uptake was highest for fresh water FW followed by tuff trench treatments.
@highlight Carbon isotope discrimination was lowest in FW and highest for treated waste water.
@highlight Tree trunk growth rate was highest in FW followed by diluted treated waste water.
