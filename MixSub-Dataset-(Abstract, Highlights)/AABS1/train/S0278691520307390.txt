 The intake of toxic compounds through the diet as a result of migration processes from food packaging is of increasing concern . It has been shown that the surfactant commercially known as surfynol which is commonly used in food contact materials is capable of migrating from multilayer containers into the food reaching potentially harmful concentration levels . In the present study the integration of an untargeted and a targeted metabolomics approach has been carried out using NTERA 2 germinal cells as in vitro model to make further progress in elucidating the molecular mechanisms associated with the toxicity of surfynol . This study has allowed the identification of different altered metabolites mainly related with energy acquiring cell development and cellular defense mechanisms . While glutamine L threonine propanoate octadecanoate and carbamate were found at higher concentrations in cells exposed tu surfynol L valine oxalate phosphate phenylalanine and myoinositol were found inhibited . Additionally concentrations of ATP ADP and NAD
