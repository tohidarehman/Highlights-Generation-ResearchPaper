 Process based agricultural simulation models are effective tools which can be applied to assess the potential impact of climate change and agronomic practices on yield and nutrient cycling . This study investigates the effects of climate change and fertilization on yield nitrogen contribution efficiency N loss to water and nitrous oxide N

@highlight SPACSYS was successfully used to simulate wheat and rice yield aboveground biomass and N cycling.
@highlight Delay wheat sown and advance rice transplantation reduced N losses by 5.4 and 5.8 respectively.
@highlight Yield losses for both wheat and rice were mitigated by altering sowing or transplanting dates.
@highlight A shift in growing seasons alongside N management practices could help to mitigate the progression of climate change.
@highlight Higher fertilizer rates under climate change significantly increase N losses.
