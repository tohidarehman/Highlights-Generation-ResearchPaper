 This is the first work to use a polyphenolic fraction derived from peanut skin to attenuate the toxicity induced by advanced glycation end products in RAW264.7 macrophages . The RAW264.7cells were stimulated by AGEs using the bovine serum albumin fructose bovine serum albumin methylglyoxal and arginine methylglyoxal models . The AGEs increased considerably the levels of reactive oxygen species and the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 tumor necrosis factor and nitric oxide . Twenty eight polyphenols including catechin phenolic acids and resveratrol were annotated in peanut skin extract with the use of ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry UPLC QTOF MS
