 Natural disasters may act as harmful causes of food insecurity in the Middle East . Frequent drought events water scarcity and unsustainable intensive agricultural practices may impact food security in the region . This paper investigates a causal relationship between drought and food security across the Middle East . Meteorological agricultural and hydrological droughts are analyzed at multiple timescales over the region for seven decades during the period of 19482017 . We simulate food security in the Middle East as a function of drought as well as several other socio economic drivers . A Bayesian approach is implemented to integrate these drivers in order to accurately predict food security in the region . Results reveal that hydrological drought is the most intensified drought type over the region especially in Egypt during the study period . Moreover the results demonstrate the significant impacts of livestock population growth agricultural products and drought on food security in the Middle East . Our findings further indicate that the agricultural products decreased in the Middle East following the recent drought event that happened in 2010 .
