 Neurite outgrowth is important process in synaptic formation and neuronal development . Many previous studies reported that natural compounds as well as neurotrophins induce neurite outgrowth through various signaling pathways . In this study we tested the effect of cryptotanshinone a constituent of

@highlight CPT facilitated neurite outgrowth in a concentration dependent manner.
@highlight CPT increased ERK1 2 phosphorylation.
@highlight ERK1 2 inhibitor blocked CPT facilitated neurite outgrowth.
@highlight CPT enhanced learning and memory without affecting basal sensory conditions.
@highlight CPT increased ERK1 2 phosphorylation in the hippocampus in a dose dependent manner.
