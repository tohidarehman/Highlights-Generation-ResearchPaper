 Wheat triticale and common bean are planted in both irrigated and rainfed conditions and may suffer the effects of water stress in both situations . The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of water stress on the physical and chemical qualities of wheat

@highlight Water stress partially affected the chemical quality of the grains.
@highlight Water stress increased protein and did not alter macrominerals in common bean grains.
@highlight Luminosity of wheat grains was altered under water stress.
@highlight Water stress reduced zinc content of wheat triticale and common bean grains.
