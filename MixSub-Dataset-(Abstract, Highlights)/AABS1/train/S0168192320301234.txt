 The effects of aquatic carbon exports on grassland ecosystem carbon balance is unclear . Here we quantified the seasonal and annual net ecosystem carbon budget of an alpine grassland ecosystem in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau permafrost region with integrative terrestrial and aquatic carbon flux measurements . The terrestrial carbon fluxes including the net ecosystem production and CH

@highlight The grassland ecosystem has an annual net ecosystem carbon budget NECB of 27.76 g C m
