 Chelerythrine a benzophenanthridine alkaloid is usually used as a nutritional and functional additive in variety of health foods . However it should be paid enough attention because of its potential toxicity to human health . In this work the binding mechanism of CHE with bovine serum albumin was systematically investigated with spectroscopic approaches . The results showed that the mixture of BSA with CHE could spontaneously cause the formation of BSA CHE complex through electrostatic interaction under simulative physiological conditions 0.01molL
