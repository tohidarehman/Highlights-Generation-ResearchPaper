 In coastal saline areas many studies ignore salinity problems when quantifying the impacts of climate change on irrigation water requirement . Based on 11 years of field investigations in a Tunisian coastal oasis this study simulated the changes in salinity in a coastal aquifer and quantified changes in net irrigation requirement of date palm under climate change considering required changes in leaching requirement . The future salinity in the aquifer was simulated based on sea level rise and changes in aquifer recharge . The study applied a statistical downscaling model to project future climate variables from 2019 to 2050 the SUTRA model to evaluate the change in aquifer salinity and applied CROPWAT software to calculate NIR . Three climate change scenarios were considered RCP8.5 RCP6.0 and RCP4.5 . Several useful finding were revealed in this study . First these three climate change scenarios showed significant trend of increasing annual maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation and a significant decreasing trend of future rainfall . Second the average aquifer salinity is expected to increase from an average of 4.2dSm

@highlight The impacts of climate change and future salinity trend in a coastal aquifer on irrigation water requirement of date palms were evaluated.
@highlight The irrigation water requirements of date palms were analyzed for historic 20082018 and future 20192050 periods for a Tunisian oasis.
@highlight The climate variability and trend were analyzed for historic 19642013 and future 20192050 periods for the studied oasis.
@highlight The climate change was contributed to progressive increasing in irrigation water salinity.
@highlight The climate change was contributed to significant increase in irrigation water requirement of date palms during 20192050.
