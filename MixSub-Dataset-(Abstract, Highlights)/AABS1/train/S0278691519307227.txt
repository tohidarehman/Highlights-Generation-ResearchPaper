 Immunomodulatory peptides with the sequences TSeMMM and SeMDPGQQ from selenium enriched rice protein hydrolysates were identified in our previous study . We synthesized these two peptides to study whether they have neuroprotective effects on Pb

@highlight TSeMMM and SeMDPGQQ were synthesized to investigate neuroprotective effects.
@highlight SPHs and purified fraction from SPHs SPHs 2 were used to compare the effects.
@highlight TSeMMM has better potential to prevent Pb
@highlight  induced neurotoxicity.
