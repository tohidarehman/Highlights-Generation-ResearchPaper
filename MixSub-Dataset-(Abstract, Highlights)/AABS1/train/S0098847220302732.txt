 Soil salinity is a major abiotic stress that limits plant growth and productivity . Understanding the mechanisms of plant salinity tolerance can facilitate engineering for quality improvement .

@highlight The first attempt to employ proteomics to elucidate salt tolerance mechanism of Apocyni Veneti Folium.
@highlight Key salt responsive proteins such as dehydrin 1 annexin PRH POP POD CAD 4CL3 CYP were identified.
@highlight Carbohydrate and energy metabolism primary and secondary metabolites and signal transduction contribute to salt tolerance.
@highlight Novel information for halophyte quality formation was provided.
