 The factors influencing the interception process such as the vegetation structure and the meteorological conditions especially rainfall characteristics are diverse and highly variable . Therefore derivation of canopy parameters for interception modelling requires data from field experiments over a long period . In this study we analyse long term changes in canopy parameters and rainfall interception for an old growth spruce stand composed mainly of

@highlight Interception study based on 22 years of throughfall measurements in a spruce stand.
@highlight Analysis of influence of two thinnings on interception and canopy parameters.
@highlight Decrease in interception only found to be significant after the first thinning.
@highlight Reliability of regression based canopy parameters depends on length of dataset.
