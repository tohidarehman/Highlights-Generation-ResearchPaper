 Wetlands store large carbon stocks and play important roles in biogeochemical C cycling . However the effects of environmental and anthropogenic pressures on C dynamics in lower coastal plain forested wetlands in the southern U.S. are not well understood . We established four eddy flux stations in two post harvest and newly planted loblolly pine plantations YP

@highlight Lower coastal plain forests appear to be on the crossroads.
@highlight The loblolly pine plantations in drained wetland soils are the most productive in North America.
@highlight Yet their carbon sequestration potential is offset by a period of net carbon loss after each harvest. The net carbon sequestration occurs for only 50 of the 25 year rotation cycle.
@highlight The natural undrained coastal forest on the other hand has experienced higher mortality and consequent carbon loss over the past decade.
@highlight Current evidence suggests that both intensive management and sea level rise reduce the forests capacity to sequester carbon in the long term.
