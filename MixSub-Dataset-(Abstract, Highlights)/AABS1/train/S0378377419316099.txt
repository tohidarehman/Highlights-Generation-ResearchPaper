 To establish the optimum fertilization rate and propose an appropriate drip fertigation regime for winter wheat in the North China Plain a three year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of drip fertigation levels on soil available nutrients winter wheat growth grain yield partial factor productivity and irrigation water use efficiency during 2014 2017 . The experiment investigated five fertilization rates 20 45 70 95 and 120 of the local recommended fertilizer dose 336 kg ha N and 169 kg ha P

@highlight Effect of different drip fertigation levels on soil available nutrients winter wheat growth and yield partial factor productivity PFP were explored.
@highlight As more fertilizer was applied more available N tended to leach to the deep layers and more available P inclined to accumulate in the upper layer.
@highlight Drip fertigation at 70 of the local recommended fertilizer dose resulted in a yield increase of 4.0 and a PFP increase of 48.5 .
@highlight Drip fertigation at 70 of the local recommended fertilization dose is suggested for winter wheat production in the NCP.
