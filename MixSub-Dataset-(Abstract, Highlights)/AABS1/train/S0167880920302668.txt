 Extensive studies have been made on the effect of the addition of nitrogen and organic carbon on grasses sedges and forbs of the alpine ecosystems however few such studies have been made on alpine plant communities and plant functional groups at extremely high altitudes . We questioned whether the addition of N and C two important soil elements would have different effects on plant functional groups and on the main plant species in an alpine steppe meadow ecosystem at an altitude of 4700 m. A two factor completely randomized design study was used with the addition of three levels of N 0 50 and 100 kg N ha With N and C as a single additive biomass of grasses increased while forbs decreased . Sedges remained unchanged with N addition and increased with C addition . These results may be due to competition among The effects of N and C addition on the biomass of plant functional groups were complicated by the interaction between N and C as well as by a major effect of initial standing biomass . With the addition of both N and C the biomass of grasses increased and forbs decreased especially in low natural primary production years . With C as a single additive the biomass of sedges increased as did community stability . Consequently management of plant biomass using N and or C addition depends on both the plant functional group target and the species within the group as well as the natural primary production . Predicting environmental factors that potentially affect primary production are crucial in a decision making nutrient management system .

@highlight Added N and C affect plant functional groups biomass rely on natural primary production.
@highlight N or C addition increase grasses biomass by increasing the dominant gramineous species.
@highlight C addition increase community stability but N addition did not.
