 Halophyte species have been proposed as suitable candidates for the phytostabilization of metal enriched sites in arid and semiarid ecosystems but co occurring conditions such as salinity and water stress can affect plant growth and colonization . In this work we determined the effect of single and combined copper salt and water stress on growth and tolerance strategies used by two xerohalophyte species of the genus

@highlight Effects of Cu stress in plants vary when combined with water or salt stress.
@highlight and
@highlight are more sensitive to Cu and water stress respectively.
@highlight accumulates Cu in roots whereas
@highlight acts as an evasor.
@highlight Stress combination decreases
@highlight growth but increases their tolerance response.
@highlight Salt stress induced proline accumulation only in
