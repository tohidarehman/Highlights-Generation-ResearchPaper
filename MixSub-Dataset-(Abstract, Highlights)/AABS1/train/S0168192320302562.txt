 Climate change poses a substantial risk to agricultural production in Peru . Nationally Determined Contributions are currently developed and outline Peru s mitigation actions and adaptation plans to climate change in various sectors . To support the implementation of adaptation measures in the agricultural sector information on weather related risks for crop production and the effectiveness of adaptation options on the local scale are needed . We assess weather influences on starchy maize yields on different scales in Peru based on statistical crop models and a machine learning algorithm . The models explain 91 of yield variability on the regional scale . On the local scale weather related yield variation can be explained in some areas but to a lower extent . Based on these models we assess the effectiveness of adaptation measures which increase water availability to protect against negative impacts from dry weather conditions . The results show that a higher water availability of 77mm in the growing season would have regionally different effects ranging from an increase of 20 to a decrease of 17 in maize yields . This large range underlines the importance of a local assessment of adaptation options . With this example we illustrate how a statistical approach can support a risk informed selection of adaptation measures at the local scale as suggested in Peru s NDC implementation plan .
