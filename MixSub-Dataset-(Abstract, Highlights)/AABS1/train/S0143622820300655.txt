 Land degradation assessment is imperative for developing a mitigation plan to minimize the adverse impacts associated with land degradation . The study involves the integration of various social economic and environmental indices for identifying the land degradation vulnerable areas in the Pir Panjal Himalaya Kashmir India . Analysis of the land use and land cover from the satellite data revealed that 47 of the area is devoid of any vegetal cover . Slope index revealed that 40 of the study area is precipitous with slope 30 . The land utilization index indicated that 51 of the area is over utilized . Integration of all the environmental indices in GIS environment yielded the Natural Resource Prioritization Index which revealed that 41 of the area needs attention for land degradation mitigation on top priority . Integration of all the socioeconomic indices yielded the Socio Economic Priority Zones which revealed that 35 of the area needs attention for the socio economic upliftment on priority for combating the land degradation in the study area . Land Degradation Vulnerability Index model was developed in GIS environment based on the unique combination of various natural resource and socioeconomic priority zones using the weighted index approach to assess the cumulative impact of social economic and environmental factors on land degradation . The model analyses revealed that 48 of the study area 603Km

@highlight The study is first of its kind to evaluate the land degradation vulnerability in the Himalaya.
@highlight Socioeconomic and environmental factors were integrated in GIS using weighted index approach.
@highlight The model assessed the cumulative impact of various causal factors on land degradation.
@highlight  48 of the study area has high vulnerability and risk to different forms of land degradation.
@highlight The findings shall inform strategies for combating land degradation at village level.
