 Excessive accumulation of cadmium is known to cause nephrotoxicity by targeting renal proximal tubular epithelial cells . Studies showed an essential role of autophagy in cadmium induced nephrotoxicity however its underlying mechanisms accompanied by autophagy are incompletely understood . Using an HK 2 human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line as a study model sustained exposure of cadmium chloride CdCl

@highlight Cadmium causes autophagic cell death in HK 2cells and kidney of exposed rats.
@highlight Cadmium induces ER stress and increases FoxO3a Beclin1 and Bnip3 expression.
@highlight Inhibitors of ER stress alleviate cadmium induced FoxO3a Beclin1 and Bnip3 expression and autophagy.
@highlight FoxO3a silencing alleviates cadmium induced Beclin1 and Bnip3 expression and autophagy.
