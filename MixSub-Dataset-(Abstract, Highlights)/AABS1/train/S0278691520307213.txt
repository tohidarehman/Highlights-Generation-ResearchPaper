 Previously we published selected Eliciting Dose values for 14 allergenic foods predicted to elicit objective allergic symptoms in 1 and 5 respectively of the allergic population . These ED01 and ED05 values were specifically presented and discussed in the context of establishing Reference Doses for allergen management and the calculation of Action Levels for Precautionary Allergen Labeling . In the current paper we publish the full range of ED values for these allergenic foods and provide recommendations for their use specifically in the context of characterizing risks of concentrations of allergenic proteins in food products .

@highlight This paper gives the full range Eliciting Dose values for 14 allergenic foods
@highlight This information can be used for the characterization of risks of allergen exposure
@highlight The values are to be used in combination with allergenic protein intake information
@highlight Recommendations are given for the correct use of the values
@highlight The reliability and safety of the use of the datasets and values are discussed
