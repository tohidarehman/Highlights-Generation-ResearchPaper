 As conservation landscapes are threatened by global change there is a growing need to understand relationships between human livelihoods and environmental processes . This often involves integrating multiple data sources capturing different scales of measurement . Participatory methods have emerged as a means to accomplish this but are hampered by a wide range of challenges associated with data collection and translation . Here we present a novel methodology for mapping human use of natural resources that overcomes many of the difficulties faced in participatory mapping . Based in the world s largest terrestrial transfrontier conservation area we couple household surveys with in situ fine scale mapping to identify key resource areas that support local livelihoods . This allows for a spatially referenced human use footprint that can be combined with remotely sensed data measuring environmental impact . This methodology is applicable across contexts and has implications for landscape management and conservation .
