 The complex pathophysiological mechanisms behind destructive chronic conditions including cancer neurodegenerative diseases diabetes mellitus cardiovascular diseases and hepatic failure urge the need for finding related pivotal dysregulated signaling mediators as well as multi target therapeutic agents . In the current study critical roles of phosphoinositide 3 kinase protein kinase B pathway as potential therapeutic targets in the pathogenesis of various diseases has been described . This pathway is also interconnected with several downstream inflammatory oxidative stress and apoptotic mediators as dysregulated pathways in chronic diseases . Therefore identifying novel multi target agents to attenuate PI3K Akt thereby related downstream pathways is of great importance . Astaxanthin is a multi target lipid soluble keto carotenoid derived from the varieties of marine organisms with potential anti inflammatory antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties through PI3K Akt pathway . Nowadays due to its high nutritional and medicinal value research on AST is increasing . This review aimed to address PI3K Akt targeted by AST in several diseases toward clinical applications .

@highlight The PI3K Akt pathway plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of different diseases.
@highlight The PI3K Akt pathway has a close interconnection with other inflammatory apoptotic and oxidative stress pathways.
@highlight Astaxanthin passes through PI3K Akt pathway toward potential therapeutic application.
@highlight Astaxanthin could attenuate mTOR GSK 3 HIF 1 Bcl 2 Bad FoxO and other interconnected mediators through PI3K Akt.
@highlight Astaxanthin is a potential carotenoid with auspicious biological activities and health benefits.
