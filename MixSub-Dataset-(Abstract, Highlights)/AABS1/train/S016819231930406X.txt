 Agricultural land management practices have the potential to reduce carbon emissions from soils especially when a reduction in microbial heterotrophic respiration

@highlight Autotrophic and heterogrophic respirations were studied in three agroforestry systems.
@highlight Areas with perennial vegetation had lower heterogrophic respirations

@highlight was more sensitive to temperature change

@highlight was greater in hedgerows and shelterbelts than in silvopasture.
@highlight Perennial vegetation forest or silvopasture helps maintain sequestered C in soils.
