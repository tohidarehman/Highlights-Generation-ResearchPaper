 Bioactive compounds from food products made from natural ingredients such as corn and common bean could target the NLRP3 inflammasome protein scaffolds with a key role in the moderation of intestinal inflammation . This research aimed to evaluate the anti inflammatory effect from the fermented non digestible fraction of baked corn and common bean snack and its main components on the modulation of NLRP3 inflammasome markers

@highlight Fermented non digestible fraction FNDF of corn and bean snacks was assessed.
@highlight FNDF mainly contained gallic acid butyric acid and verbascose.
@highlight Nitrites production was reduced in THP 1 macrophages differentiated Caco 2 model.
@highlight ROS and total superoxide nitric oxide synthase activities were modulated by FNDF.
@highlight FNDF attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome markers such as caspase 1 IL 1 and IL 18.
