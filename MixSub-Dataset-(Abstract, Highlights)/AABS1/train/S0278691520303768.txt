 The co use patterns of cosmetics would be critical for accurate aggregate exposure assessment . The Korean national representative exposure factor database which includes simultaneous usage patterns of 31 cosmetics by 1001 subjects was used to analyze the co use patterns by Koreans . Three analytical methods were applied to determine the co use patterns . Cohen s kappa coefficient was used to analyze the correlation between pairs . This method revealed an effect of gender on the cosmetics co use pattern . Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using the binary linkage distance method . The clusters were divided into one large cluster and small clusters of one or two cosmetics . Frequent pattern mining was performed using the eclat algorithm . The number of cosmetics used and co use pattern were influenced by gender and age of the population . The co use patterns exhibited an additive property in that new cosmetics were added to previous cosmetic combinations . A co use scenario was proposed using the rank of occurrence frequency in co use patterns and percentile values of the number of cosmetics used . The 16 co use scenarios represented to the 25th 50th 75th and 95th percentiles of the co use patterns for four gender age groups . These could be applied to aggregate exposure assessment as exposure scenarios .

@highlight Co use is critical for aggregate exposure because people use multiple products.
@highlight Cosmetics co use pattern was different by demographic characteristics.
@highlight Co use scenarios of 31 cosmetics were proposed for four population groups.
@highlight The co use scenarios could be applicable for aggregate exposure assessment.
