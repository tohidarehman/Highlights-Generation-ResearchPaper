 The significant contribution to the global carbon budget made by soil organic carbon inspired the 4 per 1000 initiative . It promotes agricultural practices aimed at raising SOC stocks 0.4 annually over 20 years . However the response of topsoil and deep soil profiles to agroecosystem changes is largely unknown at present . Our work aims to quantify deep SOC accumulations in stabilized croplands and grasslands of northeast Italy and identify the best management practices to increase those stores . Soil profiles were collected to 70 and 90 cm depths from three well established long term experiments . A total of 1242 soil samples were analyzed for SOC concentrations as a function of soil type soil management practice and cropping system . SOC stocks were quantified using the equivalent soil mass method . Results show that SOC stocks averaged 23.2 Mg ha

@highlight Organic carbon stock was estimated to 90 cm depth in different soils and crop systems.
@highlight Soil layers below tillage showed organic carbon stocks of at least 59 of the total.
@highlight Permanent meadow had the highest soil organic carbon stocks along the full profile.
@highlight In croplands coupling manure input and minimum tillage was the most effective practice.
@highlight Sandy soils with initial low organic carbon showed high reactivity to its storage.
