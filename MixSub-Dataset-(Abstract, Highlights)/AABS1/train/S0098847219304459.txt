 More than 31 000 useful plant species have been documented to fulfil needs and services for humans or the animals and environment we depend on . Despite this diversity humans currently satisfy most requirements with surprisingly few plant species for example just three crops rice wheat and maize comprise more than 50 of plant derived calories . Here we synthesize the projected impact of global climatic change on useful plants across the spectrum of plant domestication . We illustrate the demographic spatial ecophysiological chemical functional evolutionary and cultural traits that are likely to characterise useful plants and their resilience in the next century . Using this framework we consider a range of possible pathways for future human use of plants . These are centred on two trade offs i

@highlight  31 000 plants have documented uses but humans fulfil most requirements with very few species.
@highlight Future selection pressures on useful plants are likely to be different to those during domestication.
@highlight Society faces two trade offs substitution vs adaptation and specialization vs diversification.
@highlight Continued biodiversity loss in part due to climate change will further erode our choice of future strategies.
