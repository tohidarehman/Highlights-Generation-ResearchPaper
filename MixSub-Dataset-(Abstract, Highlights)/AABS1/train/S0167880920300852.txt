 Increase in farm size can reduce fertilizer use but it may accelerate soil erosion particularly stream channel erosion and associated nutrient losses due to reduced farmland heterogeneity . But these positive and negative environmental impacts of IFS have never been compared . The objectives of this study were to determine the SC erosion and associated nutrient losses following IFS and clarify their influencing factors . The study was conducted in Nala watershed in southern subtropics of China . Six SCs were surveyed in just completed period and after one year of IFS . The SC erosion significantly increased in entire watershed from 12.0Mg ha

@highlight IFS significantly accelerated SC erosion and associated nutrient losses.
@highlight The accelerated SC erosion negatively correlated with field density.
@highlight Reduced fertilizer use by IFS was significantly offset by accelerated SC erosion.
@highlight Grasses should be planted in SCs to control SC erosion and associated nutrient losses.
