 Olaquindox is a chemosynthetic growth promoter which could promote the treatment of bacterial infections and improve feed energy efficiency . Hepatotoxicity is still a poor feature associated with the adverse effects of OLA . The present study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of OLA induced hepatotoxicity and the protective role of curcumin in mice and HepG2 cells . The result showed that representative biomarkers involved in mitochondrial pathway p53 pathway mitogen activated protein kinase pathway autophagy and antioxidant pathway were activated . Furthermore curcumin attenuated OLA induced serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase and liver damage in mice . In addition cell viability of HepG2 was enhanced by curcumin pretreatment at 5 10 and 20M . Meanwhile curcumin markedly ameliorated OLA induced oxidative stress apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction . Moreover curcumin pretreatment significantly up regulated the expressions of nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 and heme oxygenase 1 and down regulated the expressions of nuclear factor kappaB and p53 through reduced the nuclear translocation of NF kB induced by OLA . In summary our findings indicated that OLA induced hepatotoxicity involved in mitochondrial apoptosis autophagy p53 pathway Nrf2 HO 1 pathways and curcumin regulated OLA induced liver damage oxidative stress and apoptosis via activation of Nrf2 HO 1 pathway and suppression of p53 and NF kB pathway .
