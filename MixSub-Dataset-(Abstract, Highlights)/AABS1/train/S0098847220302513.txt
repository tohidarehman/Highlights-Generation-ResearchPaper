 Plant heat stress response involves many heat shock proteins each might has distinct function . Thus understanding of molecular bases of corresponding responses of each HSP in plant is essential for both basic and applied researches . While previous work focused dominantly on high temperature heat stress studies on mild heat stress are rare .

@highlight integrates both developmental and mild heat stress signals in developing sepals.
@highlight maintains protein and metabolite homeostasis through its network genes.
@highlight Lipid metabolism seems to be an important part in
@highlight mediated regulatory network.
