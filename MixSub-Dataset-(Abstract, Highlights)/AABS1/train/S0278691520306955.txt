 The novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2 has emerged as a severe threat against public health and global economies . COVID 19 the disease caused by this virus is highly contagious and has led to an ongoing pandemic . SARS CoV 2 affects mainly the respiratory system with most severe cases primarily showcasing acute respiratory distress syndrome . Currently no targeted therapy exists and since the number of infections and death toll keeps rising it has become a necessity to study possible therapeutic targets . Antiviral drugs can target various stages of the viral infection and in the case of SARS CoV 2 both structural and non structural proteins have been proposed as potential drug targets . This review focuses on the most researched SARS CoV 2 proteins their structure function and possible therapeutic approaches .

@highlight Structural and non structural proteins of SARS CoV 2 are potential drug targets.
@highlight Spike glycoprotein and viral proteases may be promising targets against COVID 19.
@highlight Multi stage viral entry replication viral vesicle formation are therapeutic targets.
@highlight Toxicity is a critical component in the development of safe and effective drugs.
