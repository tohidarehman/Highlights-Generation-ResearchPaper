 As key components of the E3 ubiquitin ligase in the Skp1 Cullin or CDC53 F box complex F box proteins are involved in plant abiotic stress responses . However the functions of F box proteins in soybean in response to abiotic stress remain unclear . In this study the soybean F box protein encoding gene

@highlight encodes a nuclear localized F box protein that responds to PEG treatment ABA treatment and salt stress at the transcriptional level.
@highlight Stress tolerance analysis of heterologous GmFBX176 overexpressing
@highlight revealed that GmFBX176 is a negative regulatory protein that improves tolerance to drought and salt stress.
@highlight GmFBX176 overexpressing
@highlight displayed reduced sensitivity to ABA.
@highlight Constitutive heterologous overexpression of the
@highlight gene affects stress related physiological indicators and the transcript levels of stress response genes in transgenic
