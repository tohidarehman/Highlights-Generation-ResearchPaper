 Past studies have rather consistently shown a significant positive association between firearm ownership and suicide rates in the United States . However the impact of spatial dependence of suicide rates has not been considered in the existing research that took an ecological studies approach . To bridge this gap in the literature we estimated and compared the association using Ordinary Least Square spatial autoregressive and hierarchical spatial autoregressive regression models . The outcome variable was the average age adjusted and smoothed suicide rate at the county level in the United States between 2008 and 2014 . The covariates included the state level firearm ownership and several key demographic geographic religious psychopathological and suicide related variables at both the state and county levels . Our main findings were 1 the spatially informed models were significantly outperformed the OLS model . The SAR

@highlight State level firearm ownership was significantly associated with county level firearm suicide rates.
@highlight State level firearm ownership was not significantly associated with county level all or non firearm suicide rates.
@highlight Access to household firearms was a significant risk factor of firearm suicide in the United States.
@highlight Means reduction should be included in the suicide prevention strategy in the United States.
