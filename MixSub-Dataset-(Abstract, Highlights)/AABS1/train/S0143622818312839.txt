 OpenStreetMap is a volunteered platform designed to provide up to date and freely available geographic information data . OSM is known as one of the most extensively used instances of Crowdsourcing Geographic Data Crowdsourced Geographic Information Volunteered Geographic Information or the Neogeography paradigm . Economically OSM development can be beneficial for governments especially in developing countries such as Iran where financial support is limited . This paper analyzes the spatial pattern evolution density and diversity of OSM road networks in Iran between 2008 and 2016 and looks to find casual relations between the OSM and census statistics . This is due to the fact that OSMr completeness reflects the importance of OSM data in human life . The diversity of OSM roads further reflects the concerns requirements and worthiness of clients about different roads information . The results show that the road network in Iran considerably increased from 2008 to 2016 with road length increasing to 489 400km in 2016 from 4300km in 2008 . In addition road density grew while road diversity and evenness declined which could be due to an increase in main roads . These results propose a more considerable need for a more comprehensive approach using VGI to supplement gaps in authoritative data in developing countries .

@highlight We analyzes the spatial pattern evolution density diversity of OSM road networks and its relationships with census data.
@highlight Road density grew while road diversity and evenness declined.
@highlight Mapping direction extended from big cities to medium small sized ones.
@highlight Western counties located in mountainous regions are still not very active.
@highlight Top active counties producing VGI data are mostly populated by urban citizens.
