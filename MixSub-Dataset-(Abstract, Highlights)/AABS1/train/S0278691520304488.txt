 Prevention and treatment of non communicable diseases including cardiovascular disease diabetes obesity cancer Alzheimer s and Parkinson s disease arthritis non alcoholic fatty liver disease and various infectious diseases lately most notably COVID 19 have been in the front line of research worldwide . Although targeting different organs these pathologies have common biochemical impairments redox disparity and prominently dysregulation of the inflammatory pathways . Research data have shown that diet components like polyphenols poly unsaturated fatty acids fibres as well as lifestyle are important factors influencing signalling pathways with a significant potential to improve metabolic homeostasis and immune cells functions . In the present manuscript we have reviewed scientific data from recent publications regarding the beneficial cellular and molecular effects induced by dietary plant products mainly polyphenolic compounds and PUFAs and summarize the clinical outcomes expected from these types of interventions in a search for effective long term approaches to improve the immune system response .

@highlight Inflammatory cues contribute to chronic and acute disease.
@highlight Nutraceuticals are important in prevention and treatment of inflammation.
@highlight Omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have beneficial effects in chronic disease.
@highlight Polyphenols inhibit the inflammatory processes through multiple pathways.
@highlight Carbohydrate restriction and Mediterranean diet generate reduction of inflammatory markers in clinical studies.
