 Data on the bioactivation of Phosmet a phthalimide derived organophosphate pesticide to the neurotoxic metabolite Phosmet oxon in human are not available . The characterization of the reaction in single human recombinant CYPs evidenced that the ranking of the intrinsic clearances was 2C18 2C19 2B6 2C9 1A1 1A2 2D6 3A4 2A6 . Considering the average human hepatic content CYP2C19 contributed for the great majority at relevant exposure concentrations while CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 were relevant at high substrate concentration . The dose dependent role of the active isoforms was confirmed in human liver microsomes by using selective CYP inhibitors . This prominent role of CYP2C in oxon formation was not shared by other OPTs . The pre systemic Pho bioactivation measured in human intestinal microsomes was relevant accounting for of that measured in the liver showing two reaction phases catalysed by CYP2C and CYP3A4 . Phosmet efficiently inhibited CPF bioactivation and detoxication with Ki values relevant to pesticide concentrations achievable in the human liver while the opposite is unlikely at the actual exposure levels depending on the peculiar isoform specific Pho bioactivation . Kinetic information in humans can support the development of quantitative

@highlight CYP2C19 accounted for 60 of Phosmet oxon formation at actual exposure levels.
@highlight The pre systemic bioactivation in the gut accounted for of the hepatic one.
@highlight Phosmet can efficiently inhibit chlorpyrifos bioactivation and detoxication.
@highlight At actual exposure levels chlorpyrifos did not inhibit phosmet bioactivation.
