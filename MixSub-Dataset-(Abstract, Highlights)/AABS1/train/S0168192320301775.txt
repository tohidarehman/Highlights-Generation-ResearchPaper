 The length of the wildfire season has become longer in many regions around the world under climate change . This study investigated changes in fire season pattern and the contributions of climate change in Daxing anling Northeast China . An expanded fire dataset in both spatial and temporal converge from ground reporting was used . A comparison with satellite detected burned areas showed good agreement in spring summer and entire fire season . The results showed that the number of fires used to appear in a bimodal pattern with spring and fall peaks in the last century but transitioned to a unimodal pattern peaked in summer in this century . This conversion was mainly resulted from a remarkable increase in summer lightning fires which was in turned associated with warming in Daxing anling . Another factor for the conversion was decreased spring nonlightning fire occurrence in the northwest subregion where the conversion was the most significant . This decrease of fire was mainly associated with increased precipitation . The analysis of a compositional fire series built as the log of the ratio of lightning to nonlightning fires suggests that climate change was a major factor for the conversion of fire season pattern . The finding from this study indicates a need to adjust the fire prevention implementation timeline by including summer fires and to develop strategies to reduce the related risks to firefighter safety and forest ecosystem health in Daxing anling .

@highlight A fire dataset for Daxing anling China was analyzed and evaluated using GFED data.
@highlight We found that wildfires changed from a bimodal pattern to a unimodal pattern.
@highlight It was caused mainly by increasing summer lightning fires.
@highlight Analysis of compositional fire series suggests the major contribution from climate change.
