 Residential location choice behaviour is a key component of the complex and dynamic human environment interactions driving changes in the urban landscape . The residential location choices that households make depend on their socio economic characteristics attitudes and life cycle stage as well as the location s properties . The objective of this research was to analyse residential location preferences for different types of households in Belgium by developing a residential location choice model based on the use of regression trees . For each preference group a discrete choice model was estimated identifying the main factors influencing residential location choices and how these differ depending on household characteristics . The data driven approach proposed in this paper enables a transparent interpretation of the main household characteristics explaining differences in residential location choice behaviour and of the varying effect of location characteristics on residential location choice . Results obtained with the model show that tenure status education level nationality and household type successfully discriminate heterogeneous residential location preference profiles in Belgium . Model variables for each preference group demonstrate that not only socio economic characteristics of the resident population but also housing price and job accessibility differentially affect a location s attractivity for different household profiles .

@highlight Heterogeneity of residential location preferences is modelled at the national scale.
@highlight Households are partitioned into 11 preference groups using a data driven approach.
@highlight Choice heterogeneity depends on tenure education nationality and household type.
@highlight Transport and housing conditions differentially affect a location s attractivity.
@highlight Spatial non stationarity in location choice is most outspoken for owner households.
