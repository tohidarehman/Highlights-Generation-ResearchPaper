 The transition from mother plant seed production to seedlings recruitment is critical for annual plant species but also for vertically transmitted microbial symbionts . Evidence indicates that microbial symbionts play important roles in plant response to environmental changes . However their role in plant facing gaseous tropospheric pollutants such as the highly reactive and phytotoxic ozone have been scarcely studied . Here we experimentally tested the consequences of maternal plant exposure to ozone on the longevity of

@highlight Parental environment affects functional characteristics of seeds.
@highlight Seed transmitted fungal endophytes mediate transgenerational effects in plants.
@highlight Negative effects of transgenerational ozone were detected in endophyte symbiotic seeds but not in non symbiotic seeds.
@highlight Parental ozone impacted seed progeny when it occurs close to reproductive phase of the plant.
@highlight Under accelerated ageing conditions endophyte symbiotic seeds showed deteriorated physiological state and reduced longevity.
