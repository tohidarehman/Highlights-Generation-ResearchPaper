 This study investigated the effect of water saving measures on the spatiotemporal variability of water absorption and thermal state in roots . It is crucial for understanding the process of water use of plants and its importance in the functioning of hydro ecosystem . The spatiotemporal patterns of

@highlight Soil water 18O in the profile was strongly linked with soil water content and water saving measures.
@highlight Water saving measures increase the soil temperature and promote cherry root access to soil water at shallower depths.
@highlight Proposing the strategy of irrigation quota and water saving measures to improve the contribution of irrigation water in cherry orchards.
