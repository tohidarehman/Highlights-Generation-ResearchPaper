 Sugarcane is often portrayed as one of the most environmentally sustainable food and energy crops yet evidence of the crop s social and environmental impacts in Africa s growing sugarcane industry remains scarce . The land cover replaced by cane and subsequent land use practices play important roles in shaping the environmental impacts of expansion . Land cover change can be both direct and indirect and land ownership is key in shaping socioeconomic impacts yet these have not been systematically documented in an area experiencing cane expansion in Africa . This paper addresses these gaps through an analysis of land use changes and hydrological impacts associated with the 2006 to 2012 expansion of Zambia Sugar in Mazabuka Zambia . Methods included semi structured interviews with Zambia Sugar and outgrowers remote sensing of land cover to quantify the types of land conversion and hydrological analysis of impacts on regional crop water use and the Kafue River . The bulk of the expansion area as reported by Zambia Sugar converted low water using shrublands to sugarcane increasing total consumptive use of irrigation water by cane in Mazabuka to 13 16 of the 25 probability monthly mean low flow in the Kafue River . Commercial scale growers represented 94 of the expansion area calling into question claims about smallholder inclusion .

@highlight Analysis of land use change and hydrological impact of sugarcane expansion in southern Zambia.
@highlight 62 of expansion converted rainfed shrublands to irrigated sugarcane.
@highlight Expansion increased consumptive use of irrigation water to 13 16 of 25 probability monthly mean low flow of Kafue River.
@highlight With 94 of expansion taking place on commercial scale plantations smallholder participation was minimal.
