 We investigated how arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis can alter trace element uptake distribution and toxicity in plants by examining some of the molecular mechanisms behind

@highlight Under excess 
@highlight restricts Cd transport to shoots but not Zn.
@highlight Expression patterns of
@highlight and
@highlight suggest they transport both Cd and Zn.
@highlight Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus modulates Cd Zn accumulation and distribution in poplar.
@highlight Symbiosis up regulates metallothionein
@highlight in roots regardless of contamination.
@highlight greatly increases Cd tolerance in transgenic yeast under Cd stress.
