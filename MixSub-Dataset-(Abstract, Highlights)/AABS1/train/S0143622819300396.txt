 Mobile phones and short message service have been widely used in disease control and prevention . Personalized SMSs further allows real time precisely targeted interventions that achieve better cost effectiveness . Few SMSs are personalized based on spatiotemporal travel behavior of individuals which plays an important role in disease spread . We proposed a set of SMS policies tailored to individuals travel behavior derived from massive mobile phone tracking records . These policies tend to alter spatial temporal or spatiotemporal patterns of individuals daily activities in order to reduce the risk of disease spread . Taking Shenzhen city China as a study area we simulated and evaluated these policies for Dengue Fever intervention . Our simulation results show that the spatially targeting policy that discourages discretionary trips produces the highest cost effectiveness to control disease spread in areas with high importation risk . For the entire city however the temporally targeting policy that shifts individuals travel schedules achieves the best cost effectiveness . Our study contributes to a new ground of precise public health that calls for individualized real time and accurately targeted interventions . Utilizing big mobile phone data we present a novel approach to design simulate and evaluate space time precise intervention for disease control .
