 Tree heights are pivotal for assessing forest ecology and carbon management but conventional field methods are time consuming and labor intensive making them impractical for regional monitoring and long term repeated measurements . Retrieving surface height from point cloud data using a low cost unmanned aerial vehicle has been a prevailing technology . With the availability of a high spatial resolution digital terrain model from lidar tree heights can be derived by correlating field height measurements and the differences between DSM and DTM . Moreover tree growth over time can be modeled with the availability of historical field data . In this study we utilized canopy heights acquired by UAV in 2014 from a secondary broadleaf forest and broadleaf conifer plantations in a mountainous region of central Taiwan . The mean tree heights at the plot scale were assessed by comparison with ground data . We then hindcasted MTH from 20102013 by calibrating the UAV data with historical field MTH and the relationships between MTH growth and topography and climate were investigated . We found that the performance of a UAV in MTH derivation was satisfactory and that the model could explain 74 of the variation . The hindcasting analysis revealed that the broadleaf and conifer species grew 0.98 m y

@highlight An unmanned aerial vehicle was used to map tropical forest mean tree heights MTH 
@highlight Aerial and historical field data provided an opportunity to model annual MTH growth
@highlight Aspect was the only topographical attribute significantly influencing MTH growth
@highlight MTH of broadleaf and conifer species responded similarly to climate seasonality
