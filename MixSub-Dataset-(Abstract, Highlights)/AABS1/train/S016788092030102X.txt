 Ecosystem services provided by silvopastoral systems are mediated by specific management practices environmental conditions and overall design of the system . We hypothesized that selection of tree species affects understory forage nutritive value and productivity light shade environment and microclimate . The silvopastoral system was located at the Center for Environmental Farming Systems in Goldsboro North Carolina USA . Three overstory tree species were

@highlight Forage productivity was not affected by tree species at different distances from the trees.
@highlight The effect of trees was moderate on microclimate variables.
@highlight The silvopastoral systems design provided year round shade.
