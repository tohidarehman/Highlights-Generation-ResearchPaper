 Abnormal epigenetic alterations are one of the keystones of cancer development . Epigenetic targeting drugs have become a promising and effective cancer therapy strategy . However due to the high toxicity and unclear mechanisms of action of these drugs natural compounds that cause epigenetic modulation have also been studied . Sulforaphane is a promising bioactive compound for epigenetic targeting therapy . In this study we investigate the effects of SFN on gene expression and DNA methylation in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells . Using high throughput technologies in combination with cell based assays we find SFN is a potent anticancer agent as it induces DNA damage mitotic spindle abnormalities followed by apoptosis and proliferation inhibition in HepG2 cells . Our results show the upregulation of DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoint genes . Also we find the downregulation of cellular pathways frequently overexpressed in human cancer . As expected SFN exerts epigenetic modulation effects by inhibiting histone deacetylases . SFN might affect the activity of oncogenic transcription factors through methylation of its binding sites motifs . Our findings offer insights into SFN chemopreventive molecular effects in HepG2 cells and highlight SFN as a valuable natural approach to cancer therapy for future investigation .
