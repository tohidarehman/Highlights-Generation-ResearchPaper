 Exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds during pregnancy can result in negative health effects in later generations including sex changes and feminization . The present study assessed the feminization effects on male offspring rats of three EDCs Dienestrol Linuron and Flutamide . Sexually mature female rats were exposed from gestation day 6 until postnatal day 21 to 0.37 0.75 1.5 3.12 or 6.25g kg day of DIES 1.5 3 6 12.5 25 or 50mg kg day of LIN 3.5 6.7 12.5 25 or 50mg kg day of FLU and the following mixtures FLU DIES 3.5 0.37 or 3.5 3 25 0.37 or 25 3 FLU LIN 3.5 12.5 or 25 12.5 and DIES LIN 0.37 12.5 or 3 12.5 . Anogenital distance nipple retention and cryptorchidism were evaluated . FLU produced a decrease of AGD an increase of NR and an increase of cryptorchidism at the highest dose . None of these three endpoints were significantly affected by LIN or DIES treatments alone . Combinations of FLU LIN and FLU DIES increased NR and decreased AGD while DIES LIN did not produce any effects in male pups . Results show that FLU is able to induce feminization in male pups while binary combinations of LIN and DIES did not modify the effects produced by FLU .

@highlight Flutamide caused feminization to male pups.
@highlight At PND0 1 male and female pups cannot be well distinguished in FLU treated groups.
@highlight Linuron decreased the viability of pups at the highest dose.
@highlight Feminizing effects due to maternal exposure through DIES and LIN were not observed.
@highlight Combinations of FLU LIN and FLU DIES increased NR and decreased AGD.
