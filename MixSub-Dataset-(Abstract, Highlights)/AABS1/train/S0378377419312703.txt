 Recently the potential use as fertilizer of some wastewaters from table olive factories has been reported but the cause of this activity has not been disclosed up to now . In this study a huge number of table olive waste solutions were analyzed from three consecutive seasons . Sugars phenolic and mineral compounds were the main chemical groups identified . The individual effect of these components was tested on the growth of tomato plants and the quality of their fruits . Two factorial designs were assayed 2

@highlight Fresh wash waters are wastewaters of table olive factories.
