 Bisphenol A an endocrine disruptive chemical widely used to manufacture polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins acts via multiple mechanisms that perturb cellular and molecular functions . BPA has the potential to induce hepatotoxicity via generation of ROS and oxidative stress . However the mechanism of BPA induced oxidative stress and autophagy is still ambiguous at molecular and cellular levels . This study aims to elucidate the impact of BPA exposure in primary rat hepatocytes . AMP kinase an intracellular energy sensor and key regulator in cellular signaling were found to be activated during BPA exposure . The increased AMP ATP ratio and subsequent phosphorylation by its upstream mediator Liver Kinase B1 activates AMPK . BPA down regulated AMPK downstream molecule i.e . mammalian target of rapamycin by inhibiting its phosphorylation eventually enhances expression of autophagic markers LC3B Beclin 1 while lowers p62 . Results also revealed that BPA induces mitophagy by promoting accumulation of PINK1 and translocation of Parkin to damaged mitochondria culminating in decreased mitochondrial mass . Ultra structural changes also confirmed mitochondrial disintegration enhanced autophagic induction as evident from autophagosome formation . Findings confirm that BPA caused oxidative stress which eventually triggered LKB1 AMPK mediated autophagy and maintains cellular energy balance by mitophagic removal of unhealthy mitochondria in primary rat hepatocytes .
