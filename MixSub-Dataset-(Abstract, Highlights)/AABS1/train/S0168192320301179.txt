 Mushrooms play a provisioning ecosystem service as wild food . The abundance of this resource shows high annual and interannual variability particularly in Mediterranean ecosystems . Climate conditions have been considered the main factor promoting mushroom production variability but several evidences suggest that forest composition age and growth play also a role .

@highlight Previous year primary productivity NDVI was the best predictor of mushroom yield.
@highlight Fruiting year precipitacion and temperature codetermined mushroom yield.
@highlight Combining remote sensing and climate data we predicted 5575 of mushroom yields.
