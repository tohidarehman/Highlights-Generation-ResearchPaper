 Fallow fields provide suitable habitats for many farmland species in agricultural landscapes . Although the loss of fallow fields in the last few decades may be one of the major causes of the decline in farmland biodiversity quantitative studies investigating the spatial and temporal associations between fallow fields and abundance of rice paddy organisms are few . This study focused on the Greater Painted Snipe

@highlight The loss of fallow fields could have led to the decline in farmland biodiversity.
@highlight We focused on the Greater Painted Snipe found in Asian rice paddies.
@highlight We conducted replicated playback surveys during the breeding season.
@highlight Wet fallow field loss was associated with decline in Greater Painted Snipe density.
@highlight We highlight the importance of fallow fields for farmland bird populations.
