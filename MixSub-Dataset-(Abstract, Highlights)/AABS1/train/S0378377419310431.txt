 During periods of heavy precipitation farmland drainage ditches are the main routes for farmland nitrogen flowing into surface waters in northern China . Vegetated ditches can be engineered to mitigate N loss from agricultural runoff . We used a simulation study to evaluate the interception of nitrogen in a ditch without vegetation and three vegetated ditches . The

@highlight Vegetated ditch can effectively intercept nitrogen in farmland runoff.
@highlight The
@highlight N stable isotope tracer method was used to analyze the fate of vegetated ditch intercepting farmland runoff nitrogen.
@highlight The nitrogen remaining in the
@highlight and
@highlight ditch beds was almost completely absorbed by the plants after 60 d of growth.
