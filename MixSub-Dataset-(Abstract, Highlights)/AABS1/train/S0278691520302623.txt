 The wide use of carbon nanotubes in consumer products i.e . composites coatings food packaging etc raise concerns about the adverse effects that CNTs can induce in humans and environment . Yet there is no global consensus regarding risks that CNTs may pose while controversial evidence exists also on the toxic effects associated with chemical surface modification a prerequisite for their incorporation in different matrices . Moreover there is limited information available about the underlying mechanisms especially when cells interactions with the nanomaterial is assessed by imaging techniques . The present study aims at evaluating the
