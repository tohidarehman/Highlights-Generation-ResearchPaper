 Soil water is a major limitation to high crop production on the Loess Plateau of China . Straw incorporation is often suggested to promote soil water retention and grain production . Despite the rising number of studies on straw application to soil the demonstrated merits for straw with lower C N ratios and varying lengths remain unknown . A five year field experiment was conducted to explore the effect of ammoniated long or short straw incorporated into the soil on soil water storage leaf area index intercepted photosynthetically active radiation PAR

@highlight A new method of straw returning powdered straw with low C N ratio can improve soil water utilization.
@highlight The APSI treatment improved soil water content and promoted maize growth.
@highlight Compared with the CK and ALSL treatments the APSI treatment significantly enhanced maize production.
@highlight APSI is an optimal practice for summer maize in the Loess Plateau of China.
