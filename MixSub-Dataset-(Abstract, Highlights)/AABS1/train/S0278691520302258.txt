 Cinnamyl alcohol was evaluated for genotoxicity repeated dose toxicity developmental toxicity reproductive toxicity local respiratory toxicity phototoxicity skin sensitization and environmental safety . Data show that cinnamyl alcohol is not genotoxic . Data on read across analog cinnamaldehyde provide a calculated margin of exposure 100 for the repeated dose and local respiratory toxicity endpoints . The developmental and reproductive toxicity endpoint was evaluated using the threshold of toxicological concern for a Cramer Class I material and the exposure to cinnamyl alcohol is below the TTC . Data provided a No Expected Sensitization Induction Level of 2900 g cm

@highlight Cinnamyl alcohol a safety assessment based on RIFM s criteria.
@highlight A safety assessment based on 7 human health endpoints plus environmental.
@highlight All endpoints were cleared using target data read across and or TTC.
