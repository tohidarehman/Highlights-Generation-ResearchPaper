 Cigarette smoke is a risk factor for the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease . However the role of mainstream CS in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis remains unclear . During the first or last three weeks of methionine choline deficient with high fat diet feeding each diet group was exposed to MSCS . Hepatic or serum biochemical analysis showed that MSCS differentially modulated hepatic injury in NASH milieu depending on exposure time points . Consistently NASH related hepatocellular apoptosis and fibrosis were increased in the early exposure group but decreased in the late exposure group except for steatosis .

@highlight Exposure to mainstream cigarette smoke affects the severity of NASH.
@highlight NASH severity shows oppositely depending on exposure time points of cigarette smoke.
@highlight Cigarette smoke differentially modulates PPAR and its associated M1 M2 polarization in hepatic macrophages.
