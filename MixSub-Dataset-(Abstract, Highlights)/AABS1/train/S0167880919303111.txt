 Organic management has the potential to mitigate negative impacts of intensive farming on biodiversity . We aimed to determine the effects of management system local habitat conditions and the surrounding landscape on ground dwelling spiders in vineyards . We studied spider species richness abundance and community composition in fifteen pairs of conventional and organic vineyards along a gradient of landscape composition in Germany . In spite of positive effects of organic management on the inter row vegetation and soil organic matter this management system only moderately enhanced species richness of spiders compared to conventional vineyards and did not have the strong positive effects on spider densities known from other cropping systems . Instead due to high densities of the dominant species

@highlight Spider communities were affected by organic management and landscape composition.
@highlight Organic management enhanced spider species richness moderately.
@highlight Unlike other cropping systems organic management did not enhance spider densities.
@highlight The dominant spider
@highlight was enhanced by high cover of other vineyards.
