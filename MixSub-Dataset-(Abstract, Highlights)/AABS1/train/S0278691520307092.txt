 Mercury is a toxic metal well known for its dangerous health effects on human . Butylated hydroxytoluene is a phenolic component generally consumed as a food additive as an antioxidant . However BHT induced antioxidant properties against heavy metals influenced toxicity are little studied . We hypothesized that BHT has a regulatory effect on Hg induced cytotoxicity . The objective of this research was to assess the protecting effects of BHT against inorganic Hg toxicity in PC12cells where cells were treated with without HgCl
