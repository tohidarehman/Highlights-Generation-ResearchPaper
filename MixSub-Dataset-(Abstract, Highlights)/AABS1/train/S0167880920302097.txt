 Ecosystem can offer regulating services to change biodiversity patterns and ecological processes and then affect the prevalence of crop pests . Biological pest control could serve as an environmentally friendly ecological control service to suppress crop pests and decrease pesticide use by maintaining or increasing natural enemies . However few study focus on the explicit process of natural enemies pest dynamics quantitative assessment and maintaining mechanism of ecological control service in multi crop farmland landscape system for the whole crops growing cycle . Here an experimental model of rotation intercropping ecosystem via wheat maize cotton was planned for three consecutive years to response above questions . Our result found the rotation intercropping ecosystem help to increase the abundances of the dominant natural enemy

@highlight The rotation intercropping ecosystem via wheat maize cotton help to increase the dominant natural enemy and then reducted aphid in cotton.
@highlight Quantitative evaluation of pest control by a new built method of Ecological Control Service Index found crop diversity has efficient control.
@highlight The available prey resources and maize as crop habitat are beneficial to maintain the predator natural enemy and ecological control service.
