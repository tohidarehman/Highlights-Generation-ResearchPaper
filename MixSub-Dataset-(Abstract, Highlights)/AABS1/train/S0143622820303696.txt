 The symbiosis of housing and industry is currently regarded to be the key to implement the national strategy of rural revitalization in China . However challenges have emerged in portraying the spatial mismatch pattern of housing and industry development in rural regions from the demographic perspectives accompanying the massive rural urban migration . The measurement of housing industry symbiosis needs to be re examined from a novel perspective . This paper attempts to bridge the gap by proposing two indices for unearthing the symbiotic relationship between housing and industry through the lens of land use . Taking Xuzhou as an example we found that the distribution of rural housing and industrial lands is spatially uneven . And the uneven patterns of housing industry symbiosis vary at different spatial scales . The results also indicate that township level might be a better scalar for the arrangement of rural land . Policies that aimed to promote the symbiotic development of housing and industry in rural Xuzhou and beyond are finally proposed .
