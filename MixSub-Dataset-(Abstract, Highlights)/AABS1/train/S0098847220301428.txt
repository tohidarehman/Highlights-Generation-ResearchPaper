 Heat induced leaf senescence may be regulated by nitrogen or nitrogen enriched amino acids . The objectives of the current study were to examine whether exogenous application of aminobutyric acid proline and ammonium nitrate could alleviate heat induced leaf senescence in creeping bentgrass

@highlight Heat induced leaf senescence was mainly due to acceleration of chlorophyll degradation rather than inhibition of synthesis.
@highlight GABA proline and nitrogen effectively suppressed heat induced leaf senescence.
@highlight Heat induced leaf senescence was suppressed by GABA proline and N which reduced chlorophyll degrading enzyme activities.
