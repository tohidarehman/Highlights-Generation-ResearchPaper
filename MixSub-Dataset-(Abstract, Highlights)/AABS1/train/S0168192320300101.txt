 One of the most widespread consequences of climate change is the disruption of trees phenological cycles . The extent to which tree phenology varies with local climate is largely genetically determined and while a combination of temperature and photoperiodic cues are typically found to trigger bud burst in spring it has proven harder to identify the main cues driving leaf senescence in autumn . We used 905 individual field observations of BB and LS from six

@highlight Among population differences were larger for the date of BB than that of LS.
@highlight Autumn temperature was the main determinant of leaf senescence timing.
@highlight Growing season length was predicted to increase in northern populations.
@highlight Effects of autumn temperature on LS date differed according to BB timing.
