 Stemflow production has been reported to be influenced by a suite of biotic and abiotic factors . Nevertheless relative contributions of biotic and abiotic factors to stemflow production and funneling efficiency were largely unclear due to complex interactions among those factors . In this study stemflow of nine xerophytic shrubs of

@highlight We evaluated the relative contribution of biotic and abiotic factors to stemflow.
@highlight Boosted regression trees associating with partial dependence plots were performed.
@highlight Biotic variables outweighed abiotic variables on contribution to stemflow volume.
@highlight Abiotic variables contributed more to stemflow percentage and funneling ratio.
@highlight Small shrubs were more proficient in funneling stemflow than large shrubs.
