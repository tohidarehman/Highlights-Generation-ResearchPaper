 Background tree mortality is a complex demographic process that affects structure and long term forest dynamics . Here we investigated how climatic drought intensity interacts with interspecific and intraspecific competition in shaping mortality patterns across tree species ranges . To this aim we used data from five European national forest inventories to perform logistic regression models based on individual tree mortality in Scots pine

@highlight Drought intensity more important for beech mortality than neighbourhood competition.
@highlight Scots pine mortality influenced by drought intensity via interaction with competition.
@highlight Across Europe intraspecific competition stronger than interspecific for mortality.
@highlight Mortality in both species is higher in the Mediterranean cool temperate ecotone.
