 Long non coding RNAs are in general described as transcripts 200nt and lacking potential to code for proteins . In the present study 7613 putative lncRNAs were identified in

@highlight Based on
@highlight analysis 7613 lncRNAs were identified in
@highlight Of these 1614 lncRNAs were found to be heat and drought stress responsive.
@highlight Co expression based functional annotation of these lncRNAs was conducted.
@highlight TFs miRNAs and eTMs were studied to understand plant response to abiotic stress.
@highlight Differential expression analysis of lncRNAs was validated by qRT PCR.
