 Specific leaf area is an essential functional trait and indicator for estimating plant strategies in response to environmental changes . Intraspecific and interspecific variations of SLA have been extensively studied whereas the combined effects of soil water content and heat conditions on SLA dynamics have received little attention . Field experiments with different irrigation regimes for maize

@highlight Specific leaf area of maize was not a constant parameter it decreased with effective accumulated temperature.
@highlight Water deficit severely limited maize growth leaf expansion and dry matter accumulation but no expected for specific leaf area.
@highlight Specific leaf area was more affected by the occurrence time of water stress than intensity.
@highlight Soil water content and heat conditions formed a trade off in shaping the dynamic of specific leaf area.
