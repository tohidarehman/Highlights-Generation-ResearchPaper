 Determining the best management practices under different initial soil mineral N levels is helpful to improve water and N use efficiencies and protect the environment . In this study a two year field experiment of spring maize was conducted from 2014 to 2015 in northwest China . Five treatments were designed including one local farmer practice I

@highlight WHCNS model performed well for simulating maize growth water and N dynamics in desert oasis.
@highlight Increasing the irrigation times can reduce N leaching and improve N use efficiency without reducing yield.
@highlight Best management practices were developed under different initial soil mineral N ISMN levels.
@highlight The optimal N application rate decreased linearly with increase of ISMN when ISMN was 384 kg ha
