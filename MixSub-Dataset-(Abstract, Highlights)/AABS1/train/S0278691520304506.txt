 We investigated the effects of perinatal exposure to a glyphosate based herbicide or glyphosate alone on female fertility and the hormonal and uterine milieu during the preimplantation period . F0 pregnant rats orally received a GBH or Gly in a dose of 2mg of glyphosate kg day from gestational day 9 until weaning . F1 females were evaluated to determine the reproductive performance on GD19 and the sex steroid serum levels the expression of estrogen receptor alpha progesterone receptor and implantation related genes on GD5 . GBH and Gly induced preimplantation losses in F1 rats . GBH and Gly groups exhibited higher 17 estradiol serum levels without changes in progesterone . Both compounds increased the uterine ER protein expression with no differences at transcript level and only Gly decreased PR mRNA expression . Also GBH and Gly downregulated

@highlight Glyphosate pure and in formulation increased preimplantation losses in F1 rats.
@highlight Glyphosate pure and in formulation increased serum 17 estradiol in early pregnancy.
@highlight Glyphosate pure and in formulation disrupted uterine implantation related genes.
@highlight Glyphosate pure and in formulation induced similar deleterious effects.
