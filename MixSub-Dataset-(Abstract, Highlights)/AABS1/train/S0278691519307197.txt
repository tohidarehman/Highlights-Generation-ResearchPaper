 One of the most spread group of phenolics are flavonoids . Many studies focusing on the digestion and bioavailability of flavonoids have been carried out . Several possible directions of flavonoid metabolism are suspected and described in the literature . The aim of the present study was to evaluate the bioactivity of 8 flavonoid 3 O and 7 O glucuronides and 7 free aglycones on inflammatory response of PMNs and HUVECs in the context of their fate in humans after oral intake . The present study for the first time compared the activity of several most popular in plant flavonol and flavone aglycones and their beta glucuronides . The results showed that in all

@highlight Flavonoids aglycones were shown as active metabolites at the inflammation site.
@highlight Role of beta glucuronidase in the deconjugation of II phase metabolites was shown.
@highlight Glucuronidated flavonoids have no activity in neutrophils and HUVECs.
@highlight Flavones tuned out to be more active than flavonols.
