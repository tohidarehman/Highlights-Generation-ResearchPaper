 Direct root zone irrigation is a novel subsurface drip irrigation strategy for water conservation . However a comparison with traditional irrigation methods is lacking to better define the potential advantages of direct root zone irrigation . A two year study was conducted to evaluate the performance of

@highlight Direct root zone DRZ subsurface irrigation was compared to surface drip irrigation.
@highlight DRZ irrigation increased crop water use efficiency by 911 and yield by 912 .
@highlight DRZ irrigation alleviated diurnal water stress in grapevines.
@highlight Subsurface water delivery restricted root growth in the upper 60cm soil profile.
@highlight Berry morphology and composition can be regulated by DRZ irrigation rate.
