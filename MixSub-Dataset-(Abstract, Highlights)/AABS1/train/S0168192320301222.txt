 Knowledge concerning the water use characteristics of revegetated species has profound implications for understanding soilplant interaction mechanisms and guiding ecological restoration strategies in water limited ecosystems . Although afforestation is an important way to improve ecosystem functions and services in degraded ecosystems there is limited understanding about the water use characteristics of dominant species within and between different types of plantations . We investigated plant water use characteristics in three representative types of plantations on the Chinese Loess Plateau mixed plantation consisting of three deciduous tree species

@highlight Seasonal water use characteristics in three plantation types were investigated using isotope techniques.
@highlight The plants in the mixed plantation exhibited water source segregation.
@highlight Plantation types affected plant water use characteristics and existed species specific.
@highlight The higher leaf level WUE
@highlight lessened deep soil water depletion in the mixed plantation.
