 The advances achieved during the last 30 years demonstrate the aptitude of the remote sensing based vegetation indices for the assessment of crop evapotranspiration ET

@highlight Spectral vegetation indices VI allow estimate map basal crop coefficients K
@highlight  .
@highlight  VI approaches provide a simple and robust way to assess crop evapotranspiration.
@highlight Good practices for applying and analyzing the K
@highlight  VI relationships are recommended.
@highlight  VI provides spatially temporally distributed information throughout crops cycle.
@highlight Operative platforms combining K
@highlight  VI and soil water balance can support irrigation.
