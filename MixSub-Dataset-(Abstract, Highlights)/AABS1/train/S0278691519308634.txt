 has been used in traditional Indian medical system Ayurveda . However the mechanism underlying the efficacy of the TB extract against oral squamous cell carcinoma is yet to be explored . The present study established a connecting link between the TB extract induced apoptosis and autophagy in relation to reactive oxygen species . Our study revealed that gallic acid in the TB extract possess a strong free radical scavenging capacity contributing towards the selective anti proliferative activity . Furthermore TB extract markedly enhanced the accumulation of ROS that facilitated mitochondrial apoptosis through DNA damage indicating ROS as the vital component in regulation of apoptosis . This effect was effectively reversed by the use of a ROS scavenger N acetyl cysteine . Moreover it was observed to induce autophagy however it attenuated the autophagosome lysosome fusion in Cal33cells without altering the lysosomal activity . Pharmacological inhibitors of autophagy namely 3 methyladenine and chloroquine were demonstarated to regulate the stage specific progression of autophagy post treatment with the TB extract favouring subsequent activation of apoptosis . These findings revealed presence of gallic acid in TB extract below NOAEL value causes oxidative upset in oral cancer cells and promote programmed cell death which has a potential therapeutic value against oral squamous cell carcinoma .
