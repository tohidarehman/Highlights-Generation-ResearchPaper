 Soils of large areas of the globe are affected by deficiency or toxicity of iron making it one of the major limitations to higher productivity of rice . Deficiency of Fe an essential micronutrient for growth and development of rice produces grain with low Fe content . Consumption of low Fe rice causes malnutrition affecting human health . Biofortification is an easy and low cost way to enhance Fe content in rice the staple food of more than half of the global population . Identification of relevant quantitative trait loci and genes controlling the stresses are needed for developing tolerant genotype . Fe deficiency is commonly observed in alkaline and aerobic soils while toxicity is seen in low pH soils of lowland rice ecology . Rice plants cope up under deficiency or toxicity conditions through various morphological physiological and differential gene expression strategies . Rice plant uses various transporter genes like
