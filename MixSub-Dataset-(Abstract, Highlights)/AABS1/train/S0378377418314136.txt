 Effects on the soil water and foxtail millet yield of different fertilizer rates coupled with the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system are unclear which could guide improvements to productivity in dryland farming . We conducted field experiments using RFRHS and traditional flat planting at four different fertilizer rates no fertilizer low N 90 P

@highlight Ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system RFRHS improved soil water and temperature.
@highlight RFRHS stimulated positive interactions between water and nutrients.
@highlight Water use from crop sowing to heading is an evaluation index for RFRHS applicability.
@highlight RFRHS combined with the application of N 180 P
@highlight 90kg kg ha
