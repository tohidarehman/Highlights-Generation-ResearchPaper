 Perfluorooctanoic acid is a persistent and widespread industry made chemical . Emerging evidence indicates that PFOA exposure could be meditated through DNA methylation yet the molecular mechanisms governing the epigenetic states have not been well established . In this study we investigated the epigenetic alterations and inhibitory mechanisms upon PFOA exposure by identifying changes related to DNA methyltransferase with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and stimulated emission depletion nanoscopy in human breast epithelial cells . PFOA exposure at 100 and 200M altered the mobility of DNMT3A and inhibited the enzymatic activity of DNMT resulting in global DNA demethylation . Moreover PFOA significantly altered the heterochromatin organization as noted by the distribution profile of histone 3 lysine 9 tri methylation at 200 and 400M exposure levels with super resolution microscopy . An increased redistribution around the periphery of the nucleus was noted with a more diffused distribution beyond the 200M exposure . Overall exposure of PFOA resulted in DNA demethylation accompanied by altered expression patterns of DNMT1 and DNMT3A . These findings provided new insights on the epigenetic alterations and revealed an altered heterochromatin packaging upon exposure to PFOA implicating a mechanistic mode of action of DNA demethylation through direct impacts on DNMTs and increasing susceptibility to diseases such as cancer .
