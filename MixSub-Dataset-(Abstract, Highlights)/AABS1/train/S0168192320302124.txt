 Nitrogen fertilizers have substantially increased global crop yields around the world during recent decades . Nevertheless the extensive use of N fertilizers at global scale has converted agricultural fertilized soils into an important anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide N

@highlight A high resolution automatic system was implemented for NOx continuous measurements.
@highlight High net consumption rate of NO has been observed for treatments with urea DMPSA.
@highlight Urease and nitrification inhibitors effectively mitigated soil NOx and N
@highlight O emissions.
@highlight Application of inhibitors has been shown to have no significant impact on corn quality.
