 Succession caused by agricultural land abandonment is one of the most serious threats to the biodiversity of non forest ecosystems in Europe . The aim of the study conducted in the Biebrza National Park was to develop a remote sensing method to analyze the process of tree and shrub encroachment into the open peatland area of the Lower Biebrza Basin of 245km

@highlight Remote sensing investigation of succession in the Lower Basin of the Biebrza river.
@highlight Assigning the area covered by trees and shrubs to permanent reference areas.
@highlight Spatial distribution dynamics directions of tree and shrub area changes in time.
@highlight Possible integration of analysis of archived data with those acquired in the future.
