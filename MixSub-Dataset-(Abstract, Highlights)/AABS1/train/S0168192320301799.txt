 Climate warming has induced substantial advances in the onset of vegetation green up in the northern hemisphere during recent decades . To date however the temporal changes in green up date have not been adequately explained by the statistical relationships between green up date and climatic factors posing challenges in the attribution and prediction of phenological change . In this study we thus turned to focus on autumn phenology a critical biotic factor that is likely to affect the subsequent spring phenology of vegetation . Using satellite retrieved start and end of growing season over the period from 1982 to 2015 we examined the association between the EOS and the SOS in the following year in northern middle and high latitudes . Interannual changes in SOS were significantly

@highlight Green up date was related with previous autumn leaf senescence in 36.7 of the pixels.
@highlight Earlier SOS was statistically related with advanced EOS of previous year in boreal region.
@highlight SOS showed a weak negative partial correlation with previous EOS in temperate region.
