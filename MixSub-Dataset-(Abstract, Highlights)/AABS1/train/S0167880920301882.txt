 Nitrogen losses contribute to a series of ecological problems such as non point source pollution and aquatic eutrophication . The effects of tillage practices on N losses in the sloping upland of the Three Gorges Reservoir area was studied by comparing N losses of three conservation tillage practices in a short term field experiment with the conventional one . N losses from plots of the no till and minimum till treatments were less than those from plots of the conventional tillage treatment by 19.03 and 6.33kg N ha

@highlight Leaching is the major way of N loss in the sloping upland.
@highlight Conservation tillage decreases more surface N losses.
@highlight Mulch till increases more subsurface N leaching than no till.
@highlight No till reduces more N losses than mulch till in the TGR area.
@highlight No till prevents N loss better in C poor and N poor soils.
