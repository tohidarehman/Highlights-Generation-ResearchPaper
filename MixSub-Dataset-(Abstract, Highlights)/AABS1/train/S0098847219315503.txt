 A vast interest in plant photobiological responses is growing in both academia and commercial sectors due to rapid developments in electrical lighting technology . Each lighting technology has its own advantages and corresponding applications as well as disadvantages . The advantages of light emitting diodes have been reviewed extensively supporting them as suitable lighting sources to investigate plant photobiological responses . However conventional lighting sources possess some properties that can not be met by LEDs . In this work we provide a different perspective when considering electrical lighting system applications in plant photobiology including wavelength availability longevity spectral reliability and light uniformity . Optical and electrical components are addressed with respect to both laboratory use and greenhouse operations . The latest research findings on how different lighting sources influence the physiology of plants are presented and current challenges for LED technology with respect to plant photobiology are discussed . Electrical lighting systems benefit the plant photobiology field in numerous ways but comprehensive knowledge of external environment factors is required rather than choosing the latest lighting technology .

@highlight Spectral shifting exists in all electrical lighting environment.
@highlight Distinct spectra were observed at 595nm for HPS luminaires.
@highlight External environment factors should be considered when using electrical lighting systems.
