 The environmental light changing such as light spectrum influences the balance of energy metabolism and sex allocation based on plant species . However the molecular mechanism underlying systems energy responses linked to sex differentiation of

@highlight Specific energy responses to LS are triggered in
@highlight gametophytes.
@highlight RLL enhances the energy consumption with inducing male gametophytes.
@highlight BLL contributes to the energy production with inducing female gametophytes.
@highlight We suggest a link between LS induced energy metabolism and sex differentiation.
