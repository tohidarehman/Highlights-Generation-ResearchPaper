 Phylogenetic diversity reflects both community assembly and evolutionary diversification processes . Communities with low phylogenetic diversity might be the outcome of environmental filters favouring the occurrence and or the diversification of lineages from particular clades . This rationale applies for regional assemblages . Here we propose to integrate phylogenetic diversity into paleobotanical studies aimed to reconstruct temporal shifts in plant assemblages in the past . To do so we first compiled a fossil dataset of 619 vascular plant taxa occurring through the Cenozoic in the Iberian flora then we reconstructed their phylogenetic relationships and finally we calculated temporal changes in phylogenetic diversity . The results reveal high phylogenetic diversity in the early Cenozoic followed by an abrupt decline around 40 million years ago and a time interval of lower values during the Oligocene and the Miocene . A decreasing trend of phylogenetic diversity was also detected over the Piacenzian and the Early Pleistocene . Early values of high phylogenetic diversity were not explained by null models and we speculate on putative causes related to climate . Overall we propose to combine paleobotanical and phylogenetic information for detecting evolutionary changes that shaped our biodiversity across relevant geological scales .

@highlight Phylogenetic diversity was high in the early Cenozoic and followed an abrupt decline around 40 million years ago paralleling a remarkable temperature drop.
