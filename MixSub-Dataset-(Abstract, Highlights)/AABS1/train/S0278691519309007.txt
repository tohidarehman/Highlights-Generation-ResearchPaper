 A rapid analytical method for the determination of phenylethanoids content in extra virgin olive oil has been developed . The method intends to address the European regulation EU 432 2012 on health claims which allows to report on the front label of olive oil the positive health effects due to the consumption of this food . The innovative method is based on paper spray tandem mass spectrometry using deuterated standards . It relies on a two step analysis needed to assess the free form of tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol and their ester conjugates after hydrolysis treatment . Different olive oil samples have been analyzed and the classical analytical parameters such as accuracy LOQ and LOD were calculated from fortified samples . The good values of the latters show the reliability of the new approach that limits the time of analysis and sample preparation to few minutes .
