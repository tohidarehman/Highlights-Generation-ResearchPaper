 The boreal biome accounts for approximately one third of the terrestrial carbon sink . However estimates of its individual C pools remain uncertain . Here focusing on the southern boreal forest we quantified the magnitude and temporal dynamics of C allocation to aboveground tree growth at a mature black spruce

@highlight We reconstructed time series of boreal tree growth with a biometric approach.
@highlight Aboveground tree growth was a minor and decoupled fraction of carbon input.
@highlight Partitioned estimates of tree carbon sink are valuable observational constraints.
@highlight Such observational constraints can be used for model validation and policy making.
