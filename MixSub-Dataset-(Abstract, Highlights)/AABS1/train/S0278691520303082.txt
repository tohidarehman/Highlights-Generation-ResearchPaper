 Occupational residential dietary and environmental exposures to mixtures of synthetic anthropogenic chemicals after World War II have a strong relationship with the increase of chronic diseases health cost and environmental pollution . The link between environment and immunity is particularly intriguing as it is known that chemicals and drugs can cause immunotoxicity . In this review we emphasize the relationship between long term exposure to xenobiotic mixtures and immune deficiency inherent to chronic diseases and epidemics pandemics . We also address the immunotoxicologic risk of vulnerable groups taking into account biochemical and biophysical properties of SARS CoV 2 and its immunopathological implications . We particularly underline the common mechanisms by which xenobiotics and SARS CoV 2 act at the cellular and molecular level . We discuss how long term exposure to thousand chemicals in mixtures mostly fossil fuel derivatives exposure toparticle matters metals ultraviolet B radiation ionizing radiation and lifestyle contribute to immunodeficiency observed in the contemporary pandemic such as COVID 19 and thus threaten global public health human prosperity and achievements and global economy . Finally we propose metrics which are needed to address the diverse health effects of anthropogenic COVID 19 crisis at present and those required to prevent similar future pandemics .

@highlight Developmental exposure to environmental factors can disrupt the immune system.
@highlight Long term low dose exposure to chemical mixtures is linked to imunodeficiency
@highlight Immunodeficiency contributes to chronic diseases and the current Covid 19 pandemics.
@highlight Environmental chemicals and microorganisms share similar molecular pathomechanisms AhR pathway .
@highlight Understanding the underlying pathomechanisms helps to improve public health.
