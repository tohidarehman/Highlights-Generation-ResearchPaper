 While shifting disturbance rates and climate change have major implications for the structure of contemporary forests through their effects on adult tree mortality the responses of regenerating trees to disturbances and environmental variation will ultimately determine the structure and functioning of forests in the future . Assessing the resilience of forests to changing conditions requires information on what constrains tree performance during recruitment and whether recruitment dynamics have changed throughout history .

@highlight Disturbances provide opportunities for tree recruitment and canopy replacement.
@highlight We used tree rings to study tree growth during recruitment recruitment duration.
@highlight Disturbance severity and growth history shape individual recruitment responses.
@highlight Tree growth during recruitment is uniquely sensitive to winter climatic conditions.
@highlight Accelerating recruitment dynamics in the Carpathians imply links to global change.
