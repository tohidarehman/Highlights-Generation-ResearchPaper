 Manganese an essential micronutrient has the potential to induce apoptosis . The NT3 TrkC ligand receptor pair known as part of the classic neurotrophic theory plays a critical role in neuronal survival . However whether the NT3 TrkC mediated signaling pathways are involved in Mn induced apoptosis of cortical neurons remains unknown . The present study was designed to investigate the interactions between NT3 TrkC mediated signaling pathways and Mn induced apoptosis in cortical neurons . This study showed that subacute Mn exposure significantly increased the levels of pro apoptotic Bax while decreasing the levels of anti apoptotic Bcl 2 in the cortex compared with the corresponding control . Markedly reduced NT3 and TrkC levels along with decreased Ras MAPK and PI3 Akt signaling in the cortex were observed following subacute Mn exposure . We further found increased levels of Bax cleaved caspase 3 and the total apoptosis rate and decreased levels of Bcl 2 NT3 TrkC and Ras MAPK and PI3 Akt signaling in Mn treated primary cortical neurons . Pretreatment with hNT3 or Z VAD FAM ameliorated Mn induced apoptosis by increasing the levels of NT3 and TrkC and its Ras MAPK and PI3 Akt signaling pathways . Taken together our findings clearly indicate that NT3 TrkC and mediated Ras MAPK and PI3 Akt signaling pathways play a crucial role in Mn induced neurotoxicity .
