 Leguminous green manure crops are important for accumulating nitrogen by means of biological nitrogen fixation and for building up soil fertility in organic arable cropping systems . Whole year green manure crops are also known to deplete the soil weed seed bank

@highlight Whole year leguminous green manure crops can reduce the weed seed bank in subsequent crops.
@highlight Weed seed bank reduction may reach 65 at the time of termination of a green manure crop.
@highlight The legacy effect on the seed bank is still substantial three years after termination.
@highlight Periods with green manure crops can be important for the management of soil fertility and weeds in organic cropping systems.
