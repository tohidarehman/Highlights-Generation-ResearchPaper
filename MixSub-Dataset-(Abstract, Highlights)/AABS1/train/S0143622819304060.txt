 Understanding potential disparities in community compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act will help managers effectively and fairly allocate funding for improving drinking water systems . Environmental justice is experienced at the scale of the individual the household the neighborhood or the water service provider and is too fine grained a scale for spatial analysis with most available state datasets . This research represents an effort to ascertain which spatial analysis method selected to estimate the demographics of water service areas best supports environmental justice analysis at the state scale . To understand whether there are disparities in compliance with the SDWA this study specifically investigated the relationship between socioeconomic status and race as well as other water system variables and violations to the SDWA of community water system in the state of Pennsylvania . The sociodemographic characteristics of the water systems were estimated using three different CWS level spatial analysis methods and a county level spatial analysis method . Negative binomial regression was used to evaluate whether these sociodemographic characteristics and other water system variables including size of the water system ownership and water source are associated with SDWA violations . This research demonstrates that the spatial analysis method selected for an environmental justice study can affect the results and conclusions of the research . Evidence that SDWA violations were associated with race or socioeconomic status was not found however this study did determine that small CWSs and CWSs serving rural areas are less likely to be compliant with the SDWA .

@highlight Spatial analysis methods in environmental justice research can significantly affect results.
@highlight Conclusive evidence of disparities in SDWA violations by race or SES was not found.
@highlight Small and rural community water systems are likely to have more SDWA violations.
