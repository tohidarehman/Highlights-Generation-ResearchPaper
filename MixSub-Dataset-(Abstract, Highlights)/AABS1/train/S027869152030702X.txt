 The nitrate content of the most consumed green leafy vegetables in the European Region of the Canary Islands was determined . The sampling included chard and watercress which are not regulated but highly consumed in this region . The levels of nitrates in organic vegetables were significantly higher than those of conventional cultivation . However no seasonal differences were observed and overall nitrate levels were lower than those reported in other studies . Median nitrate levels in the analyzed vegetables were lettuce 573.7mg kg ready to eat salad mixes 595.0mg kg spinach 1044.2mg kg arugula 3144.2mg kg watercress 450.5mg kg and chard 1788.4mg kg . In general the nitrate levels of watercress and chard were significantly higher than those of regulated vegetables with similar culinary uses . The average per capita daily intake of nitrates through regulated vegetables was 17.532.5 of acceptable daily intake . On the contrary the consumption of unregulated vegetables in this archipelago represents a similar or even higher percentage of ADI . We therefore consider that the establishment of maximum limits of nitrate by the EU regulatory authorities would be appropriate for chard and watercress and similar to those set for spinach .

@highlight In general lower levels of nitrates than in other studies probably due to climatic conditions.
@highlight Higher levels of nitrates in organically grown vegetables.
@highlight Higher levels of nitrates in unregulated vegetables watercress and chard than in similar regulated ones.
@highlight Average nitrate intake through regulated vegetables represents 17.4532.48 of the ADI.
@highlight Average nitrate intake through unregulated vegetables represents 23.6244.29 of the ADI.
