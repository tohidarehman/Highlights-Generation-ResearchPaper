 An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of irrigation cut off strategies on yield components water productivity and gas exchange in drip irrigated hazelnut trees during two consecutive growing seasons . The experimental design was completely randomized with four ICO treatments and four replicates per treatment based on threshold values of the midday stem water potential

@highlight Effect of irrigation cut off ICO strategies on yield components in hazelnut.
@highlight Effect of ICO strategies on water productivity WP and gas exchange in hazelnut.
@highlight Four ICO treatments were applied during the stage III of the kernel growth.
@highlight Yield and gas exchange decreased as the ICO was increased.
@highlight WP increased as the ICO was increased.
