 Viticulture is a valuable sector worldwide with an extraordinary socio economic impact in Spain . Numerous pests and diseases threaten vineyards and their management primarily relies on the use of conventional agrochemicals . The current paradigm of sustainability pursues the implementation of ecologically sound strategies in vineyard ecosystems . The use of cover crops is arising as an alternative with numerous benefits including favoring above belowground biodiversity and the presence of beneficial soil organisms such as the entomopathogenic nematodes . We hypothesized that the use of specific cover crops in vineyards might enhance the natural occurrence and activity of EPNs by modulating the assemblage with associated organisms . We performed the experiments in an ongoing experimental vineyard

@highlight Cover crops might enhance entomopathogenic nematodes EPN presence in vineyards.
@highlight More EPNs and higher activity observed in spontaneous cover SPO than tilled TIL .
@highlight Lower presence of EPN natural enemies in SPO than TIL treatments.
@highlight The cover crops seeded SEE and flower driven FLO produced alteration on EPN assemblage.
@highlight SPO covers could be a promising strategy to support EPN in Mediterranean vineyard.
