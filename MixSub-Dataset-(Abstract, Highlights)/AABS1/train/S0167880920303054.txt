 Litter decomposition is a key process of nutrient cycling in ecosystems and has been studied in a wide range of grasslands including the steppes on the Mongolian Plateau . However information is hardly available on the responses of grassland litter decomposition to different land use types especially if the litters produced from grazing or mowing grasslands have home field advantage in decomposition . In a five year field experiment examining the effects of land use types on grassland ecosystems in central Inner Mongolia we determined the litter decomposition rate and quality indicators of three dominant steppe plants

@highlight Litter from grazing grassland had the highest decomposition rate.
@highlight All litter types showed greater decomposition rate in enclosed than used grasslands.
@highlight Litter decomposition rate is positively correlated with soil moisture in habitat.
@highlight No home field advantage in litter decomposition across grassland use types.
