 Freeze thaw cycles where temperatures fluctuate above and below 0C are the cause of elevated stem pressures that drive sap flow from within the sugar maple . This temperature dependency has historically limited the production of maple syrup to select regions of North America . The plantation method of sap harvesting now raises the possibility of a New Zealand based maple syrup industry . In this study a transient 2D heat transfer model was developed to predict freeze thaw events in trees and thereby evaluate potential plantation locations based on their climate . The heat transfer phenomena which have been modelled are bulk thermal diffusion diffusion across discrete wood layers convection infrared radiation and solar radiation . Through experimental validation the model was found capable of predicting temperatures in real life trees with high accuracy . Sensitive parameters were the bark absorptivity and sapwood diffusivity . Simulation results also indicate that the frequency of freeze thaw cycles increase dramatically in saplings as compared to mature trees making maple syrup production potentially viable in locations that would otherwise fail when using traditional methods .

@highlight Numerical model is consistent with experimentally measured tree temperatures.
@highlight Frequency of freeze thaw cycles increases with decreasing stem diameter.
@highlight Plantation method a promising strategy for maple syrup production in mild climates.
