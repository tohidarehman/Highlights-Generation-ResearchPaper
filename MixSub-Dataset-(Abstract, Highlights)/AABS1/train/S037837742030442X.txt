 In recent years more recognition is given to the benefits and risks of private smallholder irrigation development across sub Saharan Africa . It is acknowledged for its capacity to adapt to local circumstances and challenges . This study assesses the heterogeneous character of private smallholder irrigation in the challenging environment of southern arid Zimbabwe where family farms operate along sand river aquifers forming a reliable natural storage of shallow groundwater . It investigates the drivers characteristics obstacles and adaptive capacity of this yet undocumented form of private irrigation in a historically marginalised area and in particular also the discontinuation of these informal irrigation ventures . The research combines results from analysing satellite images and quantitative and qualitative field work whereby a social ecological system perspective is applied .

@highlight Private smallholder irrigation is practised along sand rivers in arid Zimbabwe.
@highlight It emerges from various crises instead of market opportunities.
@highlight Many families discontinue when they reach the limit of their adaptive capacity.
@highlight Others succeed but do not pass the level of subsistence farming.
@highlight This study adds to understanding the diversity of private smallholder irrigation.
