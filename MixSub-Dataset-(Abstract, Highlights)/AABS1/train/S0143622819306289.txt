 Analysis of movement patterns at fine temporal scales may suggest how animals interact with their surrounding habitat . This is particularly useful in determining not only where animals may spend their time but when and how likely they may be to interact with or utilize specific habitat resources . While previous studies demonstrate various methods seeking to address this concern most apply for a single individual or a single point pair in a trajectory . However for practical conservation concerns information on animal habitat interactions should be considered at the group level . This paper applies two approaches from movement analysis the probabilistic voxel based space time prism and the comprehensive probability surface to construct utilization distributions corresponding to specific intervals in time . Utilization distributions are processed towards summary quantification of diel habitat interaction probabilities for multiple individuals . We evaluate this approach using primary tracking data collected from Black skimmers

@highlight A time geographic approach was applied to satellite tracking data for Black Skimmers in the western Amazon Basin.
@highlight Habitat availability and utilization were explored using a time geographic framework.
@highlight Results assist conservation practitioners in scheduling time and location for observation efforts.
@highlight Results suggest space use patterns for animals from trajectory data and remotely sensed landcover.
