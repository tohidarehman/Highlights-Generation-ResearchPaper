 The role of anthocyanin accumulation in poinsettia leaves exposed to photo oxidative stress was evaluated by comparing green and reddish leaves co occurring in poinsettia

@highlight Foliar anthocyanin accumulation is an advantage to photo oxidative stress.
@highlight Anthocyanin well equipped leaves triggered a better ROS scavenging system.
@highlight Foliar anthocyanins contribute to a lower excitation pressure 1 
@highlight  at PSII.
@highlight Anthocyanin well equipped leaves possess a higher antioxidant enzymatic activity.
@highlight Foliar anthocyanin accumulation results in higher antioxidant non enzymatic content.
