 A subchronic toxicity study were conducted in Wistar Han RCC rats to evaluate the potential health effects of genetically modified drought tolerant wheat MGX11 10 . Rats were fed a rodent diet formulated with MGX11 10 and were compared with rats fed a diet formulated with its corresponding non transgenic control Jimai22 and rats fed a basal diet . MGX11 10 and Jimai22 were ground into flour and formulated into diets at concentrations of 16.25 32.5 or 65 w w and fed to rats for 13 weeks . Compared with rats fed Jimai22 and the basal diet group no biologically relevant differences were observed in rats fed the GM diet with respect to body weight gain food consumption efficiency clinical signs mortality ophthalmology clinical pathology organ weights and gross and microscopic pathology . Under the conditions of this study the MGX11 10 diets did not cause any treatment related effects in rats following at least 90 days of dietary administration as compared with rats fed diets with the corresponding non transgenic control diet and the basal diet group . The MGX11 10 diets are considered equivalent to the diets prepared from conventional comparators . The results demonstrated that MGX11 10 wheat is as safe and wholesome as the corresponding non transgenic control wheat .

@highlight Evaluate the subchronic oral toxicity of genetically modified MGX11 10 wheat.
@highlight MGX11 10 wheat diets did not produce any adverse effects in rats during the study.
@highlight MGX11 10 wheat are considered as safe and nutritious as the non transgenic wheat.
