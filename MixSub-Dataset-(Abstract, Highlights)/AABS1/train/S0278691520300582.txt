 Food product labels can provide consumers with rich specific expert certified product information . However sources of label information differ . How do consumers then evaluate label trustworthiness of expert labels in comparison to other commonly used label types We present results from a representative online survey of consumers in Japan the USA Germany China and Thailand using professionally designed labels for four food types and five different sources of food information . We tested label legibility through identification of the label information source and asked respondents to evaluate the trustworthiness of labels using a six scale instrument ranging from overall label trust to purchase intent . Results show that label legibility varied between countries with expert labels scoring lowest . Nevertheless respondents correctly identifying all label information sources chose expert labels as the most or second most trustworthy across all countries and food types while consumer labels scored low . Demographic factors exhibited weak influence . Results suggest expert labels might play an important role as trusted sources of information in an increasingly complex global food system . Finally we consider the implications of the study for a potential institutionalization of expert labels based on the Japanese context .
