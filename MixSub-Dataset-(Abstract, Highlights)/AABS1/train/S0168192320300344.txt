 Climate exerts a major influence on crop development and yield . Despite extensive modelling efforts there is still considerable uncertainty about the consequences of a changing climate for the yields of major crops . Existing crop models are complex and rely on many assumptions and parameters motivating a quest for more parsimonious models with stronger theoretical and empirical foundations . This paper presents a prototype of such a model for wheat informed by measurements of gross primary production biomass and yield at research sites across the wheat growing regions of China . First GPP was predicted using a recently developed first principles model driven only by climate carbon dioxide CO

@highlight A novel simply formulated crop model successfully predicts wheat yields in China.
@highlight The model captures the temporal and spatial variations in GPP biomass and yield.
@highlight A predicted positive response of yield to CO
@highlight counteracts negative thermal response.
