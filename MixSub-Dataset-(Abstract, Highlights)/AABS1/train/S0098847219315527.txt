 Alkali stress is an important limiting factor for agricultural production . The aim of this study was to investigate whether old and young leaves have different biochemical responses to alkali stress in hexaploid wheat and to provide molecular dissection of these differential responses on the basis of proteomic profiling . Under alkali stress hexaploid wheat accumulated higher concentrations of Na

@highlight Proteomics data are based on newly released reference genome of common wheat.
@highlight Under alkali stress old leaves programmatically degrade proteins and ribosomes through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway.
@highlight Alkali stress influences the translation of homoeologous genes in hexaploid wheat.
