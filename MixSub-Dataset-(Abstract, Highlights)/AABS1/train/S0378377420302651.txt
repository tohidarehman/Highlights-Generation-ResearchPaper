 Although soil moisture sensor based automated irrigation systems enable researchers to grow plants efficiently and quantify drought stress via constant control of volumetric water content growers in practice typically irrigate plants using excessive amounts of water based on their own experience . Herein we investigated the effects of four different irrigation strategies on the growth physiological responses and phenolic content of sweet basil

@highlight We examined how irrigation level and pattern affect sweet basil growth and quality.
@highlight Similar irrigation levels but different patterns altered basil phenolic content.
@highlight Maintaining constant VWC promotes higher yield and quality than fluctuating VWC.
