 Human milk oligosaccharides are indigestible carbohydrates representing the third largest fraction of solutes in human breastmilk . They provide valuable prebiotic and anti pathogenic functions in breastfed infants but are not yet included in most infant formula products . Recent biotechnological advances now facilitate large scale production of HMOs providing infant formula manufacturers with the ability to supplement their products with HMOs to mimic human breastmilk . Although the safety of individual HMOs has been confirmed in preclinical toxicological studies the safety of HMO mixtures has not been tested . We therefore performed bacterial reverse mutation and

@highlight The human milk oligosaccharides 2 FL 3 FL LNT 3 SL and 6 SL are usually found together in human breast milk.
@highlight Mutagenicity studies and a subchronic toxicity study were conducted of a blend of these five HMOs HMO MIX I .
@highlight Bacterial reverse mutation and
@highlight micronucleus tests showed negative results.
@highlight No changes related to the test item were observed in rats fed on a diet containing 10 HMO MIX I.
@highlight Our results support the safety of HMO MIX I for inclusion in infant formula and as general food ingredient.
