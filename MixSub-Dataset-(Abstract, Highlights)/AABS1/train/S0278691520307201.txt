 Recently mycotoxins safety in Chinese post fermented teas has attracted much attention because it is still controversial whether environmental fungi in the teas are able to produce aflatoxins . In this study a rapid and selective analytical method based on immunoaffinity column cleaning coupled with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was developed to quantify four aflatoxins B
