 Aridity has increased in recent decades in the Mediterranean Basin and is projected to continue to increase in the coming decades . We studied the consequences of drought on the concentrations stoichiometries and stocks of carbon nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in leaves foliar litter of a three dominant woody species and soil of a Mediterranean montane holm oak forest where soil water content was experimentally reduced for 15years . Nitrogen stocks were lower in the drought plots than in the control plots 8.811.01kg ha

@highlight Aridity has increased in the Mediterranean Basin and is projected to continue rising.
@highlight We studied the C N P and K stocks in a
@highlight forest after 15years of drought.
@highlight We observed an ecosystem drop of soil and canopy C and N stocks.
@highlight C and N stock losses were larger for the dominant tree than for the dominant tall shrub.
@highlight The results suggest changes in forest structure with increasing drought.
