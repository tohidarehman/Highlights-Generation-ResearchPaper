 Precipitation use efficiency the ratio of aboveground net primary productivity to annual mean precipitation is a key indicator for assessing the differential response of the water and C cycles to environmental change . Although the alpine grassland of the Tibetan Plateau is sensitive and vulnerable to climate change a generalized pattern of PUE along the water and heat availability gradients is still unavailable . Here a transect survey was conducted across grasslands on the TP to measure ANPP in the community and further explored the patterns of PUE along aridity index gradients with

@highlight Along aridity index gradients a unimodal pattern of precipitation use efficiency in alpine grasslands was observed.
@highlight Precipitation use efficiency is increased with the increasing precipitation and soil nutrients.
@highlight Compared with climate factors soil nutrients dominate precipitation use efficiency.
@highlight Plants probably via losing water resource to absorb more soil nutrients in humid environments.
