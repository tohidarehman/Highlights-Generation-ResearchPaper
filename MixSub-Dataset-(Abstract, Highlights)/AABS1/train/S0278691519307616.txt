 Outbred male rats were repeatedly injected intraperitoneally two level sub lethal doses of lead acetate and or cadmium chloride solutions 3 times a week during 6 weeks . The animals developed explicit even if moderate subchronic intoxication characterized by a large number of indices both common to both metals and lead specific . Special attention was paid to hemodynamic and electrocardiographic effects . The combined action of lead and cadmium was modeled with the help of the Response Surface Methodology to obtain additional support for the previously substantiated postulates of combined toxicity s typological ambiguity . This is dependent on which particular effect comes under consideration on its level and on the acting dose ratio . For one and the same toxic combination the type of combined toxic action can vary from synergistic to contra directional . In particular the actions of lead and cadmium on blood pressure were found to be opposite in direction .

@highlight Rats repeatedly injected IP with Pb acetate and or Cd chloride developed outcomes either common to Cd and Pb or Pb specific.
@highlight For the first time hemodynamic and electrocardiographic effects of this toxic combination was studied.
@highlight Causal association of many features with Cd or Pb impact was confirmed by their correlation with blood metal level.
@highlight For one and the same toxic combination the type of combined toxicity can vary from synergistic to contra directional.
@highlight Many toxic effects of the combination genotoxicity included were attenuated by background administration of bioprotectors.
