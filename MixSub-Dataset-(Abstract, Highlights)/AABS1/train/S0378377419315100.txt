 The assessment of hydrologic ecosystem services associated with flood irrigation in the western United States is particularly limited by a lack of data about return flows . Return flows the portion of applied water that returns to adjacent surface and groundwater hydrologic systems during flood irrigation may provide wildlife habitat recharge aquifers and supplement late season baseflows . To improve understanding about variability in the timing and volume of return flows to improve management and policy decisions associated with different irrigation management techniques our study used an agricultural water balance that combined hydrologic geophysical and meteorological tools . We directly measure key components of the water balance and quantify error and uncertainty on a 100 ha portion of the Bear Creek watershed in the Upper Wind River Basin of Wyoming . Over the course of a single irrigation season with average precipitation we found that of the 1 133 000 m

@highlight 29 of irrigation water and precipitation returned to surface water 18 went to storage 20 went to riparian ET and 23 went to ET from hay crops.
@highlight 18 of return flows occurred after the cessation of irrigation more than the median of 14 across comparable studies.
@highlight Decoupling of return flow quantity timing comparatively lower total return flows 29 corresponded with higher late season flows 18 .
@highlight Flood irrigation via measured return flows supports three key hydrologic ecosystem services soil water storage riparian vegetation and late season baseflow.
@highlight Underscores potential for both benefits and tradeoffs in local and regional alterations to irrigation management in the intermountain west.
