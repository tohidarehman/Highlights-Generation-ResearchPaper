 This study investigated a low external input sustainable agriculture rice production system in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley that applied ecological principles to create waterbird habitat and enhance soil fertility . Two production sites were selected for this study . Each production site applied a flooded treatment and a fallow treatment to select fields during the non growing season . Bird fecal matter inputs and soil microbial bacteria activity and nutrient content were quantified and compared between fields . Significantly more total nitrogen total carbon microbial richness and activity were found in flooded LEISA than other study fields . Bird fecal matter inputs on LEISA flooded fields contributed an estimated 6.148.9 kg N ha season whereas 1.914.8 kg N ha season were added to conventionally flooded fields . Long term application of the unique LEISA rice farming system can reduce the need for synthetic fertilizer application by

@highlight More bird activity was observed on flooded rice fields than non flooded rice fields.
@highlight Fecal matter input from birds correlated to enhanced soil fertility.
@highlight Bird fecal matter can potentially replace 13 of nitrogen fertilizer application.
