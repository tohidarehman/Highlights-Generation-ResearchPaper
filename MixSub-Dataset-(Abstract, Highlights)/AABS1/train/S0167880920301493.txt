 Sustainable intensive agriculture requires enhanced nitrogen use efficiency and reductions in nitrogen leaching losses . To investigate if organic farming systems have potential to achieve this a comparison between conventional and organic arable farming was carried out over a two year period . Two differently managed specialized organic arable crop rotations semi

@highlight the superiority of arable conventional or organic crop rotations regarding N leaching depends on the functional unit used.
@highlight organic arable crop rotations reduced the nitrate leaching loads per area significantly.
@highlight production related N leaching was 50 lower in the conventional system.
@highlight all crop rotations exceeded the critical N load with respect to the EU Nitrate directive threshold.
@highlight integrated approaches which include crops with high N uptake efficiency in late autumn are needed to fulfill EU standards.
