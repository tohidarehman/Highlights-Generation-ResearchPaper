 Silicon is one of the most abundant elements in the Earths crust but its role in governing the biogeochemical cycling of other elements remains poor understood . There is a paucity of information on the role of Si in wetland plants and how this may alter wetland C production and storage . Therefore this study investigated Si distribution nutrient stoichiometry and lignin abundance in

@highlight is efficient in taking up silica Si storing the biogenic Si BSi and releasing Si thus playing a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycling of Si in wetlands.
@highlight BSi can substitute lignin as a structural component due to their similar eco physiological functions reduces costs associated with lignin biosynthesis.
@highlight BSi accumulation increased total biomass C storage and BSi changed the composition and quality of litter substrates.
@highlight Competing processes of carbon cycles i.e. biomass quantity vs quality can be influenced by Si cycling in wetlands.
