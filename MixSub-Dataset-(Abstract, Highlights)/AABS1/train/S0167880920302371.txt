 The impact of agriculture on biodiversity depends on the extent and types of agriculture and the degree to which agricultural land contrasts with the natural ecosystem . Most research on the latter comes from studies on the influence of different agricultural types within a single ecosystem with far less study on how the natural ecosystem context shapes the response of biodiversity to agricultural production . We used citizen science data from agricultural areas in Canadas Eastern Hardwood Boreal and Prairie Pothole regions to examine how ecosystem context shapes the response of avian species diversity functional diversity and abundance to the amount of arable crop and pastoral agriculture at landscape scales . Avian surveys were conducted along 8km transects of Breeding Bird Survey routes with land cover assembled within a 20km

@highlight Continent wide study on effects of agriculture in forest and prairie ecosystems.
@highlight Greater biodiversity loss with higher contrast of agricultural and natural land cover.
@highlight Functionally redundant species lost first as agriculture expands.
@highlight Numerical compensation following species loss in both ecosystems.
