 Aggregation affects soil properties crucial for sustainable soil management and productivity . However longer term studies of treatments to enhance soil aggregation such as addition of biochar with labile carbon to derive microbial binding agents are limited especially in temperate climates . To fill this gap we established a field experiment with control compost only biochar only and a mixed compost biochar application at low and high application rates 970 t ha

@highlight Compost outperformed biochar in improving productivity relevant soil properties.
@highlight Longer lasting positive effect of biochar on organic carbon under field condition.
@highlight Particulate organic matter showed strongest qualitative and quantitative response.
