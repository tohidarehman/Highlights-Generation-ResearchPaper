 Deoxynivalenol a trichothecene mycotoxin has attracted global attention due to its prevalence and substantial effects on animal and human health . DON induces the upregulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species by disrupting the normal mitochondrial functionality which causes oxidative stress cell apoptosis and even severe disorders . The aim of present work is to develop a simple convenient and

@highlight A simple convenient and
@highlight method for monitoring ROS and evaluating DON mediated oxidative stress was developed.
@highlight The QDs nanoprobe was successfully applied for imaging ROS in living cells.
@highlight ROS production tended to be saturated and the oxidative stress was the most severe when DON concentration exceeded 10ppm.
@highlight The developed nanoprobe is also beneficial for early screening for other toxic and harmful substances.
