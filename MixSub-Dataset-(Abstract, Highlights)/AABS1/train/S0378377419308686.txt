 Recent studies have shown that the permanent wilting point is influenced by soil properties and plant drought tolerance mechanisms . This study was designed to evaluate the soil matric potential at which the biological wilting point BWP

@highlight Classic permanent wilting point concept of plants was investigated.
@highlight Wilting of plants results from a complex interaction between soil and plant conditions.
@highlight Wilting matric potential threshold across the various species and cultivars is not uniform.
@highlight Barley plants were more sensitive to water deficits than wheat plants.
@highlight Plant wilting could be expected at lower matric potentials for clayey than for sandy soils.
