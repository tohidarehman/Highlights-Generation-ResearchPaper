 The widespread use of neonicotinoids has increased the risk of non point source pollution . Previous studies mainly focused on neonicotinoid transport by runoff on gentle slopes and ignored the role of sediment . Neonicotinoid migration due to erosion could be underestimated because a considerable amount of sediment migration is caused by erosion on steep slopes . Here we focused on the transport of two typical neonicotinoids imidacloprid and clothianidin via runoff and sediment in new citrus orchards on steep slopes . The total runoff from the bare land biological crust and

@highlight The risk of IMI and CLO retained in topsoil is the main cause of on site pollution.
@highlight Runoff and sediment are the main mode for IMI and CLO contamination off site.
@highlight Plants mitigate soil erosion and non point source pollution.
