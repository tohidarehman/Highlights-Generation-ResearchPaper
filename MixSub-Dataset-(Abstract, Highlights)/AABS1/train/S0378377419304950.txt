 Water shortage caused by large variations in the amount frequency and timing of rainfall during the crop cycle is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting crop production . In this context environmental variability represents a significant challenge for farmers as optimal management practices vary from season to season . The aim of this study was to optimize wheat

@highlight Optimizing wheat management considering rainfall patterns and variability is critical.
@highlight Generally LF performed better than EF cultivars due to a higher yield potential.
@highlight In dry years EF reduce water uptake early in the cycle compared to LF cultivar.
@highlight Sowing date has no clear impact on yield under early water stress environments.
