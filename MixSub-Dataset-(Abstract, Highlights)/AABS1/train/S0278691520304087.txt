 Anticoagulant rodenticides are widely used for rodent control in agricultural and urban settings . Their intense use can sometimes result in accidental exposure and even poisoning of livestock . Can milk eggs or meat derived from such accidently exposed animals be consumed by humans Data on the pharmacokinetics of chlorophacinone in milk of accidently exposed ewes were used to estimate the risk associated with its consumption . Three days after accidental ingestion chlorophacinone was detected in plasma of 18 ewes with concentrations exceeding 100ng mL in 11 animals . Chlorophacinone was detected in milk on day 2 post exposure and remained quantifiable for at least 7 days in milk of these 11 ewes . Concentrations in milk were much lower than in plasma and decreased quickly . This study demonstrated dose dependent mammary transfer of ingested chlorophacinone . Variation in prothrombin time on Day 3 suggested that some of the ewes that ingested chlorophacinone may have been adversely affected but PT did not facilitate estimation of the quantity of chlorophacinone consumed . Using safety factors described in the literature consumption of dairy products derived from these ewes after a one week withdrawal period would pose low risk to consumers .

@highlight Accidental chlorophacinone ingestion by dairy ewes led to its dose dependent mammary transfer.
@highlight Residue levels in milk were low and decreased rapidly t
@highlight  2 days .
@highlight Estimated withdrawal period for human consumption of milk was about 6 days.
@highlight Risk to humans consuming this milk was seemingly low even in a worst case scenario.
