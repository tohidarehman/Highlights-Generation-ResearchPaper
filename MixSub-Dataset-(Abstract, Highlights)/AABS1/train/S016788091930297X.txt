 It is well recognized that soil tillage practice and straw returning treatment redistribute carbon in soil and promote the bacterial biomass and diversity . Yet to date the relative impact of soil tillage practice and straw returning on C in soil different fractions and bacteria community composition remains to be tested . The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of long term cultivation practices and conventional tillage and crop straw returning on dissolved organic matter aggregate fraction and bacteria community composition in a 12 year olds rice rice rapeseed rotation system . The study included four different cultivation methods

@highlight Straw returning with no tillage practice improve C and N content in soil organic matter fraction under rice rice rapeseed rotation system.
@highlight Soil bacteria community composition was significantly altered by straw retuning practice with no tillage practice.
@highlight Soil dissolved organic matter and macroaggregate were closely associated with bacterial community in the rice rice rapeseed rotation system.
