 Grapevine is a widespread crop for grape and wine production often cultivated on hilly areas . Moderate vine water stress plays an important role in determining high quality viticulture . However a precise quantification of the effect of hydraulic properties and slope gradient on hilly soil water balance and consequently on vine stress has not yet been addressed in the literature . The slope gradient effect is generally taken for granted without providing experiments validating such a qualitative assumption . We tested the hypothesis that soil hydraulic properties play a greater role than slope gradient in driving soil water status and vine stress . In two consecutive years we studied an Aglianico vineyard grown along a 90m slope with up slope soil having lower water holding capacity than down slope . Up slope vines were more stressed as shown by lower leaf water potential stomatal conductance leaf CO

@highlight Soil of a hilly rainfed vineyard had different hydraulic properties along the slope.
@highlight More stressed up slopevines had better grape wine quality than down slope vines.
@highlight Hydrus 2D 3D model quantified slope and hydraulic properties effects on vine stress.
@highlight Hydraulic properties rather than gradient predominated in soil vine water balance.
