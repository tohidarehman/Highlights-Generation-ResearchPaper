 The conversion of natural vegetation into cultivated land can cause pollinator declines and thereby degrade pollination services to crops and wildflowers . The effect of landscape composition on pollinator abundance is well established but its impact on pollination intensity and crop yield is not fully resolved . We therefore studied pollination of two crops in India brinjal

@highlight We predict fairly abrupt thresholds in the relationships between crop pollination service and the amount of surrounding natural vegetation cover.
@highlight Pollination service by bees diminished strongly as the proportional natural vegetation cover in surrounding crop fields fell below a threshold.
@highlight Our modelling provides a basis for landscape scale management to prevent pollination limitation in bee attractive crops.
