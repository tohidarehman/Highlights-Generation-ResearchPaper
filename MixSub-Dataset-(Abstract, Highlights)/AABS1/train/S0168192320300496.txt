 The potential of urban greenspaces in regulating temperature is widely known however in the heterogeneous urban landscape the process and the magnitude of human thermal comfort as well as the cumulative effects of natural and built surfaces are not yet well understood . We selected two ecologically contrasting species

@highlight Human thermal comfort PET under different tree species have been investigated.
@highlight Eco physiological and bio meteorological data were measured across the city.
@highlight Tree species with higher leaf area index showed better below canopy surface cooling.
@highlight Along with higher tree transpiration they provided better PET reduction.
@highlight Cluster tree planting design provided better PET even they reduced the tree growth.
