 Furan is a liver toxicant and carcinogen that occurs in heat processed foods . Due to its volatility analysis of furan in food does not provide reliable estimates of exposure . Biomarker based approaches offer the opportunity to more accurately assess human exposure but a correlation between concentrations of potential biomarkers of furan exposure and external dose has not been established .

@highlight Assessment of human exposure based furan content in food is unreliable.
@highlight The relationship between furan exposure and potential biomarkers of furan exposure was established in the rat model.
@highlight Adducts of
@highlight  2 butene 1 4 dial with glutathione and lysine were quantified in rat urine using LC MS MS.
@highlight Urinary furan metabolites were excreted in a dose related manner.
@highlight The study provides experimental support for biomarker based approaches to monitor human exposure to furan.
