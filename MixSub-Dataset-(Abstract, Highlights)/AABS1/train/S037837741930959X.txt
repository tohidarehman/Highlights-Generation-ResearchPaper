 Crop selection in irrigated conditions entails characterization of crop water use and productivity dynamics under limited freshwater availability in a changing climate and environment . There is ample scope to optimally irrigate row crops given the associated economic returns under full irrigation and relatively non alarming groundwater declines to require limited irrigation at least in many parts of the United States including Nebraska . However a fair and careful comparative assessment of cereal row crops for their efficiency of water use and associated metrics under optimal growth conditions is lacking . We conducted field research in semi arid south central Nebraska during 20162018 to comprehensively characterize water use and productivity dynamics in four major C3 and C4 and sorghum crops under consistent and well managed conditions . Crop specific signatures were found in seasonal profiles of total soil water and soil water depletion . The highest seasonal total evapotranspiration ET
