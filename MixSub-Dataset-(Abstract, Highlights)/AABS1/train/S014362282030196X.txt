 Noise is a pervasive environmental stressor that has adverse impacts on people s mental health . However past studies on the relationship between individuals chronic noise exposure and psychological stress were inconclusive partly due to their ignorance of the role of individual mobility and the temporality of the exposure effect relationship . This study examines how individual mobility and temporality influence the relationship between noise exposure noise annoyance and psychological stress . An approach combining geographic ecological momentary assessment and portable noise sensors is used to collect real time data from a sample of residents in Beijing China . Using structural equation modeling the study found that noise annoyance mediates the association between noise exposure and psychological stress in real time . Further participants reported divergent psychological stress levels in locations other than their residences and workplaces . Compared with the home locations recreational and commercial places are noisier but less stressful while participants tend to experience higher levels of noise and annoyance during travel . In addition the cumulative effect of noise exposure on stress decreases in magnitude over time but stays significant within 3h of the exposure . The results suggest that health impact assessments should take into account people s real time noise exposure and psychological responses to noise .

@highlight Noise exposure and psychological stress are measured by portable sensors and Geographic Ecological Momentary Assessment.
@highlight Noise annoyance fully mediates the association between noise exposure and psychological stress in real time.
@highlight Individuals are exposed to varying noise levels and report divergent stress levels in locations other than residences.
@highlight The psychological effects of noise exposure are immediate cumulative and dispositional from the long to short term.
