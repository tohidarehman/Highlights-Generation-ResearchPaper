 Moisture and nitrogen deficiency are major determinant factors for cereal production in arid and semi arid environments . The ability to detect stress in crops at an early stage is crucially important if significant reductions in yield are to be averted . In this context remotely sensed data has the possibility of providing a rapid and accurate tool for site specific management in cereal crop production . This research examined the potential of hyperspectral and broad band remote sensing for predicting maize properties under nitrogen and moisture induced stress . Spectra were collected from drip irrigated maize subjected to various rates of irrigation regimes and nitrogen fertilization . 60 spectral vegetation indices were derived and examined to predict maize yield and other properties . Highly significant correlations between maize crop properties and various vegetation indices were noticed . RVI and NDVI were found to be sensitive to maize grain yield in both tested seasons . C
