 Extensive areas of agricultural land have been abandoned to ecological restoration in recent years in the karst region of Southwest China which contributes to the greening of the area . However there has yet no direct observation of carbon water and energy fluxes on abandoned land in the region . In addition because of the coupling between above and below ground processes monitoring of the karst ecosystem needs to be conducted from a critical zone perspective . In this study an integrated vertical observation system through air vegetation soil cave continuums was constructed on abandoned farmland under natural restoration in Puding Karst Ecosystem Research Station . Preliminary results show that First vegetation cover restored rapidly after abandonment and the measured net ecosystem exchange soil CO

@highlight Natural restoration can recover vegetation rapidly on abandoned farmland in the karst region of southwest China.
@highlight Carbon water and energy fluxes show significant variation between rainy season and dry season.
@highlight High carbon exchange capacity between the atmosphere and plant soil cave continuums.
@highlight CO
@highlight emission through cave ventilation cannot be neglected in the carbon budget.
