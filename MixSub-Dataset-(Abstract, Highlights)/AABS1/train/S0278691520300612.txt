 We attempted to identify cellular mechanisms as an approach to screen chemicals for the potential to cause developmental neurotoxicity . We examine in SH SY5Y cells whether apoptosis and oxidative stress via reactive oxygen species generation caspase 3 7 activation gene expression alterations and necrosis by release of cytosolic adenylate kinase underlie direct effects of the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and alpha cypermethrin . We also determined transcriptional alterations of genes linked to neuronal development and maturation . Our results indicate that cyfluthrin and alpha cypermethrin have the ability to elicit concentration dependent increases in AK release cellular ROS production caspase 3 7 activity and gene expression of apoptosis and oxidative stress mediators . Both pyrethroids caused changes in mRNA expression of key target genes linked to neuronal development . These changes might reflect in a subsequent neuronal dysfunction . Our study shows that SH SY5Y cell line is a valuable
