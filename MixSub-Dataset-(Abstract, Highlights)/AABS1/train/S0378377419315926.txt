 The increasing demands of the population and the need for development obliged the optimal use and adaptive management of the watershed resources . Accordingly it is necessary to adopt comprehensive measures to reach sustainable development goals . This objective can be achieved by the application of interdisciplinary and professional approaches through establishing dynamic and optimal balance in supply and demand resources . However such important optimization approaches have been rarely practiced at the watershed scale . The present study has been therefore formulated to apply a linear water energy food nexus optimization for the Shazand watershed Markazi Province Iran . This approach was applied for planning 14 crops planted in orchard irrigated farms and rain fed farms between 2006 and 2014 and targeting water energy food nexus index maximization . The connections among the water energy and food were then evaluated through determining the amount of consumption mass productivity and economic productivity of water and energy . The results of WEFNIs revealed that almond has the highest WEFNI with values of 0.92 0.76 0.76 0.83 0.86 0.86 0.87 0.87 and 0.88 . Whilst potato with WEFNI of 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.06 0.09 0.10 and 0.11 sugar cane with WEFNI of 0.10 and cucumber with WEFNI of 0.13 had the lowest scores and the corresponding lowest performance among the study crops . The outcomes of optimization study explained that the current situation of land use in the Shazand Watershed is unsuitable to minimize water and energy consumption and maximize benefit . The results can be used as an effective tool for designating proper soil and water resource management strategies in the region .

@highlight Water Energy Food Nexus Index WEFNI was developed at watershed scale in Iran.
@highlight WEFNI was applied as an important approach to improve optimal cropping pattern.
@highlight The development of horticultural crops was recommended for the Shazand watershed.
