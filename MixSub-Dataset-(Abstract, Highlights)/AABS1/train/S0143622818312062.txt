 Land use changes in the tropics under the pressure of population growth have attracted wide attention . In this study the riparian area with more settlements was selected to explore the land use temporal spatial characteristics of the less developed Lake Tanganyika region . The study methods employed mainly included land use transition matrix kernel density estimation grid and buffer analysis of the ArcGIS software and remote sensing image processing . The changes of land use mainly reflected in the transformation between different land types among which the conversion from forestland into arable land constituted the major event . Though the land use change rate was not so significant for the whole region dramatic changes occurred around the towns especially in the northern area . It was found that a circle of arable land of about 6km in width and more than 40 arable land density composed the farming hinterland of the major towns . Moreover with the forest transition theory the change trends of land use and their influencing factors were analysed . The findings in this study should be helpful for the land use simulation and planning in similar riparian areas . For better understanding the dynamic of land use change a future additional in depth study at extensive spatial and temporal scale is appealed .

@highlight The land use changes in the riparian area of Lake Tanganyika were investigated.
@highlight Data within 10km around the lake from 2001 to 2011 were analysed.
@highlight The conversion of forestland into arable land was the highest.
@highlight The arable land and forestland changes fluctuated with the distance from settlements.
@highlight The findings may facilitate land use simulation and planning in riparian areas.
