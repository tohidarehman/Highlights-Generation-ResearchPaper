 Crop rotation of flooded rice with an upland crop like maize on previous continuous paddy soils is an emerging cropping system in South China . A four year experiment was conducted at a research area in Hunan province having a long history of double paddy rice cropping throughout the year . Maize was introduced as an upland crop in rotation with paddy rice thus providing two parallel cropping systems i.e . the previous flooded rice rice and the new maize rice rotation systems . We used three treatments in both cropping systems namely farmers practice as a control straw addition and biochar addition . The straw and biochar were added to soil in late rice season on an equal C input basis 3000kg C ha

@highlight SOC and grain yield was measured with biochar and straw addition in maize rice vs rice rice system.
@highlight Straw addition has no effect on SOC accumulation for both cropping systems over a 4 year periods.
@highlight Biochar significantly improved more SOC in rice maize system than rice rice system.
@highlight Higher SOC under rice maize system with biochar addition were linked increased soil aggregation.
@highlight Both biochar and straw addition led to higher late rice yield.
