 The enhanced two step floating catchment area method is a popular measure of the spatial accessibility of healthcare such as general practitioner services . However the key step of defining appropriate GP and population catchment sizes is often overlooked . Applications of E2SFCA methods use a range of catchment sizes most of which are arbitrarily defined due to a lack of real world data to inform this decision . The use of inappropriate catchment sizes may under or over estimate spatial accessibility in some areas . In this paper patient enrolment data is used to determine appropriate GP and population catchment sizes in the Waikato central North Island region of New Zealand . A range of thresholds were tested including 100 95 90 85 75 and 65 percent of enrolled patients . Initial results suggest that catchment sizes vary across rural and urban areas . Further incorporating variable data driven population catchments recognises patient travel patterns and appears to improve spatial accessibility results in a mixed urban rural context although further modification may be necessary . This study has demonstrated an effective approach to defining appropriate GP and population catchments for use with the E2SFCA method where access to patient enrolment data is available .

@highlight An approach to defining catchment sizes using enrolment records is proposed.
@highlight Catchment sizes vary with rurality and differ from default catchment sizes.
@highlight A case study illustrates the impact on accessibility in a mixed urban rural context.
@highlight Data defined catchments may improve FCA spatial accessibility results.
@highlight Service defined and population defined catchments affect results differently.
