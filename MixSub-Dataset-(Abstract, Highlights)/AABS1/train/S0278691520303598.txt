 . Ethyl 3 methylthiopropionate was evaluated for genotoxicity repeated dose toxicity reproductive toxicity local respiratory toxicity phototoxicity photoallergenicity skin sensitization and environmental safety . Data from read across analog methyl 3 methylthiopropionate show that ethyl 3 methylthiopropionate is not expected to be genotoxic . The repeated dose reproductive and local respiratory toxicity endpoints were evaluated using the Threshold of Toxicological Concern for a Cramer Class I material and the exposure to ethyl 3 methylthiopropionate is below the TTC . The skin sensitization endpoint was completed using the Dermal Sensitization Threshold for non reactive materials 900g cm

@highlight Ethyl 3 methylthiopropionate a safety assessment based on RIFM s criteria.
@highlight A safety assessment based on 7 human health endpoints plus environmental.
@highlight All endpoints were cleared using target data read across and or TTC.
