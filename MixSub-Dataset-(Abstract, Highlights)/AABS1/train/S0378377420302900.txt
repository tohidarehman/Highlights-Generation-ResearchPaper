 In large parts of the Netherlands surface water quality does not meet the chemical and ecological standards as indicated by the EU Water Framework Directive . The largest exceedances were found in areas with greenhouse horticulture flower bulbs fruit trees and ornamental trees . Several regulations have been implemented to improve water quality in greenhouse areas leading finally to a target for zero emission of nutrients by 2027 in soilless cultivation and rules to minimise losses in soil bound cultivation . In addition to that an obligation exists to remove plant protection products from drain water by 2018 onwards . For soilless cultivation a Zero Liquid Discharge system gives the best options to reach these goals . For soil bound cultivation the situation is more complicated and a combination of tools and measurements to help the farmer to tune irrigation to crop demand is most promising . These approaches will lead to a substantial decrease in losses of nutrients and PPPs to surface water . However it is uncertain whether this will lead to the desired reduction in emissions and the water quality standards of the WFD in 2027 . Obstacles might be problems with soil bound cultivation leakages in soilless cultivation and sodium limitations in certain crops .

@highlight Soilless Zero Liquid Discharge approach can reduce emissions seriously.
@highlight Remaining obstacles are leakages and sodium accumulation in certain crops.
@highlight Soil bound combination of management tools and measurements to reduce emissions.
@highlight Groundwater seepage will be an obstacle to achieve emission goals for soil bound.
