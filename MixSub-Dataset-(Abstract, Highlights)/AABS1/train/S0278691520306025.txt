 Lipopolysaccharide is the key factor in various intestinal inflammation which could disrupt the epithelial barrier function . Deoxynivalenol a well known mycotoxin can induce intestinal injury . However the combined enterotoxicity of LPS and DON has rarely been studied . In this study IPEC J2 cell monolayers were exposed to LPS and nontoxic dose DON for 12 and 24h to investigate the effects of DON on LPS induced inflammatory response and tight junction variation and specific inhibitor and CRISPR Cas9 were used to explore the underlying mechanisms . Our results showed that nontoxic dose DON aggravated LPS induced cellular inflammatory response reflecting on more significant changes of inflammatory cytokines mRNA expression higher protein expression of NOD like receptor protein 3 and procaspase 1 . Moreover nontoxic dose DON aggravated LPS induced mRNA and protein expression decreased and distribution confused of tight junction proteins . We found that DON further enhanced LPS induced phosphorylation and nucleus translocation of p65 and expression of LC3B . NF B inhibitor and CRISPR Cas9 mediated knockout of LC3B attenuated the effects of combination which indicated nontoxic dose DON aggravated LPS induced intestinal inflammation and tight junction disorder through activating NF B signaling pathway and autophagy related protein LC3B . It further warns that ingesting low doses of mycotoxins may exacerbate the effects of intestinal pathogens on the body .
