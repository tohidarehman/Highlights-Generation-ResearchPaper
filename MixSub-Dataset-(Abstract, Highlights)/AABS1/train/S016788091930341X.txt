 Stabilised nitrogen fertilisers with nitrification and urease inhibitors have been proposed to abate greenhouse gas emissions in agrosystems . Nevertheless differences in their application and in the management of water and nitrogen rates make it difficult to evaluate their actual utility . The aim of this study was to analyse the possibility for GHG emissions reduction in a 3 year rotation by substituting the traditional split urea application to maize by a single side dress application of stabilised urea fertiliser . The experiment was performed in 24 drainage lysimeters in two contrasting soil types under efficient irrigation practices and adjusted N rates under Mediterranean conditions . Nitrous oxide N
