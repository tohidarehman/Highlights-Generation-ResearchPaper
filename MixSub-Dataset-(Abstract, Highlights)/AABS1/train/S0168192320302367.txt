 Forest ecosystems greatly affect the global carbon budget . Because subtropical regions typically have wet and dry seasons that are likely to differ in their effects on soil respiration our estimates of carbon dioxide CO

@highlight soil respiration rate SRR was measured for 10 years in a subtropical forest.
@highlight Total precipitation had positive impacts on cumulative CO
@highlight emission in dry season.
@highlight Fine root was the crucial factor contributing to the SRRs in different seasons.
@highlight Cumulative CO
@highlight emissions were positively correlated with microbial and root biomass.
