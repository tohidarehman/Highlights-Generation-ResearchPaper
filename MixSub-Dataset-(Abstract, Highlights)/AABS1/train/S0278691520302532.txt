 A comprehensive toxicokinetic analysis of citrinin revealed interspecies differences for all toxicokinetic parameters and in absolute oral bioavailability . Oral bioavailability for CIT was complete for broilers while ranging from 37 to 44 in pigs . CIT was more rapidly absorbed in pigs T

@highlight Toxicokinetic characteristics of citrinin showed species dependency.
@highlight Citrinin was completely absorbed in broiler chickens but incomplete in pigs.
@highlight The elimination half life for citrinin was lower for broilers compared to pigs.
@highlight Similarities and differences in toxicokinetics of ochratoxin A were described.
