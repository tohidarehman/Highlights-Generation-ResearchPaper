 This study was designed to examine fetal and maternal toxicity of curcumin loaded lipid core nanocapsules prepared with poly as a polymer administered during the organogenesis period . Free CURC and CURC loaded LNC blank LNC and saline were administered per oral route from the 7 to 13 gestational day . Dams were evaluated daily for body weight gain clinical signs water and food intake . On 20 GD dams were euthanized organs were weighed and blood was collected for biochemical determinations . Fetal biometrics and external morphological anomalies were assessed . Also were performed histopathological analysis of placenta and measurement of cytokines levels in placental and fetal liver tissues . All groups did not cause changes in dams during the pregnancy . Furthermore treatments did not cause external morphological changes and delayed fetal development . Still for histopathological analysis of placental tissue treatments did not cause alterations in evaluated parameters . For cytokines levels CURC and C LNC caused a decrease in placental levels of TNF . Therefore we have demonstrated that C LNC did not cause toxicological effects in the same manner as pattern bioactive compound proving to be a promising nutraceutical delivery system for maternal supplementation with CURC .
