 Cyclic electron flow around photosystem I is an important photoprotective mechanism mediated mainly by PGR5 PGRL1 proteins and the chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase complex . Here chemical inhibition of PGR5 PGRL1 or NDH dependent CEF was performed to determine their roles in preventing photoinhibition in tomato leaves under low night temperature stress . Experimental treatments were with either antimycin A or rotenone to inhibit PGR5 PGRL1 or NDH dependent CEF respectively . The results showed that net photosynthetic rate

@highlight PGR5 PGRL1 dependent CEF plays an important role in the response to low night temperature stress in tomato leaves.
@highlight PGR5 PGRL1 dependent CEF induces NPQ via lumen acidification to protect the donor and acceptor side of PSII.
@highlight PGR5 PGRL1 dependent CEF protects the donor side of PSI under low night temperature stress.
@highlight PGR5 PGRL1 dependent CEF enhances ROS scavenging by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes and affects the expression of genes encoding key photosystem complex proteins and antioxidant enzymes.
