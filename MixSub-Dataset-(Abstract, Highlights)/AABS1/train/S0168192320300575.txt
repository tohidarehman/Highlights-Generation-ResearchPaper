 As water scarcity becomes more acute in many parts of the world crop modeling tools that effectively simulating crop response to deficit irrigation strategies to help investigate management improvement are needed . Identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the crop models with different growth engines are therefore of great importance . The objective of this study was to investigate the capability and improvements of the new version of a solar energy driven crop model in simulating water consumption and yield of hybrid seed maize under different soil water conditions and its comparison with a water driven crop model . Data obtained from a 4 year field trial on maize grown under different irrigation treatments at Wuwei Northwest China was used for this assessment . These models were calibrated and validated using measured daily evapotranspiration leaf area index aboveground biomass yield harvest index and soil water content . Daily ET was measured using a combination of an eddy covariance system sap flow sensors and micro lysimeter cylinders . The ability of DSSAT CERES Maize using the two different ET options i.e . Priestley Taylor Ritchie and FAO 56 Penman Monteith was analyzed . The results showed that DSSAT CERES Maize with the PT approach had fair agreement with measured daily ET of maize under non water stress condition R

@highlight The strengths and weaknesses of DSSAT CERES Maize and AquaCrop were identified.
@highlight DSSAT CERES Maize with the two evapotranspiration ET options was tested.
@highlight DSSAT CERES Maize was inferior to handle ET simulation with drought than AquaCrop.
@highlight DSSAT CERES Maize showed greater potential to simulated maize yield than AquaCrop.
@highlight Both crop models had greater uncertainties under severe drought conditions.
