 Agricultural fertilization plays a crucial role in crop production and the fungal communities catalyze transformation of soil nutrients in support of crop production . However it remains controversial about the optimal strategy for fertilizer inputs and the adaptive mechanisms of fungal communities across China . By using seven long term field fertilization experiments in China we analyzed crop yields soil properties and fungal communities in soils that were treated for 25 years with no fertilizer inorganic fertilizers and organic inorganic fertilizers . Long term NPK resulted in significant acidification up to a decline by 1.20 pH units while NPKM prevented acidification and increased pH up to 6.39 in three acidic soils with pH 5.70 . NPKM increased crop yields by 1.198.72 folds in acidic soils being significantly higher than NPK . Specific saprotroph
