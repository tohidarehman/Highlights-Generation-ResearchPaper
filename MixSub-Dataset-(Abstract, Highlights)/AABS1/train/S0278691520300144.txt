 The extensive use of doxycycline in aquaculture results in drug residue violations that negatively impact human food safety . This study aimed to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for doxycycline to predict drug residues and withdrawal times in grass carp

@highlight Cardiac output and organ weights of grass carp were determined.
@highlight A PBPK model of doxycycline in grass carp was developed for food safety assessment.
@highlight The withdrawal times were estimated based on sensitive parameters identified at 24 or 1008h.
@highlight The model provides a basis for extrapolation to other fish species and other tetracyclines.
