 The use of photovoltaic energy in irrigation is increasing its relevance as energy source in irrigated agriculture . The main reason relays on its economic and environmental benefits compared to traditional options . To reduce economic materials and energy requirements of PV irrigation systems its design and dimensioning should be optimal . In this work we developed the model MOPISS focussed on the selection of pipe diameters and PV plant dimensioning optimizing jointly the investment cost and operation of the system . MOPISS developed in MATLAB integrated a customized version of the Non dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm with two objective functions aimed at searching the optimal sizing of the irrigation network and PV plant . The results showed a series of solutions with optimal hydrants grouping in sectors pipe diameters and PV plant size . MOPISS was applied to a real case study obtaining solutions which satisfied 96 of the irrigation requirements while saved cost between 22.9 and 38.2 over the total investment cost compared with the original design . MOPISS is a useful tool to produce optimal designs of sizing new PV irrigation system under a comprehensive approach that considers crop water and energy availability and network layout .
