 Permafrost on the Tibetan Plateau is controlled by high elevation and the complex hydrothermal processes and energy balance on the ground surface . To successfully model or map permafrost distribution it is necessary to parameterize near surface air or land surface temperatures T

@highlight Differences between near surface air and ground surface temperature were quantified .
@highlight Relation of ground surface temperature and surface characteristics was analyzed .
@highlight Hourly and daily ground surface temperature are positively related to NDVI .
@highlight Active layer thickness is negatively related to NDVI.
