 Plant hormone brassinosteroids have multiple important functions in plants . They have also been found to exhibit anti tumor anti angiogenic and anti proliferative activity . The experimental part of this article describes the effects of BR biosynthetic precursors on prostate cancer cells . The experiments were performed with LNCaP and DU 145 prostate cancer cell lines . These were cultivated and treated with tested BRs in different concentrations and time intervals . The tested compounds were found to affect cell viability nuclear receptor expression cell cycle and apoptosis in the tumor cells . IC

@highlight Biosynthetic BR precursors have effects on prostate cancer cells and indicate potential use in cancer drug development.
@highlight Tumor cell viability was most effectively inhibited by cathasterone and 6 oxocampestanol with a broad therapeutic window.
@highlight The impact of BRs on the nuclear receptors for steroid hormones was manifested by a change in their expression.
