 Water pollution is a global challenge undermining economic growth as well as the physical and environmental health of billions of people . With the exception of polar caps the world s largest freshwater reserve is found underground but human activities such as agricultural livestock urban or industrial can affect its quality . The aim of this work was to carry out a study on the chemical quality of groundwater in the region of A Limia and to evaluate its possible degradation by anthropogenic influence . Water samples were taken from 76 private wells and 26 natural sources in the region . The presence and levels of anions were analyzed by ion chromatography whereas trace metals were measured by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer . More than half of the wells analyzed and three natural sources showed nitrate contamination and some samples exceeded the limit allowed by legislation for other elements and compounds . It could be inferred that this surface aquifer contamination could be attributed to intensive agriculture and livestock farming .

@highlight Well waters in A Limia show nitrate contamination in more than half of the analyzed samples.
@highlight Contamination could be attributable to the leaching of the fertilizers and the excess of livestock waste.
@highlight The compounds gradient was Nitrate Chloride K Ca and Sulphate Mg and Phosphate the rest.
@highlight Most sensitive area of underground waters quality in A Limia river basin was mainly in the South East.
@highlight This is expected to have consequences for prioritisation of preventive and remedial interventions.
