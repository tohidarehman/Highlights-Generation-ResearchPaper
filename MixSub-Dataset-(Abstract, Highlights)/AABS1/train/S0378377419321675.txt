 Under conditions of water shortage utilizing unconventional waters such as treated urban wastewater and or seawater in combination with soil amendments such as zeolite can reduce the harmful effects of drought stress on crop yield . To investigate the agronomic and physiological effects of a mix of water qualities and soil treatments on sorghum a randomized split plot research was conducted at Gharakheil agricultural research station Ghaemshahr Northeast Iran . Six combinations of water qualities and three different use of soil amendments were tested over two seasons in 2016 and 2017 . The water quality treatments with increasing salinity included well water as the control 75 well water and 25 seawater 25 well water and 75 seawater 100 treated urban wastewater alternating with 100 seawater 50 seawater and 50 treated urban wastewater and 100 treated urban wastewater . The soil amendments were no zeolite as the control and calsic and potasic zeolite . With increasing salinity the forage yield decreased significantly . Maximum and minimum forage yield were respectively 129.6ton.ha

@highlight Soil amendments combined with treated urban waste water increase sorghum yield.
@highlight Combining urban wastewater with seawater reduces drought stress on sorghum yield.
@highlight Combining treated waste water with zeolite increases the water use efficiency.
@highlight Forage yield is negatively affected by increasing salinity of irrigation water.
@highlight Contribution of seawater should be maximum 50 to guarantee optimum yields.
