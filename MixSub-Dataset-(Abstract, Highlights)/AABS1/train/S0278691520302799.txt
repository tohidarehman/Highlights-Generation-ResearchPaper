 The oral route by ingestion of water and food contaminated with cyanotoxins is the main route of exposure to these toxins . This study addresses for the first time the bioaccessibility of some of the most common Microcystins and Cylindrospermopsin simultaneously in raw and steamed mussels spiked at 250ng g fresh weight of each cyanotoxin after an

@highlight Bioaccessibility of MC LR RR YR and CYN is studied in mussels simultaneously.
@highlight Cyanotoxins degradation has been evaluated by an
@highlight digestion model.
@highlight MCs seem to be more sensitive than CYN after cooking and digestion processes.
@highlight After cooking and digestion processes bioaccessibility values drops to 22 .
