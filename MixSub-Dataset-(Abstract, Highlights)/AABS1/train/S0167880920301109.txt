 The adverse impacts of agriculture on water quality have been well documented and the practical measures required to mitigate excessive losses of nutrients and fine sediment have been demonstrated to be effective at plot to field scales . Evaluating the long term cumulative impact of measures is challenging however and the evidence for tangible water quality benefits at a catchment scale is limited . The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Catchment Sensitive Farming partnership a voluntary pollution reduction scheme in England that between 2006 and 2018 provided advice to 19 776 farm holdings covering 34 of the total farmed area in England . Water quality data from 110 river monitoring sites in catchments ranging from 11 km

@highlight Delivering advice to farmers improves water quality in meso scale river catchments.
@highlight Detectable benefits for fine sediment and dissolved phosphorus take three years.
@highlight Water quality responses to reduced pollutant loading are site specific.
