 Large reservoirs of organic carbon store in deep soils are not usually included in regional and global terrestrial C inventories . Chinas Loess Plateau which has the worlds deepest loess deposit and has experienced long term intensive agricultural and revegetation activities could contain large stores of OC . In this study the distribution of OC concentration and stock across the entire loess profile from the ground surface down to the bedrock was assessed at five sites under three land use types . There was pronounced decrease in mean OC concentration with increasing depth along loess profiles at all the investigated sites . OC concentration in the topmost 20 m of the loess was much higher and fluctuated more significantly than that in the deeper layers at YL CW FX and AS where mean annual precipitation was 550 mm . In contrast OC concentration was low and stable at SM with mean annual precipitation 450 mm . The restoration of vegetation with deep roots following the abandonment of farmlands resulted in deep OC accumulation at YL and AS whereas natural grassland recovery did not result in the accumulation of OC at SM . Our results suggested that land use change could alter OC distribution in deep soils of which degree depended on climatic condition and vegetation type . The estimated OC storage varied significantly across the sites 8595044 Mg ha

@highlight High variations in OC exist in the top 20 m loess layer in semi humid regions.
@highlight Low and stable pattern of OC content exist in loess profiles in semi arid regions.
@highlight and
@highlight plantations on farmlands enhance deep OC accumulation.
@highlight The effect of land use on deep OC depends on climate and vegetation type.
@highlight The underestimation of deep OC pool needs re consideration in C budget studies.
