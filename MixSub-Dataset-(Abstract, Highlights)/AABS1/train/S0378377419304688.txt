 In intensive agricultural systems irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer are the most important factors that influence crop production and N losses . This work aimed to evaluate the N best management practices using the calibrated and validated Decision Support System for Agro technology Transfer model for maize wheat barley sunflower and alfalfa in the Violada Irrigation District to reduce the impact of N losses on irrigation return flows quality . In total 59 farmers field plots were investigated from 2014 to 2017 crop seasons distributed in the different soil types in the VID in order to assess the current and optimum N fertilization and the combined irrigation and N fertilization management practices . Considering the whole cultivated crop area in each soil type of the VID and comparing with the current N fertilization results showed that the optimum N management could reduce the NO

@highlight Nitrogen use efficiency is low in intensive irrigated areas under Mediterranean conditions.
@highlight Optimum nitrogen fertilization could reduce total nitrate losses by 49 .
@highlight Combined best management practices could reduce nitrate leaching by 86 .
@highlight DSSAT identified the main soils and crops nitrogen polluters in the VID.
@highlight DSSAT model is a useful tool to assess sustainable agriculture.
