 The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 4 phenoxyphenylboronic acid an effective inhibitor of YUCCA enzyme on mild moderate and severe Cd stress induced responses in the root tips of young barley seedlings . While mild and moderate Cd stresses increased severe Cd stress decreased the root IAA level . PPBo post treatment strongly inhibited the Cd induced IAA accumulation without affecting the Cd level in roots and mitigated the mild Cd stress induced root growth inhibition root swelling and lipoxygenase and glutathione peroxidase activity . In addition PPBo reduced the H

@highlight Mild Cd stress induces auxin synthesis and accumulation in the barley root tip.
@highlight Cd induces IAA synthesis via indole 3 pyruvic acid biosynthesis pathway.
@highlight IAA is involved in both root growth reorientation and defense response activation.
@highlight Both H
@highlight and NO act downstream of IAA in root responses to mild Cd stress.
@highlight On the contrary severe Cd stress reduces IAA level in the barley root tip.
