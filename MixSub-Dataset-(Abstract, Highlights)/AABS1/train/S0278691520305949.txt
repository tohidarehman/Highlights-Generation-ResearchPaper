 In the last few years nanomaterials are widely used sorbents for the extraction of heavy metals in food samples . The nanomaterials have a larger surface area and show high selectivity fast adsorption capability and high efficiency for food contaminants . Carbon nanomaterials magnetic nanoparticles nano imprinted polymers nano based metal organic frameworks and silica nanoparticles are most prominent nanomaterials used in the preconcentration and determination of heavy metals . The most popular sorbent based techniques for the extraction of heavy metals are solid phase extraction and solid phase microextraction . The use of these nanomaterial sorbents increases the extraction efficiency of both techniques . This review summarizes the nanomaterial sorbents used in solid phase extraction and solid phase microextraction for heavy metals extraction in food .
