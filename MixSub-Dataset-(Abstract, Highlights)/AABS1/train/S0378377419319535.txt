 Considering the challenges faced by current agricultural industry such as less cultivable land lack of soil nutrient value limited water resources low yield and fruit quality . Biochar application was found effective way to improve soil physical properties consequently yield and quality of tomatoes . Biochar at three levels B0 B1 and B2 with three levels of drip irrigation quantity full irrigation T1 1.4 pan evaporation

@highlight Biochar application reduced soil bulk density increased soil porosity and improved soil 3 phase composition.
@highlight The interaction between Irrigation quantity and biochar has no obvious effect on the soil solid phase.
@highlight The application of biochar can improve the yield and quality of tomato under full irrigation and severe water deficit.
