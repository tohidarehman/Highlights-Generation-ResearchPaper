 Crocin a water soluble carotenoid is known as a pharmacologically active compound particularly for its potent anti oxidant activity . The present work provides a comprehensive review of the available literature concerning the anti inflammatory properties of crocin in various organs systems as well as its anti nociceptive effects . PubMed Scopus and Web of Science electronic databases were systematically searched up to 28 March 2020 to detect all relevant preclinical and human studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta analyses statement . In total 104 studies were included for qualitative synthesis . This systematic search and review indicated that crocin not only combats reactive oxygen species production and suppresses pro inflammatory cytokines secretion but also alleviates inflammation in various organs in a series of animal models and

@highlight Crocin anti inflammatory function involves suppression of MAPK and NF kB but activation of Nrf2.
@highlight Crocin decreases secretion of TNF IL 6 IL 10 IFN and IL 1 in vitro in vivo and reduces TNF and IL 17 in humans.
@highlight Suppression of MAPK and Wnt5 catenin signaling mediates crocin pain killing effects.
@highlight Crocins anti inflammatory anti nociceptive effects are promising and warrant further testing in clinical settings.
