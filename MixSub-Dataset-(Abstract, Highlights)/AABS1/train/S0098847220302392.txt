 Increases in frequency and magnitude of drought and heat events are the prime abiotic constraints which cause considerable adverse effects on maize kernel set and grain yield . However there is little information about a comprehensive and systematical understanding to identify the critical stage in the response of kernel numbers per spike to individual and combined drought and heat stress around flowering . Here we evaluated three successive phases of kernel set under drought heat and combined drought and heat stress with two maize hybrids using the field site ponds covered with a rain shelter in 2018 and 2019 . As an average in two years KNS was reduced by 18.9 in DS treatment 10.8 in HS treatment and 37.2 in DHS treatment compared with the control treatment . The most considerable adverse impacts during the three phases were all observed in DHS treatment followed by DS and HS treatments . Among the three phases the impact of stress on seed setting was more substantial than that in the other two phases for both hybrids . Kernel abortion was the main reason for the decrease in KNS due to the stress which resulted from the prevention of sugarstarch conversion . The starch content in the kernel was reduced by 42 in DS treatment 29 in HS treatment and 58 in DHS treatment on the 8th day after silking . This finding would supply a reference for breeders to evolve strategies in developing stress resilient and high yielding hybrids under climate change .
