 In the last years several satellite based models using measured or forecast meteorological data have been developed for determining spatially distributed crop evapotranspiration ET

@highlight ArcDualK
@highlight model was used for deriving spatially distributed crop evapotranspiration.
@highlight Comparison of ArcDualK
@highlight performance using measured and forecast weather data.
@highlight Slight evapotranspiration overestimates due to weather forecasts inaccuracies.
@highlight Resulting crop coefficients values reflect the irrigation strategies in the field.
