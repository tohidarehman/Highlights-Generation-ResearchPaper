 Acrylamide is one of the important products of the Maillard reaction . AA hepatotoxicity is related to inflammation which can be indicated by the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome . In this study AA activated NLRP3 inflammasome and released a large number of inflammatory factors in HepG2 cells . AA induced oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress responses in HepG2 cells accompanied by the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway . When HepG2 cells were pretreated with ROS and ERS inhibitors separately the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was inhibited . The MAPK signaling pathway was inhibited when OS and ERS were blocked . HepG2 cells pretreated with MAPK selective inhibitors led to the inhibition on the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome . Overall we consider that AA induces the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome through the OS and ERS mediated MAPK signaling pathway in HepG2 cells .

@highlight The NLRP3 inflammasome was activated by Acrylamide in HepG2 cells.
@highlight The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome induced by Acrylamide via OS and ERS mediated MAPK pathway.
@highlight Acrylamide evoked an increase in the level of proinflammatory cytokines.
