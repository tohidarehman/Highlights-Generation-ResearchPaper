 Solitary bees serve as important native pollinators of wild plants and crops . Several species of bees which form strong populations in open habitats of European landscapes nest in empty snail shells . In the present study we focused on shell nesting bees in near natural habitats neighbouring almond orchards near the town Lleida in north east Spain . We performed a series of manipulative experiments which aimed to elucidate the importance of empty shells of four common large and medium sized gastropod species for nesting bees in near natural and ruderal habitats surrounding the almond orchards . We also matched these data with findings of bees in naturally occurring shells at each examined site . All study sites consisted of habitats with naturally present shells and evidence of the natural presence of the study species of bees . In total we recorded 15 nesting bee and wasp species and eight species of hymenopteran parasites in collected shells one of which the spider wasp

@highlight Rich communities of bees and wasps utilize empty gastropod shells in near natural habitats neighbouring almond orchards.
@highlight Dry near natural habitats host many more species than irrigated ruderal habitats.
@highlight Near natural habitats are important for bees and wasps and can serve as biodiversity hotspots.
@highlight Preserving near natural habitats is likely to support effective and sustainable landscape scale pollination.
