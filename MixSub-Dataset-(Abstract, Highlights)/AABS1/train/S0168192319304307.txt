 Stemflow is a primary pathway through which rainwater reaches the ground surface under crop cover . Substantial research suggests that stemflow amounts approach or exceed half the total precipitation on maize cropland however few studies have quantified the effect of stemflow on soil erosion during rainfall events . This study aimed to measure the effect of stemflow on soil erosion under controlled situations and determine the effects of stemflow on soil erosion . Maize stems were simulated using a 2 cm diameter PVC tube in 1.3 by 0.25m steel boxes to introduce stemflows to the soil surface at a 10 slope . The rainfall intensities were 60 90 and 120mm h the stemflow amounts were 5 10 and 15g s. The results showed that stemflow significantly increased soil erosion . As stemflow increased the surface runoff and sediment rates sharply increased . Compared with a control slope stemflow increased the surface runoff and sediment rates by more than three and twelve times respectively . This result occurred because stemflow contributes to the formation of concentrated flows which easily trigger rill erosion around the stem base . The sediment rate further increased with rill development . Soil erosion was small if stemflow did not occur during a rainfall event otherwise soil erosion was extensive due to stemflow induced rill erosion . Our results provide new insights for the analysis of crop cover effects and soil erosion on cultivated lands . For maize planted slopes stemflow may also be indispensable when determining the soil erosion amount .
