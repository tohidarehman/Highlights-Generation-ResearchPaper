 Plants under combined stresses exhibit a prominent shift in molecular responses compared with plants exposed to the same stresses independently . Profiling responses to individual and combined stressors at the gene expression level have identified several genes with intersecting responses to these stressors . However the upstream regulators at the intersection of plant responses to individual and combined stresses are not known . Here using the transcriptome of

@highlight Arabidopsis modulates the expression of
@highlight to regulate proline metabolism to adapt to the combined stress.
@highlight regulates expression of
@highlight gene.
@highlight Proline metabolism plays positive role under combined drought and
@highlight pv. tomato DC3000 infection.
