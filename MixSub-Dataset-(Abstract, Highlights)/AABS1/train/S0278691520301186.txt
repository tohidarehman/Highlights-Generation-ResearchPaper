 The occurrence and accompanying risks of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in Indonesian jamu were evaluated . PAs were detected in 34 out of 35 jamu containing PA producing botanicals in the range of 12.3235 376g kg . A total PA level of 5.93 421g kg was found in 17 out of 23 jamu made of non PA producing botanicals pointing to contamination with PA producing plants . Short time consumption of jamu is unlikely to result in acute toxic effects although one sample would exceed an intake of 10gPA kg bw day which may cause hepatic veno occlusive disease in humans . The risk assessment for the genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of PAs revealed Margin of Exposure values below 10 000 for 27 out of all samples analysed indicating a priority for risk management when assuming daily lifelong consumption . Assuming consumption for two weeks every year during a lifetime and using Haber s rule 13 out of 35 jamu samples containing PA producing botanicals still pose a priority while the jamu consisting of non PA producing botanicals would be of low priority . This study provides data that can support risk management actions in Indonesia to minimize the potential health risk for jamu consumers due to the occurrence of toxic PAs in these products .

@highlight Pyrrolizidine alkaloids PAs were quantified in jamu containing PA producing botanicals or non PA producing botanicals.
@highlight An exposure and safety assessment for acute and chronic periods was performed.
@highlight Acute exposure does not raise a concern.
@highlight Lifetime daily consumption of 27 out of 58 samples indicate a priority for risk management.
@highlight When used for 2 weeks every year during a lifetime 13 samples still raise concern.
