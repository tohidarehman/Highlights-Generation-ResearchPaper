 The adoption of agro ecological practices in agricultural systems worldwide can contribute to increased food production without compromising future food security especially under the current biodiversity loss and climate change scenarios . Despite the increase in publications on agro ecological research and practices during the last 35 years a weak link between that knowledge and changed farmer practices has led to few examples of agro ecological protocols and effective delivery systems to agriculturalists . In an attempt to reduce this gap we synthesised the main concepts related to biodiversity and its functions by creating a web based interactive spiral

@highlight Despite the high number of agro ecological publications few lead to outcomes.
@highlight The pathway to outcomes is explored through an interactive web based tool.
@highlight The spiral can be used at all levels from policy makers to farm advisors and schools.
@highlight The aim is to inform efforts to enhance biodiversity based agricultural systems.
