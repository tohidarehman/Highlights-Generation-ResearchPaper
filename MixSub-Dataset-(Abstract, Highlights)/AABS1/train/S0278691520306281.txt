 Recently the use of bioactive glucosidase inhibitors for the treatment of diabetes have been proven to be the most efficient remedy for controlling postprandial hyperglycemia and its detrimental physiological complications especially in type 2 diabetes . The carbohydrate hydrolysing enzyme glucosidase is generally competitively inhibited by the glucosidase inhibitors and results in the delayed glucose absorption in small intestine ultimately controlling the postprandial hyperglycemia . Here we have reviewed the most recent updates in the bioactive glucosidase inhibitors category . This review provides an overview of the glucosidase inhibitory potentials and efficiency of controlling postprandial hyperglycemia of various bioactive compounds such as flavonoids phenolic compound polysaccharide betulinic acid tannins anthocyanins steroids polyol polyphenols galangin procyanidins hydroxyl sanshool hydroxyl sanshool erythritol ganomycin caffeoylquinic acid resin glycosides saponins avicularin oleanolic acids urasolic acid ethanolic extracts etc . from various dietary and non dietary naturally occurring sources .
