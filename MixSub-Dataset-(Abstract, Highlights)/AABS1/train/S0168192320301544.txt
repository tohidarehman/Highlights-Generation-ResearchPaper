 This study aims to ascertain the uncertainties related to the spatiotemporal estimation of net radiation and its components using remote sensing data . Geographical focus is an irrigated agricultural hotspot of the Brazilian semiarid region for which we also investigate the impact that contrasting land cover types have on the upwelling radiation balance components and hence on net radiation . Instantaneous R

@highlight Net radiation was reliably estimated from Landsat 8 and weather data for NE Brazil
@highlight Determined best methods to estimate short and long wave radiation for NE Brazil
@highlight The Brazilian caatinga area exhibits strongly contrasting radiative properties
@highlight Implications for radiation balance when caatinga is replaced by agriculture
@highlight Albedo and emissivity increase and land surface temperature reduce by 3 5 degC
