 It is still a long term challenge to improve crop production and economic benefits in arid area of northwest China . The objective of this study was therefore to propose a new and promising cotton mung bean intercropping system to cope with the challenge based on the traditional monocropping cotton system . A two year field experiment was conducted to evaluate crop production and economic benefits between the CMBI and MC systems by analyzing the total land output aboveground dry matter nitrogen uptake water use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency partial factor productivity of nitrogen and economic benefits . Experiment treatments consisted of two cropping systems and a combination of the CMBI system with different N fertilizer rates 315 390 and 475 kg ha

@highlight The study proposed a new cotton mung bean intercropping CMBI system based on the traditional monocropping cotton MC .
@highlight The CMBI system showed higher crop yield water use efficiency WUE and nitrogen use efficiency than the MC.
@highlight The CMBI system produced economic benefits much better than the MC system.
@highlight 390kgha
@highlight in CMBI system was recommended as an appropriate nitrogen application rate to improve WUE and economic benefits.
