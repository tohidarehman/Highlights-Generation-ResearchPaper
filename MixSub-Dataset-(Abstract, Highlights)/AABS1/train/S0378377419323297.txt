 This study was conducted to investigate the effects of plant density planting method and irrigation regime on water productivity and yield of sugar beet for two years during 2017 and 2018 . The planted cultivar was Shokoofa with three irrigation levels 100 75 and 50 of the full irrigation as I100 I75 and I50 respectively two planting methods direct seeding and transplanting and four planting densities 180 000 135 000 90 000 and 45 000 plants ha

@highlight Transplanting is an effective way to increase water productivity in arid regions.
@highlight Transplanting method increases root yield and white sugar yield.
@highlight Transplanting decreases root length and increases root diameter.
@highlight Deficit irrigation increases sugar concentration with no decreases in sugar yield.
@highlight Transplanting is more tolerant to deficit irrigation and high plant density.
