 Soil compaction from livestock treading during winter grazing of forage crops on cultivated soils may be harmful to subsequent crop production and nitrogen loss . This study focussed on determining how compaction and high inputs of N from livestock urine during winter grazing affect subsequent crop production and N loss and whether establishing winter grazed forage crops with no tillage can mitigate potential adverse effects on subsequent crop production and N loss . A field trial was conducted on a Templeton silt loam soil in Canterbury New Zealand from April 2016 to February 2017 comprising of forage crop grazing and subsequent crop phases . The forage crop phase represented the production of forage oat crops established using NT or intensive tillage in autumn . The grazing phase was simulated by removal of the forage crop followed by simulated grazing that comprised five compaction levels and two urea N treatments 0 versus 400kg N ha

@highlight Compaction did not affect subsequent barley crop yield and N loss after grazing.
@highlight High urea N input from grazing lowered barley grain yield and increased N loss.
@highlight Tillage affected the timing but not amount of crop growth and N loss after grazing.
@highlight Moderate compaction can improve barley production especially in NT soils.
