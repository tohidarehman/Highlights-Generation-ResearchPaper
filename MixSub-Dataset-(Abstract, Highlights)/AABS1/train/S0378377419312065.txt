 There is increasing interest and wide recognition of the potential use of human excreta derived materials as fertilizer to supply essential nutrients needed for crop production . However most work on HEDM has focussed on yield responses using soils and very little done on soil less media using hydroponics . Further physiological responses of plants to different HEDM in a hydroponic production system is currently not well understood . This study investigated the effect of Decentralized Waste water Treatment System effluents and Nitrified Urine Concentrate on leaf gas exchange photosynthetic efficiency and mineral content of hydroponically grown tomato . The experiment was conducted in a polyethylene tunnel using a complete randomised design comprising of three treatments namely DEWATS effluent NUC and commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix . Sampling conducted both before and after flowering showed significant differences

@highlight Photosynthetic response of hydroponic tomato to waste based nutrient sources was investigated.
@highlight Plants fertilized with the commercial hydroponic mix had higher leaf area index.
@highlight Tomato treated with nitrified urine concentrate had higher chlorophyll content.
@highlight Leaves of tomatoes treated with DEWATS effluent had higher photosynthetic rate.
