 The adoption of water saving practices in rice cultivation modifies soil water tension regime then influencing accumulation of chemical elements in rice grains . Some studies report higher concentrations of arsenic in rice grains produced in anaerobic soils compared to those produced in aerobic soils . However there is a lack of information about the association between water stress imposed at distinct phenological phases of rice and the accumulation of chemical elements in grains . The aim of the present work was to determine the levels of As Cd Co Cu Fe Mg Mn Ni Pb Se and Zn in husked grains of three rice varieties cultivated under different soil water tensions imposed at distinct phases of the development . The study was conducted during 3 years with 3 rice varieties . The higher soil water tension in vegetative phase influenced Cd accumulation Mn Cu and Co . The reproductive phase 1 is the main phase regarding uptake of chemical elements when the highest soil water tension implied the lowest As accumulation in grains concomitantly with increase of toxic elements Cd and Pb although keeping them below the threshold levels determined by FAO WHO and essential elements as Mn Zn Se Cu Co and Ni . The increased soil water tension in reproductive phase 2 decreased the levels of Pb in BRS Pampa . There is association among the contents of chemical elements in grains rice variety grain yield and irrigation scheduling especially for As .

@highlight Soil water tension SWT and phenological phase PP influenced the levels of elements.
@highlight Chemical elements are mainly absorbed in the beginning of reproductive PP R1 .
@highlight Higher SWT in vegetative PP increased Cd and Cu and decreased Mn and Co.
@highlight Higher SWT in R1 PP increased Cd Pb Mn Zn Se Cu Ni and Co and decreased As.
@highlight SWT was not important for Fe accumulation in grains at any PP.
