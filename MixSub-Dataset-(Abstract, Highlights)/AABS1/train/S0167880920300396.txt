 Landscape and crop management are important concepts for conservation biological control as they can influence the abundance of natural enemies . In this work we accomplished a multi scale study focused on the effect of landscape structure and crop management on the olive moth

@highlight adults in olive crops fed on surrounding landscape patches.
@highlight Both anemophilous and entomophilous pollens were consumed by adults.
@highlight Adults fed on pollen settled in the environment in non flowering periods.
@highlight Some available pollen was never ingested while rare or absent pollen was consumed.
