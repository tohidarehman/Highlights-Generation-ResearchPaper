 In order to select environmentally friendly mulching materials and to increase rainwater utilization in a semiarid region of Northwest China a field experiment was conducted using a randomized complete design to determine effects of three furrow mulching materials maize straw and biodegradable film on soil temperature moisture evapotranspiration crop yields and water use efficiency with no mulching as a control during three consecutive crop growing seasons in years 2013 2015 . Silage grain and biomass yields and WUE for maize were 1.75 1.87 1.82 and 1.76 times greater than corresponding yields and WUE for sorghum during the study period . BF increased topsoil temperature and soil water storage while MS decreased topsoil temperature but increased soil water storage . Compared with NM the increase in average topsoil temperature at the furrow bottoms of BF was 1.051.37C during the growing seasons for maize while it was 1.071.25C during the growing seasons for sorghum . During the growing seasons the decrease in topsoil temperature at the furrow bottoms for MS was 1.221.81C for maize while it was 1.341.59C for sorghum . BF and MS decreased furrow soil evaporation but increased crop transpiration while they did not shift the total water loss from ET . BF resulted in high soil temperature and moisture increased crop yields and WUE . Although low temperatures impaired emergence and crop development high soil moisture increased crop yields and WUE with MS . Compared with NM BF treatments resulted in increased mean silage mean grain and mean biomass yields for maize of 17.0 17.7 and 13.7 respectively while corresponding yields for sorghum increased by 12.9 17.0 and 11.7 respectively . The mean silage grain and biomass yields for maize with MS increased by 9.3 12.1 and 8.0 respectively while corresponding yields for sorghum increased by 5.6 14.3 and 6.7 respectively . Mean WUEs for maize and sorghum with BF significantly increased by 4.8 and 2.6 kgha

@highlight The silage yield grain yield biomass yield and WUE of maize were 1.75 1.87 1.82 and 1.76 times respectively greater than those of sorghum.
@highlight Biodegradable film and maize straw mulching did not change the total water loss by evaporation and transpiration.
@highlight Maize straw mulching provided a lower increase in grain yield compared with biodegradable film mulching.
@highlight Liquid film mulching did not significantly increase crop yields and water use efficiency compared with no mulching.
