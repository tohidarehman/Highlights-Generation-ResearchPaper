 Increasing global aridity combined with changing environmental conditions might cause irreparable alterations in arid and semiarid ecosystems . Knowledge of within species genetic diversity and adaptive responses especially along climatic gradients becomes critical to inform management conservation and restoration efforts . We combine the analysis of neutral and adaptive divergence between populations along a sharp precipitation gradient in the native Patagonian grass

@highlight Climate change might alter adaptation patterns in North Patagonian forage grasses.
@highlight populations exhibited a weak genetic structure along this region.
@highlight Plant architectures entails growth patterns associated to their home environments.
@highlight Increasing aridity might favour a more compact cespitose architecture.
