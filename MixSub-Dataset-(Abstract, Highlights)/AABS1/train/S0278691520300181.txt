 To investigate the anti tumor activities of WZ35 and its possible molecular mechanism bioinformatics analysis and the hematoxylin eosin staining were applied to evaluate the Yes associated protein level in gastric cancer . Cell counting kit 8 was used to examine cell viability . Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry analysis . Seahorse bioenergetics analyzer was used to investigate the alteration of oxygen consumption and aerobic glycolysis rate . SiRNA transfection was applied to silence endogenous YAP . Western blot was performed to detect indicated proteins . We found that treatment of gastric cancer cells with WZ35 exerted stronger anti tumor activities than curcumin . Mechanistically our research showed that WZ35 inhibited glycolysis and induced reactive oxygen species generation resulting in Jun N terminal Kinase activation through downregulation of YAP in gastric cancer cells . ROS mediated YAP downregulation and JNK activation was regulated by glycolysis . Abrogation of ROS production markedly attenuated WZ35 induced anti tumor activities as well as YAP downregulation and JNK activation . Similarly the JNK inhibitor significantly reversed WZ35 induced anti tumor activities in gastric cancer cells . Our study reveals a novel anti gastric cancer mechanism of WZ35 by inhibiting glycolysis through the ROS YAP JNK pathway . WZ35 might be a potential therapeutics for the treatment of gastric cancer .

@highlight Curcumin analogue WZ35 inhibits gastric cancer cell growth.
@highlight ROS mediated YAP and JNK activation was regulated by glycolysis.
@highlight Glycolysis throught ROS YAP JNK pathway might be a potential therapeutic target of gastric cancer.
