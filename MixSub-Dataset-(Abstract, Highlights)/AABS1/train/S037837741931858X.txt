 Water is the limiting factor for crop production within the southern US Great Plains and it has become a critical resource for multiple stakeholders . Hence efficient irrigation and cropping systems are of paramount importance to conserve water resources . The objective of this study was to determine the effect of irrigation timing and quantity cover crop use and tillage on cotton production in an established conservation tillage system . Evaluated tillage systems included 1 conventional tillage 2 strip tillage 3 no till and 4 NT with a terminated wheat cover crop . Irrigation treatments included 1 5.08 6.35mm d

@highlight Delaying irrigation until flowering greatly reduces irrigation water usage without significantly reducing lint yield.
@highlight Early season irrigation to bank soil moisture was not an efficient use of water.
@highlight No till with a terminated wheat cover crop increased lint yields by 7 over strip till and 9 over conventional till.
@highlight Over 6 yrs irrigation water use efficiency was 11 greater for no till with a wheat cover crop and 9 greater for no till compared to conventional till.
@highlight No till with a cover crop and irrigating at critical growth stages can conserve water resources and increase cotton lint yields.
