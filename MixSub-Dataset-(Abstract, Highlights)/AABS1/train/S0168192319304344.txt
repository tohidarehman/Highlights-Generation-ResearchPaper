 Hedgerows have the potential to facilitate the persistence and migration of species across landscapes mostly due to benign microclimatic conditions . This thermal buffering function may become even more important in the future for species migration under climate change . Unfortunately there is a lack of empirical studies quantifying the microclimate of hedgerows particularly at broad geographical scales .

@highlight We quantified microclimatic temperature buffering along hedgerow woodland transects across Europe.
@highlight Hedgerows are less efficient thermal insulators than woodlands notably at high ambient temperatures.
@highlight Temperatures in hedgerows are most extreme around 10m from the woodland edges.
@highlight Wider hedgerows with a tall and dense tree layer provide better buffering against temperature extremes.
