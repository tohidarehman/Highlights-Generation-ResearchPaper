 YIT 12319 was isolated from the oral cavity of a healthy subject as a new candidate probiotic with potential benefits for oral health . As a safety assessment of LcY we performed an antibiotic susceptibility test and virulence associated gene analysis using a draft genome sequence . Susceptibility to 15 antibiotics was analyzed according to the standard method of the International Dairy Federation International Organization for Standardization as recommended by the European Food Safety Authority . The results showed that the minimum inhibitory concentrations of LcY were not higher than those of other
