 The existing information supports the use of this material as described in this safety assessment . 1 2 2 4 trimethylpentan 3 ol was evaluated for genotoxicity repeated dose toxicity reproductive toxicity local respiratory toxicity phototoxicity photoallergenicity skin sensitization and environmental safety . Data show that 1 2 2 4 trimethylpentan 3 ol is not genotoxic . Data on 1 2 2 4 trimethylpentan 3 ol provide a calculated margin of exposure 100 for the repeated dose toxicity endpoint . The reproductive and local respiratory toxicity endpoints were evaluated using the threshold of toxicological concern for a Cramer Class III material and the exposure to 1 2 2 4 trimethylpentan 3 ol is below the TTC . Data show that there are no safety concerns for 1 2 2 4 trimethylpentan 3 ol for skin sensitization under the current declared levels of use . The phototoxicity photoallergenicity endpoints were evaluated based on ultraviolet spectra 1 2 2 4 trimethylpentan 3 ol is not expected to be phototoxic photoallergenic . The environmental endpoints were evaluated for the hazard assessment based on the screening data 1 2 2 4 trimethylpentan 3 ol is not persistent bioaccumulative and toxic as per the International Fragrance Association Environmental Standards . For the risk assessment 1 2 2 4 trimethylpentan 3 ol was not able to be risk screened as there were no reported volumes of use for either North America or Europe in the 2015 IFRA Survey .
