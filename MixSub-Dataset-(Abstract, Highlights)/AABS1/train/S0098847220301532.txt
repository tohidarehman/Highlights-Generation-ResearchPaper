 is a biennial plant species forming a taproot and a leaf rosette during the first year and which requires low temperature during vernalization to flower during the second year of its cycle . Heat stress however is known to induce premature flowering during the first year . The present work aims to compare the effect of heat treatment and vernalization on the phytohormonal profile and the expression of two chicory genes

@highlight requires vernalization for flowering.
@highlight High temperature paradoxically induce flowering in this species.
@highlight Vernalization inhibited
@highlight expression while high temperature increased it.
@highlight Impact of high temperature on phytohormonal profile was different for vernalized and non vernalized plants.
