 Despite the development of rubber agroforestry systems for ecological and economic benefits in Southeast Asia knowledge of their water uptake dynamics and interspecic water interactions remains limited . The objective of this study is to reveal the water relations between rubber

@highlight Interspecic water competition existed between rubber trees and intercrops.
@highlight Observed water uptake complementarity differed from that of previous reports.
@highlight Intercrops could promote surface soil water availability for rubber trees.
@highlight Facilitative effects were most marked in rubber galangal agroforestry.
