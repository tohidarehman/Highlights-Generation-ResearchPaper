 This study provides statistical emulators of global by gridded crop models included in the Inter Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project Fast Trackproject to estimate irrigated crop yields and associated irrigation water withdrawals simulated at the grid cell level . An ensemble of crop model simulations is used to build a panel of monthly summer weather variables and corresponding annual yields and irrigation water withdrawals from five gridded crop models . This dataset is then used to estimate crop specific response functions for each crop model . The average normalized root mean square errors for the response functions range from 3 to 6 for irrigated yields and 2 to 8 for irrigated water withdrawal . Further in and out of sample validation exercises confirm that the statistical emulators are able to replicate the crop models spatial patterns of irrigated crop yields and irrigation water withdrawals both in levels and in terms of changes over time although accuracy varies by model and by region . The emulators estimated in this study therefore provide a reliable and computationally efficient alternative to global gridded crop yield models .
