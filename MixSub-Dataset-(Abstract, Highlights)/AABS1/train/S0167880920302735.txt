 Excessive fertilization and accelerated erosion due to intensive agriculture have resulted in a large nitrogen and phosphorus exports from farmlands to rivers and lakes contributing substantially to eutrophication in many regions . But many studies mainly emphasized the influence of fertilizer overuse neglecting the contribution of accelerated erosion to diffuse N and P pollution . Thus the objectives of this study were to determine the seasonal changes of sediment and particulate N and P entering the river by surface runoff from core sugarcane growing watershed and clarify their influencing factors . Surface runoff sediment and associated nutrients were measured in summer and autumn at the outlets of three sub watersheds under rainfall events in Nala watershed southern subtropics of China . The total sediment PN and PP loads in the entire seasons were 30.9 t ha

@highlight Contributions of water erosion and fertilizers to diffuse pollution was compared.
@highlight Water erosion significantly controlled seasonal export of particulate N and P from the watershed.
@highlight Applied fertilizers significantly influence watershed export of PN but not PP.
@highlight Applied fertilizers accounted for 14 PN and 64 PP exports from the watershed.
@highlight Sugarcane cover is another key factor influencing the exports of PN and PP.
