 Seaweeds are among the significant currently exploited marine plant resources which are gaining full applications in culinary cosmetic pharmaceutical and biotechnological processes . Much attention has been devoted to seaweeds based on their proven health benefits and is considered as a rich source of structurally different bioactive metabolites for the discovery of novel functional food based pharmacophores drugs . Nonetheless there is still a dearth of updated compilation and analysis of the in depth pharmacological activities of these compounds . This review therefore aims to provide a piece of up to date detailed information on the major compounds isolated from various seaweed species together with their in vitro and in vivo biological properties . These compounds were found to possess broad pharmacological properties and inhibitory enzyme activities against critical enzymes involved in the aetiology of noncommunicable diseases . However their toxicity clinical efficacy mechanisms of action and interaction with conventional foods are still less explored and require more attention in future studies .

@highlight Seaweeds are exploted widely for their health beneficial bioactive compounds.
@highlight This review aims to provide up to date information on the seaweed pharmacology.
@highlight Much information provided with regards to phlorotannins and polysaccharides.
