 Abiotic stresses pose adverse impact on plant growth and development and exploring the stress tolerance genes from dominant species is still urgent . The desert shrub

@highlight HaASR1 interacts with HaPrxQ and HaBADH and may function in preventing PrxQ and BADH from denaturation in plants under drought stress.
@highlight HaASR1 made the plants partially defective in ABA signaling and participated in drought tolerance regulation through nonstomatal pathways.
