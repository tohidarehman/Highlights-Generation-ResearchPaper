 The present work aimed to study the effect of using Treated Wastewater to irrigate Chemlali olive trees on the quality characteristics and chemical composition of olive oils . This research was conducted in orchards cultivated in the center of Tunisia where olive trees were subjected to different irrigation treatments during two consecutive years 0 ET

@highlight Oil quality indices and phenolic compounds were maintained unchanged after TWW use.
@highlight Fatty acids and desirable attributes of aromatics were not affected by treatment.
@highlight TWW irrigation led to a decrease in undesirable volatiles.
@highlight TWW irrigation didnt enhance heavy oil metals.
