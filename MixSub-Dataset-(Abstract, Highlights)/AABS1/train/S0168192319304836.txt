 crop yield is highly sensitive to climate change and extreme climate . Here the impact of climate change and extreme climate was assessed based on the climate variable outputs from 17 General Circumstance Models in the Coupled Model Inter comparison Project phase five dataset a statistically downscaling method a series of 12 extreme climate indices selected from the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices calculated using the downscaled climate variable outputs and a processbase Crop Simulation Model . The climate variable outputs consist history data series of GCMs simulation used as baseline future period including two Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5 in the Yangtze River Basin . The results showed that the mean temperature and precipitation in growing season would increase for 81 stations for the future period under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 relative to baseline in the Yangtze River Basin . In contrast the mean downward shortwave solar radiation in growing season at most sites presented an upward trend for the future period under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 relative to baseline in the Yangtze River Basin the maize and rice yield was projected to decrease by approximately 5.36 and 2.55 under RCP4.5 and 6.04 and 2.48 under RCP8.5 respectively relative to baseline with consideration of the CO

@highlight The contribution of climate variables including extreme climate were quantified.
@highlight Climate change lowered maize yield by 56 in future period relative to baseline.
@highlight Climate change lowered rice yield by 2.5 in future period relative to baseline.
@highlight Extreme climate indices were strongly correlated with the maize and rice yield.
