 Soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit are key variables that affect the carbon water and energy cycles . Very few studies have been conducted to evaluate their impacts on site specific ecosystems especially in mountainous regions and plains using an integrated remote sensing and modeling approach . This study used two flux tower sites P301 Prairie View A M University to evaluate gross primary production sensible heat flux and latent heat flux . The community land model and soil moisture active passive carbon product were employed and evaluated using the flux tower data from 2016 to 2018 . From the CLM4 and SMAP estimation of GPP the CLM4 showed better accuracy at P301 whereas SMAP performed better at PVAMU . The SMAP overestimated GPP at P301 which could be due to the coarse footprint of SMAP . CLM4 overestimated GPP during the growing season at PVAMU which could be due to the structural and parametric uncertainties . The H at P301 showed good agreement between the CLM4 results and flux tower measurements . However H at the PVAMU site was most likely affected by the precipitation . Moreover at P301 VPD was effective in controlling the carbon and water fluxes with a positive partial correlation

@highlight SMAP performs better at the grassland site PVAMU .
@highlight Model CLM4 simulations were better at the forest site P301 .
@highlight Atmospheric component effects were dominant at the mountainous site P301 .
@highlight Terrestrial component effect was dominant at the low elevated humid site PVAMU .
