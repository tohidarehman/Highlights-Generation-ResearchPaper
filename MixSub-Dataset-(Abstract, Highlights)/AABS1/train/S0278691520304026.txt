 Raspberry ketone 2 butanone is used by the food and cosmetic industry as a flavoring agent . RK is also marketed as a dietary supplement for weight maintenance and appetite control . The purpose of the study was to characterize the acute feeding suppression with RK by oral gavage in male and female C57BL 6J mice . Cumulative 24h food intake was reduced at 200mg kg in males and reliably reduced at 640mg kg . Feeding suppression was not associated with pica behavior over the range of doses or conditioned taste aversion . In a separate experiment a single oral gavage of RK resulted in approximate 43 mortality rate within 2 days . Atrophy of white adipose tissue splenic abnormalities and thymus involution were noted after 24 days after oral gavage RK . Total white blood cell count lymphocytes monocytes eosinophils were significantly lower while mean red blood cells hemoglobin and hematocrit were significantly higher with RK treatment . Our findings indicated a dose dependent feeding suppression with acute RK but doses that reliable suppress food intake are associated with pathological changes .
