 Soil aggregate stability is an important index for predicting soil water loss and soil erosion resistance . Plant roots effectively control soil erosion and stabilize soil structure which has a crucial influence on the formation of aggregates and soil organic carbon sequestration . We examined how rhizosphere effects influence soil aggregate stability and its associated SOC contents and

@highlight Rhizosphere effects significantly improved the stability of aggregates.
@highlight Rhizosphere effects significantly promoted the C fixation of soil aggregates.
@highlight C flow in rhizosphere aggregate was greater than that in the non rhizosphere.
@highlight The rhizosphere effects of fibrous roots were stronger than that of tap roots.
