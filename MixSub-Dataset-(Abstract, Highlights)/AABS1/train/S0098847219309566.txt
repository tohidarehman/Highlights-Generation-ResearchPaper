 Dormant seed embryos in seed banks can experience hydration cycles that subject them to water stress and then fast hydration . Physiological and cytological aspects of embryos of the Cerrado palm

@highlight embryos were subjected to water stress WS and fast hydration FH .
@highlight Protein reserves SOD activity and ABA biosynthesis are related to WS tolerance.
@highlight Biophysical damage to cell structure cause viability losses under severe WS.
@highlight Tolerance to WS and FH is crucial to the resilience of
@highlight seed banks.
