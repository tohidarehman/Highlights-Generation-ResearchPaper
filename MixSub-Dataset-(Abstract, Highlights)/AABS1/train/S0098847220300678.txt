 Programmed cell death plays a crucial role in plant development and is also activated under the influence of environmental factors . As the mechanism of PCD under heavy metal stress is poorly understood a suspension culture of cells from the facultative metallophyte

@highlight Heavy metals induce programmed cell death PCD in
@highlight cells.
@highlight Papain like cysteine proteases PLCPs but not caspase 3 like enzyme are involved in heavy metal induced PCD.
@highlight E 64 d a PLCPs inhibitor prevents the PCD pathway increasing cell viability after heavy metal treatment.
