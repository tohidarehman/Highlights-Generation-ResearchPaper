 To address the water shortage caused by various natural conditions and ineffective irrigation water management in the Zhanghe Irrigation District of the Yangtze River basin in China a full fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming model is developed under uncertainty . Derived through incorporating fuzzy credibility constrained programming into the Jensen model optimization framework FFICNP can not only address intervals and fuzzy interval sets in the model objectives and double sided constraints but also reflect nonlinear responsive relationships between the crop yields and irrigation levels by introducing the crop water production functions under different growth stages . Moreover an expected value based approach is introduced to solve the FFICNP model . The FFICNP model is then applied to the case study of irrigation water allocation in the ZID for demonstrating its applicability . Optimal solutions can be generated from the FFICNP model for solving the irrigation water allocation problem under uncertainty . The results indicate that a lower credibility level corresponds to a higher level of system benefits and system efficiency . The system benefits of ZID in a wet year are 10

@highlight A full fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming FFICNP model is proposed under uncertainty.
@highlight This approach is applied to a case study for planning irrigation water allocation in the Zhanghe Irrigation District.
@highlight A lower credibility level corresponds to higher net system benefit and system efficiency.
@highlight The results support in depth analysis of interrelationships among water allocation schemes system benefits and credibility levels.
