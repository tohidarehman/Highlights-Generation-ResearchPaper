 The influence mechanism of heterogeneous nutrient distribution on compensatory growth of maize seedlings is a key topic in the interaction between crops and soil environment . We evaluated the significance of root hydraulic conductance

@highlight We evaluated the significance of root hydraulic conductance Lp and related parameter changes in water uptake and growth regulation of plants under different nitrogen N conditions.
@highlight The superiority of partial N deficit D in term of maize seedling growth was apparent and caused compensatory growth.
@highlight Higher plant dry mass in D might be attributable to the maintenance of a similar L and improved shoot N content.
@highlight Compared with partial N resupply partial N deficit was more advantageous to root water uptake and N accumulation at the same level of root surface area thus resulted in higher dry mass of maize seedlings. Unexpectedly at 21 day the shoot dry mass in S could recover to the level of control. The regulation mechanisms in partial N resupply will be the focus of future studies.
@highlight When adopting the method of partial N application it is necessary to consider the soil N condition before partial application.
