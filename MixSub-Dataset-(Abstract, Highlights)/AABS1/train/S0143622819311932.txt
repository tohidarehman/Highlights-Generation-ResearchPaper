 Accessibility to healthcare has a direct bearing on the overall well being of the population . Poor access to healthcare has serious consequences particularly in low and low middle income countries in sub Saharan Africa . The lack of detailed and up to date spatial data and health information in these regions further challenges both the accurate assessment of spatial accessibility and the determination of optimal locations of healthcare facilities that would improve health service planning . In the present study we proposed a systematic approach to assess the spatial accessibility to healthcare and to identify optimal locations for additional healthcare facilities based on the accessibility measures . Results from a raster based accessibility measurement showed that majority of population could not reach the nearest hospitals within 2 hours only 25 50 and 44 of population reached the nearest hospital within 2 hours under walking motor and bus travel scenarios respectively . Our results also showed that the five newly proposed hospitals whose optimal locations were determined using a location allocation model could potentially increase 11.41 8.29 and 8.95 of additional population coverage for the three travel scenarios . The proposed health system evaluation approach and the health care planning based on open source data derived from remote sensing and crowdsourcing and the spatial modeling approach has the potential to be useful in LMIC to improve overall population health .
