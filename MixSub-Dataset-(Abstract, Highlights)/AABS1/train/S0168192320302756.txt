 Knowledge about heat acclimation in perennial plants is limited . Our hypotheses were that high temperature during budswell before budbreak elicits acclimation in grapevines that is mediated by greater water transport capacity and that water deficit modulates acclimation to high temperature . We compared field grown Malbec grapevines heated before budbreak during 3 or 15 days with untreated controls . We also combined these thermal regimes with two water regimes well watered and water deficit . The heat treatment was applied to vines enclosed in individual chambers . Under well watered conditions 3 days of heating during budswell were enough to increase number and diameter of primary xylem vessels in the emerging shoots leaf stomatal density transpiration CO

@highlight Elevated temperature before budbreak increases shoot water transport capacity.
@highlight Heat before budbreak stimulates vegetative growth throughout the growing season.
@highlight Heat before budbreak increases photosynthesis and transpiration on the growing season.
