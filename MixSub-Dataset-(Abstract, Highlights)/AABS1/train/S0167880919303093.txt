 Native bees are in decline as many species are sensitive to habitat loss climate change and non target exposure to synthetic pesticides . Recent laboratory and semi field assessments of pesticide impacts on bees have focused on neonicotinoid insecticides . However field studies evaluating influences of neonicotinoid seed treatments on native bee communities of North America are absent from the literature . On four Conservation Areas of Missouri we sampled row cropped treated

@highlight Fields with and without prior history of neonicotinoid seed treatments were studied.
@highlight Neonicotinoids were frequently detected in soils but not margin plants.
@highlight Neonicotinoids present in margin soils of untreated fields despite no prior use.
@highlight Bee richness negatively associated with margin soil neonicotinoid concentrations.
@highlight Neonicotinoids in soil may be a potential route of exposure for native bees.
