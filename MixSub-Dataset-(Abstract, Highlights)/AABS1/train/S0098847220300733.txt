 Plants have the ability to alleviate the harmful effects caused by abiotic and biotic stress . Phytohormones play a very important role in the acclimation to these stresses . To study the role of jasmonate in the acclimation to osmotic stress an ALLENE OXIDE CYCLASE mutant of rice

@highlight Jasmonate required for osmotic stress in rice.
@highlight Jasmonate deficiency increases osmotic stress sensitivity.
@highlight Fast increase of jasmonate levels followed by increase in abscisic acid level.
@highlight JA independent accumulation of abscisic acid.
@highlight Root and shoot specific hormonal patterns.
