 The rapid depletion rate of the Ogallala aquifer threatens agriculture sustainability in the U.S. Southern Great Plains . Adoption of drought tolerant crop with suitable irrigation strategy is critical to improve water use efficiency and sustain crop production in the region . The objective of the study was to assess soil water extraction pattern and water use efficiency of spring canola

@highlight Skipping irrigation at the vegetative stage improves water use efficiency in canola.
@highlight Soil water extraction depth was similar across irrigation treatments and cultivars.
@highlight Canola extracted maximum soil water when stressed during reproductive stage or throughout growing season.
