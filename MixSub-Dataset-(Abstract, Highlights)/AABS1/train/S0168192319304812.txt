 Given the significant increasing trend of droughts in Northeast China under climate change it is of particularly urgency to quantify the drought risk to vegetation in different ecosystems . Based on the theory of risk formation we developed a quantitative framework for the assessment of ecosystem drought risk that integrates both drought hazard and vulnerability . To quantitatively assess the drought risk to different vegetation types in NEC we used long term normalized difference vegetation index data and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index data . The effects of climate change and non climatic factors on the NDVI dynamics and drought risk were analyzed using the partial least squares regression method to explore key drivers of risk formation . Our findings indicate that almost 45.4 of ecosystem vegetation in NEC is at a moderate or high risk of drought . Our findings indicate that vulnerability is key to NEC drought risk assessment and adaptability plays an important role in regulating sensitivity . Land cover is the main driving factor for the spatial pattern of drought vulnerability in NEC and forests have the lowest vulnerability . The impact of climate change on vegetation dynamics in dry years R

@highlight A quantitative assessment framework for ecosystem drought risk was established.
@highlight Nearly 45.4 of ecosystem vegetation in NEC has a moderate or high risk of drought.
@highlight Quantitative assessment of vulnerability is the key point to drought risk assessment.
@highlight The drought risk patterns driven by climate variability and human activities are different in farmland and natural vegetation.
