 Nitrogen fertilizer stabilizers nitrification inhibitors and double inhibitors are promising tools to mitigate N pollution from agricultural production . For a better understanding of how N stabilizers impact on the fate of fertilizer N we conducted a comprehensive meta analysis of data from experiments that used the

@highlight Nitrogen stabilizers could improve fertilizer N recovery in the soil crop system.
@highlight Nitrogen stabilizers could reduce fertilizer N losses to the environment.
@highlight Urease and urease nitrification inhibitors had better performance in improving NUE.
@highlight Soil pH has large impact on efficacy of N stabilizers.
