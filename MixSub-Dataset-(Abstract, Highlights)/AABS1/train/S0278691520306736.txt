 Genetically engineered crops expressing insecticidal and herbicide tolerant traits offer a new strategy for crop protection and enhanced production however at the same time present a challenge in terms of toxicology and safety . The current experiment presents the findings of a 90 day feeding study in SpragueDawley rats with transgenic cottonseed which is expressing insecticidal Cry proteins and tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate . There were 100 rats in this experiment divided into 5 groups of 10 rats sex group . Cottonseed from transgenic and control lines was formulated into standard diets at levels of 10 and 30 . All formulated diets were nutritionally balanced . Overall appearance feed consumption body weight organ weight haematology serum chemistry and urinalysis were comparable between control and treatment groups . In addition there was no treatment related difference in findings of microscopic histopathology and gross appearance of tissues . In conclusion following the 13 week of feeding transgenic cottonseed no treatment related adverse effects were observed in any of the parameters measured in this experiment . Thus this study demonstrated that transgenic cottonseeds do not cause toxicity and are nutritionally equivalent to its conventional counterpart .
