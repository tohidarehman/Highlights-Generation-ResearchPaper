 Tieguanyin tea plant is the most important tea cultivar in Fujian Province China . It has suffered great economic losses due to high temperature and dry weather in recently years . This study proposed a prediction model for daily reference evapotranspiration ET

@highlight MMC and GRNN model is proposed for prediction of ET
@highlight of Tieguanyin tea plants.
@highlight Selection of training samples by MMC was helpful for compressing the structure of GRNN.
@highlight Optimization of smoothing factor of GRNN improved the training effect of GRNN.
@highlight Prediction performances were assessed with RMSE MAE and model validity coefficient.
@highlight Prediction results were accurate and reliable under different weather types.
