 The effects of selective logging in Argentinean native subtropical forests or its replacement by pine plantations on carbon and hydrological cycles is of importance for developing strategies for a sustainable use of water resources and climate mitigation in subtropical humid regions . Ecosystem level gross primary productivity evapotranspiration and water use efficiency were assessed using multi temporal MODIS remote sensing data and its response to climatic variables were analyzed in well preserved native forests degraded native forests by selective harvesting and pine plantations . Field measurements of leaf area index tree density basal area tree high diameter at breast height and understory cover was implemented . The GPP was high throughout the year across all three land use types . Selective harvesting of commercial trees resulted in a significant decrease in tree density and in basal area compared to well preserved native forests but did not have a negative impact on GPP . Mean annual ET was similar between both native forests because although the degraded forest had a lower tree density they had a greater maximun DBH per tree than the well preserved forests and therefore high transpiration . The WUE was similar across the ecosystem types . Removal of 5.5 m

@highlight Effect of land uses of humid subtropical forests on ecosystem processes was studied.
@highlight Similar GPP ET and WUR was observed in preserved forests degraded forests and pine plantation.
@highlight Field LAI understory cover and structural stand variables was related to ecosystem processes.
@highlight Climatic determinants on ecosystem processes were also studied.
