 The imbalance of cellular redox status in conjunction with the activation of inflammatory processes have been considered common predominant mechanisms of noise induced hearing loss . The identification of novel natural products as potential therapeuticstargeting oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways is an emerging field . Here we focused on the polyphenol caffeic acid the major representative of hydroxycinnamic acids and phenolic acid in order to investigate its protective capacity in a model of sensorineural hearing loss induced by noise . Hearing loss was induced by exposing animals to a pure tone 120dB 10kHz for 60min . By using auditory brainstem responses and immunofluorescence analysis we found that CA protects auditory function and limits cell death in the cochlear middle basal turn damaged by noise exposure . Immunofluorescence analysis provided evidence that CA mediates multiple cell protection mechanisms involving both anti inflammatory and anti oxidant effects by decreasing NF B and IL 1 expression in the cochlea and opposing the oxidative nitrosative damage induced by noise insult . These results demonstrate that the supplementation of polyphenol CA can be considered a valid therapeutic strategy for attenuating noise induced hearing loss and cochlear damage targeting both inflammatory signalling and cochlear redox balance .
