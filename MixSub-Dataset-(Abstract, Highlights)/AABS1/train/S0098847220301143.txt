 Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi improves phosphorus uptake in plants and regulates growth under environmental stresses . Present trials were undertaken to study the effect of phosphorus P 40mgkg

@highlight Physiological and biochemical processes in
@highlight were affected by drought stress resulting in altered growth.
@highlight AMF inoculation allevaited the drought induced decline in photosynthesis by up regulating the antioxidant metabolism and osmolyte accumulation.
@highlight Enhanced drought tolerance was related to the elevated levels of phytohormones like ABA and IAA and lowered ROS.
