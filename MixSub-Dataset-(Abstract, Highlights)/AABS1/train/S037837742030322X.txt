 Subsurface drip irrigation is one of the most efficient types of water saving irrigation technology . However in regions prone to drought during the planting period crop germination may be a problem under SDI . A 2 year field experiment was conducted in Chifeng Inner Mongolia China to assess the impacts of two planting methods flat planting and alternate row bed planting and four pre emergence irrigation levels 15 25 45 and 60mm on corn germination grain yield and crop water productivity under SDI . The AP method utilized a small lister furrow that was 10cm deep and the corn seeds were planted 5cm beneath the lister furrow . The results indicated that the soil water at the depth of 5cm vertically below the seeds was on average 27 higher under AP than under FP 24hours after PI . The emergence rate under AP initially increased at the lower PI values and then decreased at the highest PI amount . The maximum emergence rate was obtained at 45mm PI under AP . The emergence rate under FP increased with the PI level but the average two year emergence rates were all lower than 80 . The two year average grain yield and the WPc reached maximum values of 15.3Mg ha

@highlight The soil water at the depth of 5cm beneath the seeds SM5 of Alternate row bed planting AP was greater than flat planting FP .
@highlight When Pre emergence irrigation PI amount was 45mm the emergence rate of AP reached 98 .
@highlight The emergence rate yield and crop water productivity of AP was 21 24 and 21 greater than those of FP respectively.
@highlight An emergence rate of corn of 90 95 was obtained when the SM5 was 82 90 of field capacity 24h after PI event.
