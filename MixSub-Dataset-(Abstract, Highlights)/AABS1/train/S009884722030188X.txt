 Phosphorus is a major essential macronutrient for plants and its availability in the soil is scarce and not renewable . Molecular responses to low concentrations of inorganic phosphate are better understood in Arabidopsis whereas several information gaps still exist in crops . In addition rice has invaluable socio economic importance and is a crop model system for studies on Pi starvation responses due to its high tolerance to Pi deprivation . Thus unraveling the mechanisms related to Pi starvation in rice is extremely important for plant breeding and agronomic productivity and sustainability . In this review we discuss the recent progress and remaining gaps of knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of sensing and signaling Pi starvation in rice . By exploring publicly available transcriptomic data we propose new functions on Pi metabolism for previously known genes and pinpoint attention worthy genes with unknown function although evidently regulated under Pi starvation . Orthologs of the promising Pi responsive genes with unclear function identified in rice roots were also discussed in the context of other crops . New strategies to increase global food productivity by improving Pi uptake in rice and possibly in other crops are proposed .
