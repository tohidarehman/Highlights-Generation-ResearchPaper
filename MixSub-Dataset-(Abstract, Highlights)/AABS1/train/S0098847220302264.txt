 Aquaporins are the membrane channels that facilitate the transportation of water and small neutral molecules in plants . As such they play an important role in stress tolerance . This function may be more pronounced in woody plants which must efficiently absorb water and transport it over long distances . Therefore a functional analysis of plasma membrane aquaporins under drought stress can provide insights into the roles of these proteins in woody plants . In this work we obtained 15 members of the
