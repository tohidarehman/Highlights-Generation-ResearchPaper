 Drought is a severe environmental stress that limits plant growth and productivity . Plant hormones play a key role in response to biological and abiotic stresses . And phytohormones can regulate stomatal opening and transpiration for improving water use efficiency under water stress conditions . In this study

@highlight A drought tolerance gene
@highlight was isolated from
@highlight was localized to the nucleus and bound to the
@highlight  promoter.
@highlight induced SA biosynthesis to increase ROS accumulation leading to smaller stomatal aperture under drought stress.
@highlight Overexpression
@highlight improves drought tolerance in poplar.
