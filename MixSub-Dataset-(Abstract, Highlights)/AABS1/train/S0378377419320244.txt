 This paper examines the adoption of irrigation technologies and the underlying diversity in terms of intensity of adoption in 2 irrigated valleys in Central Chile . Results show a low and narrow range of adoption with only 30 of farmers adopting technologies . Through a Latent Class Analysis 2 types of farmers were identified a small group comprising moderate to intensive users and a second one consisting of the majority of farmers mostly constrained in natural capital . Furthermore the econometric analysis indicates that education diversification continuous access to water and perception of water reliability increase the adoption . Conversely higher water land ratios presence of community reservoirs and earthen canals reduce the uptake . Overall the dominance of fruit and horticulture production access to agricultural credits and full irrigation of the farm are the main drivers of adoption . The latter is a critical factor indicating a relative abundance of water resources which alongside contextual characteristics discourages farmers from implementing technologies . The low adoption rate as well as the hindering factors will challenge public and private organizations to design and implement policies aiming to improve water reliability and management . To generate incentives and increase awareness on the scarcity of the resource in the light of the predicted reductions in water availability because of climate change will be crucial as well .

@highlight Low and narrow level of adoption. Most of farmers not implementing technologies.
@highlight Farmers farm and water community characteristics affect irrigation adoption.
@highlight Relative abundance of the resource discourages the adoption of technologies.
@highlight Irrigating the whole farm produces the largest negative effect on adoption.
