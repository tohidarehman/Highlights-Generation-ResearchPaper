 Understanding the myriad reasons why people value protected areas provides insight on how to align the decisions made by public land management agencies with diverse stakeholder interests . This study drew on survey data collected within the context of Denali National Park and Preserve to better understand the spatial dynamics of social values reported by frontcountry and backcountry recreationists that held differing degrees of local knowledge . Using a Public Participation in Geographic Information Systems exercise and Social Values for Ecosystem Services mapping application we observed differences in the point allocation and spatial distribution of social values associated with a protected area landscape . Wilderness aesthetics and ecological integrity were the primary social values embodied by places within Denali . Backcountry recreationists engaged with a broader range of values and derived deeper benefits from recreation and therapeutic qualities of the landscape whereas frontcountry recreationists expressed multiple concentrated values for places in Denali that were accessible and symbolically important . We also observed that local knowledge provided a useful basis for better understanding social values yet variation in knowledge was not spatially manifested . Our findings therefore advance the spatial prioritization of conservation initiatives that aim to represent and legitimize the voices of stakeholders in protected areas .
