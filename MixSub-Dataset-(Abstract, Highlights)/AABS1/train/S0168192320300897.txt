 Dust storms in Northwest China are a major component of global dust storms and it is important to be able to identify and quantitatively analyze their dust trajectories . In this study the dust events sources and transport paths in the Hexi Corridor were identified using ground measured PM

@highlight A new method for determining dust trajectories is proposed.
@highlight Five main areas that affect the hexi region are identified.
@highlight Two desert areas have the largest contributions to dust in the hexi region.
