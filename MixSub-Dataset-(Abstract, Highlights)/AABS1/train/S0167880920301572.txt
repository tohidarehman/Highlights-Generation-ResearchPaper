 In spite of the large number of studies conducted on the drivers of soil organic carbon stocks there is still no consensus on the impact of tillage on the distribution and turnover rate of SOC in the soil profile . Few studies have characterized precisely the turnover of SOC using

@highlight SOC stocks 060cm did not differ between tillage treatments after 47 years.
@highlight C mineralization rates in each soil layer were calculated using 13C natural tracing.
@highlight C mineralization rates were correlated with C inputs but not with tillage intensity.
@highlight AMG model could reproduce the evolution of SOC and C4 stocks in the soil profile.
@highlight Reduced tillage increased mineralization rate in the topsoil and decreased it below.
