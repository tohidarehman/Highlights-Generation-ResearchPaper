 The conversion of primary forest to other types of land cover such as pasture and agriculture in Amazonia affects regional carbon and water balances significantly contributing to increased carbon emissions and reduced evapotranspiration . However secondary forest growth resulting from the abandonment of low productivity pasture areas offers a potential alternative to counterbalance the effects of deforestation on carbon release to the atmosphere and evapotranspiration reduction . In this work we present four years of eddy flux measurements of a SF that is approximately 20 years old located in Central Amazonia and we compare these measurements with those of a PF in the same region analyzing daily and seasonal variations in evapotranspiration gross primary productivity of carbon and water use efficiency . On average evapotranspiration is 20 higher in the SF 3.6mm day

@highlight We compare 4 years of eddy flux data of secondary and primary forest in Amazonia.
@highlight Evapotranspiration in secondary forest is 20 higher than in primary forest.
@highlight GPP is higher in secondary forest at lower percentage than the ET difference.
@highlight Average albedo is similar at both sites but peaks earlier in the primary forest.
