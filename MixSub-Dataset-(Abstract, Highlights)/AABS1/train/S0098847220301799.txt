 As tropospheric ozone is increasingly posing Asian rice production at risk the breeding of novel adapted varieties is required . In this study we investigated sequence polymorphisms in the

@highlight Polymorphisms in the 5 UTR and promoter sequence of the
@highlight gene correlate with ozone tolerance in rice.
@highlight These sequence variation affect the expression of
@highlight ozone inducible oxidative stress and growth retardation.
@highlight Sensitive alleles contain
@highlight  elements recognized by WOX and ZF HD type transcription factors contrary to tolerant alleles.
