 Aquaculture effluent irrigation has been widely adopted to replace freshwater irrigation to save water and providing additional fertilizer to the crop . There is limited information on the performance of fertilizer supply levels under fishpond effluent irrigation . The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of reducing a rate of fertilizer on the purification of wastewater from fishponds by paddy fields and the yield of rice under fishpond effluent irrigation in central China in 2015 . The treatments included 100 80 and 60 of the normal fertilizer rate NFR 150kg N ha

@highlight Reduced normal fertilizer rate NFR by 2040 improved N and P removal efficiencies in the effluent from fishpond through paddy fields.
@highlight The increased N and P removal efficiencies were related to the lower N and P concentrations in the surface water of paddy fields and the efficient nutrients uptake by rice under the reduced NFR treatments.
@highlight Residual soil N and P in the 060cm soil depth after rice harvest decreased with the decreasing NFR under fishpond effluent irrigation.
@highlight Reduced the NFR by 20 without compromising rice yields under fishpond effluent irrigation.
