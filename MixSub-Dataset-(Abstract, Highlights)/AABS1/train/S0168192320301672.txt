 Addressing the impact of vegetation architecture on shortwave radiation transfer in land surface models is important for accurate weather forecasting carbon budget estimates and climate predictions . This paper investigates to what extent it is possible to retrieve structural parameters of two different parameterization schemes from direct transmittance derived from digital hemispherical photography and 3D radiative transfer modeling for two study sites with different vegetation canopy architectures . Neglecting the representation of 3D canopy structure in radiative transfer schemes leads to significant errors in shortwave radiation partitioning . Structural parameters referred to as whole canopy clumping indices were obtained in order to evaluate the impact of angular variation in clumping on shortwave radiation transfer . Impacts on photosynthesis were evaluated at site level with the UKESM land surface model JULES . A comparison between flux tower derived and modeled photosynthesis indicates that considering zenith angular variations of structural parameters in the radiative transfer scheme of the UKESM land surface model significantly improves photosynthesis prediction in light limited ecosystems from RMSE 2.91 mol CO
