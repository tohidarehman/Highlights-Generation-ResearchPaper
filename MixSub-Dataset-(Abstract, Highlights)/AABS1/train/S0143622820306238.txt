 The emergence of the novel Coronavirus Disease in late 2019 and subsequent pandemic led to an immense disruption in the daily lives of almost everyone on the planet . Faced with the consequences of inaction most national governments responded with policies that restricted the activities conducted by their inhabitants . As schools and businesses shuttered the mobility of these people decreased . This reduction in mobility and related activities was recorded through ubiquitous location enabled personal mobile devices . Patterns emerged that varied by place based activity . In this work the differences in these place based activity patterns are investigated across nations specifically by focusing on the relationship between government enacted policies and changes in community activity patterns . By addressing five research questions we show that people s activity response to government action varies widely both across nations as well as regionally within them . Three assessment measures namely cosine similarity lag response and subregional variation are devised and the results correlate with a number of global indices . We discuss these findings and the relationship between government action and residents response .
