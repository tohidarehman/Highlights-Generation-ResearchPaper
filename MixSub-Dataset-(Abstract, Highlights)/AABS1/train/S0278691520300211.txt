 Tebuconazole is an effective systemic fungicide that belongs to the triazoles family . It has been widely used in both agricultural and medical sectors for the control of fungal diseases . Although TEB poses serious threats to mammals health studies regarding its cardiotoxicity are very limited . Thus we aimed to evaluate the effects of TEB on some biochemical parameters the induction of apoptosis and DNA damage in the heart tissue . Male Wistar rats were treated with TEB at varied oral doses for 28 consecutive days . This study demonstrates that TEB decreased cardiac acetylcholinesterase increased serum marker enzymes such as creatinine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase and altered the lipid profile by increasing serum levels of total cholesterol triglyceride low density lipoprotein cholesterol and reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels . Furthermore TEB increased levels of p53 and Bax Bcl2 ratio released the cytochrome
