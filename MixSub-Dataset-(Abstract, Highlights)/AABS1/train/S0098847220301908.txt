 is a mountain tropical landscape occurring in Brazil . It is considered one of the most biologically diverse ecosystems in the world and a major center of endemism . This review addresses the particularities and crucial roles that environmental signaling plays in germination longevity and dormancy cycles of seeds of tropical species from

@highlight Germination temperature thresholds are related to moisture in the microhabitats.
@highlight ABA mediates interactions between light and temperature to germinate.
@highlight Most species from
@highlight can form long term persistent soil seed banks.
@highlight Cyclical dormancy is highly synchronized with the soil moisture seasonality.
@highlight Induction of secondary dormancy is related to low GA levels rather than high ABA.
