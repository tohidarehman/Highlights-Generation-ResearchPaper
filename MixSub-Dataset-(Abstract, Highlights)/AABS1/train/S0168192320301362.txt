 Climate change will likely intensify water shortages so more attention should be given to the efficient use of agricultural water in agricultural production especially under rainfed conditions . Therefore studying and understanding crop water consumption amounts and patterns is of great importance . However the amount of water consumed by the component crops in strip intercropping systems has received little attention . To close this knowledge gap a two year field experiment of sole wheat

@highlight Intercropped wheat had higher water use efficiency than sole wheat.
@highlight Wheat outcompeted maize for soil water during the co growth period.
@highlight Transpiration was higher in wheat border rows than sole wheat especially during the dry period.
@highlight A method for evapotranspiration partitioning in wheat maize strips was proposed.
