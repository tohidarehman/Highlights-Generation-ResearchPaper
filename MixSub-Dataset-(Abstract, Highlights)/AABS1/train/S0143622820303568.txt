 Maintaining enough green areas and ensuring fair access to them is a common planning challenge in growing and densifying cities . Evaluations of green area access typically use metrics like population around green areas but these do not fully ensure equitable access . We propose that using systematic and complementarity driven spatial prioritization often used in nature conservation planning could assist in the complex planning challenge . Here we demonstrate the use of spatial prioritization to identify green areas with highest recreational potential based on their type and their accessibility for the residents of the Helsinki Metropolitan area the capital district of Finland . We calculated travel times from each city district to each green area . Travel times were calculated separately to local green areas using active travel modes and to large forests using public transport . We prioritized the green areas using these multimodal travel times from each district and weighting the prioritization with population data with Zonation conservation prioritization software . Compared to a typical buffer analysis our approach identified areas of high recreational potential in different parts of the study area . This approach allows systematic integration of travel time based accessibility measures into equitable spatial prioritization of recreational green areas . It can help urban planners to identify sets of green areas that best support the recreational needs of the residents across the city .

@highlight We demonstrated spatial prioritization for fair access to green areas.
@highlight We analyzed accessibility using different travel modes covering the whole city area.
@highlight Our method provides more equitable solutions than a typical buffer method.
