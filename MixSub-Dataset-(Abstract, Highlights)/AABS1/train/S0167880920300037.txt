 Soil arthropods with a body size of more than 2 mm are a significant component of terrestrial ecosystems and play an important role in biogeochemical cycles . Understanding the spatial distribution of soil arthropods is crucial for biodiversity conservation and land remediation . Studies on the spatial distribution of soil arthropods have mostly been performed at a small scale . However due to the difficulties in obtaining soil arthropods research on their spatial distribution patterns at a large scale is scarce and the details remain unclear . Therefore it is important to clarify the spatial distribution pattern of soil arthropods at a large scale and the influence of environmental variables on them to develop targeted protection measures . In this study we used a random forest model combined with environmental variables to map the spatial distribution of soil arthropods in cultivated land in Changtu County China and evaluated the prediction accuracy of the model . In addition we ranked the relative importance of environmental variables to understand their influence on the spatial distribution of soil arthropods . The results showed the following 1 The mean absolute prediction error was 13.9 the root mean square error was 21.5 R

@highlight Establish and evaluate a predictive random forest model to extrapolate the distribution of soil arthropods at a large scale.
@highlight Determine the environment variables affecting the spatial distribution of soil arthropods.
@highlight Results show that the random forest model can effectively predict the spatial distribution of soil arthropods on a large scale.
@highlight The nature index of cultivated land was the most important variable for the spatial distribution of soil arthropods.
@highlight The prediction results showed that the number of soil arthropods in Changtu County China were at a low level.
