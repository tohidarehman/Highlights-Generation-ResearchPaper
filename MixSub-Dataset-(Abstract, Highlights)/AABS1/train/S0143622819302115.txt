 Our research seeks to expand existing knowledge of travel behavior and decision making in avalanche terrain . We have done this by using GPS tracking to observe the travel behavior of out of bounds skiers and collecting survey data to investigate their terrain choices . We sampled participants in the field by distributing hand held GPS units and surveys along the southern boundary of Bridger Bowl Ski Area Southwest Montana USA . In total we used data from 136 participants that volunteered over the course of 19 field days from February 2017 to February 2018 . We analyzed the resulting GPS data using a GIS and we derived terrain metrics from elevation and land cover data . We fit a multiple linear regression model using GPS track downhill starting distance from the ski area boundary as the response variable and survey responses interaction with complex avalanche terrain weather conditions and avalanche hazard level as explanatory variables . This approach evaluates travel behavior as a function of human factors terrain weather and snowpack providing a holistic perspective on decision making drivers . Our results show that gender

@highlight Applied Avalanche Terrain Exposure Scale to quantify risk due to avalanches.
@highlight Low cost method for GPS data collection on recreational travel behavior.
@highlight Skiers less prepared and knowledgeable about avalanche danger than expected.
@highlight High incidence of skiers travelling without a partner in backcountry terrain.
@highlight Survey assessed human factors correlated with higher risk travel behavior.
