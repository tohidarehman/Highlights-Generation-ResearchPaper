 Microbial functional genes can reflect the nutrient cycle activities in soil because they encode various enzymes involved in the material cycle . Therefore the gene abundance variation can reveal the impact of interference on the material cycle of grassland . To study the cycle of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus between plant and soil in grassland under different grazing regimes we investigated the soil microbial functional genes related to C N and P cycling by high throughput quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA based Illumina sequencing analysis under grazing exclusion rotational grazing and continuous grazing in alpine meadow of the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau where climate is characterized by little rain and low temperature and grassland is very sensitive to grazing . The results showed at the early grazing period C fixtion

@highlight The effect of grazing regime on functional genes were different at distinct grazing period.
@highlight Grazing regime affected the temporal variation of soil microbial functional genes.
@highlight Grazing rather than exclosure promote C fixation and decomposition and N cycling.
@highlight There existed trade offs between plant and soil nutrients along the grazing time.
@highlight Continuous grazing promoted CH
@highlight metabolism.
