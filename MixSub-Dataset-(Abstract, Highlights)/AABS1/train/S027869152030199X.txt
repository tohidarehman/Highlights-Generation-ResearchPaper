 The study aimed to investigate the ameliorative effect of salidroside on the crosstalk among liver metabonomics gut barrier function and bile acids in furan induced mice . Forty male mice were randomly divided into the following five groups CON FUR 8 SAL 10 SAL 20 and SAL 40 . Mice were administered with furan for 30 days and SAL was administered for 15 days from day 16 . Principal components analysis and heatmap were employed to probe metabonomics profile alterations in liver tissues and select thirty eight potential biomarkers . Pathway analysis revealed primary bile acids were largely changed in the biosynthesis pathway . Moreover SAL regulated the activation of farnesoid X receptor downregulating hepatic heterodimer partner upregulating cholesterol 7a hydroxylase as well as decreasing the expression of portal fibroblast growth factor 15 compared to the furan treated group . Importantly SAL dramatically increased the level of tight junction proteins as immunohistochemistry results show . In conclusion the ameliorative effects of SAL on liver damage induced by furan might be due to altered gut barrier function while FXR signaling acted a significant role in the function of SAL .

@highlight Thirty eight metabolites were identified by LC MS system in FUR 8 group.
@highlight As the dose increasing SAL altered at least 9 metabolites compared to FUR 8 group.
@highlight SAL changed the primary bile acids pathway compared to FUR 8 group.
@highlight SAL improved liver injury caused by furan by affecting gut barrier function.
