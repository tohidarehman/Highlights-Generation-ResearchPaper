 This study aims at evaluating the impact of counterweighted spheres on evaporation loss in agricultural reservoirs . To this end water temperatures were measured in two evaporatorsone covered with spheres and the other uncovered . Results reveal that during the irrigation period the average evaporation reduction rate under the coverage of counterweighted spheres equaled 70.6 average growth rate of the evaporation driving force equaled 19.2 and average rate of mass transfer coefficient reduction equaled 75.3 . Between April and August the observed difference in water surface temperature between the covered and uncovered groups was significant compared to that during other months . Likewise for both groups the water temperature was observed to increase between March and July and reduce between August and October . For the covered group significant stratification of water temperature was observed between March to July and the observed difference between the surface temperature

@highlight Evaporation results in serious water loss from the surface of an agricultural reservoir.
@highlight Impact of counterweighted spheres on loss of water due to evaporation was studied.
@highlight Sphere coverage reduced evaporation and net radiation.
@highlight Saved agricultural water could be further utilized in irrigation areas.
@highlight The approach is economically feasible based on net profit per cubic meter of water.
