 Metabolic syndrome is characterized by increased abdominal fat dyslipidemia diabetes mellitus and hypertension . A high MetS prevalence is strongly associated with obesity . Obesity is a public health problem in which several complex factors have been implicated including environmental pollutants . For instance maternal smoking seems to play a role in obesogenesis in childhood . Given the association between endocrine disruptors obesity and metabolic programming over the past 10 years our research group has contributed to studies based on the hypothesis that early exposure to nicotine tobacco causes offspring to become MetS prone . The mechanism by which tobacco smoking during breastfeeding induces metabolic dysfunctions is not completely understood however increased metabolic programming has been shown in studies that focus on this topic . Here we reviewed the literature mainly based in light of our latest data from experimental models . Nicotine or tobacco exposure during breastfeeding induces several endocrine dysfunctions in a sex and tissue specific manner . This review provides an updated summary regarding the hypothesis that early exposure to nicotine tobacco causes offspring to become MetS prone . An understanding of this issue can provide support to prevent long term disorders mainly related to the risk of obesity and its comorbidities in future generations .

@highlight Metabolic syndrome and obesity are linked with endocrine disruptors exposure.
@highlight Tobacco during critical phases of life leads to metabolic dysfunctions later in life.
@highlight Nicotine and tobacco exposure during lactation cause different effects in offspring.
@highlight Experimental models in this area could be the key for further clinic investigations.
