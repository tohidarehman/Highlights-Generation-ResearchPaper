 Determining the mechanism of rocky desertification by investigating the sediment transport process in carbonate aquifers with the great mixture of various karst conduit features presents severe difficulties . This study put its focus on the overlying soil entering the master small scale surface karst negative feature the tapering grike on limestone hillslopes . The objective is to assess the primary forms and the annual rates of underground soil loss relative to the crown cross section of the grikes wall . The tapering grikes were differentiated into the fully and partially filled ones based on the current filling status of the soil . Through the analysis of the possible scenarios the stable carbon isotope and

@highlight Underground soil loss relative to the crown cross section of grike wall is defined.
@highlight Underground soil loss form via fully filled grike is overlying soil moving down.
@highlight Underground soil loss form via partially filled grike is eroded soil depositing.
@highlight The annual underground soil loss intensity via the sample grikes was strong.
