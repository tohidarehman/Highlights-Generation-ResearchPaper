 Phenolic root exudates released from plants are potentially effective for the degradation of aromatic compounds yet the inherent process and mechanism remain insufficiently elucidated . In this study we selected four representative PREs of

@highlight Some PREs can enrich PTBP degrading bacteria and accelerate PTBP biodegradation.
@highlight Monohydroxy PREs can promote hydroxylation of PTBP but ortho dihydroxy PREs cannot.
@highlight Functional structure of PREs may decide the co metabolism effect of PTBP.
