 Arbuscular mycorrhizas enhance the drought tolerance of host plants through several underlying mechanisms . Polyamines are known to protect plant cells from the damages of drought by enhancing the antioxidant defense system restricting ethylene synthesis maintaining cell pH and ion homeostasis preventing chlorophyll loss and so on concomitantly the mechanism through which arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi modulate PA metabolism to enhance drought tolerance of plants remains unclear . A pot experiment was conducted to assess how an AM fungus

@highlight This study analyzed how PAs were involved in AMF enhanced drought tolerance of plants.
@highlight AM trifoliate orange had higher Put and Cad and lower Spd and Spm under drought.
@highlight Mycorrhizal plants had higher activity of PA catabolic enzymes and Put synthetase.
@highlight AM plants showed overexpression of
@highlight  and
@highlight under DS.
@highlight AM plants represented down regulated expression of
@highlight under DS.
