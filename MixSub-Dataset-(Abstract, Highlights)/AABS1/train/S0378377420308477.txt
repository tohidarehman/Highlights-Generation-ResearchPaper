 Successive pig slurry applications can substantially increase phosphorus movement due to leaching mainly in sandy soils found in areas presenting high rainfall rates . The aim of the current study was to assess the transference of different P forms through leachate in a soil managed under no tillage system in a crop rotation system subjected to successive PS applications . The study was carried out from 2005 to 2007 the studied site presents Typic Hapludalf soil and its mean annual rainfall reaches 1 769 mm . The study adopted PS doses 0 20 40 and 80 m

@highlight High and frequent pig slurry application increase leaching of P.
@highlight P was transferred via leaching mainly in the particulate form.
@highlight On average P loss by leaching was 0.2 kg ha
@highlight year
@highlight or 0.07 of total P applied.
@highlight P concentrations in the leached solution exceeded the environment critical limit.
