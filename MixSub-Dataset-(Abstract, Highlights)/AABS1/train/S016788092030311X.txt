 Enhancing agrobiodiversity offers a suite of functions key to the sustainability of low input agroecosystems . The pairing of shade trees in pan tropical tree crop systems represents one of the most common and widespread applications of agroecosystem diversification yet given the vastly heterogeneous conditions in which shade tree selection is made generalizable advances in the identification of suitably paired tree crop and shade tree is essential for performance and adoption . Here we determine the phylogenetic distance between 78 reported shade tree genera and the dominant tree crop
