 Ingestion of deoxynivalenol one of the most common mycotoxin contaminants of cereals leads to adverse effects for animal and human health . Bacterial biotransformation is a strategy to mitigate the toxicity of this mycotoxin . The present study aims to evaluate the toxicity of two bacterial biotranformation products of DON 3 epi deoxynivalenol and de epoxy deoxynivalenol through zootechnical hematological histological and immunological assays . Twenty four 4 weeks old piglets received a control diet or a diet contaminated with 3mgkg

@highlight Ingestion of DON induces tissue changes and overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines and cell junction proteins in pigs.
@highlight Bacterial biotransformation seems to be a sustainable alternative to reduce mycotoxintoxicity
