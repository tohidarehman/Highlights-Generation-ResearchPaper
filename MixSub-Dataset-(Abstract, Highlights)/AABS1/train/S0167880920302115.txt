 Karst ecosystem services the key components of global terrestrial ESs play a crucial role in human welfare and livelihood . However the spatiotemporal changes of ecosystem service values in the karst areas of China remain unclear . In this paper land use land cover data were used to estimate the ESVs changes during 19922015 by the benefit transfer method to reveal its spatial heterogeneity and to explain the sensitivity of ESVs to land use change . The results indicated that the ESVs were increased by US 23.42 billion at 0.10 yr

@highlight We found the ESV increased by US 23.42 billion from 1992 to 2015 in karst areas.
@highlight The contribution rate of regulating service function was 69 .
@highlight The implementation of ecological project has a positive impact on ESV in karst areas.
@highlight The ESV appeared to be more sensitive to bidirectional land transfer.
