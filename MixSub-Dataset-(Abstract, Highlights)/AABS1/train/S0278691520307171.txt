 Acteoside is one of the most widespread phenylethanoid glycosides with pharmacological activities including antioxidant neuroprotective property etc . However its bioavailability is poor due to the low absorption and P gp efflux . This study aimed to select food derived P gp inhibitors for promoting the acteoside absorption and investigate whether the inhibitors could increase the bioavailability and stability of acteoside . Results showed that EGCG and quercetin significantly decreased the BL to AP efflux and promoted the AP to BL influx of acteoside across Caco 2 monolayers with optimum concentrations of 320M EGCG or 240M quercetin adding to 320M acteoside . EGCG increased the bioavailability of acteoside to 1.43 fold but quercetin had no such effect . Further study showed that EGCG and quercetin had no effects on the storage and digestion stability of acteoside . This work revealed that EGCG could improve the acteoside absorption across the Caco 2 monolayers and enhance the bioavailability of acteoside in rats .

@highlight EGCG and quercetin decreased the efflux and promoted the influx of acteoside.
@highlight Adding 320M EGCG or 240M quercetin enhanced acteoside absorption optimally.
@highlight EGCG increased the bioavailability of acteoside in rats to 1.43 fold.
