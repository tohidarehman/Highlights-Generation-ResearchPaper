 Fluctuating light can cause selective photoinhibition of photosystem I in angiosperms . However the strategies for photosynthetic regulation under fluctuating light in wild epiphytic plants are little known . We here compared PSI and PSII performances under fluctuating light in the epiphytic orchid

@highlight shows a rapid oxidation of P700 upon dark to light transition.
@highlight shows a rapid oxidation of PSI upon an increase in illumination.
@highlight Water water cycle leads to the rapid oxidation of PSI in
@highlight WWC is more effective in protecting PSI under fluctuating light than CET.
@highlight Sensitivity of PSI to fluctuating light can be altered by WWC activity.
