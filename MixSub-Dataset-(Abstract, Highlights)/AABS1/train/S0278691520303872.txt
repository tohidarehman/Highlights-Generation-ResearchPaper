 The highest human exposures to the plasticizer di phthalate occur through intravenous exposure from medical procedures . Rodent toxicity studies mainly using oral exposures have identified male reproductive toxicity after developmental exposure to DEHP as the primary concern . Other organs are also affected by DEHP and route may influence the degree of target organ involvement . Cammack et al . reported a critical study focused on testicular toxicity using oral and iv exposures of neonatal Sprague Dawley rats to 60 300 or 600mg kg body weight day DEHP in Intralipid vehicle . The present study followed the same dosing paradigm and included assessment of additional organs to evaluate the potential utility of this design for DEHP alternatives . Reduction of testis weight was observed in all DEHP treatment groups and germ cell and Sertoli cell toxicity was observed at the two highest doses with both routes . Lung granulomas occurred in all iv DEHP groups possibly related to increased fat particle size in DEHP lipid emulsions . Lung alveolar development was inhibited after both oral and iv high dose DEHP . Toxicity of oral Intralipid vehicle was observed in germ and Sertoli cells . The lack of such effects after iv vehicle exposure suggested that this may be a gut mediated effect .

@highlight Medical procedures using parenteral routes result in the highest human exposures to DEHP.
@highlight This study extended a previous study that compared the effects of oral and iv DEHP in developing rats.
@highlight Adverse effects in testis and possibly lung were observed in all DEHP dose groups and dosing routes.
@highlight Oral but not iv Intralipid vehicle produced adverse effects in testis suggesting gut mediation.
