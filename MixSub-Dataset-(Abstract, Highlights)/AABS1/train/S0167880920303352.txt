 In any given watershed riparian buffer systems can influence terrestrial carbon sequestration and potentially enhance terrestrial C sinks . This study looked at the effects of soil texture vegetation type and age on C stock sequestration in eight RBSs located within the Grand River Watershed southern Ontario Canada and compared the C stock with adjacent agricultural fields . Soil organic carbon stocks on an equivalent mass basis were significantly higher in mature buffers 192.7 Mg C ha

@highlight Soil organic carbon stock is higher in riparian soils compared to agricultural soils.
@highlight Biomass and soil carbon concentrations are higher in deciduous than coniferous buffers.
@highlight Total carbon stocks are higher in deciduous tree buffers established in clayey soils.
