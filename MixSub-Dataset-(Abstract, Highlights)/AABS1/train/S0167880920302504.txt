 Excessive inputs of sediment and acceleration of primary production have been observed worldwide in a large number of water bodies . Human environment interactions were recognized as one of the main drivers of this evolution during the 20th century with the occurrence of major landscape changes and a greater use of agricultural inputs .

@highlight Sediment cores were collected in ponds draining contrasted agricultural catchments.
@highlight Paleproductivity was reconstructed during the 20th century based on multiproxy sediment analysis.
@highlight Between 1950 and 1965 organic matter was mainly supplied by terrigenous sources.
@highlight After 1970 acceleration of primary production was recorded in water bodies
@highlight Autochthonous production was highly correlated to the use of N fertilizers for the 19501990 period.
