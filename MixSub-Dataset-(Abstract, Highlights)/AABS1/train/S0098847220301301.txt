 Zinc is one of the most widespread transition metals in plants and Zn deficiency has many adverse effects on plant productivity and human health . The zinc homeostasis system is actively studied however the mechanisms underlying regulation of Zn homeostasis have not been fully elucidated . Two potential ways to assess cellular Zn homeostasis are to sense changes in the free Zn

@highlight Free Zn
@highlight levels regulate the expression of Zn homeostasis genes in Arabidopsis cells.
@highlight Zn deficiency influences protein folding in the cytosol of Arabidopsis cells.
@highlight mRNA degradation of Zn homeostasis genes is influenced by free Zn
