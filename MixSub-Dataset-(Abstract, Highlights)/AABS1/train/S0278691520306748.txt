 It was generally accepted as a default assumption that No Observed Adverse Effect Levels or Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Levels in long term toxicity studies are lower than in short term ones i.e . the toxic potency increases with prolonged exposure duration . Recent studies on pesticides and industrial chemicals reported that subacute subchronic or chronic NOAELs LOAELs are similar when study design factors are appropriately considered . We investigated whether these findings also apply to certain food constituents . After reviewing subchronic and chronic toxicity studies on more than 100 compounds a total of 32 compounds could be included in the analysis . Geometric mean values of subchronic vs. chronic NOAEL or LOAEL ratios ranged from 1.0 to 2.0 with a geometric standard deviation from 2.2 to 4.2 which is consistent with data reported in the literature . While for many of the investigated compounds the ratio is around 1 suggesting that health based guidance values could appropriately be derived from subchronic toxicity studies our study also identified some substances with higher ratios leading to a GM of around 2 . The EFSA Scientific Committee suggested to apply an uncertainty factor of 2 to extrapolate from subchronic to chronic studies and as a precautionary approach we concur with this suggestion .
