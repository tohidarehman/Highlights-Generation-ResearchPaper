 Salt marshes are highly productive ecosystems and yet we have only a preliminary understanding of how net ecosystem exchange varies on daily and seasonal time scales . We used the eddy covariance method to examine the behaviour of the net ecosystem exchange as influenced by tidal flooding in daytime conditions in a coastal salt marsh dominated by

@highlight NEE during neap tides was 60 greater than during spring high tides
@highlight The effect of tidal flooding on NEE varied with the degree of plant inundation
@highlight The highest CO
@highlight flux reductions were observed in early and peak growing seasons
@highlight Daytime CO
@highlight flux was reduced 20 60 in the peak growing season due to tidal flooding
