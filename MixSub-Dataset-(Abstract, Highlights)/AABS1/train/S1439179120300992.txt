 Bats play an important role as predators of insect populations but are threatened by a variety of factors including the loss of foraging habitat and insect declines . Knowledge on trophic interactions foraging strategies and hunting areas is key to understanding the ecology of bat species to assess their impact on ecosystems and to optimize conservation strategies . We investigated seasonal trends in the diet of two nursery colonies of the serotine bat

@highlight First high resolution dietary analysis of the serotine bat 
@highlight  .
@highlight Detection of 254 taxa at species or genus level of 13 arthropod orders indicates a generalistic diet and the use of a broad variety of foraging habitats.
@highlight Equal use of Coleoptera Diptera and Lepidoptera contradicting previous morphological dietary analyses that had shown beetles to be the most relevant prey.
@highlight Among the most frequently detected prey taxa were many pests of agriculture and forestry.
@highlight Seasonal variations in prey diversity and prey composition were mainly determined by the phenology of available prey.
