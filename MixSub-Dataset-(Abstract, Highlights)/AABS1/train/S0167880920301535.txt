 Nitrogen fertilization is an important agricultural management practice that greatly affects soil carbon storage through regulating the balance of soil C input and output especially for agroecosystems with simultaneous straw incorporation . However little is known about how different NF rates affect soil C balance in flooded paddy ecosystems with SI . We conducted a two year field experiment in a typical ricewheat cropping system in southern China to investigate the response of soil C input and SI output and NECB and N losses under five different NF rates 0 0 120 90 180 135 240 180 and 300 225kg N ha

@highlight Higher increase in SOC was achieved by optimizing N rate in the ricewheat system.
@highlight Higher SOC increase in the optimized N rate was due to greater soil C input and lower C output.
@highlight Optimizing N rate can also ensure food security and decrease N pollution while increasing soil C sequestration.
