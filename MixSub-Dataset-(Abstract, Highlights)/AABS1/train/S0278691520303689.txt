 Bisphenol A is an industrial chemical used in the production of various plastic materials . It is associated with reproductive immunological and neurological disorders . Luteolin a flavonoid found in fruits and vegetables possesses anti oxidative anti inflammatory and free radical scavenging properties . Here we carried out studies to ascertain if Luteolin would ameliorate BPA induced toxicity in

@highlight Bisphenol A BPA induced oxidative damage in
@highlight BPA inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity and induced locomotor deficit in
@highlight BPA reduced cell viability and abrogated survival rate in
@highlight Luteolin suppressed BPA induced toxicity improved survival and locomotor capacity in
@highlight Hence Luteolin is an effective antioxidant and chemoprotective agent against BPA induced toxicity.
