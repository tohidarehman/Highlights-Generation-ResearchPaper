 There is growing evidence that boron and B compounds are essential nutrients for animals and humans . Besides B compounds have been suggested to treat inflammation and oxidative stress . As a part of our Boron Project II on B exposed persons in Bandrma and Bigadic between 2014 and 2017 anti oxidant pro oxidant and inflammatory parameters were assessed . In this first large scale human study biomarkers of oxidative stress such as the enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase catalase glutathione peroxidase glutathione reductase and the levels of malondialdehyde glutathione and 8 hydroxy 2 deoxy guanosine were investigated in relation to B exposure . The immune biomarkers interleukin 1ra IL 6 IL 8 and nuclear factor kappa B levels were included . There was no influence of human exposure to B on the parameters of oxidative stress and inflammation .

@highlight Boron compounds have been suggested to treat inflammation and oxidative stress.
@highlight It is obvious that Boron exposure did not increase oxidative stress and inflammatory parameters in Boron exposed females and males.
