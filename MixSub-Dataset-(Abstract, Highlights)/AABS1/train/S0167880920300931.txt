 Roller crimping of cover crops grown during winter may facilitate reduced tillage efforts in organic vegetable production . A one year field experiment was conducted twice in sandy loam soil in Denmark testing two cover crop termination systems roller crimping without tillage before crop planting and full incorporation by tillage of mowed cover crops in organic white cabbage

@highlight Roller crimping cover crops reduced cabbage yield compared to full incorporation.
@highlight Legume rye mixtures reduced available N and cabbage root growth compared to legumes.
@highlight Roller crimping reduced soil microbial activity compared to full incorporation.
@highlight Roller crimping suggested reduced N leaching risk during winter.
@highlight Roller crimping suppressed weed emergence by 63 compared to full incorporation.
