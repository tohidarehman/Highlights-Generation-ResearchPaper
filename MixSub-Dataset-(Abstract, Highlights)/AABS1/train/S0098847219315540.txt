 Galactinol synthase is a crucial enzyme of raffinose family oligosaccharides biosynthesis essentially catalyzes the first crucial step in the raffinose biosynthetic pathway . Galactinol and raffinose accumulation along with its higher homologs such as stachyose and verbascose has been considered to participate in plant abiotic stress tolerance . Previously we reported the function of chickpea galactinol synthase

@highlight is an ABA inducible gene.
@highlight over expression plants showed improved tolerance to the dehydration stress.
@highlight Transgenic lines accumulated less ROS under dehydration stress.
@highlight Galactinol synthase act as a positive regulator of dehydration stress response.
