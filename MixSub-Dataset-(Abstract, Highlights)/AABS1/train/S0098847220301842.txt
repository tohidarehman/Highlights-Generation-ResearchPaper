 Complex environmental interactions may modify toxicity of metals . We studied responses of the common medicinal plant chamomile to lead toxicity under nitrate sufficient or deficient conditions involving also inhibitor of the key phenolic enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase . Data indicate that N deficiency depleted nitrogenous but elevated phenolic metabolites or peroxidase activity and enhanced ROS formation evoked by Pb or AIP . Pb stimulated individual phenolic acids in the shoots but had no impact on total soluble phenols or flavonols where the impacts of AIP and N nutrition were more evident . Pb rather affected glutathione while N deficiency ascorbic and malic acids and the involvement of AIP in these changes was visible . PCA analyses showed clear separation with respect to N deficiency or AIP application . Besides application of AIP stimulated accumulation of Pb in shoots and in absorbed root fraction while N deficiency suppressed Pb amount in shoots and stimulated in roots . Our data to our knowledge for the first time confirm that uptake of metals is not only a simple function of its presence but that mineral nutrition and state of the secondary metabolism have crucial impact on resulting responses .

@highlight Impact of nitrate and phenolic inhibitor AIP on Pb toxicity was studied.
@highlight N deficit suppressed nitrogenous but elevated phenolic metabolites and GPX activity.
@highlight N deficit enhanced ROS but not nitric oxide formation evoked by Pb and AIP.
@highlight Pb affected GSH while N deficit ascorbate and malate and AIP modulated these changes.
@highlight AIP elevated Pb uptake but N deficit had the opposite impact in organs.
