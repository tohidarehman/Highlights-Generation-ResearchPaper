 Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of mortality in women . Lupiwighteone has anticancer effects in prostate cancer cells and neuroblastoma cells . However the molecular and cellular mechanisms of lupiwighteone effects on human breast cancer cells are not as well known . In the present study we investigated the effects of lupiwighteone on the proliferation and apoptosis of two different human cancer cells MCF 7 an estrogen receptor positive human breast cancer cell and MDA MB 231 a triple negative human breast cancer cell . Lupiwighteone treatment decreased the viability of MCF 7 and MDA MB 231cells . Lupiwighteone treatment resulted in apoptotic cell death in breast cancer cells which was characterized by DNA fragmentation accumulation of apoptotic cells and nuclear condensation . We also showed that treatment with lupiwighteone induced caspase dependent apoptosis induction of caspase independent apoptosis and inhibition of the PI3K Akt mTOR signaling pathway in both MCF 7 and MDA MB 231cells . These results suggest that lupiwighteone induces caspase dependent and independent apoptosis in both breast cancer cell lines via inhibiting PI3K Akt mTOR pathway .

@highlight The molecular and cellular mechanisms of lupiwighteone effects on human breast cancer cells are not well known.
@highlight The present study is the first to investigate induction of apoptotic mechanism by lupiwighteone in human breast cancer cells.
@highlight The present study revealed that lupiwighteone in breast cancer cells has nothing to do with hormones.
