 The timing and distribution of soil erosion in agroforestry landscapes in karst regions remains poorly understood at the watershed scale despite the recognized deleterious impacts of soil erosion . The aim of the research presented here is to understand multi scale soil erosion and its relationship with agricultural activities in an agroforestry catchment developed on limestone bedrock in southwest China . Soil erosion monitoring was carried out for runoff plots on the hillside of the basin and high frequency suspended sediment and discharge monitoring was carried out for the surface and underground rivers at the outlet of the basin . The results show that the annual sediment transport modulus in this catchment is extremely low 5.1Mg km

@highlight Underground soil leakage is a distinctive feature of soil loss in karst region of Southwest China.
@highlight Agricultural activities dominate the distribution pattern of soil erosion in karst watershed.
@highlight Runoff and soil erosion exhibited remarkable variation among different rainfall regimes.
@highlight River sediment transport modulus is comparable to the soil formation rate of pure carbonate.
