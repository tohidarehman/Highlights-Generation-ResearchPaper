 The existing information supports the use of this material as described in this safety assessment . 3 3 cyclohexene 1 carbonitrile was evaluated for genotoxicity repeated dose toxicity reproductive toxicity local respiratory toxicity phototoxicity photoallergenicity skin sensitization and environmental safety . Data show that 3 3 cyclohexene 1 carbonitrile is not genotoxic . Data show that there are no safety concerns for 3 3 cyclohexene 1 carbonitrile for skin sensitization under the current declared levels of use . The repeated dose reproductive and local respiratory toxicity endpoints were evaluated using the threshold of toxicological concern for a Cramer Class III material and the exposure to 3 3 cyclohexene 1 carbonitrile is below the TTC . The phototoxicity photoallergenicity endpoints were evaluated based on UV spectra 3 3 cyclohexene 1 carbonitrile is not expected to be phototoxic photoallergenic . The environmental endpoints were evaluated 3 3 cyclohexene 1 carbonitrile was found not to be persistent bioaccumulative and toxic as per the International Fragrance Association Environmental Standards and its risk quotients based on its current Volume of Use in Europe and North America are 1 .
