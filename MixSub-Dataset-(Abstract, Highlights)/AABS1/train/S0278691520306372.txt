 The aim of this study was to explore the toxicokinetics of diisobutyl phthalate and its major metabolite monoisobutyl phthalate by developing a UPLC ESI MS MS method for simultaneously measuring DiBP and MiBP in rat plasma urine feces and 11 different tissues . For the experiment 0.1 aqueous formic acid and acetonitrile mobile phase by gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.3mL min equipped with a KINETEX core shell C

@highlight The first study for simultaneous analysis of DiBP and MiBP in rat biological samples.
@highlight UPLC ESI MS MS development and validation for DiBP and MiBP in rat biological samples.
@highlight Well applied to
@highlight toxicokinetic and tissue distribution of DiBP and MiBP.
@highlight Rapid
@highlight metabolism of DiBP and considerable tissue distribution of MiBP.
@highlight Useful for developing PBPK model for DiBP and its metabolite in future exposure study.
