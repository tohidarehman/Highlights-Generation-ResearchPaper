 Increasing irrigation efficiencies remains the focus of numerous efforts to mitigate water scarcity . In reality higher local efficiencies do often not reduce water scarcity but instead cause a redistribution of water flows when the entire irrigation scheme or river basin is considered . Insufficient understanding of consumed fractions and non consumptive use have led to ineffective or even harmful water conservation measures . In this paper we demonstrate a novel method for spatial quantification of the Consumed Fraction

@highlight Consumed Fractions CF of irrigation water were spatially quantified by integrating Budyko theory and remote sensing.
@highlight Increasing CF with scale prove that local irrigation efficiency improvements should be implemented with caution.
@highlight Extensive reuse of non consumed water takes place in the Indus Basin Irrigation System.
@highlight Spatial data on total water supply CF and non consumed flows support effective agricultural water management options.
@highlight The proposed method is easily replicated or modified for future use in basins worldwide.
