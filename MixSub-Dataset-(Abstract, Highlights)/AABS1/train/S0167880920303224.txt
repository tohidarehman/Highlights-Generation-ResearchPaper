 Fertilisation although it improves crop yield and enhances farmer income can contribute to freshwater pollution . Thus it is important to determine the recommended fertilisation rate that can ensure crop yield and farmer income as well as not harm the environment . We calculated the yield and net income of tobacco and measured the nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations under different fertilisation rates in plot runoff and local stream water during 2017 and 2018 . Tobacco yield increased with increasing fertilisation rates but net income decreased at extremely high rates . The opposite pattern was observed for the fertiliser nutrient use efficiency . When fertilisation was applied the N and P concentrations in the runoff exceeded the established national thresholds and the concentrations and discharges of N and P in the runoff were positively correlated with the fertilisation rate . According to the ratio of arable land to the total watershed area reduction characteristics of N and P in the watershed stream and the established national thresholds the recommended N and P
