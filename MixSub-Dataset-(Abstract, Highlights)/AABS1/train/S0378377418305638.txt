 Since reckonable understanding of yield response under long term conservation management practices is the key to improve the productivity and physico chemical indicators of rice wheat rotation impact of long term tillage and irrigation levels on productivity yield trend soil organic carbon fractions carbon pools and sequestration under rice wheat rotation on sandy clay loam soil of the mid Himalaya were quantified . A field experiment started from 2001 through 2016 to assess the effect of tillage alterations conventional tillage and zero tillage and four irrigation levels I

@highlight Rice yield declined more under zero tillage ZT as compared to conventional tillage CT plots after 16years of cultivation.
@highlight Wheat yield non significantly increased under ZT while it was decreased under CT plots.
@highlight Plots under ZT had higher SOC pools and carbon sequestration as compared to CT.
