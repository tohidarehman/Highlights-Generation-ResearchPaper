 To understand the genetic and evolutionary basis of the responses to water deficit in plants we turned to the basal liverwort

@highlight Water deficit and ABA treatments in
@highlight cause osmotic adjustment.
@highlight Upon water limitation 
@highlight changes its vacuole turgor.
@highlight increased endogenous ABA levels under water deficit.
@highlight Transcriptome wide gene expression changes in response ABA or water deficit indicate conserved responses in land plants.
@highlight Overall these response sets are conserved and shared between liverworts and vascular plants.
