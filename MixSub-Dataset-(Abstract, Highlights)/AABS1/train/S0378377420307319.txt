 Drought tolerant forage crops have huge development potential in drylands taking into account the current global challenges . However little is known about the trade off among yield nutritional quality and soil water consumption for dryland forage farming production in semi arid regions . This research compared the two year yield and soil water consumption characteristics of sweet sorghum

@highlight Trade off of dryland forage farming production and soil water consumption were studied.
@highlight Sweet sorghum showed the highest yield two and five times of sudangrass and forage maize.
@highlight Soil water consumption was in 0150 cm for maize and 50100 cm for sorghum and sudangrass.
@highlight Average evapotranspiration of forage maize was 10 and 15 higher than sorghum and sudangrass.
@highlight Dryland sweet sorghum with higher yield less water consumption and similar nutritional quality.
