 Methamphetamine is a highly addictive stimulant that results in serious and persistent neurotoxic effects . Studies have indicated that luteolin a flavonoid may confer neuroprotection against neurotoxicity . Nevertheless the effects of luteolin on METH induced neurotoxicity have not been sufficiently verified . In the present study Sprague Dawley rats were pretreated with luteolin or sodium dodecyl sulfate water followed by administration of METH or saline . Rat striata were then collected for RNA sequencing and subsequent analyses . A total of 347 differentially expressed genes were identified in the METH group with 20 pathways including the phosphoinositol 3 kinase protein kinase B found to be enriched by the KEGG analysis . Seventy five of the 347 DEGs were modulated in luteolin pretreated rats which were enriched into 12 pathways containing the PI3K Akt . Results further showed that luteolin pretreatment significantly repressed the METH induced increases of PI3K Akt p Akt p53 Bax caspase 3 normalized the ratio of p Akt Akt and autophagy related proteins expression . Taken together these findings indicate that luteolin attenuates METH induced apoptosis and autophagy by suppressing the PI3K Akt pathway . In this case it exerts protection against METH induced neurotoxicity . This provides a platform for development of potential therapies for METH treatment .
