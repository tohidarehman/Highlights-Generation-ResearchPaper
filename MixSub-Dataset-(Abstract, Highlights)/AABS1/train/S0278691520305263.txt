 Exposure to nonbiodegradable cadmium causes many health problems including the damage to the nervous system . This study aimed to increase knowledge about its neurotoxic effects and the neuroprotective potential of caffeic acid phenethyl ester . In mice CAPE attenuated significantly learning and memory deficits induced by CdCl

@highlight CAPE has protective effect on CdCl
@highlight  induced neurotoxicity and neurodegenerative disorders.
@highlight CAPE plays a protective role through attenuating neuronal apoptosis and neuroinflammation.
@highlight AMPK SIRT1 pathway and amyloid tau neuroinflammation axis involve in the protection of CAPE.
