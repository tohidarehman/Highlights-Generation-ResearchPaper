 Tree rings play an important role in high resolution paleoclimate reconstruction over large areas . Nevertheless the sampling sites of most existing tree ring networks are unevenly distributed due to the limitations of the availability of appropriate tree species and sampling conditions . In light of the good spatial representation provided by tree ring stable oxygen isotope ratio
