 Diet is the major route of exposure to arsenic with rice and rice products as food groups with relatively high As levels . This study was aimed at determining the concentrations of total arsenic and inorganic arsenic in rice and rice products . The dietary exposure and health risks for infant and adult population were also estimated . Brown varieties of rice showed higher As levels than white rice . Toddlers and infants presented the highest dietary exposure to total As but unlike the rest of population groups the main contributor was organic arsenic . Focusing on the contribution of each food item rice represents the major contributor to InAs exposure by the adult population while baby cereals and breakfast cereals are the most important contributors for infant exposure . Anyhow none of the population groups exceeded the lower limit of the BMDL

@highlight Baby cereals and breakfast cereals are the main contributors of InAs for children.
@highlight Rice consumption is the main contributor to InAs exposure for the adult population.
@highlight The EC limit was not exceeded for any exposure scenario and population group.
@highlight In order to reduce As exposure white or pre cooked rice should be prioritized.
@highlight In the future risk assessment should be based on aggregative cumulative exposure.
