 The promotion of senescence in cancer cells by dietary phenols gained attention as a promising chemopreventive strategy against colorectal and other cancers . Urolithins are ellagitannins and ellagic acid derived gut microbiota metabolites that reach high concentrations in the human colon . They were postulated to be as potential anticancer agents in different CRC models but their role as promoters of cellular senescence has never been comprehensively evaluated .

@highlight Urolithin A exerts anti clonogenicity and cell cycle arrest in colon cancer cells.
@highlight Long term exposure to Urolithin A induces cellular senescence.
@highlight Urolithin A induces cellular senescence in a p53 dependent manner.
@highlight Phase II metabolism limits the senescence mediated chemoprevention.
