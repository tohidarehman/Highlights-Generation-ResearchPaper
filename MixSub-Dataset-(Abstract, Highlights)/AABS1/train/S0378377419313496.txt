 Film mulching has been used widely to improve field productivity in rainfed agricultural ecosystems in semiarid areas of China . During 20132016 we evaluated the effects of different film mulching methods on soil water water productivity crop yield and economic benefits in a semiarid area of southern Ningxia China . Five treatments were tested a control method consisting of conventional flat planting without mulching alternate mulching and bare rows without ridges and planting in mulched rows maize planted in furrows separated by consecutive plastic film mulched ridges maize planted in furrows separated by alternating large and small plastic film mulched ridges and maize planted in furrows with large plastic film mulched ridges alternating with flat plastic film mulched spaces . After four years of continuous treatment the results indicated that D and S treatments significantly increased soil water content at depths of 0200 cm during the early growth stage but the increases in the soil water content were lower later in the maize growth process . The grain yield increases were affected by the different hydrothermal conditions in various years . On average mulching increased grain yield by 31.33 and biomass accumulation by 22.48 . Across four seasons film mulching significantly

@highlight Film mulching improved the soil water content during the early maize growth stage.
@highlight Soil water consumption regulated by film mulching during maize growth period.
@highlight Improved grain yield and WUE correlated with field water consumption.
@highlight Film mulching can lead to higher and stable net incomes for local farmers.
