 Monophthalate promotes adipogenesis via PPAR . PPAR agonists e.g . rosiglitazone enhance adipocyte browning . However scientific evidence regarding MEHP as a browning chemical is lacking . This study combined 3T3 L1 adipocytes and C57BL 6J mice to examine the potential roles of MEHP in browning . MEHP and the browning agent RSG caused similar energy metabolism in adipocytes . Both MEHP and RSG caused transcriptional changes involved in browning associated thermogenesis energy homeostasis inflammatory response and glucose uptake . MEHP treated adipocytes exhibited brown adipocyte like characteristics i.e . increased mitochondrial proton leak triiodothyronine induced

@highlight MEHP and RSG cause similar energy metabolism gene expression in adipocytes.
