 This paper explores the geography of microbreweries in three countries in Central Europe the Czech Republic Poland and Slovakia . Each has a long turbulent and different history of brewing but in the twenty first century all of them have experienced the change in this market caused by the so called craft beer revolution . First in an exhaustive literature review we present the reasons for the craft beer proliferation in the world and characterize the beer market in these three countries . We also identify the factors that might lead to the location and clustering of craft breweries . Second we empirically test where the microbreweries tend to locate and what the driving forces are in the clustering patterns in the Czech Republic Poland and Slovakia using spatial statistical models and data from Eurostat and collected by the authors . Our findings suggest that craft brewers cluster in Central Europe for reasons related to income and general well being the education level economic activity and creativity the age of the population and the distance from cities .

@highlight Craft breweries in Central Europe have a strong tendency towards clustering.
@highlight Above average breweries concentration dominates mainly in the Czech Republic.
@highlight Craft breweries location is related to the level of socioeconomic factors.
@highlight GDP employment population age have a positive impact on the number of craft breweries.
@highlight Brewing traditions well being and education level do not play a large role in craft breweries location.
