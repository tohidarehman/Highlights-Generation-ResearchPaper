 Crop production is facing the increase of salinity in soils and irrigation waters . This is a widespread problem that affects crops with high economic importance and reduces yields . Salinity causes oxidative stress in plants which induce complex defensive mechanisms involving the antioxidant system and osmoprotector compounds . Ca
