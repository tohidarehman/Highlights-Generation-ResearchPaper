 Water scarcity is becoming a major constraint for maize cultivation and increasing maize yield globally . Water saving irrigation methods are required to increase crop water productivity without reducing grain yield and nutrient uptake . We evaluated the effects of different methods and levels of irrigation on crop dry matter grain yield nutrient uptake and CWP of maize in field condition in a sub tropical environment in Bangladesh . The experiment was laid out in a nested plot design with three replications during 201415 and 201516 . The treatments were three irrigation levels I

@highlight Both irrigation level and method had significant effects on yield nutrient uptake and crop water productivity CWP .
@highlight Alternate AFI and traditional furrow irrigation TFI had similar grain yield when irrigated to 100 of field capacity.
@highlight AFI had highest CWP and saved water by 37 compared to TFI.
@highlight Uptake of both macro nutrients and micro nutrients in maize grain at harvest was found similar in both AFI and TFI systems.
@highlight AFI can save water and be used for dry season maize in areas with limited water sources.
