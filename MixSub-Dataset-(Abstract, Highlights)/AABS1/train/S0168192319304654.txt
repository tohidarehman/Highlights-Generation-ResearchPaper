 A better understanding of crop transpiration and its influencing factors in arid areas where irrigation is required contributes to improving agricultural water productivity and water resources management . However previous studies from different regions have not come to a consensus on which factors and how they control crop transpiration and little is known for areas with a shallow groundwater table . In this study maize

@highlight Maize sap flow was measured in two fields with contrasting water table depths.
@highlight The influencing environmental factors were examined at sub daily and daily scales.
@highlight Transpiration and water productivity under two groundwater depths were evaluated.
@highlight The optimum groundwater depth for maize was determined by high water productivity.
