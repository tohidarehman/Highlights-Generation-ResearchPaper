 Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with the impaired copper metabolism resulting in hepatic and neurologic manifestations . D Pencillamine is a first line of treatment however monoisoamyl 2 3 dimercaptosuccinic acid is gaining recognition recently as a future chelating agent of choice . We evaluated the effects of MiADMSA against copper induced hepatic and immunological changes in the male Sprague Dawley rats . Copper overload increased the levels of pro oxidant and concurrently decreased the levels of antioxidant enzymes in the liver . Increased oxidative stress triggered the up regulation of pro inflammatory cytokines in the liver and down regulated the anti inflammatory cytokine IL 4 . Altered liver function parameters as well as serum immunoglobulins levels were also noted . MiADMSA treatment restored most of copper altered biochemical and immunological changes . Further the histopathological changes proved that MiADMSA treatment ameliorated copper induced hepatic injury . Infra red spectra of liver tissue indicated shift in the characteristic OH peak during copper exposure while the shifting came to normal in MiADMSA administered rat liver . We conclude that MiADMSA could be a promising antidote for the chronic copper toxicity and possibly in the clinical management of WD .
