 Zearalenone is a mycotoxin that contaminates crops worldwide and is toxic to the reproductive systems of mammals however the toxicological mechanism by which ZEA affects germ cells is not fully understood . In this study proteomic analysis using iTRAQ technology was adopted to determine the cellular response of Leydig cells of rats to ZEA exposure . The results were used to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the toxicity of the ZEA towards germ cells . After 24h of exposure to ZEA at a concentration of 30mol L a total of 128 differentially expressed proteins were identified . Of these 70 DEPs were up regulated and 58 DEPs were down regulated . The DEPs associated with ZEA toxicology were then screened by using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis . The results show that these DEPs are involved in a number of important ZEA toxicological pathways including apoptosis immunotoxicity DNA damage and signaling pathways . The complex regulatory relationships between the DEPs and ZEA toxicological signaling pathways are also explicitly demonstrated in the form of a proteinprotein interaction network . This study thus provides a theoretical molecular basis for understanding the toxicological mechanisms by which ZEA affects germ cells .

@highlight The toxicity of ZEA on leydig cells are involved in apoptosis immunotoxicity DNA damage.
@highlight The endoplasmic reticulum and MAPK signal pathway might be the most important ZEA toxicological pathways.
@highlight The protein protein interaction network of Leydig cells of rats after ZEA exposure are revealed.
