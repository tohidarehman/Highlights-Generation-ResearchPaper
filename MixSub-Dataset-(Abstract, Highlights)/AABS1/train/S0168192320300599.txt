 Seasonally dry tropical forests are among the most important biomes regarding regional and global hydrological and carbon fluxes . Thus the objective of this study was to evaluate the seasonal and interannual variability of evapotranspiration

@highlight observation of evapotranspiration 
@highlight  in a Brazilian STDF 
@highlight  using eddy covariance.
@highlight Maximum surface conductance values occurred at approximately 09 00 local time .
@highlight During the two studied years the surface did not decouple from the atmosphere.
@highlight During the wet season 
@highlight was mainly controlled by available energy while surface conductance controlled
@highlight during the dry season.
