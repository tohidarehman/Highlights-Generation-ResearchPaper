 Increased variability in growing season climates continues to threaten the growth and yields of many crops . The impacts of individual climate stress conditions on crops has been documented frequently yet how crops respond to multiple abiotic stress components is less well understood . Here we report on the main and interactive effects of growth temperature water deficit and a heatwave on leaf physiology and biomass production of cotton plants

@highlight The response of crops to multiple environmental stressors is unclear despite their co occurrence in nature.
@highlight The interactive effects of day night temperature water deficit and heatwaves on
@highlight L. were examined.
@highlight Increased daytime temperature reduced leaf carbon gain and final yield while night time warming generally did not alter daytime impacts.
@highlight Moderate water deficit did not strongly affect growth and yield.
@highlight Temperature was the major determinant of cotton yield. Therefore thermally tolerant varieties should be targeted in future breeding selection.
