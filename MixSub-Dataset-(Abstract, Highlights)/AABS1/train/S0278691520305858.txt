 Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid a shorter chain Per and polyfluoroalkyl substances cognate of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid has been used as replacement for the toxic surfactant PFOS . However emerging evidences suggest safety concerns for PFBS and its effect on reproductive health is still understudied . Therefore the current work aimed to investigate the effect of PFBS in comparison to PFOS on reproductive health using

@highlight PFOS and PFBS impaired reproduction of
@highlight Preconception exposure of PFOS and PFBS led to offspring physiological dysfunctions.
@highlight Higher dosages are needed for PFBS to produce comparable effects of PFOS.
