 This paper contributes to debates on the implications of land based investments on local livelihoods in the Global South . Drawing on a comprehensive national dataset on land concessions in Laos and 2005 and 2015 village level poverty rates we examine the association between land based investments and poverty at the village level in Lao rural areas . Results outline contexts in which land based investments have either positive or adverse association with village level poverty change rates they also reveal factors that determine village level poverty reduction in Laos . Our results suggest that poverty rates in villages affected by land based investments decreased significantly between 2005 and 2015 following the national trend in Laos . However in cases where land based investments caused more farmland loss poverty reduction was low or poverty rates increased over this period . Results further reveal that land based investments implemented in more remote areas or poorer villages had a stronger association with poverty reduction . However poverty was not a central consideration for the establishment of land based investments . Our findings fill an important gap providing a middle level analysis from which grounded observations are analyzed alongside national trends .

@highlight Poverty rates in affected villages decreased between 2005 and 2015 consistent with Laos national decrease in poverty.
@highlight However in villages that lost more land in these deals the poverty rate increased between 2005 and 2015.
@highlight Deals in poorer areas have stronger association with poverty reduction but most deals targeted less poor areas.
@highlight Temporal statistical and qualitative analyses reveal contexts where deals positively or negatively affect poverty change.
