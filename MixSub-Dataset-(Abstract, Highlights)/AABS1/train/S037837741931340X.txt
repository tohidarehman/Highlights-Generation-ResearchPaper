 Iran has the second rank in production and cultivation area and the fifth in exporting date palm in the world . Even though the date palm has a high economic value due to the water crisis in Iran the effect of date palm production on the water resources along with its economic value should be considered . This research assesses the index of water footprint and economic value of water footprint for three cultivars of date palms including the soft semi dry and dry during the period 20082016 . Through this study these indices have been computed for date palms and compared with the other agricultural products in Iran . Finally the results are used for prioritization of the cultivated area . The outputs show that the average footprint and economic value of water footprint for date palm is 3.02m

@highlight The average water footprint WF and economic value of water footprint WFEV for date palm cultivars is 3.02m

@highlight The WF and WFEV of Date palm cultivars are compared to other crops in Iran.
@highlight The exported virtual water VW for date palm cultivars is 1243 MCM which its WFEV is 733 million USD.
@highlight The agricultural policies should be based on exporting low VW and high WFEV agricultural crops and importing large VW and low WFEV.
