 Epiphytic bromeliads are subjected to intermittent nutrient availability while at the same time having a small root system that absorb a small amount of nutrients . These bromeliads possess adaptations such as a tank formation and a higher trichome density that contribute to their acquisition of water and nutrients . However little is known about the nitrogen metabolism in epiphytic tank bromeliads or how ammonium reaches the leaf apex before its assimilation and nothing has been described about the functioning of the low and high affinity nitrogen transporters in epiphytic plants whose leaves play a key role in nutrient uptake . In this context we conducted a controlled experiment with

@highlight Upregulation of high affinity nitrate and ammonium transporters in the leaf base.
@highlight Higher urease and nitrate reductase activities in the leaf base.
@highlight Upregulation of urea transporter genes

@highlight Higher glutamine synthetase activity in the leaf apex.
@highlight Upregulation of low affinity nitrate and ammonium transporters in the leaf apex.
