 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a complex group of organic compounds consisting of at least three fused aromatic rings which are formed during combustion of organic matter . While some PAHs have been reported to have carcinogenic and or mutagenic properties another possible negative health impact is their endocrine disrupting potential . Therefore the aim of this study was to determine both the agonistic and antagonistic endocrine activity of 9 environmentally relevant PAHs using three different CALUX bioassays The AhR CALUX The ER CALUX and PPAR CALUX . For the PPAR CALUX anthracene fluoranthene pyrene and fluorene showed weak agonistic activity whilst benzopyrene P was the only one exhibiting weak antagonistic activity . For the AhR CALUX chrysene was the only PAH that showed relatively strong agonist activity P which was used as a standard . Pyrene anthracene and fluoranthene showed weak AhR agonist activity . In the ER CALUX bioassay fluoranthene had agonistic activity whilst BP exhibited both agonistic and antagonistic activity . Phenanthrene and anthracene had weak ER agonist activities . These results indicate that certain PAHs have multiple modes of action and can activate inhibit multiple receptor signaling pathways known to play critical roles in mediating endocrine disruption .

@highlight PAHs have multiple modes of action and can activate inhibit multiple receptor signaling pathways.
@highlight Anthracene fluoranthene pyrene and fluorene showed weak agonistic activity in PPARy CALUX.
@highlight Chrysene and B a P showed clear agonistic activity in AhR CALUX pyrene anthracene and fluoranthene showed weak AhR activity.
@highlight Fluoranthene benzo a pyrene phenanthrene and anthracene were found to be weakly estrogenic.
@highlight B a P is a partial ER agonist that can both induce and inhibit ER functional activity.
