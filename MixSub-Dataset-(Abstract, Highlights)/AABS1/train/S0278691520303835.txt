 Mitochondria are cellular organelles involved in many crucial functions such as generation of energy and initiation of apoptosis . The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of mitochondria in the toxicity induced by sterigmatocystin a mycotoxin produced by fungi of the genus

@highlight STE reduces cell viability in a concentration and time dependent manner in SH SY5Y.
@highlight STE toxicity is related to a modulation of mitochondrial function.
@highlight Exposure to STE causes ATP depletion and oxidative stress but not m disruption.
@highlight STE induced cell viability loss is due to the induction of an apoptotic process.
@highlight Alteration of
@highlight and
@highlight 3 mRNA expression levels was detected by qPCR.
