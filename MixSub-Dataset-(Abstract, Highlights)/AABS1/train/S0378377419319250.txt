 The optimization of irrigation strategies with the goal of increasing water utilization efficiency and achieving higher yield is an important farming practice that helps balance groundwater use and food security during water shortage periods in the North China Plain . In the present study the AquaCrop model was used to simulate winter wheat yield evapotranspiration water productivity WP

@highlight The irrigation water requirement ranged from 136 to 387 mm during the 35 year study period.
@highlight Water consumption intensity increased during the tillering stem elongation stage.
@highlight One irrigation at the anthesis stage was optimal in wet years.
@highlight Two irrigations were best for normal and dry years.
@highlight High water productivity was achieved by optimization of irrigation strategy.
