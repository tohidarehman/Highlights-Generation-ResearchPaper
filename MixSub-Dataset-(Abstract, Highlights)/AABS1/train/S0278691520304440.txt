 Excessive sodium intake has been associated with high blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases . Therefore sodium reduction is a public health challenge worldwide . The aim of this study was to develop smoked salmon with a reduced Na content . Sodium chloride was replaced by potassium chloride at 25 and 50 and studied in combination with two smoking procedures as well as two smoking temperatures . Smoked salmon samples were characterized by physicochemical sensory and microbiological analyses . No major differences were observed regarding physicochemical properties in the studied treatments . Smoked samples with 50 of NaCl replaced by KCl were slightly more bitter than those with 25 whereas samples with 25 of replacement did not show differences to those with non reduced Na content . Molar Na K ratio decreased from 4 3 in controls to 1 4 and 0 6 in samples with a NaCl reduction level of 25 and 50 respectively . Microbiological assessment indicates that 2 week shelf life would be appropriate and safe in terms of accomplishment of the EU regulation taking into account foreseeable storage temperatures . Thus it is possible to achieve a reduction of 2550 of NaCl in smoked salmon by replacing NaCl by KCl and considerer this product as a source of K .

@highlight 2550 NaCl replacement by KCl was investigated for natural and liquid smoking procedures at 1819 and 56C.
@highlight No sensory differences were observed for 25 NaCl replacement by KCl in the four smoking treatments.
@highlight 50 NaCl replacement by KCl resulted in a slightly more bitter product in all the smoking treatments.
@highlight Salmon with KCl substitution had a 2 week shelf life when stored in refrigeration.
@highlight Salmon with KCl substitution could be a source of K and Salmon with KCl substitution could be a reduced salt content product.
