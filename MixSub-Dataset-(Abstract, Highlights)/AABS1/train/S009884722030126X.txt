 Observations in recent years have shown that climate change can affect plants and herbivorous insects . An increase in temperature can indirectly affect insects by changing quality of host plant tissues or directly affecting their biology . So far little research has addressed the problem of the interactive impact of abiotic and biotic stress on defence mechanisms and effectivity of plant defence mechanisms . The work is aimed at explaining how the plant reacts to abiotic stress caused by elevated temperature and additional biotic stress caused by feeding

@highlight The activity of enzymes increased in the tissues of plants during compounded affects of biotic and abiotic stress.
@highlight The temperature from 20C to 25C and 28C affects aphid plant interactions and defence responses of plants.
@highlight The plant defence responses were highest at 20C.
