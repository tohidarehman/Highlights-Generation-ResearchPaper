 Micro catchment systems are designed to harvest and utilize rainwater with the aim of supporting crop growth in arid regions . While MCs were traditionally built with shallow infiltration basins recent research indicates that MCs with deeper basins lose less water to the atmosphere than MCs with shallower basins . Consequently we can expect more water to infiltrate the soil and be available to trees grown in deeper MCs than those grown in shallow MCs . The reduction in the direct water loss is owed to a large extent to the decreased flux of incoming shortwave radiation reaching the surface in deeper basins . The degree to which the incoming shortwave radiation reaching the floor of the MC is reduced in turn depends on the systems dimensions and orientation geographical location canopy geometry soil properties date and time . We present a model that calculates the incoming all wave radiation flux densities reaching any point on the floor of a trench MC in which trees are planted . To add to previously developed models that considered direct radiation diffuse radiation and direct and diffuse radiation reflected downwards from the walls of the trench the model accounts for possible shading and attenuation of the radiation caused by the presence of a canopy in the system . We have also added the component of longwave radiation considering longwave radiation emitted from the atmosphere from the canopy of trees planted within the system and from the trench walls .

@highlight Optimum trench geometry for specific situations can be determined with the model.
@highlight The model was successfully validated under field conditions.
@highlight Trench orientation and canopy size affect radiation reaching trench micro catchment.
