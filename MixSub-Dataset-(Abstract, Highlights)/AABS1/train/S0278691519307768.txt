 It is recognized that d amphetamine induced hyperactivity is thought to be a valid animal model of mania . In the present study we investigated whether a proinflammatory oxidative gene indoleamine 2 3 dioxygenase is involved in AMPH induced mitochondrial burden and whether mood stabilizers modulate IDO to protect against AMPH induced mania like behaviors . AMPH induced IDO 1 expression was significantly greater than IDO 2 expression in the prefrontal cortex of wild type mice . IDO 1 expression was more pronounced in the mitochondria than in the cytosol . AMPH treatment activated intra mitochondrial Ca

@highlight AMPH significantly enhanced mitochondrial IDO 1 but not IDO 2 expression.
@highlight IDO 1 KO attenuated AMPH induced mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative burden.
@highlight Anti manic potential of mood stabilizers is comparable to that of IDO 1 KO in mice.
@highlight IDO 1 may be a novel target for anti manic potential of mood stabilizers.
