 In recent years an increased interest in farmland globally has led to the emergence of many land based investment projects . Although most projects enter the production stage a significant number also ends in failure . This paper asks why land based investment projects fail . This is a crucial question as failed investment projects are unlikely to have any positive impacts on the host regions . I develop a conceptual framework to understand the determinants of failure and then use project level data to empirically test these potential determinants drawing on survival analysis . I find that failure occurs globally but is concentrated on the African continent with some countries exhibiting a particularly high risk of project failure . In addition larger projects projects growing agrofuels and projects targeting land formerly used by smallholders or pastoralists are more likely to fail . In contrast projects that involve domestic investors or take place in countries with better infrastructure are less likely to fail . The findings on the impact of host country institutions on project failure are ambiguous and highlight the need for more localized institutional variables to better understand the role of institutions for project failure .

@highlight A significant number of large scale land acquisitions end in failure.
@highlight LSLAs can fail at different stages during negotiations before production starts or after some years of production.
@highlight Failure occurs globally but is concentrated on the African continent.
@highlight Mega projects projects growing agrofuels and projects not involving domestic investors are particularly prone to failure.
@highlight More localized institutional variables are needed to understand the role of host country institutions for project failure.
