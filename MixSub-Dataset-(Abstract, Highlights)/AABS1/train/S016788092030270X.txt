 Landscape fragmentation and farming can affect the diversity of plants and pollinators harbored by linear landscape elements in agroecosystems . To assess the role of these habitats in sustaining plant pollinator communities twenty portions of LLE were studied during two consecutive field seasons in the Argentine Pampas . A hierarchical approach was taken describing three features of road verges in different scales of observation width of the road verge the land use of the neighboring fields and landscape heterogeneity . The influence of these features on the composition and abundance of entomophilous flowering plants and their visitors were examined with GLMMs . Plant and flower visitor communities in road verges were dominated by alien species . The local scale feature was the most influential as the widest road verges had higher plant richness and higher flower visitor abundance . Contrary to our expectations richness and abundance of both plants and flower visitors were not related to adjacent land use or landscape heterogeneity . These results suggest that the conservation and management of wider road verges should be a priority to sustain high species diversity in intensely managed agroecosystems .

@highlight Entomophilous plants richness increased with roads verges width.
@highlight Flower visitor abundance increased with the roads verges width.
@highlight Landscape heterogeneity did not influence plant and visitor diversity.
