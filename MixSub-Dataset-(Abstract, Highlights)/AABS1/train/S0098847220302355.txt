 Salt stress limits the regional distribution of Chinese cabbage yet the molecular factors that confer tolerance to salt stress in Chinese cabbage remain poorly understood . To further investigate this issue salt tolerant and salt sensitive Chinese cabbage cultivars were selected and their responses to salt stress were tested . Then comparative transcriptome profiling was performed on the roots of salt tolerant and salt sensitive Chinese cabbage cultivars under salt stress . The results showed that Qinghua and Biyu are considered to be salt tolerant and salt sensitive Chinese cabbage cultivars respectively . Qinghua had higher water content and lower Na

@highlight Effects of salt stress were assessed on two Chinese cabbage cultivars.
@highlight QH was resistant cultivar to salt stress.
@highlight ABA and ethylene signaling pathways in the QH root are more actively expressed than those in BY.
@highlight Suberin development and lignin accumulation in QH roots were important strategies for resisting salt stress.
