 Salt stress is an important limiting factor in agricultural production . Previous studies have shown that exogenous melatonin promotes plant defense against various abiotic stresses in a concentration dependent manner . It is an efficient and convenient way to improve the resistance of plants by modulating the endogenous melatonin at a moderately high level by utilizing the plant s own regulatory mechanism . Serotonin N acetyltransferase is a key enzyme in the melatonin synthesis pathway . In this study
