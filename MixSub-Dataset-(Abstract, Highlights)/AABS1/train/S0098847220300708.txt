 In greenhouse tomato production the lower canopy of tomato plants is often shaded by the neighbouring tomato plants . Supplementary lighting can be used to provide sufficient light energy for plants . Red light is regarded as the most efficient spectrum in supplementary lighting . Whether and how supplementary red light in the ambient of sunlight affect the ripening of tomato remain to be elucidated . In this research the impacts of supplementary red light on tomato ripening were examined by comparing the impacts of supplementary red light on ripening related regulators ethylene synthesis ethylene signaling carotenoid synthesis and light signaling in Micro Tom wild type tomato fruit and
