 Current water consumptions are unsustainable in many regions which requiring more efficient agricultural water management strategies . This study incorporated the DSSAT CERES Maize model with a new algorithm for dynamic within season irrigation scheduling for maize

@highlight Maize yield was forecasted on each day by considering actual weather data.
@highlight High accuracy of yield prediction could be achieved after maize tasseling.
@highlight Decline in daily forecasted yields resulted from more serious water stress.
@highlight This algorithm could quantify the impacts of real time weather on seasonal yield.
@highlight Simulated IUEs were improved with irrigation schemes scheduled by this method.
