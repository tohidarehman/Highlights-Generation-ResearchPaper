 Forested environments feature a highly complex radiation regime . The three dimensional canopy structure masks solar radiation as it penetrates through the forest . This entails sub canopy radiation to vary in space over time season and with weather conditions which challenges both measurements and modelling . Here we combine the experimental acquisition of forest structure information with radiation transfer modelling to achieve efficient and accurate estimation of sub canopy shortwave radiation at very high temporal resolution . For this purpose we have developed a Matlab based software tool to analyse digital hemispherical imagery for directional canopy transmissivity which yields in combination with measured or estimated above canopy shortwave radiation respective below canopy radiation . We demonstrate the utility of the tool to accurately model shortwave radiation in comparison to pyranometer measurements at both the point scale and along a transect under heterogeneous canopy cover . Optimized for computational efficiency the software even enables fully distributed simulations . Without necessitating high performance computing or complex ray tracing this tool enables easy access to detailed sub canopy radiation information . These should be valuable for validating site scale radiation transfer models as input to eco hydrological and snowmelt models and for researching light dependant bio physiological processes .
