 Since 2007 electronic cigarette sales in the U.S. have surpassed those of tobacco cigarettes . This is due in part to manufacturer s claims that they are a safer alternative to tobacco cigarettes . However formaldehyde acrolein and diacetyl have been detected in e cigarettes and public knowledge of e cigarette composition and ingredient bioactivity is conspicuously lacking . We evaluated the toxicity of nine e cigarette flavor mixtures and their constituents in the developmental zebrafish an excellent whole animal biosensor of chemical hazard . Seven of the nine flavors elicited adverse developmental responses at 1 by volume . The number of toxic endpoints varied greatly between flavors . Two flavors Grape and Bubble Gum had similar chemical compositions but different toxicity profiles . We hypothesized that the toxicity was driven by a constituent present only in the Bubble Gum flavor cinnamaldehyde . To replicate this toxicity we built our own defined mixture . The addition of varying concentrations of cinnamaldehyde suggested that it drove the toxicity of these mixtures and that e cigarette hazard can be flavor dependent .

@highlight 7 of 9 flavors tested in the developmental zebrafish model induced adverse responses at 1 by volume.
@highlight Chemical composition and bioactivity varies by flavoring mixture.
