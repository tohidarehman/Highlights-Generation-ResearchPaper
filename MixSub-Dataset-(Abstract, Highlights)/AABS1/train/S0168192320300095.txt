 Although the eddy covariance technique provides direct and continuous measurements of evapotranspiration separate measurement of evaporation and transpiration at the ecosystem level is not possible . For partitioning ET into E and T high frequency time series EC observations collected from Apr 2016 to May 2018 over a rainfed alfalfa

@highlight Alfalfa evapotranspiration ET was partitioned using Fluxpart software.
@highlight Evaporation E and transpiration T were consistent with expected trends.
@highlight T accounted for roughly 80 of the total ET during the alfalfa growing season.
@highlight This study can provide a foundation for future applications of this procedure.
