 Rice is a strategic crop that has a high tolerance to hypoxia compared to other species . Our purpose was to investigate the salinity acclimation mechanisms in rice plants triggered by hypoxia in the nutrient solution . So the development of radial O

@highlight Fine adjustment in oxygenation around rice roots under hypoxia can worsen responses to stresses.
@highlight Rice plants are more sensitive to severe hypoxia in the tillering phase.
