 The water balance of tropical dry deciduous forests is less well understood than some other forest ecosystems . To help close this knowledge gap we separately measured the evapotranspiration from the whole ecosystem

@highlight ET and its components were measured separately in a tropical dry deciduous forest.
@highlight Understory ET is important contributing 35 to whole ecosystem ET.
@highlight Overstory LAI strongly affects the proportion of understory ET relative to whole ET.
@highlight Underestimates of stand transpiration can be corrected with calibrated coefficients.
