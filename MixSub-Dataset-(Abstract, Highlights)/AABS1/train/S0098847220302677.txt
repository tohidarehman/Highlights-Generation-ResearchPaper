 Cajal bodies are nuclear domains widely present in eukaryotic cells . Their main functions include processing and modifications of small nuclear RNAs including those participating in mRNA splicing . CBs are dynamic structures in terms of their mobility fusion and split which results in their variable number and size during cell cycle . CBs are supposed to play a role in response to various stresses or at least the cell reactions to these stressors is related with changing CB number and size . That is why the number and size of CBs were analyzed in primary root meristematic cells of soybean a subtropical plant whose seedlings were grown at 23C subjected to chilling stress and recovered at 23C after chilling . These parameters were examined in three classes of cell size which corresponded to the cells in G1 S and G2 phases . The general number of CBs in nuclei of the chilled plants was halved in comparison to the control cells however this parameter returned to the control value during recovery . Such a result suggests that chilling may hinder formation of CBs or it may provoke their fusion . Moreover the number of small CBs decreased and the number of large CBs increased during interphase progress while the general number of CBs was constant in each treatment group . The constant number of CBs from G1 to G2 phase proves that in soybean cells they enlarge as a result of component accumulation rather than their fusion . The reasons of such a state of soybean CBs are discussed .

@highlight Cajal bodies of soybean root meristem cells react specifically to chilling stress.
@highlight Cajal body number halves but their sizes increase under chilling stress.
@highlight Cajal body number does not change but they enlarge during interphase progression.
