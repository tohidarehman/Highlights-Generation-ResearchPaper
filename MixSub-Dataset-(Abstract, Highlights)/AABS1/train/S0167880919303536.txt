 While the Western World is facing an inexorable decline of its farmland biodiversity following continuous intensification of production modes agricultural landscapes in Africa are still largely dominated by small scale subsistence farming operated by smallholders mostly harbouring high biodiversity . However as most African countries are confronted to an unprecedented population growth and a rapid economic development efforts to intensify food production are widespread with concomitant potentially negative effects on biodiversity . We conducted a study in a highly contrasted agricultural landscape of the Ethiopian highlands comprising two distinct farming systems large scale farming relying on modern combine machinery and technology

@highlight Birds were mainly driven by semi natural habitats with varying effects depending on the farming system.
@highlight Large scale farming had overallnegative effects on birds but typical open habitat species benefitted from wide openlandscapes.
@highlight Habitat diversity enhanced overall bird species richness whereas migratory species were positively affected by crop diversity.
@highlight Both large and small scale farming systems can coexist as long as semi natural habitats are preserved.
