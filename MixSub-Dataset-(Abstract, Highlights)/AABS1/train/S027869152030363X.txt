 Since humans are exposed to different mycotoxins through daily intake there is increasing concern about the adverse effects of the interactions between them . Cytotoxicity of sterigmatocystin and nivalenol alone and in combination in human hepatocarcinoma cells was evaluated by MTT assay . Furthermore ROS production and alteration of m as mechanisms of action were assessed . Cells were treated with concentrations ranging from 0.15 to 5M for NIV and from 0.78 to 50M for STE individually and in binary combinations . The combination ratio between the mixture STE NIV was 10 1 . The IC

@highlight The effects of NIV and STE were evaluated alone and in combination in HepG2 cells.
@highlight The isobologram and the Combenefit method were applied for the interaction analysis.
@highlight NIV STE showed additive synergism and antagonism at different concentrations.
@highlight The ROS production and alteration of m were not involved in STE and NIV toxicity.
