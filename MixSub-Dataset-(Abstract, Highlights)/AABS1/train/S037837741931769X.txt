 The microclimate under the drip and furrow irrigation systems inside a solar greenhouse located in the arid regions of northwestern China was evaluated during the two consecutive tomato growth cycles . Influence of soil hydrothermal conditions and the energy partitioning process were also analyzed . The results showed that when adopting the same water management measures the irrigation amount evapotranspiration

@highlight The microclimate showed a significant difference between drip and furrow irrigation systems.
@highlight Furrow irrigation allocated more energy to latent fluxes while the solar radiation it received was identical with drip irrigation.
@highlight It suggests that irrigation amount should be the key point of the distinct microclimate generated under different irrigation methods.
@highlight The availability of the Bowen ratio energy balance BREB method for the energy partitioning in the solar greenhouse was verified.
