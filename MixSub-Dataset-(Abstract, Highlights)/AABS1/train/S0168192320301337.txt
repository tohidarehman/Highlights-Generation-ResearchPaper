 We explored the inter individual variability in bud burst and its potential drivers in homogeneous mature stands of temperate deciduous trees . Phenological observations of leaves and wood formation were performed weekly from summer 2017 to summer 2018 for pedunculate oak European beech and silver birch in Belgium . The variability of bud burst was correlated to previous year autumn phenology and tree size but with important differences among species . In fact variability of bud burst was primarily related to onset of leaf senescence cessation of wood formation and tree height for oak beech and birch respectively . The inter individual variability of onset of leaf senescence was not related to the tree characteristics considered and was much larger than the inter individual variability in bud burst . Multi species multivariate models could explain up to 66 of the bud burst variability . These findings represent an important advance in our fundamental understanding and modelling of phenology and tree functioning of deciduous tree species .
