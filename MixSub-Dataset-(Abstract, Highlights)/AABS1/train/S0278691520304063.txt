 Ochratoxin A was reported to induce proximal tubules nephrotoxicity in humans and animals . However the toxicity of OTA on glomeruli has rarely been studied . We investigated OTA induced glomerular injury and the underlying mechanisms . Mice were intraperitoneally treated with OTA on alternate day for 3 weeks . OTA exposure decreased the weight gain ratio the kidney index and increased the levels of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen . It induced also fragmentation and atrophy in glomeruli and increased the expression of TNF IL 6 COX 2 TGF SMA and vimentin in a dose dependent manner . Human mesangial cells were treated with OTA for 48h . Treatment of HMC cells with OTA increased cell inhibition rate up regulated the expression of IL 6 TGF SMA and vimentin in a dose dependent manner . Additionally it enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK1 2 and p65 degradation of IB and translocation of p65 into the nucleus . OTA induced toxicity was attenuated by NF B and ERK1 2 inhibitors . In conclusion these results suggest that OTA exposure induces glomerular injury via activation of the ERK NF B signaling pathway and provide novel insights into the research of OTA induced nephrotoxicity .
