 Synergistic therapy is emerging as a promising strategy for improving the chemotherapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs . Addition of adjuvants with standard anticancer drugs has shown successful reduction of adverse side effects . The synthetic drug 5 Fluorouracil shows several side effects upon prolonged chemotherapy thereby restricting its long term clinical application . Several studies have reported anticancer potential and anti inflammatory activity of tangeretin towards mammalian cells . Therefore we investigate whether the combination of TAN with 5 FU increases their anticancer potential against colorectal cancer . In this study we examined the synergistic activity of TAN and 5 FU on the viability of several human cancer and normal cells . Several possible mechanistic pathways were screened and found that co exposure of TAN and 5 FU accelerates oxidative stress and increases endogenous ROS generation which sequentially triggers the DNA damage response and activates the apoptotic pathway by down regulating autophagy and DNA repair system in HCT 116cells . TAN and 5 FU co treatment also remarkably reduces the mitochondrial membrane potential and sequentially decreases ATPase activity . Collectively results indicate that combination of TAN and 5 FU significantly accelerates apoptosis

@highlight Antioxidant level in colorectal cancer cells was decreased upon 5 FU treatment in combination with TAN.
@highlight TAN and 5 FU co treatment suppressed the autophagy cell survival mechanism.
@highlight TAN synergistically accelerated 5 FU induced apoptotic event.
@highlight TAN and 5 FU induced the program cell death through the JNK mediated signaling pathway.
