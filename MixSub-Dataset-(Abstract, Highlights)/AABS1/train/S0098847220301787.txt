 Ultraviolet B radiation is a well known stress factor as involved in the generation of free radicals and induction factor which permutates growth metabolic processes and secondary metabolites synthesis of plants . However its impact on medicinal plants is less explored particularly in relation to secondary metabolites associated with the medicinally important rhizomes . An endangered medicinal plant

@highlight UV B induced changes in medicinal properties of
@highlight were explored.
@highlight UV B increased above ground biomass and tuber biomass in expense of rhizome.
@highlight Anthocyanin played a major role in detoxifying ROS.
@highlight Higher antioxidative response under UV B was compensated by reduction in rhizome.
@highlight Metabolites showed differential response with induction of anticancerous compounds.
