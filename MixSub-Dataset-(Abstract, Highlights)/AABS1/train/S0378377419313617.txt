 Garlic is widely cultivated around the globe . Particularly in semi arid regions where limited water reservoirs are getting more valuable due to climate change and increasing demand . In this context implementation of irrigation management techniques such as the optimized regulated deficit irrigation are beginning to be explored . ORDI distributes the total available water based on the needs at each growing stage crop development Ky bulbification Ky and ripening Ky . To evaluate and improve deficit irrigation strategies leaf functional traits such as stomatal conductance g

@highlight Optimized regulated deficit irrigation methodology ORDI was evaluated in garlic.
@highlight Garlic acclimated its functional response to the irrigation schedule imposed by ORDI.
@highlight Functional performance was recovered after the imposed water deficit stages.
@highlight ORDI optimized water supply and physiological performance at yield sensitive stages.
@highlight Stomatal conductance monitoring can help improve irrigation management of garlic.
