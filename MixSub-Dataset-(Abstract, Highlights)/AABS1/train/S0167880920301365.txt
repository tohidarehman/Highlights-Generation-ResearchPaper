 Increasing soil organic carbon reserves in agricultural land is important for mitigating global climate change . The soil environmental factors that affect SOC storage in agricultural cultivation are relatively easy to manage but the effects of these factors on SOC have not been studied systematically especially the relative weight of each factor is still unclear . In this study more than 30 soil environmental factors including SOC soil physical and chemical properties mineral types and microorganisms present in the 0140 cm soil layer were determined hierarchically within tea plantations . The main and secondary factors affecting SOC storage were then analyzed quantitatively using a structural equation model . The most important factors affecting SOC storage in tea plantations included water content total nitrogen oxalate extractable iron active iron poorly crystalline iron Fe

@highlight are the most critical soil environmental factors for SOC storage.
@highlight N S and P input can activate crystalline Fe in soil to further promote SOC storage.
@highlight Magnetic fertilizer application is vital to improve SOC storage in tea plantations.
