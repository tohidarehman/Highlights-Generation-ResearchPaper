 Facing with the scarcity of water resource and irrational fertilizer use it is highly important to supply plants with water and fertilizer in a coordination pattern to improve yield with high water use efficiency . A field experiment was conducted in 2012 and 2014 to investigate the effect of N supply methods on biomass accumulation and distribution yield components and WUE of maize

@highlight Alternate furrow irrigation coupled with alternate or conventional nitrogen supply AIAN or AICN significantly increased leaf area index LAI of maize at the R

@highlight and R
@highlight stages indicating the enhanced photosynthesis in leaves.
@highlight The increased LAI and root length density were useful to improve biomass accumulation under AIAN and AICN.
@highlight AIAN and AICN improved the dry matter distribution proportion in kernel and contribution rate of the biomass transfer from the vegetative organ to grain resulting in a greater harvest index.
@highlight AIAN and AICN significantly increased water use efficiency of maize.
