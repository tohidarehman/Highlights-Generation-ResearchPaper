 Climate change is dramatically affecting small scale farming productivity in the global south . The phenotypic and pedoclimatic characterization of indigenous crop resources may provide an opportunity to address future challenges threatening food security . This study focuses on a vast Ethiopian

@highlight We characterized the bioclimatic and phenotypic diversity of the entire active teff collection of the Ethiopian Biodiversity Institute for a total of 3850 accessions
@highlight Ethiopian teff boasts broad variability in terms of adaptation and agronomic traits
@highlight Agronomic traits of teff correlate with environmental variation at growing sites
@highlight Future climate scenarios predict a decrease of teff cultivation suitability in Ethiopia
