Two year rodent bioassays via oral exposure conducted by the National Toxicology Program reported evidence of carcinogenicity only in B6C3F

@highlight An expert panel assessed the genotoxic potential of 4 methylimidazole 4 MeI .
@highlight The panel used a weight of evidence WOE approach for 4 MeI study evaluation.
@highlight The expert panel evaluated study reliability and contribution to the overall WOE.
@highlight The expert panel found no clear evidence of
@highlight genotoxicity of 4 MeI.
@highlight Genotoxic mode of action for mouse lung tumor formation is not plausible for 4 MeI.
