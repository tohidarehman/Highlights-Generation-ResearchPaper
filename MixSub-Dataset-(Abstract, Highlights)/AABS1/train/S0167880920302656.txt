 Agricultural intensification causes habitat modification sometimes leading to habitat loss and subsequent loss of connectivity . Remaining species in these agriculture dominated landscapes often use hedgerows such as windbreaks or riparian strips as movement corridors or even as habitats . However the understanding of the use of these hedgerows by mammals is limited and could be improved with the use of high resolution remote sensing data which are unbiased detailed and repeatable . The aim of this study was to assess the attributes that affect medium and large sized mammals use of hedgerows with

@highlight 421 mammals were detected over 1572 trap days in 23 hedgerows.
@highlight Hedgerow length tree cover and understory density increased mammals use of hedgerows.
@highlight Human disturbance and hedgerow width negatively affected mammals use of hedgerows.
@highlight Mammals used all the hedgerows under study as movement corridors and or habitat.
@highlight Variables derived from remote sensing were useful to complement field data.
