 This study evaluated the effects of salicylic acid beeswax waste extract and licorice extract as novel biostimulants on drought induced oxidative stress on sesame . The treatments consisted of three drought stress conditions moderate stress 60 FC and severe stress 30 FC together with four exogenous foliar applications . Plants subjected to drought stress displayed significant reduction in plant height leaf area index biological and seed yield chlorophyll

@highlight Drought stress caused damage to growth and some physio biochemical traits.
@highlight Exogenous foliar application of substances mitigated the oxidative damages.
@highlight The modulating power of beeswax waste extract on drought stress was more effective than licorice extract and salicylic acid.
@highlight Beeswax waste extract can be utilized as an osmoprotectant instead of their synthesized ones.
