 Bisphenol A exposure can increase the risk of immune related diseases in later life . Vitamin D3 has been shown to have multiple immunomodulatory actions and has been used to treat immune diseases . However the potential beneficial effects of Vit D3 on BPA induced adverse effects in the immune system have not explored . We hypothesize that VitD3 may ameliorate BPA induced side effects in the immune system even in offspring of VitD3 supplemented mothers . Here we established our experimental model by exposing pregnant dams with 1000nM BPA with or without VitD3 treatment . We show that mother s exposure to BPA increases proliferation of the spleen T helper 17 cells and serum protein level of IL 17 in the offspring however VitD3 supplementation in mothers dose dependently ameliorated these BPA induced side effects on the immune system in the offspring as evidenced by attenuated upregulation of Th17 proliferation and

@highlight Maternal VitD3 supplementation inhibits BPA induced Th17 proliferation in offspring.
@highlight VitD3 in mother mice attenuates BPA induced RORt expression in offspring.
@highlight VitD3 in mother mice reduces BPA induced IL 6 and IL 23 increase in offspring.
@highlight VitD3 inhibit Th17 increment was mediated by upregulated VDR expression.
