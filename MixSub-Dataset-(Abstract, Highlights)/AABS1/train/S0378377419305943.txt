 A higher drought risk in Java Island is generally known than the other regions in Indonesia . Tracking soil moisture can be an alternative way to monitor drought rather than precipitation based drought indices . The objective of this study was to assess root zone water storage based on a linked approach between the generalized complementary relationship and a single bucket model in Java Island . Since it does not require precipitation for estimating actual evapotranspiration ET

@highlight Eastern Java could have a high risk of water shortage in dry season.
@highlight The proposed approach meets the simplicity for an operation of developing countries.
@highlight El Nio clearly contributed to the root zone water storage variability in Java.
