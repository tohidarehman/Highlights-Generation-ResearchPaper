 It is widely accepted that land surface temperature affects household energy consumption . There is however no previous study available that clarifies whether LST s impact is similar in each and every area or if it varies from one location to another . Analysing the impact of LST on HEC of 2612 residential zones of the Netherlands in 2014 this study concludes that HEC of 50 of the zones is affected by LST accounting for 0.8 of overall consumption on average . It is obtained that energy intensive high income and large size households are more likely to be affected by LST . The results show that the effect is likely to be significant in the zones with relatively milder air temperature and higher levels of humidity and wind . It is obtained that the effect intensifies when the buildings are less compact and the zones are less urbanised . Ultimately this study urges for a shift in the approach of the existing studies on the impact of LST by putting forward a proposition the impact of LST on HEC could not be spatially generalised and one can not enhance the associations unless location specific circumstances of the areas in question are taken into consideration .
