 Methane oxidation in upland areas plays a critical role in the global methane budget . A three year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of two soil surface treatments including soil covered with black plastic film mulch and non mulched treatment three fertilizer treatments including chemical NPK fertilizer cattle manure and their combined application of 50 chemical NPK fertilizer and 50 cattle manure and three soil wetted proportion levels under drip irrigation including 35 55 and 75 on methane oxidation in potato field in the arid area of northwestern China . Results showed that seasonal cumulative methane uptake value was 1.14.9kghm

@highlight Manure application enhanced methane oxidation.
@highlight Non mulched treatment was favorable for methane oxidation.
@highlight Small wetted proportion of drip irrigation was more conducive to methane oxidation.
