 Soil organic carbon ensures soil quality and productivity of cultivated systems in the Sahelian region . This study uses Rock Eval pyrolysis to examine how cultural practices impact the quantity of SOC and quality of SOM in cultivated sandy soils in the Senegal groundnut basin . This cost effective method provides information on SOC thermal stability which has been shown to be related qualitatively to biogeochemical stability of SOC . We sampled soils within two villages in agricultural plots representative of local agricultural systems and in two local preserved areas . SOC concentrations ranged from 1.818.5 g.kg

@highlight Soil amendment with manure or household organic wastes enhances SOC.
@highlight Rock Eval pyrolysis successfully characterizes SOC of sandy C poor soils.
@highlight Arenosols have a specific I R signature in the Rock Eval pyrolysis.
@highlight Organic inputs are crucial to feed labile C and maintain soil fertility.
@highlight The refractory C pool is more important in Arenosols than in Ferralsols.
