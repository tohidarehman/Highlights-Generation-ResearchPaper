 While liver injury is commonly associated with excessive alcohol consumption how liver injury affects alcohol metabolism and drinking preference remains unclear . To answer these questions we measured the expression and activity of alcohol dehydrogenase 1 and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 enzymes ethanol and acetaldehyde levels

@highlight Liver injury and inflammation impair the expression and activity of ethanol and acetaldehyde metabolizing enzyme.
@highlight Ethanol metabolizing ability is attenuated in injured and inflamed livers.
@highlight Liver injury and inflammation decrease binge like drinking behavior in mice.
@highlight Chronic liver injury reduces ethanol drinking preference in mice.
