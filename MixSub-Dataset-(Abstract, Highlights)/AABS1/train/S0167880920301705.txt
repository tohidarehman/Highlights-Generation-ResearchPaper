 In a rotation the use of crop species with large root biomass is thought to increase soil organic carbon storage deeper in the soil profile yet the processes and mechanisms that control SOC dynamics at depth are poorly understood . Using a cotton based field trial we examined how maize may impact SOC dynamics up to 1 m depth in three systems that differed in tillage and wheat rotation by examining the changes in

@highlight Maize rotation increased SOC stock in some systems particularly in the subsoil.
@highlight The increase was linked to the stable C fraction.
@highlight Vertical movement of C may have contributed to the observed increase in SOC stock.
@highlight Maize effect may not be consistent overtime and across different management.
