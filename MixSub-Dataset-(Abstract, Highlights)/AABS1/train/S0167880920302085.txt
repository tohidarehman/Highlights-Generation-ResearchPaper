 In the past decades the expansion and modernisation of agriculture in the mountainous areas of Southeast Asia has had severe impacts on biodiversity as the once species rich forests were turned into homogeneous fields receiving ample external inputs . A common feature of permanent cropping with annual crops is the frequent change of crop choice depending on market opportunities or other motives . However the precise effect of crop shifts on weeds in tropical areas is largely unknown . In this study we investigated the short term effect of crop sequences on the diversity of weed communities in smallholder fields of Northern Thailand . Crop choices were upland rice maize fallow and young tree plantations with or without intercrop . We counted the number of crop shifts and the number of crops involved during a 3 years period preceding weed sampling . We showed that the number of crop shifts did not affect weed density and biomass . However herbaceous species number and diversity increased by 36 and 46 respectively while herbaceous species dominance decreased by 38 in fields with yearly crop shifts compared to fields with no shifts in the previous three years . The effect of a particular crop on diversity or the effect of intercropping with young trees was weaker . It was likely due to the more variable resources in fields with two crop shifts allowing species with different niches to co exist . Crop type and frequent crop shifts did not affect shrub and tree species number diversity or dominance . Some species were strongly associated with fields with no crop shift in the sequence e.g . the tree

@highlight Frequent crop shifts in a crop sequence increased weed richness and diversity.
@highlight Crop shifts had a stronger effect on weed richness and diversity than the current crop.
@highlight The number of crop shifts did not affect weed biomass and density.
