 Subsoils have been identified as a potential carbon sink because they typically have low soil organic carbon concentrations and high SOC stability . One proposed strategy to increase SOC stocks is to enhance C inputs to the subsoil by increasing crop rotation diversity with deep rooted perennial crops . Using three long term field trials in Iowa we examined the effects of contrasting cropping systems maize

@highlight Greater belowground C inputs in alfalfa inclusive systems than maize soybean.
@highlight Greater soil C in alfalfa inclusive system at one location.
@highlight No effect of cropping system on vertical distribution of soil organic C.
