 Climate change and population growth generates a decrease in water availability around the world which can compromise the maintenance of sustainable agriculture . Thus treated wastewater became an alternative to minimize water shortage . However this may indirectly affect the soils microbial properties . In this study different soils irrigated for 0 1 8 and 20 years with TWW were sampled and from the east central region of Tunisia . The objective was to investigate its effect on heavy metal accumulation and enzyme activities of glucosidase arylsulfatase acid phosphatase alkaline phosphatase urease dehydrogenase and fluorescein diacetate . Moreover carbon microbial biomass C

@highlight The impact of TWW irrigation for 20 years was investigated.
@highlight TWW irrigation had led a significant accumulation of heavy metal.
@highlight Enzymes activities showed a significant variation among soils.
@highlight Functional diversity of soil microbial communities was enhanced.
