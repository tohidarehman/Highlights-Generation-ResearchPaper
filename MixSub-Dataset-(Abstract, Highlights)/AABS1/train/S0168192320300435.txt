 Dew is an important source of available water in arid or semi arid areas and considerable attention has focused upon whether foliar dew uptake occurs . Nonetheless its occurrence and effects on plant growth in the sand based ecosystems of the Mongolia Plateau are largely unknown . We performed laboratory experiments and conducted a three year field investigation of dew in the Hunshandak sandland northern China . Dew yield was determined by a weighing method . The ecological significance of dew was evaluated by measuring isotopes in the field leaf water content photosynthesis and the biomass of drought stressed plants exposed to dew . Nights producing dew comprised 53 of those between June and October when the atmospheric relative humidity was higher than 80 and wind speed was lower than 4.0ms

@highlight 53 of nights produced dew formation during summer and autumn.
@highlight Dew yield averaged 0.15mm night
@highlight Dew sustained C
@highlight plants and increased carbon gain in C
@highlight plant.
@highlight species showed higher utilization efficiency for dew than C
@highlight species.
