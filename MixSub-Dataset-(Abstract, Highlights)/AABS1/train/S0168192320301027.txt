 The past century has witnessed a global trend of increasing green house gas emissions causing a rise in temperatures changing hydroclimatic patterns and increasing occurrence of climatic extremes . Despite their importance for environmental conservation scientific research and forest management primary montane forests of the Dinaric Mts remain insufficiently studied . In this study we examined the relationship between climate and growth of Norway spruce

@highlight Growth limited by high summer temperatures and water availability in the Dinaric MTS.
@highlight Earlywood blue intensity contains a stronger recent drought signal than ring width.
@highlight Spruce TRW response is stronger than in fir but similar in EWBI of both species.
@highlight Recent spruce growth decline linked to increasing summer temperature and drought.
@highlight Ongoing climate change may have a strong impact on vitality and forest development.
