 Remotely sensed solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence provides a means to assess vegetation productivity in a more direct way than via the greenness of leaves . SIF is produced by plants alongside photosynthesis so it is generally thought to provide a more direct probe of plant status . We analyze inter annual variations of SIF over the US Corn Belt using a seven year time series retrieved from measurements of short wave IR radiation collected by the Japanese Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite . Using survey data and annual reports from the US Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service we relate anomalies in the GOSAT SIF time series to meteorological and climatic events that affected planting or growing seasons . The events described in the USDA annual reports are confirmed using remote sensing based data such as land surface temperature precipitation water storage anomalies and soil moisture . These datasets were carefully collocated with the GOSAT footprints on a sub pixel basis to remove any effect that could occur due to different sampling . We find that cumulative SIF integrated from April to June tracks the planting progress established in the first half of the planting season Pearson correlation

@highlight A seven year SIF time series from GOSAT over the US Corn Belt was analyzed.
@highlight Anomalies are consistent with USDA summaries regarding meteorological events.
@highlight GOSAT derived SIF tracks both planting and annual crop yields.
