 Microbial immobilization is a novel and environmentally friendly technique in which microbes are used to immobilize heavy metals in the soil . Polyamine production screening media and high pressure liquid chromatography were used to isolate polyamine producing bacteria from Cd and Pb polluted rhizosphere soil of lettuce . Enhancement of lettuce growth and reduced accumulation of Cd and Pb in lettuce by the polyamine producing strains were investigated . Two polyamine producing bacteria

@highlight N3 produced spd and spm 
@highlight XY7 produced put.
@highlight The two strains increase pH level and PAs content by enhanced
@highlight gene expression.
@highlight The two strains improved the biomass and reduced Cd and Pb accumulation in lettuce.
@highlight The two strains increase PAs contents and SOD and POD activities of lettuce shoots.
