 Jiuzhaigou Valley a subalpine river valley located in the transition zone between the Tibetan Plateau and the Sichuan Basin is characterized by fragile ecosystems strong climate change and high intensity human activities which might have changed the energy and water exchange of the wetlands . However little is known about the seasonal and interannual variability of the surface fluxes and their driving forces in these wetlands owing to the lack of long term continuous observations . We studied the dynamics of surface fluxes and their controlling factors based on the five year data collected from July 2013 to April 2019 . Our results showed that the dominant turbulent flux in this ecosystem shifted from sensible heat flux

@highlight The 5 year flux data provided a first look in wetlands of the transition zone.
@highlight Patterns in energy partitioning co varied with monsoon climate.
@highlight The energy partitioning with each year was similar across years.
@highlight Despite large fluctuations in precipitation interannual ET fluctuated little.
@highlight Official efforts to increase vegetation cover led to an increase in wetland ET.
