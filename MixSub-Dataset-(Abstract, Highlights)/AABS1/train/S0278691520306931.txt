 This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of curcumin on type 2 diabetes and its underlying mechanisms . A type 2 diabetes mellitus rat model was established by providing high fat diet and low doses of streptozotocin . Type 2 diabetes mellitus rats were treated with low dose and high dose of curcumin for 8 weeks . The results showed that high dose curcumin significantly reduced fasting blood glucose total cholesterol triglyceride low density lipoprotein cholesterol high density lipoprotein cholesterol alanine aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase liver coefficient and malondialdehyde levels and BCL2 Associated X expression in the type 2 diabetes mellitus rats . High dose curcumin increased the levels of liver superoxide dismutase catalase and glutathione as well as the expression of liver B cell lymphoma 2 phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase protein kinase B and phosphorylated protein kinase B in type 2 diabetes mellitus rats . Furthermore it ameliorated the histological structure of the liver and pancreas in diabetes mellitus model rats . However low dose curcumin had no significant effect on diabetes mellitus model rats . The results suggest that adequate doses of curcumin controls type 2 diabetes mellitus development as well as the mechanism involved in its anti apoptotic actions and phosphatidylinositol 3 hydroxy kinase protein kinase B signal pathway regulation in the liver .

@highlight High fat diet combined with STZ established T2DM rat model.
