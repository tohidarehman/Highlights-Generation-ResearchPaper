 Tetrabromobisphenol A and Hexabromocyclododecanes are two of the most used BFRs and they have cumulated in the environment . TBBPA and HBCDs in food were determined and their risks were assessed . The analytical method used was validated in different food categories and the performance parameters were acceptable based on the criteria of AOAC . Fish and cephalopods were contaminated with TBBPA higher than other foods and fish contained higher levels of HBCDs than other foods . HBCD was the predominant diastereomer in fish and meat and had strong correlations with HBCDs in fish and cephalopods . HBCDs accumulated easier than TBBPA in food . People were exposed to TBBPA from 0.125ng kg

@highlight A method to simultaneously analyse TBBPA and HBCDs in different foods was validated.
@highlight Fish and cephalopods were highly contaminated by TBBPA and HBCDs.
@highlight HBCDs easily accumulate in food rather than TBBPA.
@highlight Vegetables were the main contributors for exposure to TBBPA and HBCDs in food.
@highlight TBBPA and HBCDs in food and the environment are of low concern to public health.
