 Zeolite has been widely used for improving rice production but there is a lack of information on how nitrogen accumulation and translocation affect yield performance of paddy field in the alternate wetting and drying irrigation amended with zeolite . In this study a 2 year field experiment with installed lysimeters was carried out to determine the influence of Z application 0 5 and 10 t Z ha

@highlight Alternate wetting and drying irrigation increased inorganic N in soil but not plant N accumulation of rice.
@highlight Alternate wetting and drying irrigation reduced water usage with similar or reduced rice grain yield.
@highlight Zeolite amendment increased inorganic N in soil and plant N accumulation of rice.
@highlight Zeolite amendment enhanced plant growth and subsequent grain yield of rice.
