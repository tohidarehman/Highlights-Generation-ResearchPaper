 Replacing native savannas with exotic pastures not only alters vegetation structure but it also increases herbivorous cattle dung quantity consequently changing the food resource available for dung beetles . Therefore this study aims at investigating the relative importance of vegetation structure regarding food resource types to determine dung beetle assemblage in Cerrado savannas and exotic pastures . We carried out a sampling of dung beetles in 30 areas of Cerrado

@highlight Conversion of Cerrado savannas into exotic pastures changed dung beetle assemblages.
@highlight Changes in vegetation structure are more important than changes in food resources.
@highlight Introduction of pastures and cattle facilitate the invasion of an exotic species.
@highlight The vegetation structure of exotic pastures can be modified to avoid the loss of dung beetles.
