 The impact of global warming on water and nitrate losses from a rainfed canola cropping system under various artificial drainage systems was assessed using an integrated field modeling approach . Four subsurface drainage systems with different drain depths

@highlight Climate change projections into water nitrate losses from a rainfed canola field were investigated.
@highlight The projections were simulated for different drainage systems using HYDRUS 2D 3D .
@highlight Surplus precipitation and seasonal water nitrate losses will increase in future.
@highlight Drainage system D
@highlight provides the smallest risk of future environmental deterioration.
