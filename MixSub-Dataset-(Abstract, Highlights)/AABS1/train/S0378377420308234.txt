 Regulating water use in agriculture in water stressed basins is a challenging task . Recent scholarship emphasises the need to combine strong State oversight for achieving the collective extraction caps with considerable leeway to users to allocate water according to local priorities . This form of co management between the State and users aims to improve the implementation of sustainable extraction limits . This model was adopted in France where agricultural user groups share water resources within a capped allocation pool enforced by the State . This paper evaluates whether the allocation rules developed by user groups improve environmental economic and social performance . A detailed survey was carried out amongst the 54 agricultural user groups created across France . Results suggest that the reform has led to greater awareness amongst irrigators of their water resources and the slow emergence of collective action . Allocation rules have been developed reflecting local economic and social priorities as well as the temporal and spatial dynamics of local surface and groundwater resources . Although challenges remain the research presented in this paper supports co management to manage agricultural water extraction and discusses institutional design features that can facilitate its implementation .

@highlight We examine how agricultural extraction is being capped in France.
@highlight We analyse allocation rules designed by 54 user groups.
@highlight Users were able to exploit the regulatory leeway to adapt rules to local conditions.
@highlight Rules are very diverse and integrate environmental economic and social priorities.
