 Agricultural intensification has led to landscape simplification partially due to massive reduction in the area of biodiversity rich non cropped habitats . Power lines and their associated infrastructure occurring in homogeneous farmland have recently been suggested to provide suitable habitat resources for some animals . This is the first study to investigate the importance of high voltage power pylons in providing habitats of uncropped patches for small mammal communities in the agricultural landscape . We found that the abundance and species richness of small mammals during the winter was significantly higher in uncropped habitat patches under power pylons compared to the surrounding farmland . We suggest that power line infrastructure in the agricultural landscape may represent a crucial though overlooked refuge for small mammals by providing them with persistent habitat for wintering and spring dispersal .

@highlight Power lines have been widely recognized as a crucial anthropogenic threat to wildlife.
@highlight We assessed importance of uncropped habitats under power pylons for small mammals.
@highlight We found that power lines represent crucial refuges for small mammals in the farmland.
@highlight Thus power lines may thus paradoxically contribute to biodiversity conservation.
