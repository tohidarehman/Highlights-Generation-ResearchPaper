 Pollination service in agricultural crops increases significantly with pollinator diversity and wild pollinator abundance . Differences in the foraging behaviour of pollinating insects are one of the reasons why pollinator diversity and abundance enhances crop pollination . Here we focused on the foraging behaviour of honey bees and bumble bees in sweet cherry orchards . In addition we studied the influence of bee diversity and abundance on the foraging behaviour of honey bees and bumble bees . Honey bees were found to visit fewer flowers than bumble bees . Bumble bees also showed a higher probability of changing trees between rows than honey bees . Both visitation rate and probability of row changes of honey bees increased with bumble bee diversity and with bumble bee abundance . We also found that the probability of row changes of honey bees increased with increasing bumble bee abundance . These effects of bumble bee richness and abundance on the pollination behaviour of honey bees can improve the pollination performance of honey bees in crops that depend on cross pollination . Our results highlight the higher pollination performance of bumble bees and the facilitative effect of wild pollinators to crop pollination .

@highlight The pollination behaviour of bumble bees is different than that of honey bees.
@highlight Bumble bee richness and abundance improve the pollination behaviour of honey bees.
@highlight Bumble bees pollination behaviour was not influenced by bee richness or abundance.
