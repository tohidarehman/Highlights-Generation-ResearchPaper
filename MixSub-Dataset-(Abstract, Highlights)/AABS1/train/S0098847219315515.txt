 Climate change is predicted to result in more variable and extreme precipitation regimes with potentially longer periods between precipitation events . However the effects of multiple sequential drought events on ecosystems and potential acclimation particularly in grasslands is poorly understood . In this study we tested if two simulated drought regimes sustained drought and repeated drought differentially influence fourteen key physiological responses in the model grass species

@highlight Sustained drought but not repeated promoted physiological acclimation.
@highlight More variable physiological responses occurred in repeated than sustained drought.
@highlight Sustained drought led to conservative responses and minimal growth.
@highlight Physiology during repeated drought was opportunistic linked to water availability.
