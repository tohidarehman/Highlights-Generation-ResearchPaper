 Within the context of climate change the temporal dynamics of vegetation growth on the Tibetan Plateau have remained unclear especially over the most recent decade . Using a normalized difference vegetation index we investigated vegetation dynamics on TP from 2000 to 2018 with a special focus on the northeastern part controlled by the westerlies and the southwestern part controlled by the Indian monsoon . Results indicate that the northeastern part had a consistent greening trend but the southwestern part was browning in the 2000s and turned to greening in the 2010s . Precipitation was the key factor controlling NDVI dynamics in both parts . Differences in seasonality and trends in the strength of the atmospheric circulation might contributed to the distinct NDVI dynamics in these two parts . Our findings in combination with previous reports on changes in the westerlies and Indian monsoon highlight the importance of linking vegetation dynamics and atmospheric circulation for predicting the trend of plant growth on TP in the future .

@highlight Unlike the persistent greening trend in the northeastern part the southwestern part was browning in 2000s but turned to greening in 2010s.
@highlight Precipitation was the key factor controlling NDVI dynamics in both northeastern and southwestern Tibetan Plateau.
@highlight Changes in the strength of Indian monsoon might contribute to the shift trend of NDVI in the southwestern part.
