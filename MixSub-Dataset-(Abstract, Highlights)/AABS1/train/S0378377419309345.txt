 We evaluated the influence of the termination dates of a winter cover crop on soil water availability during soybean

@highlight Cover crops reduced soil available water at termination date mostly in the uppermost soil layers 040cm .
@highlight Cover crop water uptake produced little impact on soil available water during soybean initial growth and critical period for kernel set.
@highlight Cover crops at contrasting termination dates did not influence soybean grain yield.
@highlight Soybean evapotranspiration was reduced between 1217mm and water productivity was slightly increased 410 following a cover crop.
@highlight Larger soybean evapotranspiration reductions were associated with larger cover crops shoot biomass production.
