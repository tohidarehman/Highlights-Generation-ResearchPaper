 Agroforestry shelterbelts are important ecological barriers providing protection against wind and sand related disasters in the North China Plain . However large proportions of these agroforestry shelterbelts are degenerating or have died in recent years and the causes of degeneration are extremely complex . In this study stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope techniques were used to quantify water sources for

@highlight Stable isotope used to explore the causes of shelter forest degradation.
@highlight Water absorption of shelter forest under four degradation degrees were explored.
@highlight The water sources of tree gradually shallow as the degree of degradation increased.
@highlight Insufficient water was the main reason for the degeneration of shelter forest.
