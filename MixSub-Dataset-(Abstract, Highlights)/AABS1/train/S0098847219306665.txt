 This study investigated whether and how brassinosteroids mediate the effect of soil drying during meiosis on spikelet degeneration in rice

@highlight Brassinosteroids BRs are involved in spikelet degeneration in rice.
@highlight BRs mediate the effect of soil drying during meiosis on rice spikelet degeneration.
@highlight Moderate soil drying can increase BRs levels and decrease spikelet degeneration.
@highlight BRs mediate spikelet degeneration by regulating antioxidant level and energy status.
