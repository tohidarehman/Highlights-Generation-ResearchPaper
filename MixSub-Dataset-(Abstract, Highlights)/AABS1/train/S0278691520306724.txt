 Beer is one of the most widely consumed alcoholic beverages in the world however traditional and non alcoholic beer consumption appear to have different effects on the cardiovascular system . In this short work we review a base of recent papers to confirm whether or not moderate consumption of beer and its non alcoholic components have a beneficial effect of cardiovascular system . Moreover the present work reviews recently published papers regarding the influence of beer components on the hemostasis cardiovascular system and cardiovascular diseases . Although most nutritional guidelines recommend a maximum of one beer per day for women and two for men individual ideals may vary according to age sex genetics and body type as well as drug or supplement use . Moreover the recommendations for the moderate consumption of beer are often based on individual case reports and often small clinical experiments . In addition as the health related effects of beer consumption may also depend on the presence of other dietary components as well as the type of beer it is difficult to determine whether moderate consumption is universally safe and beneficial for the cardiovascular system . More randomized clinical trials are needed to determine this . Well designed clinical trials are also required to determine the influence of various beer components on hemostasis and CVDs and their effects in combination with drug or supplement therapy .
