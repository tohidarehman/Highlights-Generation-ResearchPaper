 Rainfall characteristics can be a major factor influencing the ability of best management practices to reduce nutrient loss from agricultural lands to receiving waterbodies . The goal of this study was to examine how rainfall characteristics impacted NO

@highlight We examined how rainfall characteristics impacted NO
@highlight N concentrations in a tailwater recovery ditch.
@highlight Rainfall events were grouped into four classes by using the
@highlight  means clustering method.
@highlight NO
@highlight N concentrations were strongly dependent on duration of rainfall events.
@highlight NO
@highlight N concentrations were also strongly dependent on the characteristics of next to last rainfall events.
@highlight Rainfall characteristics have significant implications on the operation and management of TWR ditches.
