 Chloroamphetamine an amphetamine derivative has been shown to induce serotonergic toxicity . However the precise mechanism of serotonergic toxicity induced by PCA remains unclear . In this study PCA treatment did not significantly change 5 HT

@highlight A high dose of PCA markedly increased hypothalamic 5 HT
@highlight receptor R expression.
@highlight 5 HT
@highlight R antagonism protected against PCA induced phosphorylation of PKC.
@highlight The phosphorylation of PKC mediated PCA induced serotonergic impairments.
@highlight Pharmacological genetic inhibition of PKC rescued these serotonergic impairments.
