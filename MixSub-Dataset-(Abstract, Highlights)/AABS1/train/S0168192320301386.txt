 In the Mediterranean region the coupled effect of recent changes in climatic features and an increase in human related water demand induced a progressive reduction in the water level of many lakes . Consequently intense withdrawals for public supply can affect the health of lake ecosystems and increase trees vulnerability to predicted drought intensification effects .

@highlight Lake water withdrawal influenced tree ring growth responses to climate variability
@highlight Intense water withdrawal and drought induced trees to utilize long term water supply
@highlight Tree ring growth was highly sensitive to short term water level fluctuations
@highlight Resilience and growth recovery suggested critical water levels affecting riparian trees
@highlight Human water use can increase trees vulnerability to drought intensification
