 This investigation continues our study of the effects of Pb Cd poisoning on the heart extending the enquiry from isometric to auxotonic contractions thereby examining the effect on the ability of myocardial tissues to perform mechanical work . Different shifts were revealed in myocardial force velocity relations following subchronic exposure of rats to lead acetate and cadmium chloride acting separately in combination or in combination with a bioprotective complex . The experiments were conducted on isolated preparations of trabecules and papillary muscles of the right ventricle in physiological loading conditions and on isolated heart muscle contractile proteins examined by the

@highlight The experiments were conducted on preparations of trabecules and papillary muscles and on myocardium proteins.
@highlight Force velocity and the
@highlight motility assay data were changed following subchronic exposure of rats to Pb and Cd.
@highlight These shifts become fully or partly normalized against background administration of the proposed bioprotective complex.
