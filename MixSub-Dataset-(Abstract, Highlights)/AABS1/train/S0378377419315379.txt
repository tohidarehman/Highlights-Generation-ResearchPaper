 To quantify the water absorbed by wheat in different soil layers and improve both wheat yields and water use efficiency a 2 year conservation tillage and straw treatment experiment was implemented . This experiment involved four tillage methods conventional tillage subsoiling rotary tillage and no tillage and two straw treatments straw return and no straw return . The hydrogen oxygen and carbon stable isotope method was used to evaluate the water source grain yield dry matter quantity and WUE of wheat as well as the relationships between

@highlight Wheat mainly absorbed water from 020cm soil layer at jointing and harvest stages.
@highlight Subsoiling with straw returning improves wheat yield and water use efficiency.
@highlight Wheat yield and water use efficiency can be indicated by
