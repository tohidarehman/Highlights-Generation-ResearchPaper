 Supplementing different quantities of boron can significantly affect immune function in rat spleen but the mechanism of action behind this effect remains unclear . Our purpose was to study the involvement of the estrogen membrane receptor GPR30 in the effect of boron on the proliferation apoptosis and immune function of rat spleen lymphocytes . Results showed that the addition of 0.4mmol L boron had a beneficial effect on the immune function and proliferation of spleen lymphocytes but the addition of 40mmol L boron had opposite effect . After using G 15 to selectively inhibit GPR30 the proportions of CD4

@highlight The Supplemental dose of boron affected the immune function of spleen lymphocytes.
@highlight GPR30 regulated spleen T cell subsets and cell proliferation and apoptosis events.
@highlight GPR30 mediated the effects of low dose boron on immune function of spleen lymphocyte.
