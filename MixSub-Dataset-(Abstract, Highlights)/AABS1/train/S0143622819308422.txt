 It is meaningful to improve the urban land resources carrying capacity and realize a sustainable utilization of land resources in the process of urbanization . The review of the previous studies shows that the impact of urbanization on the urban land resources carrying capacity has not reached a unified conclusion . The aim of using EBP is to narrow the gap between the practice and the academic community in the study of the urban land resources carrying capacity is the first of its kind . In this study the related literatures are reviewed systematically . The relationship between urbanization and the urban land resources carrying capacity is obtained by using meta analysis . Then evaluate the urban land resources carrying capacity and compare with text analysis results . The results show that in general urbanization is conducive to improving the urban land resources carrying capacity . In addition due to the destruction of ecological environment and aging population structure with a large influx of urban population the urban land resources carrying capacity in Shanghai the core city of the long delta region is decreasing . Focusing on a case study of Yangtze River Delta is useful in promoting urban sustainability and this framework provides rich implications for other city prototypes in the world .

@highlight It is the first time to use the EBP to study land carrying capacity.
@highlight Urbanization is beneficial to improve the urban land resources carrying capacity.
@highlight The new type urbanization is more conducive to the sustainable use of urban land.
@highlight Population factor has an important influence.
@highlight Environmental ecology is the main obstructive factor.
