 Humans are exposed to plastic particles but there are no studies on environmental plastics in cell cultures or animals . The toxicological understanding arises from model particles like polystyrene polyethylene or non plastic particles like food grade titanium dioxide . The majority of studies on polystyrene particles show toxicological effects on measures of oxidative stress inflammation mitochondrial dysfunction lysosomal dysfunction and apoptosis . The toxic effects in cell cultures mainly occur at high concentrations . Polyethylene particles seem to generate inflammatory reactions whereas other toxicological effects have not been assessed . There are very few studies on effects of polystyrene particles in animal models and these have not demonstrated overt indices of toxicity . Studies in animals are the likely way for hazard assessment of micro or nanoplastics . However co culture systems that mimic the complex architecture of mammalian tissues can cost efficiently determine the hazards of micro and nanoplastics . Future studies should include low doses of micro and nanoplastic particles which are more relevant in the assessment of health risk than the extrapolation of effects from high doses to realistic doses . Based on studies on model particles environmental exposure to micro and nanoplastic particles may be a hazard to human health .

@highlight Humans are orally exposed to micro and nanoplastic particles via food and water.
@highlight The hazard of real life plastic particles have only been assessed indirectly via model particles.
@highlight Polystyrene particles primarily in nanosize produce toxic responses in cell cultures.
@highlight There are insufficient studies to conclude anything about the toxicity of polystyrene particles in animals.
@highlight Using food grade TiO
@highlight as model particle for plastic particles does not indicate strong toxic effects.
