 Intensive agricultural activities have accelerated soil erosion and rocky desertification in karst regions of southwest China . Knowledge of sediment sources and soil erosion rates can be used to target soil conservation measures and to improve calibration and validation of process based soil erosion and sediment delivery models for scenario analyses . Due to the complexity of karst environments however catchment scale information on these components of sediment budgets has rarely been assembled meaning there continues to be an evidence gap . Within this context this study selected Chenqi catchment given its appropriate research infrastructure to investigate sediment sources and soil loss rates in a typical karst agroforestry landscape . We estimated the relative contributions from three sources surface soil subsurface soil and clastic rock using a composite fingerprinting procedure combining

@highlight Cs and mineral magnetism used to fingerprint sediment sources.
@highlight Sub surface soils contributed 62 099 of suspended sediment in surface drainage.
@highlight Sub surface soils contributed 68 097 of suspended sediment in subsurface drainage.
@highlight Annual suspended sediment yield for the surface outlet was 4.64 Mg km
@highlight Annual suspended sediment yield in the underground outlet was 1.20 Mg km
