 Changes in the seasonal timing of plant flowering are hypothesized to alter the number of flowers plants produce which contributes to reproductive success . However empirical evidence linking specific aspects of plant flowering phenology to the number of flowers produced is limited particularly under future global climate change . We used phenology measurements after 2 3 6 and 7 years of a fully factorial climate change field experiment in an alpine meadow pasture on the central Tibetan Plateau to understand 1 how experimental warming and snow addition affect the date of first and last flowering in related forb and shrub species

@highlight Experimental warming advanced first flowering in alpine shrub and forb species.
@highlight Simulated snowstorms delayed first flowering in the forb 
@highlight Early season soil microclimate significantly affected the date of last flowering.
@highlight Reproductive effort increased as last flowering date occurred later.
@highlight Advanced first flowering date does not guarantee increased reproductive effort.
