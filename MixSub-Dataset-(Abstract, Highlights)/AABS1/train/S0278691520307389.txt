 Di phthalate which is widely used as an industrial plasticizer may cause liver damage . Concomitantly bad dietary habits can exacerbate the liver burden . In this study high fat diet fed rats were treated with DEHP for 5 weeks and a biochemical method was adopted to detect serum lipid contents . Key metabolic genes and pathological changes were assessed by different methods . The rats which were exposed to DEHP at a dose of 10mg kg bw exhibited dyslipidemia and increased transcription of SREBP 1 and its target FAS thereby prompting

@highlight The HFD fed rats exposed to DEHP did not show increased body weight whereas worse metabolic profile.
@highlight Different doses of DEHP disrupt lipid metabolic profiles.
@highlight DEHP at the lowest dose prompts
@highlight lipogenesis.
@highlight DEHP at the highest dose improve fatty acid oxidation.
