 The link between transportation infrastructure and income segregation has long been recognized in the literature but has received renewed attention with the increased investment in rail transit in US cities . In this paper we examine the impacts of rail transit investments on neighborhood income diversity and metropolitan income segregation . For the neighborhood level analysis we apply a difference in difference approach combined with propensity score matching in 11 metropolitan areas that invested in rail transit between 2000 and 2005 . We then estimate the effect of changes in rail transit access on income segregation across the 50 largest metropolitan areas in the US between 1990 and 2010 . We find no statistical evidence that rail transit investments spur changes in neighborhood income diversity when compared to similar neighborhoods elsewhere in the city . Similarly we find no significant impact of new or expanded rail transit lines on metropolitan wide income segregation .

@highlight Study combines propensity score matching with difference in differences estimations.
@highlight No significant relationship between rail transit and neighborhood income diversity.
@highlight Changes in rail transit access does not appear to influence income segregation.
