 Determining the timing of supplementary irrigation in water limited conditions is one approach to reducing drought damage increasing water productivity and improving the yield of dryland canola . Selenium spraying may be an appropriate strategy for increasing crop tolerance to drought stress . The aim of this research was to evaluate supplementary irrigation and selenium spraying on the yield and water productivity of two canola cultivars under subtropical dryland conditions . The experiment was a split factorial in a randomized complete block design with three replications conducted during 20162018at Gachsaran Agricultural Research Station Iran . The main factors consisted of irrigation regimes no irrigation I

@highlight Supplementary irrigation in two stages of flowering and grain filling of dryland canola increased yield 2.8 times.
@highlight Selenium spraying 1.5mg L
@highlight  increased canola performance under dryland condition.
@highlight Two supplementary irrigation and 1.5mg L
@highlight sodium selenate increased water use efficiency two times.
