 Returning crop straw such as biochar into the field is increasingly recognized as a valid environmentally friendly agricultural strategy to improve soil quality increase crop yields and reduce combustion induced air pollution . Root exudation has potential importance for plant performance rhizosphere function and plantsoil interactions however the effects of crop straw input on maize root exudation remain unclear . After three seasons of a field experiment a mesh bag experiment was conducted in situ in the fourth season to study the effects of three straw incorporation treatments and control on root exudation and their underlying mechanisms in a maize cropping system . Discrimination in the metabolic profiling of the root exudates between the CK and all the straw incorporated samples was clear but the separation between the samples from the three different straw strategies was limited . Among the 32 assigned components of maize root exudates the fluctuations in organic acids were stronger than those in sugars and amino acids when straw was incorporated . The response of the organic acid exudates was linked to the transcript levels of the ZmMATE1 and ZmMATE2 genes which are associated with root exudation Spearman correlations

@highlight Root exudation plays a vital role in the soilplant system.
@highlight Maize roots under straw input had different
@highlight H NMR exudate profiles compared no straw.
@highlight Root modification mainly characterized by elongation of BC switched to thickening of SD.
@highlight Molecular evidence was provided by qRT PCR for organic acid exudation and root growth.
@highlight Responses of root morphology and metabolome to straw input linked to exudation shift.
