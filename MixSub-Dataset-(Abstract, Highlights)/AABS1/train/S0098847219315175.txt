 WRKY transcription factors play crucial roles in plant response to environmental stresses . This study aimed to investigate an uncharacterized gene encoding AtWRKY21 in mediating an adaptive response to osmotic stress in Arabidopsis .

@highlight is substantially induced by drought stress.
@highlight The
@highlight mutant lines have higher tolerance to drought stress.
@highlight A set of genes are possibly working on the downstream of
@highlight functions as a negative regulator of plant response to drought stress.
