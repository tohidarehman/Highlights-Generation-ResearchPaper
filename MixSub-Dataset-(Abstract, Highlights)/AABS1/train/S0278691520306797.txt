 Toxicant exposures may worsen the micronutrient status especially during the womb to childhood development impairing organism programming and increasing the risk for health disorders in adulthood . Growing evidence calls for an integrated risk analysis of the interplay of environment behavior and lifestyle where a imbalanced diet and micronutrient deficiencies may increase the vulnerability to toxicants and alter body defence systems and b intake of antinutrients and contaminants may increase nutritional requirements . Such scenarios are especially evident in communities undergoing a fast nutrition transition such as in many countries of sub Saharan Africa .

@highlight Toxic exposures and nutritional imbalances rise with fast and unmanaged economic growth.
@highlight Exposure to toxicants is a shared aspect in fighting all forms of malnutrition.
@highlight Sub Saharan Africa presents huge implications of the interplay between toxic exposures and nutrition.
@highlight Challenges for risk analysis include rapid changes of environment and lifestyles dumping weak awareness and legislation.
@highlight Riding the emerging market opportunities presents a chance for diseases prevention and health promotion.
