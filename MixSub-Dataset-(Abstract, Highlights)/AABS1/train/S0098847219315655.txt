 Our previous study on bedding plants indicated that blue light in association with low phytochrome activity relative to red light can promote elongation growth as one of the shade avoidance responses . We hypothesized that phototropin is involved in the blue light promotion effects . To test the hypothesis plant growth and morphology were examined in wild

@highlight Phtotropins are partly involved in blue light promoted stem elongation.
@highlight Phtotropins contribute to flowering promotion by blue light.
@highlight Phototropins play a role in blue light mediated leaf expansion.
