 Every individual strives to improve their quality of life and therefore adopts strategies to cope with the adverse situation of their livelihood . The decision to migrate or to stay is one such strategy to combat unexpected disturbances to their livelihoods . This research assessed the relationship between socio ecological systems and livelihood conditions and determined how a sustainable livelihood influences non migration decisions of people living at risk .
