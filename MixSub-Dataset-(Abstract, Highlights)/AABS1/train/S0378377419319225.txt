 The main objective of the present study is to improve onion crop yield using aquaculture drainage under surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems . Field experiments are carried out on onion crop under conditions of two different water resources two types of filters and four different pressures . The performance of the tested drip irrigation systems is evaluated based on filtration efficiency discharge reduction application efficiency emitters clogging emission uniformity onion yield and water use efficiency . The obtained experimental results show that irrigation with aquaculture drainage gives the highest onion yield of 19.17Mg fed for surface drip irrigation and 17.03Mg fed for subsurface drip irrigation compared to groundwater which gives 17.55Mg fed for surface irrigation and 14.20Mg fed for subsurface irrigation . Surface drip irrigation achieves the lowest emitter clogging and the highest emission uniformity in comparison with a subsurface drip irrigation system that gives the lowest emitter clogging and the highest emission uniformity at 1.6bar pressure . It is recommended to use aquaculture drainage for operating surface drip irrigation systems under pressure of 1.4bar using combined screen sand filters for aquaculture drainage filtration while screen filter for groundwater filtration .
