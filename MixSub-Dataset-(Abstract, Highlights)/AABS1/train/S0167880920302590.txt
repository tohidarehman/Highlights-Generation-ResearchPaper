 Ruminant urine patches are potential sites of reactive nitrogen loss to the environment . Quantification of N losses from grazed grasslands requires measurement of the frequency of urine deposition as well as its volume and chemical composition . However studies to date are typically restricted to analyses of few replicate animals and urination events especially for sheep . Here we present data on urine frequency volume chemical composition and metabolomic profile from penned sheep . Differences in urine parameters and chemical composition data were compared seasonally and between two sites . Sheep urinated 811 times d

@highlight Sheep urination data is important for quantifying downstream nitrogen losses.
@highlight Assessed frequency volume and chemical composition of sheep urine events.
@highlight Greater N excretion rate for sheep on improved versus semi improved pasture.
@highlight Site and seasonal differences in sheep urine chemical composition observed.
@highlight Data will be useful for modelling experimental studies assessing urine N losses.
