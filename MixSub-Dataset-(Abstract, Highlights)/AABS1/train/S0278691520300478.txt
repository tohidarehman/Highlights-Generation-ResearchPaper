 Aflatoxin is a highly toxic and carcinogenic substance with fluorescence characteristic . To explore the feasibility of detection the degree of aflatoxin contamination using hyperspectral imaging technology we proposed a machine learning detection method based on support vector machine combining band index and narrow band . First five concentrations of aflatoxin solutions were prepared and dripped onto the surface of different peanut kernels . Next hyperspectral images with 33 bands were acquired for each sample using a hyperspectral imaging system under 365nm ultraviolet light . Then four fluorescence indexes including Radiation Index Difference Radiation Indexes Ratio Radiation Index and Normalized Difference Radiation Index were proposed . Finally Fisher method was used to optimize and obtain a narrowband spectrum and RBF SVM model was used to recognize aflatoxin and make regression analysis on the degree of aflatoxin contamination . Experimental results showed that DRI index had the optimal performance and the accuracy rate of 5 fold cross validation of SVM were 95.5 and the mean square error and correlation coefficient
