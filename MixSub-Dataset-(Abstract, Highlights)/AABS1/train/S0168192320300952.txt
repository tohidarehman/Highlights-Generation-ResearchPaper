 Assimilating multi source data into crop models is a promising way to improve crop growth simulations and yield estimations over a large area . Most of previous studies have mainly assimilated one of the observed retrieved variables such as leaf area index or soil moisture . However assimilating multi source data into a model and evaluating their respective contributions to improvements in model simulations have been rare . In this study we proposed a novel Multi Step Assimilating of a crop model with Multi source Data and further demonstrated it with the MCWLA Wheat model in improving the simulations of crop development soil moisture dynamics and grain yield for winter wheat in the North China Plain . The MSAcmMD based on the calibrating assimilation strategy followed the logical links among sub modules of the crop model . It includes four assimilation steps calibrating crop model parameters assimilating crop phenology assimilating soil moisture and assimilating crop LAI . The results showed that MSAcmMD can improve substantially the simulations of crop development soil moisture dynamics grain yields and their spatiotemporal patterns over a large area and during a relative long term period . During 20012008 across the study areas the coefficient of determination R

@highlight We designed an MSAcmMD framework to improve regional crop growth simulation.
@highlight We evaluated the respective contributions of multi variables to yield estimations.
@highlight Modelling under MSAcmMD framework can retrieve reasonably root zone soil moisture.
