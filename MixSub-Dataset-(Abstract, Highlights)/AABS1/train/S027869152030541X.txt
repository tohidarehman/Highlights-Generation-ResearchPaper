 The effect of simulants repeated use washing and oiling on the release of toxic metals from metallic kitchen utensils was investigated . The release of As Cd Cr Ni and Pb from kitchen utensils composed of stainless steel aluminum copper alloy and cast iron into food simulants was quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry . The results show that this release of toxic metals was highly dependent on pH . Generally the release of toxic metals tended to decrease with repeated use and the release of Cr and Ni from stainless steel samples was significantly higher in the first test compared to the third test . The washing conditions affected the release of As and Cr whose release levels were higher when washing only with water and with a steel wool pad respectively . Furthermore oiling cast iron cookware reduced the release of As Cd Cr and Ni into acidic simulants by 66 83 71 and 15 respectively . The margin of exposure was calculated for each toxic metal the calculated MOE values indicated that it is improbable that the current level of exposure from metallic kitchen utensils would pose a health risk in Korea .
