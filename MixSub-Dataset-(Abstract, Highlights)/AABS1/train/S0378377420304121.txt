 Desalinated sea water provides a steady agricultural water supply that overcomes climatological and hydrological constraints fostering food security and socio economic stability in water stressed regions . In the last decade seawater desalination for irrigation has been massively implemented in south eastern Spain amid rising pressure and competition for water resources . However farmers seem reluctant to replace conventional water sources with DSW due to its higher price and the need for additional fertilization . This article assesses how fertigation cost increases can affect farming profitability when integrating DSW for irrigation . The increases in water and fertilizer costs of totally and partially replacing conventional water with DSW were calculated for the most representative crops of the Segura basin in SE Spain .

@highlight Replacing conventional water with DSW strongly affects fertigation costs.
@highlight Moving to a 100 DSW scenario implies a remarkable profitability loss for all crops.
@highlight Irrigation water cost increase is significant for all crops.
@highlight Fertilizer cost increase is only significant for hydroponic cultivation.
@highlight A 50 DSW scenario mitigates fertigation costs supra linearly.
