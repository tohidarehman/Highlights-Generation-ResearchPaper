 Tetrodotoxin is a potent neurotoxin responsible for many food poisoning incidents and some fatalities . Although mainly associated with the consumption of pufferfish in recent years TTX has been found in shellfish particularly in Europe . In this work a magnetic bead based colorimetric immunoassay was applied to the detection of TTX in Pacific oysters

@highlight An immunoassay was developed for the detection of tetrodotoxins TTXs .
@highlight The use of magnetic beads MBs as supports decreased the shellfish matrix effects.
@highlight TTX spiked Pacific oyster razor clam and mussel extracts were analysed.
@highlight Limits of detection below the EFSA guidance threshold 44g kg were obtained.
@highlight The analysis with the MB based immunoassay can be performed in less than 1.5h.
