 Establishing semi natural areas within annual croplands can provide habitat for beneficial organisms and ecosystem services to crops through a spillover effect . However this approach to increasing landscape complexity may have no effect on crops or it may promote pests weeds and other disservices that reduce productivity . An argument for changing landscape complexity may be more persuasive if it is associated with higher crop yields . Here we examine regions that vary in their landscape complexity and therefore may also naturally differ in the potential for ecosystem services disservices and crop yields . Specifically we examine crop growing districts in the Canadian province of Alberta to test whether the presence of more non crop land covers has increased crop yields . Our dataset covered about one quarter of the seeded area in Canada between 2012 and 2017 consisting of 10 069 records representing average field level yields reported to a crop insurance provider . In total we analyzed summary data for 250 000 km

@highlight Landscape complexity was positively associated with crop yields at the district level in four crops.
@highlight Farmers may be able to receive a small crop productivity benefit from enhancing landscape complexity.
@highlight Potential negative effects of non crop land covers e.g. as pest or weed reservoirs were not dominant.
@highlight Increasing semi natural vegetation may present few risks for crop productivity in Canadian Prairie annual croplands.
