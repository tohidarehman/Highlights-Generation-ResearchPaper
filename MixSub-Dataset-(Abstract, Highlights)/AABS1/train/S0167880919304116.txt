 Due to severe soil erosion and low crop yield sloping croplands have been converted into forests and grasslands during the past decades on Chinas Loess Plateau . The introduced exotic high water consumption plants cause soil water deficit that leads to the formation of dry soil layer . The traditional index method used to determine the existence of DSL considers only soil hydraulic property of stable field capacity and fails to fully reflect the interactions between soil water and vegetation . A new index method that considers physiological response of vegetation to drought is needed for DSL research . Here we proposed a new method to identify and quantify the severity of DSL and compared the proposed method with the traditional method using field data for the 5 m soil depth in typical tree

@highlight The conversion of cropland into forests and grasslands causes DSL formation on CLP.
@highlight The proposed new dynamic index method uses soil water availability to determine DSL.
@highlight The traditional method overestimates the severity of DSL on converted croplands.
@highlight The overestimation of DSL severity was greater for areas with coarser textures.
