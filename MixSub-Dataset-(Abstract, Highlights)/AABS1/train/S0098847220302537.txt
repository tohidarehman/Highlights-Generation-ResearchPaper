 This study revealed the cytotoxicity genotoxicity and toxicity mechanism of uranium in plants . The cytotoxic effect of U was evaluated by detecting the survival status of root border cells the genotoxic effect was evaluated by micronuclear experiments and the toxicity mechanism of U to plants was primarily revealed by combining with transcriptome . Results showed that after U exposure the proportion of late apoptotic cells and dead cells was significantly higher than the control indicating that U could induce the apoptosis or necrosis of root border cells . The micronucleus rate increased dramatically after U exposure reaching a maximum of 4.89 times the control whereas the mitotic index decreased significantly reaching a minimum of 26.00 of the control . Moreover the activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase decreased triggering severe oxidative stress . Combined with the transcriptome data this study showed that U interfered with the expression of genes related to antioxidant enzymes the cell cycle and the DNA repair system . In conclusion U strongly terminated the root border cells and blocked the mitosis therefore inhibiting the growth of the
