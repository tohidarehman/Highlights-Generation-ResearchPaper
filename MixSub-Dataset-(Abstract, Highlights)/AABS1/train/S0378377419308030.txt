 The increasing pressure on water resources in Nebraska US and other agricultural areas requires the implementation of innovative tools and solutions for the governance of water resources and the analysis of water use efficiency . In this vein this paper presents the application of a remote sensing based soil water balance for the study of water use in agricultural areas . The specific objectives were the identification of the temporal and spatial behavior of the irrigation water use based on the quantification of the water use deviation as the main indicator and the comparative analysis of the irrigation productivity WP

@highlight Remote sensing to model irrigation for long term in thousands of corn fields for center pivot and furrow systems.
@highlight Furrow system had the highest average applications depth difference and variability reaching 115mm of difference.
@highlight Large variability shows potential for saving water and energy if furrow irrigation was converted to center pivot system.
@highlight WP and WPi for center pivot was greater than furrow system due to better system water use efficiencym and 3.06kg.
