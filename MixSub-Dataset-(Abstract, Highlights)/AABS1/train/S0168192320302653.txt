 Coastal shoreline forests are vulnerable to seawater exposure the impacts of which will increase due to sea level rise but the long term adaptation strategies and vulnerability of coastal forests are not well understood . We used whole tree transpiration leaf water potential tree ring width and tree ring

@highlight Whole tree transpiration radial growth and
@highlight C were measured in a coastal forest.
@highlight Shoreline trees had higher transpiration rates than the nearby upland trees.
@highlight Shoreline trees had similar growth and gas exchange compared to the upland trees.
@highlight Trees adapted to shoreline conditions by maintaining homeostasis in water relations and growth.
