 The dramatic rise in the global occurrence of obesity and associated diseases calls for new strategies to promote weight loss . However while the beneficial effects of weight loss are well known rapid loss of fat mass can also lead to the endogenous release of liposoluble molecules with potential harmful effects such as persistent organic pollutants . The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a polyphenol rich cranberry extract on POP release and their potential deleterious effects during weight loss of obese mice . C57BL 6J mice were fed an obesogenic diet with or without a mixture of POP for 12 weeks and then changed to a low fat diet to induce weight loss and endogenous POP release . The POP exposed mice were then separated in two groups during weight loss receiving either CE or the vehicle . Unexpectedly despite the higher fat loss in the CE treated group the circulating levels of POP were not enhanced in these mice . Moreover glucose homeostasis was further improved during CE induced weight loss as revealed by lower fasting glycemia and improved glucose tolerance as compared to vehicle treated mice . Interestingly the CE extract also induced changes in the gut microbiota after weight loss in POP exposed mice including blooming of

@highlight Persistent organic pollutants POP did not potentiate the effects of HFD on metabolic health and obesity.
@highlight A polyphenol rich cranberry extract ameliorated metabolic health during weight loss in a POP contaminated context.
@highlight Increased loss of adipose tissue upon supplementation with cranberry polyphenols did not increase circulating POP levels.
@highlight Gut microbiota could play a key role in body detoxication of POP.
