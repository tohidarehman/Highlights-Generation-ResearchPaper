 Accurate quantification of crop water use or evapotranspiration is crucial in agriculture for improved irrigation scheduling and water resource planning across a wide range of farming conditions . The aim of this study was to quantify ET dynamics for irrigated sweet potato

@highlight Daily sweet potato water use was highly affected by changes in canopy cover and weather conditions.
@highlight Time average crop coefficients were derived for each growing period.
@highlight A heat unit based thermal time crop coefficient equation was successfully developed and tested.
