 Legal frameworks lay down requirements for risk assessment of combined exposure to multiple chemicals and their implementation where scientific methods are accepted by responsible authorities . In order to protect human health an assessment of potential risks that might result from co exposure to multiple chemical substances is requested by European legislation . Several approaches for risk assessment of mixtures of chemicals have been proposed but none has been widely implemented in regulatory risk assessments so far . EuroMix an EU Horizon 2020 funded project contributed to the improvement of internationally harmonised approaches for risk assessment of chemical mixtures . Based on
