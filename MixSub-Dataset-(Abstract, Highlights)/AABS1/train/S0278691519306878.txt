 The mechanisms of prenatal cadmium exposure cause adverse effect transmission to future generations that remain unclear . In this study pregnant SD rats were orally dosed with Cd from gestation day 1 until birth . F1 female rats were mated with untreated males for F2 generation . In both generations after prenatal Cd exposure histopathological examinations showed testicular development disorder . A significant decrease in serum testosterone was observed in the F1 rats but a significant increase in serum T was observed in the F2 rats . Moreover both the F1 and F2 rats had different patterns of mRNA and protein expression for testicular steroidogenic factor 1 and steroidogenic enzymes at postnatal days 21 and 56 . We also found that rno miR 328a 5 and rno miR 10b 5p significantly changed and TargetScan software showed that both of these microRNAs targeted SF 1 and steroidogenic acute regulatory respectively . Overall the results indicate that prenatal Cd exposure causes male reproductive problems in a multigenerational manner . In addition SF 1 signaling was disrupted and the expressions of microRNAs were affected which may be an important target for Cd induced reproductive toxicity in offspring .
