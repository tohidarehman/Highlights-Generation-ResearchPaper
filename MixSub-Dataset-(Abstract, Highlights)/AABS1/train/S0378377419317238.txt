 Seed priming is known to often alleviate salinity stress during seed emergence and subsequent crop growth . This study compares the effects of salinity stress on the germination and emergence of wheat

@highlight Many studies reported positive effects of priming on wheat seed germination and seedling establishment in saline environments.
@highlight Of five different seed priming agents investigated potassium silicate K

@highlight Traditional salinity response functions closely described the response of wheat germination and seedling growth to increasing salinity stress.
