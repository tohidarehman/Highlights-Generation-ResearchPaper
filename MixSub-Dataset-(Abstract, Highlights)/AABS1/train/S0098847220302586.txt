 Low temperature is a common environmental stress factor . Polyploidy has often been considered to confer adaptation to cold stress in plants . However the mechanisms by which abscisic acid regulates non structural carbon in polyploids yielding an advantage in various ecological contexts are largely unknown . Here we have compared transcriptomic data from two

@highlight Tetraploid
@highlight has relatively high ABA content.
@highlight Up regulated ABA related genes anti oxidation genes and transcription factors appear to support cold tolerance in tetraploid
