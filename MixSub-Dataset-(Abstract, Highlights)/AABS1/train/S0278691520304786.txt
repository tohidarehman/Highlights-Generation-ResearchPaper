 In recent decades the occurrence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been increased remarkably in the population . Cigarette smoke plays one of the key roles for COPD development . In our study we explored the ameliorative role of melatonin on COPD progression by using a Cs inhaled

@highlight Chronic exposure of Cs caused the development of COPD in mice.
@highlight Cs caused ER stress and mitochondrial damage induced NLRP3 inflammasome formation.
@highlight Melatonin helped to restore Cs induced altered pulmonary pathophysiology.
@highlight Melatonin caused TRX 1 and mitophagy upregulation to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome.
