 The landscape patch amount and configuration at the class level profoundly affect stream nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in agricultural catchments but their relationships and contributions to stream NP levels remain unclear . Here we observed the stream water NP concentrations stream flow and landscape pattern at the class level in 11 catchments in a Chinese subtropical agricultural catchment during 20112017 to quantify their relationships and contributions . Pearson correlation analysis suggested that landscape patch amount and configuration at the class level significantly affected stream water NP levels and stepwise multiple linear regression models showed that the landscape pattern of a single land use could effectively predict the NP levels . The determination coefficients R

@highlight Landscape patterns at the class level determine stream water NP levels.
@highlight Small scale land uses of ponds and tea fields determine stream NP levels.
@highlight The PLAND and FRAC of ponds critically affect stream water N levels.
@highlight The FRAC of tea fields critically affects stream water P levels.
