 Fibrogenesis is a common feature for all types of chronic kidney disease . Epithelial to mesenchymal transition of renal tubular epithelial cells is one of the main processes involving renal fibrosis and its inhibition is considered as a preventive therapeutic strategy for CKD . Trigonelline a plant alkaloid commonly found in herbs coffee bean soy bean and other edible food plants has several beneficial effects on human health and has been proposed to reduce renal fibrosis but with unclear mechanisms . This study thus addressed cellular mechanism underlying the anti fibrogenic effects of TRIG in renal tubular epithelial cells grown

@highlight EMT was successfully induced in renal tubular epithelial cells by oxalate treatment.
@highlight From various doses 1M1mM analyzed 100M was the optimal dose of TRIG.
@highlight All the oxalate induced EMT features could be attenuated by TRIG pretreatment.
@highlight Oxalate also induced cell migration and ROS overproduction and reduced Nrf 2 level.
@highlight TRIG prevented oxalate induced changes in cell migration and ROS and Nrf 2 levels.
