 Solar UV B radiation enhances constitutive and inducible plant defenses against herbivore insects . Although inducible defenses in leaves damaged by lepidotperan larvae and other chewing insects are well known almost nothing is noted for the response of reproductive organs in response to stink bug attack . Here we measured the induction of phytohormones and flavonoids in undamaged and damaged pods by stink bug

@highlight Solar UV B increases defenses against stink bugs in pods of field grown soybean.
@highlight Phenolic compounds of seeds are not modulated by solar UV B radiation.
@highlight Herbivory induced isoflavonoids in soybean pods and seeds.
@highlight ET by itself is enough to increase the levels of defensive isoflavonoids in pods of field grown soybean.
