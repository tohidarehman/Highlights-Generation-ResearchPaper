 Biological pest control depends on the ability of natural enemies to find herbivore infested plants which is often guided by herbivore induced plant volatiles . While foraging behavior of natural enemies has been extensively studied under controlled conditions little is known on how odor guided foraging behavior is influenced by fluctuating weather conditions in the field .

@highlight Weather conditions influenced parasitoid foraging behavior in the field.
@highlight Humidity wind speed temperature and barometric pressure affected foraging success.
@highlight Odor guided upwind flight was only observed at wind speeds below 3 m s.
@highlight Responsiveness of parasitoids to HIPVs tended to be reduced at low humidity.
@highlight High wind speed and low humidity constrain pest control potential of parasitoids.
