 The plant specific tau class of glutathione S transferase has high stress inducing expression characteristics that can play an important protective role in plant tolerance to different environmental stresses . To explore the mechanisms underlying submergence and reoxygenation tolerance in soybean plants the transcriptomic analysis of leaves under submergence was firstly performed using the highly submergence tolerant

@highlight Two potential submergence responsive
@highlight genes 
@highlight and
@highlight  were identified from the highly submergence tolerant
@highlight  P18B .
@highlight Two transgenic methods were adopted to compare the responses of overexpressed plants to submergence and desubmergence.
@highlight or
@highlight  overexpressed soybean or Arabidopsis plants conferred alleviated submergence and reoxygenation stress.
