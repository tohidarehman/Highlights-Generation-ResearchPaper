 Urban trees provide benefits and services like improving environmental quality and mitigating impacts of climate change on human health e.g . through the reduction of greenhouse gases effects the removal of pollutants from the atmosphere and the improvement of water quality through interception of pollution . Tree transpiration in a multi species urban garden in southern Italy was investigated for one year on hourly daily seasonal and annual time scale . Water status of trees was determined by means of the Crop Water Stress Index . The difference between canopy and air temperature was calculated using transpiration measurements and the canopy energy balance . Transpiration was measured by heat dissipation method in more than 14 tree species grouped in four classes

@highlight Transpiration was measured by sap flow heat dissipation method in 14 tree species.
@highlight The trees were grouped in classes 
@highlight  Conifers Broadleaves.
@highlight and
@highlight had a good adaptation to Mediterranean climate.
@highlight Conifers showed the maximum efficacy in lowering air temperature.
@highlight The uncertainties were evaluated by error analysis.
