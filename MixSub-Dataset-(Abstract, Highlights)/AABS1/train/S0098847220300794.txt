 Most types of stress influence crop plants at intervals . Unlike other stresses salt and alkali stresses influence crop plants for their entire life cycle . However little is known about physiological and molecular response of crop plants to long term salinity or long term alkali stress condition . In the present study we subjected hexaploid wheat seeds to LAS treatment NaHCO

@highlight The understanding of adaptive mechanisms of crop plants to long term alkali stress is valuable.
@highlight The suppression of the IAA JA and SA signaling pathways may shift energy from general metabolism to stress response.
@highlight Expression dosage effects of homeologs of alkali tolerance triads may contribute to alkali tolerance of hexaploid wheat.
