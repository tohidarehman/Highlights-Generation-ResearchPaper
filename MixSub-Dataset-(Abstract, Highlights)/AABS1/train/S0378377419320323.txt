 Reclaiming saline soils at the edge of Yinchuan Plain is of paramount importance for ecological conservation . Therefore efficiency of drip irrigation method was evaluated in a field experiment . The experiment using drip irrigation as reclamation method was carried out that included five soil matric potentials controlled at 5 10 15 20 and 25 kPa directly under drip emitters at 20 cm depth . Measures including vegetation collocation high raised ridge and three stage drip irrigation scheduling were adopted . Results showed that SMP thresholds significantly affected the spatial distributions of both electrical conductivity and sodium adsorption ratio based on extracts of saturated paste . The low salinity and SARe zones either kept enlarging or remained stable when SMP thresholds were above 20 kPa . However for treatment S5 these gradually shrank with time . By the end of the second year the average ECe values in treatments S1S5 were 2.05 2.59 3.36 3.05 and 3.9 dS m

@highlight Salt dynamics were studied comprehensively under drip irrigation.
@highlight A key soil matric potential value was confirmed for drip irrigation scheduling.
@highlight An efficient method was proposed for revegetation in saline alkali area.
