 The intensification of agricultural practices contributes to the decline of many taxa such as insects and weeds . Wildflower species have an important environmental impact on rural biodiversity since plant pollinator networks play a key role in both landscape aesthetics and environmental functionality . Due to their scarcity and or disappearance in conventional agroecosystems wildflowers are now being used in strips to restore the agro environment .

@highlight Mutualistic interactions in pollination networks depend on the conservation of both pollinator and wildflower communities.
@highlight The botanical complexity of wildflower strips leads to a prolonged food availability for pollinators.
@highlight Some wildflower species were visited by a wide range of pollinators while others were more selective.
@highlight The predominance of a chemical class of volatile implies the attraction for specific pollinators.
@highlight The choice of species in wildflower strips leads to differences in performance diversified flowering periods and or diversified attractiveness to pollinator species.
