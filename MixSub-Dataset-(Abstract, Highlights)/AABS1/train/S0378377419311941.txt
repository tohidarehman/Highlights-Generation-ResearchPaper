 An experiment was carried out in a semi arid area of Spain with the objective of quantifying the transpiration of grapevine cv . Tempranillo . Measurements of transpiration were taken in a weighing lysimeter over five years the soil surface was covered with a waterproof canvas to avoid the evaporative component of evapotranspiration . The sample frequency was 1s and a mean value was recorded with a datalogger every 15min which allowed for measuring the transpiration every quarter of an hour and therefore identify night time E

@highlight Nocturnal transpiration was measured with a weighing lysimeter in a grapevine at level of plant.
@highlight The highest values of night transpiration corresponded with days in which the daylight transpiration and the soil humidity was very low.
@highlight The night transpiration in the period after sunset was more than in predawn although in this last period it was higher close to sunrise.
@highlight Nocturnal transpiration was analysed throughout the growing season and from veraison to harvest was the period with the highest values.
