 Ground dwelling predators provide regulation services of several insect pests . Enhancing these services may be a step toward integrated crop protection . Many studies have shown that soil tillage is deleterious to ground dwelling predators but pest regulation processes and services have rarely been measured . We performed an experiment to study whether simplifying soil tillage before the establishment of spring broccoli enhanced ground dwelling predator populations and the control they provide on

@highlight We investigated whether plowing and harrowing modify pest natural regulation.
@highlight Emerging rates of carabids and spiders were not modified by soil tillage.
@highlight Plowing and or harrowing did not affect
@highlight natural regulation.
@highlight Shallow tillage lowered the late emergence of carabids overwintering as larvae.
@highlight Soil tillage in the spring may affect pest natural regulation on autumn crops.
