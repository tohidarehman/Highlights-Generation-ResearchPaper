 Canola is a water stress tolerant crop which could be an alternative in areas with limited water resources . However in arid and semi arid environments where rainfall events are scarce and increasingly erratic the use of irrigation is necessary for canola production to reach its maximum yield . The goal of this study was to determine the crop evapotranspiration ET

@highlight Seasonal canola ET
@highlight measured in the lysimeter was 472 mm in 2008 and 602 mm in 2012.
@highlight Average K
@highlight values from lysimeter observations were K
@highlight  1.20 and K
@highlight  0.35.
@highlight For the two seasons average observed K
@highlight values were K
@highlight  1.16 and K
@highlight  0.20.
@highlight and K
@highlight adjusted to standard climate were 1.15 and 1.11 respectively.
@highlight Good agreement was found between K
@highlight and f
@highlight  and vegetation indices.
