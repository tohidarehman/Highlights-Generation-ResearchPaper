 Root trait dynamics can reflect the adjustment in the strategy of plant roots in resource acquisition and energy storage when responding to climatic fluctuations . Under global change the responses of root traits in climate sensitive ecosystems e.g . high elevation and cold Alpine ecosystems remain unclear . To identify how climatic fluctuations drive the variations in the root traits in a Tibetan alpine grassland we intensively investigated the temporal dynamic of root traits by biweekly measuring root length root biomass and specific root length for three continuous years . The SRL showed strong seasonal patterns across three years which did not support SRL considered as a constant in previous root system modeling while as hypothesized mean SRL in non growing seasons was significantly higher than that in growing seasons by 17 . The accumulative air temperature of growing or non growing season exerted synchronic effects on the changes in root traits . Nevertheless precipitation was observed to have the lag effects on root traits showing that January April accumulative precipitation was a major driver for the variations in the root length and root biomass respectively peaking in July and June each year . Distinguishingly root length relied on the lag effect of precipitation however for root biomass the continuous accumulative precipitation together with peak month i.e . the January June accumulative precipitation was also significantly vital . Our results would have an important implication for predicting responses of belowground carbon cycling to global climate change .
