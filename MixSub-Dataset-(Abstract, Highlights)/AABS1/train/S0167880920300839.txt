 In an effort to address the challenges of low crop productivity and food insecurity among Africas smallholder farmers Conservation Agriculture is considered a promising strategy . This study synthesized and analyzed the maize yield merits of CA systems relative to conventional farmer practices and the contribution of agro ecological zones seasonal rainfall regimes and soil characteristics in five Eastern and Southern African countries namely Ethiopia Kenya Malawi Mozambique and Tanzania over a seven year period . Agronomic data generated from 287 smallholder on farm trials testing the productivity of CA cropping systems with a total of 4976 observations were compiled and collated . Across the five countries the factors country cropping system rainfall regime agro ecological zones and soil texture accounted for 51 20 16 10 and 3 of the yield variation respectively . Furthermore CA reduced yield variability by 11 . Across all the ESA environments and relative to conventional tillage with a mean of 2401 kg ha

@highlight Across 5 countries in ESA CA systems reduced maize yield variability by 11 .
@highlight CA involving maize legume rotations produced the highest maize yield increases 35 .
@highlight Highest yield returns 95 to CA investments were realized under low rainfall 700 mm .
@highlight CA effects were most positive on well drained 16 and depressed on poorly drained soils 33 .
@highlight Prime CA conditions include rotations low rainfall loam and well drained soils.
