 Fluoroquinolone antibiotics a new class of pollutants that seriously threaten human health through environmental and food residues have aroused wide public concern . However little attention has been paid to the potential toxicity of FQs metal complex . Here we firstly explore the proof of concept study of FQs metal complex to bind bovine serum albumin using systematical spectroscopic approaches . In detail we have found that the complex of Al
