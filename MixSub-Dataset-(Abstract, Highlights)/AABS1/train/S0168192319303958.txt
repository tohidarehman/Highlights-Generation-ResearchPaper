 Precipitation extremes have a strong influence on the exchange of energy and water between the land surface and the atmosphere . Although the Horn of Africa has faced recurrent drought and flood events in recent decades it is still unclear how these events impact energy exchange and surface temperature across different ecosystems . Here we analyzed the impact of precipitation extremes on spectral albedo broadband albedos energy balance and surface temperature in four natural vegetation types forest savanna grassland and shrubland . We used remotely sensed observations of surface biophysical properties and climate from 2001 to 2016 . Our results showed that in forests and savannas precipitation extremes led to divergent spectral changes in visible and NIR albedos which cancelled each other limiting shortwave albedo changes . An exception to this pattern was observed in shrublands and grasslands where both visible and NIR albedo increased during drought events . Given that shrublands and grasslands occupy a large fraction of the Horn of Africa our results unveil the importance of these ecosystems in driving the magnitude of shortwave radiative forcing in the region . The average regional shortwave radiative forcing during drought events 0.64Wm

@highlight Visible spectral albedo change dominated during precipitation extremes.
@highlight Both visible and near infrared albedo increased during drought in shrubland.
@highlight Impact of albedo change on surfaceatmosphere coupling was minor.
@highlight Surface feedback from turbulent energy exchange affected surface temperature.
@highlight Forests were the least and grassland the most sensitive to precipitation extremes.
