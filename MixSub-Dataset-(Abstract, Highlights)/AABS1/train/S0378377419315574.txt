 Irrigation systems have in recent years attained a higher level of variety in as such that the selection and implementation of an irrigation system is based on the physical constraints of the site area thus giving way to a much more adequate irrigation efficiency . With due regards to the water crisis in Iran and subsequent drought conditions the implementing of similar irrigation systems in different regional conditions lacks any justification . In the Izeh plain the use of surface irrigation systems with minimal efficiency is very common . In order to implement and operate modern irrigation systems and maximize water saving the site selection of pressurized irrigation systems was evaluated through the fusing of AHP and GIS maps for a variety of pressurized irrigation systems followed by the selecting of the best irrigation system for each region . In the current study physical and socio economic criteria were selected as the main criterion and were then classified into several sub criterions.A Drip irrigation system a Gun irrigation system a center pivot irrigation system and a linear irrigation system were selected as the options utilized when using the AHP method . The Gun and center pivot irrigation systems had the least value as they were not suitable for mountainous area . Drip and linear irrigation systems were given a higher value and were suitable for implementation in most regions . After comparing different sub criterion the drip irrigation system was identified as being the most suitable pressurized irrigation system for the Izeh plain .

@highlight Combination of GIS and AHP to determine the best irrigation system to reach the highest water use efficiency and water saving.
@highlight Using different irrigation system alternatives including modernised and common irrigation systems.
@highlight Considering different socio economic and physical criterion including cost water climate and etc.
