 3 chloro 1 2 propanediol is a well known contaminant that was produced in the thermal processing of food . Dietary intake represents the greatest source of exposure to 3 MCPD . Autophagy is an important catabolic pathway that plays an important role in liver physiological function . Evidence suggests that 3 MCPD exposure causes toxicity in liver but the mechanism remains unknown . Here we explored the effects of 3 MCPD on autophagic flux and traced the molecular mechanism in HepG2 cells . The data showed 3 MCPD exposure promoted the accumulation of autophagosomes in HepG2 cells . Subsequently by detected te expression of LC3 and P62 and transfection of mRFP GFP LC3 adenovirus we found that the accumulation of autophagosomes was caused by inhibition of autophagic flux . After that we investigate lysosomal function and found that 3 MCPD induced lysosomal alkalinization . Further we detected the expression of TFEB which is a key nuclear transcription factor in control of lysosome biogenesis and function . We found that 3 MCPD inhibited the nuclear expression of TFEB and mRNA levels of some target genes of TFEB . In order to further verify the role of TFEB in autophagic flux blockage in HepG2 cells induced by 3 MCPD we overexpressed TFEB by transfection with adenovirus and found that both autophagy inhibition and lysosomal alkalization induced by 3 MCPD were alleviated . These results suggested that 3 MCPD could induce the autophagic flux blockage in HepG2 cells . The possible mechanism was due to the destruction of lysosomal function .

@highlight 3 MCPD inhibited autophagic flux in HepG2 cells.
@highlight 3 MCPD could not inhibit the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes.
@highlight 3 MCPD decreased pH value of lysosomal.
@highlight 3 MCPD inhibited transcription of TFEB and its target genes.
@highlight Overexpression of TFEB could restore autophagy flux blockage and lysosomal alkalinization induced by 3 MCPD.
