 A 3 yr field study was conducted in semiarid areas of the Loess Plateau to investigate the effects of different planting densities on the soil water potato growth yield and WUE during the normal year relatively dry year and relatively wet year . The five potato planting densities were 3.7510

@highlight Variability of planting densities depended on rainfall amount and its distribution.
@highlight Planting densities could improved the crop emergence and promote potato growth.
@highlight Potato yield and WUE increased firstly and decreased with planting density increased.
@highlight Greater net profit was obtained by using a planting density of 5.2510
@highlight plants ha
@highlight Potato planting density of 4.505.5810
@highlight plants ha
@highlight is recommended in Loess Plateau.
