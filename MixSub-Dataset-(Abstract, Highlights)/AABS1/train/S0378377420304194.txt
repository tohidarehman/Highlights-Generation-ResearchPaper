 Agricultural system modeling has become an effective tool for analyzing and quantifying the effects of varying management practices and environmental conditions on crop production and nutrient export from croplands . The use of such modeling tools provides useful insights in identifying the most effective management practices for enhancing productivity sustainability and resiliency of agricultural systems . This study focuses on testing and application of an integrated field scale process based model DRAINMOD DSSAT for simulating hydrology nitrate nitrogen NO

@highlight Hydrology NO
@highlight losses and crop yield was simulated using DRAINMOD DSSAT in Illinois.
@highlight Model predictions well agreed with measured drainage flow NO
@highlight losses and crop yield.
@highlight Effects of N management were evaluated under controlled and conventional drainage.
@highlight Split N application combined with controlled drainage could reduce NO
@highlight losses.
@highlight The importance of N fertilizer application rate and timing was demonstrated.
