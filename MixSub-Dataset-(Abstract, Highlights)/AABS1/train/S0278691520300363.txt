 Trans cinnamic acid is a phenylpropenoic acid which occurs naturally in a number of plants . In this study the anti obese effects of tCA were evaluated in oleic acid induced HepG2 cells and high fat diet fed mice . The results showed tCA treatment significantly decreased lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells exposed to OA

@highlight Trans cinnamic acid alleviated lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells.
@highlight Trans cinnamic acid improved blood lipid profile in high fat diet induced mice.
@highlight Trans cinnamic acid also improved hepatic steatosis and adipose hypertrophy in high fat diet induced mice.
