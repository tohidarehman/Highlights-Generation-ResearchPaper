 To deal with serious water resources crisis the Shiyang River Basin of Hexi Corridor in Northwestern China has been experiencing rehabilitation for water saving since 2006 . Water use efficiency in cropland is a critical indicator to understand the response of carbon water interactions . Because we currently lack a clear picture of how WUEc responds to climate and human activities factors in the SRB here we applied Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite images to obtain a regional estimation of gross primary productivity in cropland and actual evapotranspiration in cropland and analyzed the variations in WUEc and climate and human activities factors then we evaluated the annual WUEc responses to climate and human activity factors and discussed major driving factors underlying the interannual variability of WUEc from 2000 to 2014 in the SRB . Finally we clarified the implications of the water saving project on the water cycle . Results indicated that increased WUEc covered 97.25 of the cropland area with a trend of 0.017 g C kg

@highlight Spatial temporal dynamics of cropland ecosystem water use efficiency was evaluated based on MODIS products.
@highlight We attribute the variation in WUEc to the trend in climate change and human activities.
@highlight Increased WUEc covered 97.25 of the cropland area with a trend of 0.017g C kg
@highlight O yr
@highlight The relative contribution of human activities to ETc before and after the water saving project was 26.3 and 77.5 .
