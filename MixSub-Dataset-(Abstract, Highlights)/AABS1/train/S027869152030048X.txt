 7 3 4 Trihydroxyisoflavone is a secondary metabolite derived from daidzein and is abundantly present in soybeans . Daidzein and 7 3 4 THIF exhibit several pharmacological activities including antioxidant and anti atopic properties . However the effects of 7 3 4 THIF on cognitive function have not been fully investigated . Here we evaluated the effects of 7 3 4 THIF on memory using Y maze and passive avoidance tests . The positive control groups were given donepezil or piracetam and the treated groups were given 7 3 4 THIF . 7 3 4 THIF at 1mg kg and donepezil at 5mg kg effectively ameliorated memory impairments induced by scopolamine in mice . In addition 7 3 4 THIF at 1mg kg and piracetam at 200mg kg significantly enhanced memory in intact mice . To examine the underlying mechanisms of 7 3 4 THIF on cognition following behavioral experiments biochemical tests were performed in the whole hippocampus . 7 3 4 THIF significantly recovered scopolamine induced cholinergic impairments . Moreover brain derived neurotrophic factor postsynaptic density protein 95 and synaptophysin along with phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 2 and cAMP response element binding were significantly increased by 7 3 4 THIF . Our findings indicate that 7 3 4 THIF improves cognitive function by regulating cholinergic system and BDNF signaling .
