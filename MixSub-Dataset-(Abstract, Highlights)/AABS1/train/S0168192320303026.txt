 Understanding the interactive responses of agroecosystem water use efficiency to climatic and vegetation factors is significant for revealing how ecohydrological processes vary between the carbon and water cycles in the changing climate . Based on data from 11 eddy covariance flux sites for a total of 32 site years in four typical agroecosystems including winter wheat

@highlight LAI can explain 41 64 T ET variation .

@highlight LAI exerted stronger controls on WUE
@highlight than climatic factors by regulating T ET.
@highlight Carbon uptake regulated WUE
@highlight more while water consumption controlled WUE
