 Ensuring global food security is a worldwide major concern considering the predicted climate change scenarios for the main agricultural regions of the world . Stomatal conductance

@highlight Diffusional limitations gs and gm impose around two thirds of the total photosynthetic limitation in plants at optimum conditions.
@highlight Under stress photosynthetic limitations due to diffusional restrictions can reach 85 of the total.
@highlight Knowledge about each of the conductances differs into their focus signalling pathways regulating gs are well known but not for gm.
@highlight Knowledge about each of the conductances is also unbalanced regarding to the molecular and anatomical determinants of both conductances. this bullet should be deleted 
@highlight The possible molecular mechanisms that drive the known coupled behaviour between both conductances remain almost unexplored.
