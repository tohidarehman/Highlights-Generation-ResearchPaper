 Improved understanding of crop water use is vital for aiding water saving and sustainable production practices particularly for water restricted regions where limited observations exist . This study investigated the standard evapotranspiration and crop coefficients for drip irrigated mature orange trees

@highlight The crop coefficient values of Washington navel orange varied from 0.67 to 0.96 for the study region.
@highlight The moderately water stressed trees reduced their

@highlight and
@highlight significantly reduced when
@highlight dropped below 0.0670.077mol m
@highlight and soil moisture was below RAW.
@highlight Irrigating at 6770 of crop demand is recommended for sustainable citrus production in the study region.
