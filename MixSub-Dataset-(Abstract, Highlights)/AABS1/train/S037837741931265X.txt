 Water saving irrigation measures in arid areas affect evapotranspiration processes while conserving water . Mulched drip irrigation is considered the most efficient irrigation method because it distributes water uniformly in the soil restricts deep percolation and minimizes unproductive evaporation from soil . The effect of mulched drip irrigation on farmland ET during the growing season at a landscape scale remains unclear despite being vital for developing optimal water resource management strategies in arid areas . To compare the effects of mulched drip irrigation and mulched border irrigation on ET based on Landsat satellite imagery an improved Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land model was used to evaluate ET for the two periods of an oasis at Sangong River Basin in the arid region of Northwest China . The results show that daily ET rates from farmland managed under mulched drip irrigation were on average 0.21mm.d

@highlight Mulched drip irrigation increased farmland ET during crop growing season.
@highlight Less water stress under mulched drip irrigation enhanced crop growth.
@highlight Better developed crop canopy captured more radiation and resulted in a higher ET.
