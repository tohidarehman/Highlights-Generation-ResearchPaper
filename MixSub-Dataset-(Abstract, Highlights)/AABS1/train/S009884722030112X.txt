 Drought is a major limiting factor affecting crop productivity . To gain a comprehensive understanding of transcriptomic reprogramming under drought stress in maize

@highlight LY66 exhibits greater drought tolerance than LY99.
@highlight Coordinated regulation of C and N assimilation confers drought tolerance in maize.
@highlight Coordinated C and N assimilation under drought stress is possibly involved in phytohormone signaling pathways
