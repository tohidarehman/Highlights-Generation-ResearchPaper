 In 2015 the Expert Panel of the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association initiated a program for the re evaluation of the safety of over 250 natural flavor complexes used as flavor ingredients . This publication third in the series considers NFCs composed primarily of constituents with the 3 phenyl 2 propenyl or a cinnamyl functional group using the procedure outlined in 2005 and updated in 2018 to evaluate the safety of naturally occurring mixtures for their intended use as flavor ingredients . The procedure relies on a complete chemical characterization of the NFC intended for commerce and organization of each NFC s chemical constituents into well defined congeneric groups . The safety of the NFC is evaluated using the well established and conservative threshold of toxicological concern concept in addition to data on absorption metabolism and toxicology of members of the congeneric groups and the NFC under evaluation .
