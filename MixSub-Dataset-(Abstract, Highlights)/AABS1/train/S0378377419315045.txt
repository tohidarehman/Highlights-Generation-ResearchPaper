 In order to explore the application value of the stable carbon isotope discrimination method in improving water use efficiency and productivity of kiwifruit under deficit drip irrigation five water deficit levels with thirteen treatments were established at three growth stages in field grown kiwifruit . The leaf stable carbon isotope discrimination

@highlight Low water deficit treatment at fruit maturation stage increased kiwifruit yield and WUE
@highlight by 14.75 and 23.74 respectively.
@highlight None
@highlight showed a high response to ET over the whole growth period.
@highlight None
@highlight can be used as a useful evaluation index of WUE
@highlight  and
@highlight is an important indicator of quantifying Y and ET of kiwifruit under deficit drip irrigation.
