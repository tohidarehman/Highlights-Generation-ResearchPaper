 Coronavirus has rapidly spread across many countries in pandemic proportions since the first case was reported in Hubei China in December 2019 . Understanding transmission susceptibility and exposure risks is crucial for surveillance control and response to the disease . Knowing the geographic distribution of health resource scarcity areas is necessary if a country is to adequately anticipate and prepare for the full impact of infections . We explored the potential to undertake a spatial risk assessment of an emerging pandemic under data scarcity in Eswatini . We used a set of socio economic and demographic variables to identify epidemic risk prone areas in the country . Three risk zone levels for COVID 19 were identified in the country . The analysis showed that about 29 of the population were located in the high risk zone and these were people who could potentially be infected with COVID 19 in the absence of mitigation measures . A majority of cases and deaths attributed to COVID 19 would likely remain unknown but our estimate could be used to gauge the full burden of the disease . Approximating and quantifying the number of people who may be potentially infected with COVID 19 remains impossible under data scarcity and limited healthcare capacity especially in sub Saharan Africa . We provided an estimation method that could support the pandemic risk forecasting preparedness and response measures in the midst of data scarcity . The resultant map products could be used to guide on the ground surveillance and response efforts .

@highlight About 321 000 people are located in the COVID 19 high risk zone in Eswatini.
@highlight A majority of COVID 19 cases and deaths are likely to remain unknown due to poor testing in Eswatini.
@highlight Minimizing movement from high risk zones to low risk areas could help control the spread of COVID 19.
