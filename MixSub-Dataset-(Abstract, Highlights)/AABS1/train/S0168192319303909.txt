 The seasonal dynamic of gross primary productivity has influences on the annual GPP of the terrestrial ecosystem . However the spatiotemporal variation of the seasonal dynamic of GPP and its effects on spatial and temporal variations of AGPP are still poorly addressed . In this study we developed a parameter

@highlight None
@highlight  integrated index of GPP seasonality was ratio of mean to maximum daily GPP.
@highlight None
@highlight in Northern Hemisphere ranged from 0.47 to 0.85 with an average of 0.62.
@highlight None
@highlight decreased as latitude increased and was stable between years.
@highlight Spatial pattern of astronomical radiation seasonality affected that of
@highlight Spatiotemporal variation of
@highlight provided a new approach to assess annual GPP.
