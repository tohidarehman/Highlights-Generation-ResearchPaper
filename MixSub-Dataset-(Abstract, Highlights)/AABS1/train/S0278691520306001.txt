 The present study aims to examine the effect of early lactational perfluorooctane sulfonate exposures on learning and memory in male mice and reveal the underlying mechanisms involved . PFOS solution was orally administered to dams from the postpartum days 114 so that pups would be exposed through breast milk . At 810 weeks of age we performed object location test object recognition test and pairwise visual discrimination task . We also performed

@highlight Lactational PFOS exposure has profound long lasting effect on learning and memory in adult male mice.
@highlight Male adults exposed to PFOS during lactational period have significantly higher GABA and Glu concentrations in the dorsal hippocampus.
@highlight PFOS may indirectly alter the funtion of the hippocampus by affecting the parahippocampal region.
