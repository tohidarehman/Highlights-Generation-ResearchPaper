 Reuse of treated wastewater effluent for crop irrigation can be a promising strategy to substitute reduce chemical fertilizers and mitigate contamination of water environment . The effect of the effluent irrigation strategies on crop yield and nitrogen loss to the environment have not been yet well explored . In the present study a soil column monitoring experiment was conducted for over two years to assess the effect of domestic sewage tail water irrigation on rice growth and N loss . DSTW irrigation was established substituting N fertilizer at percentages of 15 30 and 45 with a total nitrogen input of 210 kghm

@highlight Domestic sewage tail water DSTW irrigation on rice growth and N loss was explored.
@highlight DSTW irrigation with 15 45 N substitution ratio had little effect on grain yield.
@highlight DSTW irrigation can minimize NH
@highlight emissions compared to chemical fertilization.
@highlight The optimum N substitution ratio for DSTW irrigation was 30 45 .
