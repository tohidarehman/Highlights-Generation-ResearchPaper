 Furrow irrigation in cotton growing vertosols is the most preferred method in Australia . After fertilisation irrigation water interacts with the soil which can dissolve nitrogen compounds into the run off water . The run off or tail water that leaves the field is enriched with N and can reduce crop N use efficiency . During 20142015 and 20152016N solute concentration in the irrigation water and run off was measured in a tillage cropping rotation experiment . In the continuous cotton treatments when urea was broadcast on the surface of furrow irrigated cotton system 11 of the applied fertiliser 260kg N ha

@highlight Urea and DON were important components in the irrigation and tail waters.
@highlight Only 5 of the applied fertiliser was lost with sub surface urea 10cm banding.
@highlight Across all cotton treatments the losses and composition were similar.
