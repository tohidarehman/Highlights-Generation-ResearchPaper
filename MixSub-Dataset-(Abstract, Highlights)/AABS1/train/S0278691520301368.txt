 Polyphenols are secondary metabolites widely distributed in many plant foods such a tea coffee chocolate and fruits . The consumption of these compounds is related to the improvement or amelioration of many diseases including diabetes . Nevertheless the great barrier to the therapeutic use of polyphenols is the low bioavailability of these compounds once ingested . For that reason the encapsulation of polyphenols in different matrices may protect them from digestion and improve their release and subsequent absorption to obtain target specific health effects . Some studies have reported the beneficial effect of encapsulation to increase both bioavailability and bioaccessibility . However these works have mostly been carried out

@highlight Polyphenols are a potential tool to ameliorate diabetic disorders.
@highlight Polyphenols have low bioavailability in humans limiting their therapeutic effects.
@highlight Nanoencapsulation increases bioaccessibility and in turn the effects of polyphenols.
@highlight Clinical trials are necessary to increase the knowledge about nanoencapsulation.
