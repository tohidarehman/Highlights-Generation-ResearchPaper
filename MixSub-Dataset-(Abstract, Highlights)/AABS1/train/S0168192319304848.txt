 Wind machines are used in the agricultural sector to prevent or mitigate the adverse effects of night frost in spring . In this study we aim to quantify the impact of wind machine operation on the local temperature field in an orchard . To this end a field experiment is conducted and experimental analysis is combined with numerical simulation studies in order to assess the functional relations between wind machine performance and the dominating physical processes occurring during radiative frost events .

@highlight Wind machines are effective in mitigating fruit frost in spring.
@highlight Temperature increase 50 of inversion strength over 35ha.
@highlight Numerical simulations agree with field experiment distributed temperature sensing.
@highlight Slow axis rotation of wind machine increases efficiency.
@highlight Strong upwind downwind asymmetry in affected area due to background wind.
