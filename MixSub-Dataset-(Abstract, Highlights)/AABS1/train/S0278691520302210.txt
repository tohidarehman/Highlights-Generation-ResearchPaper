 Reactive carbonyls including methylglyoxal are considered toxic compounds in foodstuffs because they irreversibly modify proteins and produce advanced glycation end products . Therefore we studied the long term effect of increased MG intake in mature adult mice . Six month old C57BL 6N mice received MG by drinking water 2.5mg ml

@highlight Methylglyoxal is a reactive carbonyl compound in foodstuffs.
@highlight Renal function efficiently detoxifies dietary methylglyoxal without signs of dysfunction.
@highlight Mice with methylglyoxal intake had fewer age related tumours and longer survival.
@highlight The mouse
@highlight genotype influences the beneficial effects of methylglyoxal.
