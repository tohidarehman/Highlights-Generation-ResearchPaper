 Seed germination is a key phase of the plant life cycle and the plant is highly sensitive to low temperature during this phase . However the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation of rice seeds to low temperatures remain elusive . The present study compared seed germination between Dongdao 4 and Jigeng 88 and investigated the mechanisms of their response to low temperature conditions . Seed germination percentage of Dongdao 4 was significantly higher than that of Jigeng 88 when exposed to low temperature . Furthermore Dongdao 4 seeds exhibited higher concentrations of bioactive gibberellins GA

@highlight Compared to Jigeng 88 seeds Dongdao 4 seeds exhibited higher germination percentage under low temperature conditions. Dongdao 4 seeds accumulated more endogenous bioactive GA and soluble sugars than Jigeng 88 seeds under low temperature conditions. ABA concentration was lower in Dongdao 4 seeds than in Jigeng 88 seeds under low temperature conditions.
