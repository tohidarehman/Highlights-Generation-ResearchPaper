 This study describes the evolution of the Spanish irrigated sector and focuses on water abstraction water consumption and energy use in the period 19502017 . The analysis shows evidence of the basins reaching closure state and the impact on energy use from irrigation supply . The response in the context of an increasing water demand with a limited supply has been investment in water saving and conservation technologies with the transformation of furrow irrigated areas into those of drip and sprinkler resulting in an increase in irrigation efficiency . The effect of this policy implies an increase in energy use by a factor of six in the period while the irrigated area triples and its water use doubles in the same period . Water abstraction reaches its peak in the year 2004 and decreases slightly as a consequence of subsidies to WSCT . The impact on energy consumption in pumping and treatment illustrates the water energy nexus in Spains agriculture and the change in the water policy paradigm from supply augmentation towards demand management .

@highlight Water conservation and non conventional resources are triggered by basin closure.
@highlight Water conservation systems increased energy consumption by irrigation since 2005.
@highlight Monitoring of water abstraction water consumption and energy use by irrigation should be implemented at basin level.
@highlight Mature water economies such as Spain may exhibit reduced water abstractions and increased energy consumption.
