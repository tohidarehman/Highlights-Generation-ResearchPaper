This publication fifth in the series evaluates the safety of NFCs containing linalool and or other characteristic mono and sesquiterpenoid tertiary alcohols and esters using the safety evaluation procedure published by the FEMA Expert Panel in 2005 and updated in 2018 . The procedure relies on a complete chemical characterization of the NFC intended for commerce and organization of the chemical constituents of each NFC into well defined congeneric groups . The safety of each NFC is evaluated using the well established and conservative threshold of toxicological concern concept in addition to data on absorption metabolism and toxicology of both the constituent congeneric groups and the NFCs . Sixteen NFCs derived from the
