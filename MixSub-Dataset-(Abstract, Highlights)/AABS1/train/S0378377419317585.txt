 Crop biomass is one of the most important parameters of a crop and knowledge of it before harvest is essential to help farmers in their decision making . Both green and dry Bio can be estimated from vegetation spectral indices because they have a close relationship with accumulated absorbed photosynthetically active radiation which is proportional to total Bio . The aims of this study were to analyze the potential capacity of spectral vegetation indices in estimating corn green biomass based on their relationship with the photosynthetic vegetation sub pixel fraction derived from spectral mixture analysis and to analyze the best interval of VI accumulation for corn grain yield estimation . Field data of center pivots cultivated with corn during the irrigation seasons of 2015 and 2018 and Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images were used . The EVI produced the best results Pearson s correlation coefficient RMSE and Willmotts index reached 0.99 6.5 and 0.948 respectively . Among the nine potential VIs analyzed the EVI SAVI and OSAVI were considered the first second and third best performing for corn green Bio estimation respectively based on their comparison to the photosynthetic vegetation sub pixel fraction and the time intervals that extended until 120 days after sowing showed the best results for corn grain yield estimation .

@highlight Vegetation indices VIs were compared with the photosynthetic vegetation fraction fPV .
@highlight The EVI enhanced vegetation index SAVI soil adjusted vegetation index and OSAVI Optimized SAVI had the best performance in their relationship with the fPV.
@highlight Operational land imager OLI and MultiSpectral Instrument MSI images were used.
@highlight Spectral mixture analysis SMA was employed using the VIPER Tools plugin.
@highlight Accumulations of VIs up to 120 days after sowing were the best for yield estimates.
