 Protecting and restoring riverine environmental quality requires a quantitative understanding between riverine nitrogen and various determinants however it is still challenging in highly naturally and anthropogenically differentiated agricultural catchments . The study observed riverine ammonium N NH

@highlight Multiple stepwise linear regression model effectively predicts riverine N levels and loadings.
@highlight Variation partitioning analysis reveals the determinants of riverine N levels and loadings.
@highlight Land use compositions decide riverine N levels and nitrate N loadings.
@highlight Socioeconomic conditions determine riverine ammonium N and total N loadings.
