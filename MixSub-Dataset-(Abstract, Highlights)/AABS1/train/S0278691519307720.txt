 With epidemic of obesity it affects aspects of female reproduction . Genistein could ameliorate obesity in people and animals but might exert adverse effects on the female reproductive system . To evaluate the effects of fetal and neonatal genistein exposure on the ovarian health of F1 obese female mice with obesity induced by high fat diet after weaning we simulated a diet induced obesity model to observe and determine biological effects of genistein exposure on the ovarian follicle of overfed female mice . Results showed that F1 female mice with obesity induced by high fat diet significantly prolonged the estrus cycle disrupted sex hormonal balance and ovarian follicle development after they were exposed to 25mg kg b.w . day of genistein during the fetal and neonatal stages . Genistein significantly up regulated the ovarian mRNA expression of estrogen receptor beta in F1 obese female mice and high fat diet influenced the ovarian mRNA expression of estrogen receptor alpha luteinizing hormone receptor and follicle stimulating hormone receptor . Hence genistein exposure from the fetal stage might increase the risk of reproductive diseases in obese females in later life . Thus the long term risks of genistein to obese females should be thoroughly assessed .
