 Integrated crop livestock systems can improve profitability production efficiencies and reduce environmental degradation . Among the many environmental metrics important for assessing the sustainability of ICL systems nitrous oxide N

@highlight O flux from ICL systems is poorly understood particularly in North America.
@highlight O flux was least under grassland and grass dominant cover crops.
@highlight Grazing did not affect N
@highlight O flux in cropland or grassland.
@highlight O flux was weakly related to volumetric water content when soil was not frozen.
