 Female breast cancer incidence rate varies greatly across counties in the United States . Factors contributing to these geographic disparities have not been fully understood at the population level . In this study we investigated the relationships between the county level FBC IR and a diverse set of variables in demographics socioeconomics life style health care accessibility and environment .
