 Drip irrigation has been gradually adopted for winter wheat production in the North China Plain due to significant saving from using irrigation water and improving water and nitrogen use efficiencies . However the optimal water and nitrogen application rates for drip irrigated wheat are still unclear . A field experiment with five nitrogen application rates 0 120 180 240 and 300 kg ha

@highlight A 2 years field experiment was conducted to study the optimal irrigation and nitrogen rates for drip irrigated winter wheat.
@highlight Combination of nitrogen rate of 240kgha
@highlight and irrigation quota of 40mm maximized wheat growth and grain yield.
@highlight High water use efficiency and acceptable nitrogen partial factor productivity also appeared in the combination.
