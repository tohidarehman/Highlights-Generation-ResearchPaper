 The brain is a highly metabolic organ and requires regulatory mechanisms to meet its high energy demand with the PI3K Akt and AMPK signalling pathways being central regulators of cellular energy and metabolism also making them major targets for the development of neurometabolic disorders . Fusaric acid a toxin of fungal origin was found to be a potent hypotensive agent

@highlight Exposure to fusaric acid depletes neuronal ATP levels at 1 and 10 days.
@highlight Metabolic Akt and AMPK signalling pathways were activated at 1 day.
@highlight Activated Akt AMPK signalling supressed the expression of glucose receptors.
@highlight At 10 days fusaric acid dampened Akt AMPK activity despite low ATP volume.
@highlight Inactivated Akt AMPK signalling resulted in increased glucose receptor expression.
