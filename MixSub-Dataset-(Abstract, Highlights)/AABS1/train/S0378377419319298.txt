 The Jarvis canopy resistance sub model is commonly used in transpiration modelling although its optimal structure is rarely studied . It is still not fully clear that to what extent transpiration modeling may differ if using different constraint function forms for key environmental variable in Jarvis sub model . In this study various Jarvis canopy resistance sub model configurations were embedded in the Penman Monteith model to compare their ability to model daily transpiration of rain fed jujube

@highlight Various constraint functions of environmental factors were used in Jarvis model.
@highlight Their ability to model daily transpiration of jujube orchard 
@highlight  was compared.
@highlight Bayesian approach rather than traditional method was used for model comparison.
@highlight Different constraint functions of soil water achieved different
@highlight model performance.
@highlight Including soil water in Jarvis model was not always improved
@highlight model performance.
