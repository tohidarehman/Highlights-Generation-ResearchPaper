 To meet the high demand for organic produce farmers must select crop cultivars that perform well under the low input conditions of organic production systems . Most cultivars grown on organic farms are genotypes selected through conventional breeding programs which may impact responsiveness to microbial symbionts . The use of biological inputs such as mycorrhizal inoculants offers the promise of improving yield quality and stress responsiveness of crops but evidence of efficacy in the field remains elusive . Moreover interspecific and intraspecific variability may impact the ability of mycorrhizal inoculants to provide benefits . This work evaluated four cultivars of carrots and their propensities to benefit from inoculation with isolates of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in organic field conditions with and without late season water restriction . Inoculants included geographically distinct isolates from four species

@highlight Genotypes of carrot differed in response to mycorrhizal inoculation.
@highlight Heirloom varieties of carrot responded more positively than hybrid cultivars.
@highlight Isolates of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi differed in contributions to plant growth.
