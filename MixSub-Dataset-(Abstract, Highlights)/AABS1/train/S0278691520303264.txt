 Ochratoxin A is a ubiquitous food contaminant and a critical food safety concern due to its nephron toxic effects which impacts all parts of the world . Luteolin had gained increasing interest as a health promoting food antioxidant component . However the preventative effect of LUT against OTA induced oxidative stress was not yet clear and the elucidation of which would provide critical information to develop dietary LUT as a control strategy for OTA . In the current study the cytoprotective effect of LUT against OTA induced oxidative stress and the mechanism behind was examined in NRK 52E rat kidney cells . The results showed that LUT exerted its preventative effect via restoring cell viability and preventing LDH release . It alleviated the OTA induced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation by reducing ROS accumulation ameliorating the mitochondrial membrane potential reduction and reversing the activities of antioxidant enzymes to the control levels . The regulating roles of Nrf2 and HIF 1 in this process were evaluated by cell immunofluorescence assay reporter plasmids transfection assay and qRT PCR analysis . The results showed that LUT activated Nrf2 pathway and increased the antioxidant defense capacities of OTA treated cells . Additionally LUT also modulated HIF 1 pathway to initiate the angiogenesis and epithelial restitution process .

@highlight Ochratoxin A elicited the two ROS peaks at 1h and 24h respectively.
@highlight Luteolin reduced the ROS accumulation induced by OTA at any given time.
@highlight Ochratoxin A induced opposite trend for target genes mRNA levels for different time durations.
@highlight Luteolin reversed the Nrf2 nuclear translocation inhibition induced by ochratoxin A.
@highlight Luteolin diminished the HIF 1 and VEGF transcription inhibition induced by ochratoxin A after 3h.
