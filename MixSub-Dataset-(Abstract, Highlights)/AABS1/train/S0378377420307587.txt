 High resolution measurements of trunk diameter fluctuations provide a means to study short term and long term stem radial variations and response to water stress of fruit trees . There is a lack of information however on the performance of TDF measurements on fast growing poplar trees . To both clarify the intra annual and inter annual growth patterns and to diagnose water status of young poplar trees we monitored TDF leaf area index soil matric potential midday stem water potential

@highlight The seasonal growth pattern of young
@highlight tree was identified.
@highlight Stage II mid April to mid June is the crucial stage for irrigation management.
@highlight Maximum growth rate occurred earlier in the well watered trees.
@highlight The trunk growth rate is an effective indicator for assessing tree water status.
