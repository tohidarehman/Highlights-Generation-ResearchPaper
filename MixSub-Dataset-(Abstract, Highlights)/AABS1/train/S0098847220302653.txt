 Olive flowering phenology is highly affected by climatic conditions . Phenological models have been developed to forecast flowering date on olive mainly based on temperature . These models have used flowering datasets collected from trees growing under Mediterranean climatic conditions . In most of the cases in those conditions chilling requirements are rapidly fulfilled . In other cases artificial modifications of the climatic conditions has been practiced by using growth chambers . In the present work we compare the flowering phenology of Picual and Arbequina olive cultivars in Mediterranean conditions of Andaluca Southern Spain with those in Tenerife Canary Islands with Sub Tropical climate . The climatic conditions of Tenerife respect to Andaluca promoted an earlier flowering date but more importantly a much longer flowering period . This is mainly produced by an asynchronous flowering bud burst that will generate negative impacts on yield and quality . Quite likely those differences on flowering phenology between Andaluca and Tenerife climatic conditions are mainly caused by the lack of winter chilling in Tenerife locations . Based on those results we propose that future works studying the effect of lack of winter chilling on olive should include the length of the flowering period as a parameter to be modeled . Besides studies on natural climatic conditions with warm winters as the one here reported are needed to really assess the effect of winter chilling on olive .

@highlight Olive phenology in Subtropical climate is different from the typical Mediterranean.
@highlight The length of olive flowering phenology is greatly influenced by climatic conditions.
@highlight The main effect of lack of winter chilling is an asynchronous burst of olive flowers.
@highlight Length of flowering period should be included in future olive phenology modelling.
