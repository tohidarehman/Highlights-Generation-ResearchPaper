 Increasing temperatures due to climate change are leading to advances in grapevine phenology and sugar accumulation in grape berries . This study aims to determine if a temperature based model can predict the time to target sugar concentrations from 170 to 220g L for

@highlight A wide range of temperature based models were tested for the trait temperature requirements to sugar ripeness.
@highlight Six sugar concentrations were assessed as an objective measure of ripeness.
@highlight Two temperature based models were successfully developed for the day of the year to reach the six sugar concentrations.
@highlight 65 cultivars were characterised for different sugar targets using these models.
@highlight Cultivar confidence intervals were reported.
