 Tropical peatlands are a major but understudied biophysical feedback factor on the atmospheric greenhouse effect . The largest expanses of tropical peatlands are located in lowland areas of Southeast Asia and the Amazon basin . The Loreto Region of Amazonian Peru contains 63 000 km

@highlight Rare eddy covariance flux measurements of CO
@highlight and CH
@highlight in a palm swamp peatland in the Peruvian Amazon.
@highlight The peatland was a large CO
@highlight sink and a CH
@highlight source.
@highlight Photosynthetic activity was inhibited and respiration enhanced during warm dry conditions.
@highlight Carbon cycling in Amazonian palm swamp forests are sensitive to hydrometeorological forcings.
@highlight Longer term measurements are needed to assess their potential vulnerability to climate change.
