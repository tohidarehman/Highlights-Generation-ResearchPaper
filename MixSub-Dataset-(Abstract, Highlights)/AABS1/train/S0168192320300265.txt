 Rainfall interception is a dynamic process where raindrops exert a force on leaf surfaces causing splashing and changes in leaf inclination angles . Leaf biomechanical properties determine the resistance to changes in leaf inclination angle due to raindrop impacts . The hydrophobicity of leaf surfaces may influence water movement off the leaf . A laboratory experiment incorporating a raindrop generator and high speed video camera was used to examine the relationships between raindrop impact leaf biomechanics and water droplet retention of three tree species

@highlight Leaf inclination angle change after drop impact explains water movement off a leaf.
@highlight Leaf inclination angle change after drop impact was species dependent with drop size.
@highlight No relationship was found between leaf hydrophobicity and water droplet retention.
