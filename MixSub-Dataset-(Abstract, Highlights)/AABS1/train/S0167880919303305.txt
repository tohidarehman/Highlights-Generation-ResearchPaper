 Soil and water conservation measures such as vegetation cover and terraces effectively reduce runoff and sediment yield . However there is little information available on how vegetation cover and terraces affect peak flow under extreme rainstorm conditions . The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of vegetation cover and terraces on peak flow rate in small catchments under 7.26 extreme rainstorm conditions on the Chinese Loess Plateau . Thirty two small watersheds located in Chabagou Watershed Zizhou County Shaanxi Province were selected . The watershed areas ranged from 0.03 to 1.55 km

@highlight Basin area main channel length slope grassland proportion affect peak flow rate.
@highlight Unit flood peaks of the grassland and woodland decreased by 36 and 64 respectively.
@highlight Terrace reduced 48 and 39 of the unit flood peaks for the farmland and grassland.
@highlight The effectiveness of conservation measures was affected by their area fraction.
