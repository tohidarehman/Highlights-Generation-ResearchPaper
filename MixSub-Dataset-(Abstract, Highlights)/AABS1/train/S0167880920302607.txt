 Dominant plant species coexist with other species from the same or other trophic levels which may give rise to neighbourhood and defoliation effects on litter decomposition . Yet little information exists on if and how neighbouring plant species and herbivore defoliation interactively affect the decomposition of dominant species and further whether decomposition of leaves and roots has similar responses . Here we simultaneously examined both the leaf and fine root litter decomposition of the dominant grass species

@highlight Neighbouring legume and defoliation accelerated both leaf and root decomposition.
@highlight Neighbouring legume exerted stronger effects on litter decomposition than defoliation.
@highlight Neighbouring legume and defoliation exerted interactive effects on leaf decomposition.
@highlight The cooccurrence of neighbouring legume and defoliation caused the fastest root decay.
@highlight Functionally dissimilar species coexistence facilitates nutrient cycling in grassland.
