 Microbial anabolism relative to catabolism reflected by the C use efficiency determines the fate of C transformation in soil . Understanding how the microbial CUE and microbial necromass respond to fertilization is crucial for the evaluation of the C sequestration potential in intensively managed paddy soils . We examined the microbial CUE microbial biomass turnover and necromass accumulation in rice rhizosphere and bulk soils subjected to long term fertilizations no fertilizers mineral fertilizers alone mineral fertilizers plus rice straw incorporation and mineral fertilizers combined with a low or a high amount of organic manure . The microbial CUE was determined by

@highlight We describe microbial biomass role in C sequestration in fertilized paddy soil.
@highlight Organic inputs increase microbial growth and necromass accumulation.
@highlight Organic inputs do not alter microbial CUE in bulk soil but reduce CUE in rhizosphere soil.
@highlight Microbial CUE is lower in rhizosphere soil than in bulk soil.
