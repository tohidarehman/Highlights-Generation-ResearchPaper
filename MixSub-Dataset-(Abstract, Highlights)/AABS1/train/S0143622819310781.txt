 Various environmental criminology theories and empirical studies have linked the urban environment to crime . The crime pattern theory in particular argues that edges either social or physical affect crime . A recent study has combined both social and physical edges to derive composite edges . A composite edge index measured by NPP VIIRS satellite nightlights at the census tract level is found to be related to street robbery and burglary . Nightlight images of Luojia 1 01 launched in June 2018 have a much higher spatial resolution than that of NPP VIIRS . This study applies Luojia 1 01 nightlight data to measure composite edges by nightlight gradients at the smaller census block group level . The effects of the composite edges on street robbery and burglary are explored by negative binomial models . Results show that composite edges measured by Luojia 1 01 nightlight data improve the fitness of models noticeably on street robbery but not on burglary . Nightlight gradients make a statistically significant and positive impact on the street robbery rate but an insignificant and negative impact on the burglary rate . Furthermore the composite edge effect on street robbery is more substantial than that on burglary . In sum this study provides evidence that Luojia 1 01 nightlight imagery can help explain crime at the aggregated block group level but its impact on crime varies by crime type .

@highlight Make the first attempt of using Luojia 1 01 nightlight imagery to study urban crime.
@highlight Confirm that Luojia 1 01 is applicable for crime research at the census block group level.
@highlight Reveal that composite edge effects are more substantial on street robbery than burglary.
