 Over the last few years the use of remote sensing data in different applications such as estimation of air pollution concentration and health applications has become very popular and new . Thus some studies have established a possible relationship between environmental variables and respiratory health parameters . This study proposes to estimate the prevalence of Chronic Respiratory Diseases where there is a relationship between remote sensing data and environmental variables to determine the number of hospital discharges of patients with chronic respiratory diseases in Quito Ecuador between 2013 and 2017 . The main objective of this study is to establish and evaluate an alternative LUR model that is capable of estimate the prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases in contrast with traditional LUR models which typically assess air pollutants . Moreover this study also evaluates different analytic techniques that often form the basis of spatial models . The results show that machine learning techniques such as support vector machine are the most effective in computing such models presenting the lowest root mean square error . Additionally in this study we show that the most significant remote sensing predictors are the blue and infrared bands . Our proposed model is a spatial modeling approach that is capable of determining the prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases in the city of Quito which can serve as a useful tool for health authorities in policy and decision making .

@highlight Quito Ecuador is a city located in the middle of the Andean Region with some interesting geographical characteristics.
@highlight The use of Remote Sensing and environmental variables can estimate the prevalence of respiratory diseases.
@highlight The LUR model uses some geographical variables being an interesting alternative to build air pollution and health spatial models.
@highlight The machine learning techniques let compute more efficient regression models.
