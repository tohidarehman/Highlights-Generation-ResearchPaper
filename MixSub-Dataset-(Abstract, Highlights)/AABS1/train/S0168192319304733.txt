 Agro ecosystems in degraded lands are subjected to climate change impacts throughout the globe . Previous work in degraded lands has focused on afforestation and soil conservation which has obvious limitations in terms of generality and scope of application for production systems in climate change scenario . A key challenge in degraded lands is to develop climate smart systems those are resilient to extreme weather and have high potential for carbon sequestration . Therefore we examined the effectiveness of Sapota trees

@highlight Climate change is severely affecting the agro ecosystems in ravine lands.
@highlight Extreme rainfall events adversely affected crops compared to tree and grasses.
@highlight Soil and water conservation enhanced the growth biomass and carbon stock of plants.
@highlight Terrace was found superior to enhance climate resilience and carbon sequestration.
