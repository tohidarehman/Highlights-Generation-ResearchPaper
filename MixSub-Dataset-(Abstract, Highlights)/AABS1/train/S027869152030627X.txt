 Summary The existing information supports the use of this material as described in this safety assessment.2 Propanol 1 1 1 1 tetrakis was evaluated for genotoxicity repeated dose toxicity reproductive toxicity local respiratory toxicity phototoxicity photoallergenicity skin sensitization and environmental safety . Data from the target material and read across analog 1 1 1 nitrilotripropan 2 ol show that 2 propanol 1 1 1 1 tetrakis is not expected to be genotoxic . Data on 2 propanol 1 1 1 1 tetrakis provide a calculated margin of exposure 100 for the repeated dose toxicity and reproductive toxicity endpoints and show that there are no safety concerns for skin sensitization under the current declared levels of use . The phototoxicity photoallergenicity endpoints were evaluated based on ultraviolet spectra 2 propanol 1 1 1 1 tetrakis is not expected to be phototoxic photoallergenic . The local respiratory toxicity endpoint was evaluated using the threshold of toxicological concern for a Cramer Class III material and the exposure to 2 propanol 1 1 1 1 tetrakis is below the TTC . The environmental endpoints were evaluated 2 propanol 1 1 1 1 tetrakis was found not to be persistent bioaccumulative and toxic as per the International Fragrance Association Environmental Standards and its risk quotients based on its current volume of use in Europe and North America are 1 .

@highlight 2 Propanol 1 1 1 1 1 2 ethanediyldinitrilo tetrakis a safety assessment based on RIFM s criteria.
@highlight A safety assessment based on 7 human health endpoints plus environmental.
@highlight All endpoints were cleared using target data read across and or TTC.
