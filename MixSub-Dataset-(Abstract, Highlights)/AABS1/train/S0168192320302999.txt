 Changes in land use management and natural climate variability has led to significant vegetation greening in China over the past decades as evidenced by satellite observations . In this study we used a high resolution land atmosphere coupled regional climate model to assess the impacts of recent greening on China s regional summer climate . Our results inferred a country averged surface cooling of 0.11 C and a precipitation increase of 0.02mm d during summer in response to China s widespread greening . We also identified significant regional variability in the climatic responses to vegetation change . The regions of northern China showed significant cooling including the Northeast China Plain Loess Plateau and the eastern areas of the Northern arid and semi arid region however no significant temperature changes were simulated in southern China . Summer precipitation decreased in southern China and increased in the Huang Huai Hai Plain and the northern Loess Plateau . Variations in moisture flux convergence had a stronger influence on the precipitation patterns relative to evapotranspiration . Furthermore our results suggested that vegetation greening would influence the occurrence of extreme climate events by decreasing the number of heatwave days reducing the number of continuous drought events in northern China and minimizing the risks of floods in southern China .

@highlight Widespread greening cools surface and increases rainfall in summer over China.
@highlight Climatic responses to the greening showed significant regional variability.
@highlight Vegetation greening would decrease the risk of extreme climate events.
