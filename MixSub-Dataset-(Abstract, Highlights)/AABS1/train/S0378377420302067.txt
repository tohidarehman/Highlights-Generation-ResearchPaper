 Surface water infiltration is an important process to meet plant water needs and an important part of the hydrological cycle via groundwater recharge with special relevance in semi arid regions . This study evaluated the relationships between grassland plant root morphological characteristics and soil water infiltration rates . For this purpose five artificial homogeneous grasslands

@highlight Effects of root morphological characteristics on soil water infiltration rates was studied.
@highlight Root length density and root surface area were negatively correlated with infiltration rate.
@highlight Root length density 530cm and root surface area 1020cm influence infiltration rates.
@highlight It provide insights for plant root morphological characteristics on the infiltration processes.
