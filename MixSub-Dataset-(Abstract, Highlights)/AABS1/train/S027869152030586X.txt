 3 7 Dimethyl 3 6 octadienal was evaluated for genotoxicity repeated dose toxicity developmental and reproductive toxicity local respiratory toxicity phototoxicity photoallergenicity skin sensitization and environmental safety . Data from read across analog citral show that 3 7 dimethyl 3 6 octadienal is not expected to be genotoxic and provided a calculated margin of exposure 100 for the repeated dose toxicity and developmental and reproductive endpoints . Data from the read across analog citronellal provided 3 7 dimethyl 3 6 octadienal a No Expected Sensitization Induction Level of 7000 g cm
