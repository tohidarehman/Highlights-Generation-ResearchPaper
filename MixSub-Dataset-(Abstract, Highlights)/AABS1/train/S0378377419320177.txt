 Drip irrigation has been widely used for corn potato and soybean among other crops and its water saving effect has been confirmed by numerous studies . However how DI affects soil evaporation crop transpiration and total evapotranspiration of wheat in arid regions and how much it can reduce E T and ET under sufficient irrigation remain uncertain .

@highlight Drip irrigation reduced wheat ET E and T by an average of 3.5 mm 18.5 mm and 22 mm per year respectively.
@highlight The reduction in ET under drip irrigation was primarily due to the reduction in T.
@highlight Drip irrigation lower LAI by 24 and shorten the crop growth duration by 1 week.
