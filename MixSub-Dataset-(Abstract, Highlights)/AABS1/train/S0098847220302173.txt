 The accumulation of free polyamines plays critical role in plants under abiotic stress conditions while protective traits of bound PAs receiving much less attention our understanding of the regulation of free PAs converted to bound PAs is limited . In this study we demonstrated that the PA mediator transglutaminase play an important role in improving tomato tolerance to salinity stress in part because its critical role in inducing accumulation of bound PAs under salt stress .

@highlight This study provide a comprehensive genetic and analysis of TGase in response to salinity stress in tomato plants.
@highlight Overexpression of TGase increases the bound PAs.
@highlight This work demonstrate that TGase depend on bound PAs accumulation to mediate antioxidant enzyme activity and reduce salt induced oxidative damage.
