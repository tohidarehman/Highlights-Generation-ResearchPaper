 Ecosystem water use efficiency defined as the ratio of gross primary productivity to total ecosystem evapotranspiration is an important indicator of the coupling between the terrestrial carbon and water cycles . China s Loess Plateau has been experiencing climatic warming in recent decades and large scale revegetation since the early 2000s . Understanding the combined effects of revegetation and climate change on ecosystem WUE patterns is important for a better prediction of future changes of the water and carbon cycles in the region . In this study we decompose ecosystem WUE into a two component process i.e . the ratio of carbon uptake to plant transpiration GPP

@highlight Ecosystem WUE remained stable in 19851999 but increased in 20002015 on CLP.
