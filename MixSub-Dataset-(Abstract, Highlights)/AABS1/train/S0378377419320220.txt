 The crop water stress index is usually used to normalize crop temperature for efficient irrigation management . For CWSI computation the temperature of a non transpiring crop T

@highlight New artificial reference surfaces for CWSI computation have been developed.
@highlight The new surfaces are made of cellulose paper and have hemispherical geometry.
@highlight The dry and wet reference surfaces matched well the temperature of wilted and well watered maize canopies.
@highlight Solar radiation is needed to derive the temperature of a well watered maize canopy.
