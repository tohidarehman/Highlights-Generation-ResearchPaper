 Habitat quality is often evaluated based on food availability . However ecological theory suggests cover should be a more important decision rule when food is not a proximate threat to fitness as cover mediates predation risk as well as other important factors of fitness . In reality vegetation characteristics related to food availability and cover are rarely coupled with animal use in the same space and time to determine their relative influences on habitat use . Using an array of 81 camera traps in a matrix of forest management strategies used to deliberately cause a wide disparity in vegetation characteristics we monitored intensity of use by white tailed deer

@highlight The relative importance of habitat components to habitat use is often debated.
@highlight Food availability is often used to assess habitat quality but cover usually has a stronger fitness consequence.
@highlight White tailed deer use was positively influenced by cover and negatively by food.
@highlight Wild turkey use was positively influenced by grasses which may simultaneously provide food and cover.
