 Overuse of chemical fertilizer due to intensive agriculture results in excess dissolved nutrient exports by runoff from watershed causing eutrophication of water bodies . But how the time of fertilization and ground cover influence exports of dissolved nutrients by runoff from watershed have not been studied yet . This study therefore investigated the dynamics of dissolved nutrients NH

@highlight Influence of fertilizer and sugarcane cover on TDN and TDP exports were verified.
@highlight Fertilizer application followed by rainfall significantly increases dissolved nutrient exports in runoff from the agricultural watershed.
@highlight Increasing sugarcane cover significantly reduces dissolved nutrient exports from the watersheds.
@highlight Appropriate timing of fertilizer application and sugarcane cover reduce dissolved nutrient exports in runoff from agricultural watersheds.
