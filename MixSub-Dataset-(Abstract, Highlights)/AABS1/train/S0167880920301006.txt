 The diversification of agroecosystems with shade trees has a complex role in climate change adaptation . Multiple interactions among shade tree composition heterogeneous soil conditions and resulting microclimate modifications makes reproducible evaluations of agroforestry as a climate change adaptation practice challenging . In this study we systematically investigate soil water and nutrient acquisition strategies in cocoa

@highlight Shade trees have a complex and inconsistent role in climate change adaptation.
@highlight Cocoa root trait expression varied with climato edaphic conditions.
@highlight Cocoa absorptive root trait response to agroforestry was environment specific.
@highlight Cocoa transport root traits were affected by soil texture rather than shade trees.
@highlight Soil texture may moderate agroforestry success in climate change adaptation.
