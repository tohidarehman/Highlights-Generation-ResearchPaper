 Spring maize is one of the major cereal crops in the arid and semi arid regions of Northwest China but limited water resources and low water fertilizer use efficiency largely restrict the sustainable development of local agriculture . A two year eld experiment was conducted to explore the effects of water fertilizer interaction on aboveground biomass grain yield crop water productivity partial factor productivity and economic benefits of spring maize . Particularly the optimized combination of drip irrigation and fertilization regimes for high grain yield CWP and economic benefits were attained by multiple regression analysis and likelihood estimation . The irrigation levels included I
