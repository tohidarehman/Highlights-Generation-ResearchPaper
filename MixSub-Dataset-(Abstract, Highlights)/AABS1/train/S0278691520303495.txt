 2 Monochloropropane 1 3 diol and its isomer 3 monochloropropane 1 2 diol are widespread food contaminants . 3 MCPD has been classified as a non genotoxic carcinogen whereas very limited toxicological data are available for 2 MCPD . Animal studies indicate that heart and skeletal muscle are target organs of 2 MCPD . Oxidative stress may play a role in this process and the potential of 3 MCPD to induce oxidative stress

@highlight Up to 100mg 2 MCPD per kg body weight per day caused no acute toxicity in male mice.
@highlight Only minor effects of 2 MCPD on the induction of oxidative stress in mice.
@highlight Different modes of action of 2 MCPD and 3 MCPD with regard to target organs and oxidative stress.
