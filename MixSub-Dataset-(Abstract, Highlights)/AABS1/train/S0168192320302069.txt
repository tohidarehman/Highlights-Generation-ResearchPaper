 Carbon and nitrogen are key to biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial ecosystems . Despite the negative effects of drought on multiple ecosystem processes our understanding of the responses of C and N in plants soil and microorganisms to drought remains incomplete . Our meta analysis of 379 observations from 79 studies revealed that the C and N concentrations and C N ratios of plant organs litter and soil and activities and stoichiometry of C and N acquiring extracellular enzymes all decreased under drought while the microbial biomass C N ratio increased . Moreover the magnitudes of these responses generally increased with drought intensity and drought duration . These effects of drought were consistent across ecosystem types including forests and grasslands . Our study underpinned the strong coherent responses of C N stoichiometry to drought encompassing plants soil and microorganisms .
