 is a native Chinese plant species that belongs to the group of metal hyperaccumulators and can accumulate significant amounts of Cd and Zn in the shoot without detrimental effects on its growth and metabolism . Understanding the molecular basis of this process may be essential for both phytoremediation of contaminated soils and developing heavy metal resistant crop species . In this work we have focused on NRAMP family proteins transporters as potential candidates conferring superior hyperaccumulating ability in this species and undertaken its functional characterization . The bioinformatic analysis showed that SaNRAMP1 from

@highlight is highly expressed in the young tissues of the shoots of hyperaccumulating ecotype of
@highlight SaNRAMP1 is localizes at plasma membrane and transports Cd Zn and Mn.
@highlight Overexpressing of
@highlight could significantly increase the accumulation of Cd Zn and Mn in tobacco.
