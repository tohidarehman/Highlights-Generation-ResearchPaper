 The Sistan region in southeastern Iran is one of the country s main dust storm areas . To reduce the frequency and intensity of dust storms using efficient windbreaks is critical . In a field study the sheltering effect of a multiple row windbreak 14 rows of

@highlight Aerodynamic roughness length and friction velocity increased within the windbreak.
@highlight The greatest
@highlight values was observed at the beginning of windbreak 
@highlight 100 .
@highlight The windbreak sheltered an area of 50h beyond and 1.8h above the vegetation.
@highlight Windbreak s efficiency is high due to its optimal porosity and multi row design.
