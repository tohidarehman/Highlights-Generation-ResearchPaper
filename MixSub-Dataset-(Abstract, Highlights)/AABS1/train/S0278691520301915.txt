 Mixtures of substances sharing the same molecular initiating event are supposed to induce additive effects . The proposed MIE for azole fungicides is CYP26 inhibition with retinoic acid local increase triggering key events leading to craniofacial defects . Valproic acid is supposed to imbalance RA regulated gene expression trough histone deacetylases inhibition . The aim was to evaluate effects of molecules sharing the same MIE and of such having different MIEs but which are eventually involved in the same adverse outcome pathway . An

@highlight Different molecules can induce the same adverse outcome AO .
@highlight Similar or dissimilar Mode of Action can be involved in the same pathway AOP .
@highlight approach can predict different relative potencies.
@highlight approach is useful to obtain robust data for mathematical modelling.
