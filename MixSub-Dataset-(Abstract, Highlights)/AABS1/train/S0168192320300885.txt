 Across networks of cold weather sites eddy covariance measurements of ecosystem fluxes commonly indicate carbon uptake throughout winter a problem that has been linked to open path infrared gas analyzer self heating . Though there is no definitive consensus about this phenomenon the de facto correction for the prevalent LI 7500 is the methodology of Burba etal . which predicts self heating from IRGA surface temperatures and boundary layers . In this paper we examine the validity of this model compared to an updated correction by conducting field studies with the LI 7500 and an IRGA designed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . Both types of sensors were instrumented to measure sensible heat flux within the instrument path and temperatures of key instrument surfaces . We test hypotheses that considerable IRGA self heating occurs at a cold windy high elevation mountainous field site unwarranted boundary layer adjustment terms defined in B08 reduce the bottom and top surface heat fluxes by an order of magnitude and the weighted sum of the surface heat fluxes should be proportional to their surface area contribution to the IRGA measurement volume . We detected more sensible heat flux within the LI7500 path than outside of it statistical slopes between 0.95 to 1.3 and offsets between 0 and 35W m
