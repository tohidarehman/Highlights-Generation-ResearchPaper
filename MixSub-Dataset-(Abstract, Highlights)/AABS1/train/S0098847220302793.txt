 Kale originates from the eastern Mediterranean and Asia Minor being cultivated worldwide and is considered as global cash crop to high nutrients as well as cold tolerance in the fall winter and spring . Although kale production is gradually increasing there is limited research on physiological and metabolism changes by different levels of irrigation . Here we comprehensively investigated yield metabolism and physiological changes by different levels of precision irrigation based on soil moisture sensor . Kales were grown at three different levels of volumetric water content which included 0.15 0.25 or 0.35m

@highlight Drought stress induces decreases in net CO
@highlight assimilation rate in kale.
@highlight Carotenoids and chlorophylls are decreased under drought stress conditions.
@highlight MetaboAnalyst based pathway analysis can be a useful tool physiology study.
@highlight Analysis of variable importance projections score can be used to identify metabolites that can be use as biomarker for stress tolerance.
