 Different species have different germination strategies to cope with various climates they encounter when spreading in which temperature and water are two of the most important factors that affect seed germination . Such differences in their coping strategies therefore could determine the fate of a species after its invasion into different environments .

@highlight An adjusted hydrothermal time model was used to study the germination of C.
@highlight from two climate zones.
@highlight Seeds from subtropical and temperate areas differed in germination behavior indicating their adaptation after invasion.
@highlight There was a wider environmental range than expected for seed germination in C.
@highlight  potentially promoting its invasion.
