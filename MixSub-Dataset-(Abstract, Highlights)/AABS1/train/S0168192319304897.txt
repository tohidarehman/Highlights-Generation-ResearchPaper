 Water use efficiency oftentimes estimated as transpiration efficiency the amount of biomass produced with regard to the water used has not yet been used as a breeding trait to select poplar genotypes with simultaneously high productivity and conservation of water . Before its application as a selection target evidence must be presented showing that WUE or its estimators remain constant with age and across environmental conditions .

@highlight Glasshouse and field grown poplar genotypes showed similar water use efficiency.
@highlight Drivers of differences in water use efficiency changed between experiments.
@highlight Leaf level and whole plant estimators of water use efficiency were correlated.
