 The main target organ for MeHg is the nervous system and its neurological dysfunction remains irreversible . Therefore predictive biomarkers associated with individual susceptibility to MeHg and future clinical severity are needed to protect against the progression of MeHg toxicity . In this study we demonstrated that plasma thiol antioxidant capacity is a useful predictive biomarker associated with future clinical severity using MeHg intoxicated rats administered 1mg kg day for 4 weeks . Blood samples were collected from the subclavian vein of each rat once a week to examine total blood mercury concentrations and the levels of plasma oxidative stress markers . Time course analyses of the correlation between these weekly blood examination values and hind limb crossing signs score after 4 weeks of MeHg exposure were performed and plasma SHp levels after 2 weeks of MeHg exposure showed strong correlations with future hind limb crossing sign scores . Neuropathological changes also developed in parallel with hind limb crossing sign scores . Quantitative analysis of vacuolar areas in the spinal cord showed a strong correlation with hind limb crossing sign scores . In conclusion evaluation of plasma SHp levels allowed us to detect individuals at risk for health damage and could protect the sensitive population against MeHg toxicity .
