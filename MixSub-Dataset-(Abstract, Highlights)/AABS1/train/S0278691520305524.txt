 Pyrrolizidine alkaloid containing plants are among the most common poisonous plants affecting humans livestock and wildlife worldwide . A large number of PAs are known to induce genetic damage after metabolic activation . In the present study using a battery of fourteen newly developed TK6 cell lines each expressing a single human cytochrome P450 we identified specific CYPs responsible for bioactivating three PAs lasiocarpine riddelliine and senkirkine . Among the fourteen cell lines cells expressing CYP3A4 showed significant increases in PA induced cytotoxicity evidenced by decreased ATP production and cell viability and increased caspase 3 7 activities . LC MS MS analysis revealed the formation of 1 hydroxymethyl 7 hydroxy 6 7 dihydropyrrolizine the main reactive metabolite of PAs in CYP3A4 expressing TK6 cells . DHP was also detected in CYP3A5 and 3A7 expressing cells after PA exposure but to a much lesser extent . Subsequently using a high throughput micronucleus assay we demonstrated that PAs induced concentration dependent increases in micronuclei and G2 M phase cell cycle arrest in three CYP3A variant expressing TK6 cell lines . Using Western blotting we observed that PA induced apoptosis cell cycle changes and DNA damage were primarily mediated by CYP3A4 . Benchmark dose modeling demonstrated that lasiocarpine of the three PAs was the most potent inducer of micronuclei with a BMD

@highlight A battery of 14 CYP expressing TK6 cell lines were created for genotoxicity testing.
@highlight Pyrrolizidine alkaloid PA induced genotoxicity was investigated in these metabolically competent TK6 cell lines.
@highlight Genotoxicity of lasiocarpine riddelliine and senkirkine was mainly catalyzed by CYP3A4.
@highlight To a lesser extent CYP3A5 and 3A7 were also involved in PA bioactivation.
@highlight Lasiocarpine has the highest genotoxic potency followed by riddelliine and senkirkine.
