 The rising temperature and extreme drought induced by climate change will considerably affect plant growth and survival . However the interactive effects of elevated temperature and drought on carbon balance and hydraulic traits remain unclear . In this study we investigated the C exchange hydraulic characteristics and total nonstructural carbohydrate availability of different organs in

@highlight Carbon and hydraulic traits were monitored under elevated temperature and drought.
@highlight Drought reduced C assimilation and increased loss of plant xylem conductivity.
@highlight Elevated temperature exacerbated the drought effect on the plant.
@highlight Elevated temperature enhanced the hydraulic failure and C starvation under drought.
