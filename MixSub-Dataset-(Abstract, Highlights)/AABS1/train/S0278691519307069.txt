 Mitochondrial DNA encodes for 13 proteins involved in the oxidative phosphorylation process . In liver genetic or acquired impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can reduce ATP output but also decrease fatty acid oxidation thus leading to different hepatic lesions including massive necrosis and microvesicular steatosis . Hence a severe impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can lead to liver failure and death . An increasing number of investigations report that some drugs can induce mitochondrial dysfunction and drug induced liver injury by altering mtDNA homeostasis . Some drugs such as ciprofloxacin antiretroviral nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and tacrine can inhibit hepatic mtDNA replication thus inducing mtDNA depletion . Drug induced reduced mtDNA levels can also be the consequence of reactive oxygen species mediated oxidative damage to mtDNA which triggers its degradation by mitochondrial nucleases . Such mechanism is suspected for acetaminophen and troglitazone . Other pharmaceuticals such as linezolid and tetracyclines can impair mtDNA translation thus selectively reducing the synthesis of the 13 mtDNA encoded proteins . Lastly some drugs might alter the mtDNA methylation status but the pathophysiological consequences of such alteration are still unclear . Drug induced impairment of mtDNA homeostasis is probably under recognized since preclinical and post marketing safety studies do not classically investigate mtDNA levels mitochondrial protein synthesis and mtDNA oxidative damage .
