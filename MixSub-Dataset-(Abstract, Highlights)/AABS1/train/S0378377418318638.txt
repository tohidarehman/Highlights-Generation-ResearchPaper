 Demand for rice will increase with growing global population . Globally water management and nitrogen application are two key factors influencing rice production and greenhouse gases emissions . In China one of the worlds largest rice producing countries scarcity of water also threatens rice production . Therefore in order to meet these challenges it is essential to find water use efficient irrigation management that also mitigates GHGs emissions from rice paddies . This study was conducted with three N application rates 90 180 270kg N ha

@highlight AWD irrigation significantly reduced CH
@highlight emissions but increased N
@highlight O emissions during rice growing season.
@highlight AWD irrigation decreased GWP and GHGI but enhanced WUE compared with FDF in rice paddies.
@highlight The highest grain yield occurred in AWD with medium N application rate.
