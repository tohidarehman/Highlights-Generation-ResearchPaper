 Does past migration beget future migration Do migrants from different backgrounds origins and ethnicities and separated by several generations always settle in a path dependent way in the same places Is there a permanent separation between migration prone and migration averse areas This paper examines whether that is the case by looking at the settlement patterns of two very different migration waves that of Europeans at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries and that of Latin Americans between the 1960s and the early 21st century . Using Census data aggregated at county level we track the settlement pattern of migrants and assess the extent to which the first mass migration wave has determined the later settlement pattern of Latin American migrants to the US . The analysis conducted using ordinary least squares instrumental variable and panel data estimation techniques shows that past US migration patterns create a path dependence that has consistently affected the geography of future migration waves . Recent Latin American migrants have flocked once other factors are controlled for to the same migration prone US counties where their European predecessors settled in spite of the very different nature of both migration waves and a time gap of three to five generations .

@highlight The settlement pattern of European migrants more than a century ago has influenced the geography of Latino migration to the US a century later.
@highlight Places that attracted large number of migrants century ago remain more appealing to new migrants.
@highlight Historical migration stocks are a key pull factor for new generations of migrants in a more consistent way than most standard regional pull factors.
@highlight Past migration irrespective of national or kinship networks is a long lasting pull factor creating migration prone and migration averse places.
