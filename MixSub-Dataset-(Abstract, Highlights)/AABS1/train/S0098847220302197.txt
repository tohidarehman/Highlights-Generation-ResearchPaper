 Invader success might depend on both nutrient availability and species richness of the resident community . Here we combine these ideas in a single experiment testing whether the Fluctuating resource and biotic resistance hypotheses might be contingent upon one another . The fluctuating resource hypothesis proposes that resource fluctuation might facilitate the successful invasion of exotic plants if invaders are better than natives at taking advantage of resource pulses . The biotic resistance hypothesis proposed that more species rich communities might be more resistant to invasion due to greater competition for resources with greater native richness . Here we use an experiment with the invader

@highlight The effect of nutrient fluctuation on invasion success of
@highlight are contingent on resident origin.
@highlight The effect of nutrient fluctuation was weaker in more species rich communities.
@highlight The invasion success of
@highlight was negatively related with biomass of resident plants in communities.
@highlight Competition for fluctuating resources may be one mechanism governing biotic resistance hypothesis.
