 Agri environment measures to support biodiversity in intensively used agricultural landscapes have been implemented in many European countries but the large scale downward trend in many species groups continues . The arable flora is one of the species groups that suffered the steepest declines in European cultural landscapes . Despite their fundamental importance in agroecosystems as the basis of the food web few studies have tested the effectiveness of different agri environment measures on the arable flora in replicated field trials over several consecutive years . In a four year participative project with the farmers we recorded the effects of four agri environment measures namely conservation field margins annual fallow strips alternately managed biennial flower strips and perennial flower strips on the species richness plant cover and composition of the non crop vegetation in 67 intensively managed arable fields in Northwest Germany . Compared to conventionally managed field edges all measures led to a large increase in total plant cover and doubling of species richness promoting not only generalist species but also the typical arable flora . Of the 207 plant species recorded during sampling 43 were solely found in measures . All measures promoted forbs more than graminoids while annual species benefited especially from CFM and fallows . The overall effects on diversity and cover remained stable over the 3 yr implementation period but were significantly influenced by interannual weather fluctuation . Spillover effects of the measures into adjacent conventionally managed crops were not detectable .

@highlight Four agri environment measures increased arable plant diversity and cover.
@highlight Adapted management is crucial to maintain the positive effects over time.
@highlight Weather conditions strongly influence species richness and cover.
@highlight Long term monitoring is necessary to reliably validate the success of measures.
