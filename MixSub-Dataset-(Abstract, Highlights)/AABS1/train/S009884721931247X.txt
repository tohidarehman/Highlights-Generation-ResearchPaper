 Although nitrogen influences plant response to cadmium stress little information has been suggested on how N forms affect Cd distribution and tolerance in

@highlight Nitrogen forms differently affected Cd response in
@highlight clones with different sensitivity to nitrogen deficiency.
@highlight Nanlin 1388 had stronger Cd tolerance than Nanlin 895 under the different nitrogen forms and status.
@highlight NH
@highlight supply promoted Cd accumulation and toxicity relative to NO
@highlight supply especially in Nanlin 895.
@highlight NO
@highlight supply enhanced Cd tolerance by improving ion homeostasis detoxification and defense preparedness in Nanlin 1388 relative to Nanlin 895.
