Pregnant rats were daily gavaged with 500mg kg DBP alone or together with taxifolin from gestational day 1221 . At GD21 sera and testes of male fetus were collected . DBP significantly lowered serum testosterone level at 500mg kg and taxifolin can completely reverse its action . DBP caused abnormal aggregation of fetal Leydig cells and taxifolin can reverse it . DBP down regulated the expression of the genes of cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme
