 Aquaculture production is demanding novel feed ingredients that reflect natural marine nutrient levels that are also essential to humans . In this regard biofortification through addition of iodine rich sugar kelp in feed formulations was assessed in a 12 week rainbow trout trial . Yttrium inclusion in feed allowed determinations of apparent absorption coefficients of essential and potentially toxic elements and apparent digestibility coefficient of nutrients . E.g . apparent absorption coefficients in trouts fortified feed with 14 dw kelp were 6761 As 3240 Cd 5 Fe 8083 I 66 58 Se . Iodine concentrations in feed up to 239mg kg was proportional to iodine accumulation in trout fillets R
