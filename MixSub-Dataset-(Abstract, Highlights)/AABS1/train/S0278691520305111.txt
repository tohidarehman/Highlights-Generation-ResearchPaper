 Selenium nanoparticles were first designed as nutritional supplements but they are attractive also for use in diagnostic and therapeutic systems owing to their biocompatibility and protective effects . This study aimed to examine if different SeNPs stabilization strategies affect their antimicrobial activity against bacteria

@highlight Human toxicity and antimicrobial effects of selenium nanoparticles were studied.
