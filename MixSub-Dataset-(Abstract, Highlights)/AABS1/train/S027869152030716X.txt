 Fenamiphos is a chiral organophosphate pesticide that is used to control nematodes in several crops . Enantioselective differences may be observed in FS activity bioaccumulation metabolism and toxicity . Humans may be exposed to FS through occupational and chronic exposure . FS may cause undesirable CYP450 pesticide drug interactions which may impact human health . Here the CYP450 isoforms involved in enantioselective FS metabolism were identified and CYP450 inhibition by

@highlight CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 are involved in the metabolism of fenamiphos enantiomers.
@highlight CYP2B6 may be involved in the metabolism of fenamiphos racemic mixture.
@highlight Fenamiphos is a reversible competitive inhibitor of CYP1A2 CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 5.
@highlight Stereoselective differences were observed in CYP450 inhibition by fenamiphos.
@highlight CYP450 pesticide drug interaction studies are important for human risk assessment.
