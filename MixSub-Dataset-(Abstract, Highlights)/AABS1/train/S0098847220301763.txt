 Heat stress is a major problem of tomato production worldwide as it reduces fruit setting due to the adverse effects on pollen development and fertility . In this study we isolated heat tolerant mutants providing improved fruit setting under long term ambient high temperature by testing over 4000 lines from the Micro Tom tomato mutant collection . The HT mutants were categorized into two types namely those that produced parthenocarpic fruit and those that produced fruit with seeds . Among the HT mutants HT7 plants produced fruit with seeds had a higher fruit number and seeded fruit yield and the total pollen number and viability were much higher under HS conditions than those of the WT under both control and HS conditions . HT7 also succeeded at fertilization even under HS conditions due to higher pollen viability than the WT . In addition HS related genes such as S
