 Saline conditions can significantly affect plant growth and development leading to massive reduction in crop yield . Herein we show that a protein repairing enzyme PROTEIN

@highlight Both
@highlight and
@highlight are induced by salinity stress.
@highlight over expression lines exhibit improved tolerance to salinity stress while
@highlight RNAi lines are hyper sensitive to salinity stress.
@highlight over expression lines are associated with reduced isoAsp and ROS accumulation.
@highlight RNAi lines are associated with increased isoAsp and ROS accumulation.
@highlight Improved compromised catalytic activity of antioxidant enzymes is correlated well with enhanced reduced PIMT activity.
