 Lipopolysaccharide induced inflammatory macrophages model and intestinal like Caco 2 macrophages co culture inflammation model were established to evaluate the anti inflammatory effect and underlying mechanism of

@highlight Established LPS induced macrophages model and Caco 2 macrophages co culture model.
@highlight PSG 1 inhibited the level of pro inflammatory cytokines ROS COX 2 in both models.
@highlight PSG 1 suppressed the LPS induced activation of MAPKs signaling pathways.
@highlight PSG 1 regulated oxidative stress by activating the Nrf2 Keap1 signaling pathways.
