 This study explored the camel milk efficacy to ameliorate the fenpropathrin induced neurotoxic impacts in rats . Six groups were orally administered physiological saline corn oil CM FNP CM FNP or FNP CM . Sensorimotor functions memory exploratory and locomotor activities were assessed . The levels of dopamine neurotransmitter acetylcholinesterase enzyme oxidative stress and inflammatory markers were determined . Brain histopathology and apoptotic markers immunohistochemical detection were performed . The results revealed that FNP exposure resulted in deficit sensorimotor functions impaired memory and less exploration . DOPA and AChE Levels were significantly reduced . FNP exposure increased nitric oxide malondialdehyde myeloperoxidase Caspase 3 and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels but interleukin 10 total antioxidant capacity and Bcl 2 levels were declined . Also FNP exposure induced obvious encephalopathy . Additionally neurodegenerative changes were seen in the hippocampi of FNP treated rats . FNP Exposure induced a significant decrease of Bcl 2 immunolabelling but Caspase 3 immunoexpression was increased in cerebral cortices and hippocampus tissues . CM significantly counteracted the FNP injurious impacts especially when used as a prophylactic routine than a therapeutic one . Conclusively these findings confirmed that CM could be a biologically effective protective agent against FNP induced neurobehavioral aberrations and neurotoxic impacts .

@highlight CM restored dopamine and acetylcholinesterase in the FNP treated rat brain.
@highlight CM suppressed the release of pro inflammatory cytokines due to FNP exposure.
@highlight CM reduced oxidative stress and lipid per oxidative damage in the FNP treated rat brain.
@highlight CM reduced FNP induced apoptosis in rat brain.
@highlight CM corrected FNP induced neurobehavioral aberrations.
