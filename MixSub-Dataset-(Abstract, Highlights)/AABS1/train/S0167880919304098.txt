 The demand for crop pollination is increasing and honey bees are frequently used in particular as wild pollinators are in decline . Temporal and spatial variation of flower resources affects foraging decisions of wild and honey bees . To optimise crop pollination management a better understanding of potential competition for pollinators in mass and minor flowering crops is needed .

@highlight Honey bees danced more often for the strawberry fields than the land cover suggests.
@highlight The foraging distance decreased when mass flowering oilseed rape was in blossom.
@highlight Foraging activity dances pollen collection was unaffected by oilseed rape bloom.
@highlight Less honey bee were found in strawberry fields when OSR was in bloom.
@highlight Bumble bees and solitary bees made up 75 of the bees counted in strawberry fields.
