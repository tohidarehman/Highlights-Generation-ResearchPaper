 The diversification of tropical pastures with legumes for increased forage and animal productivity has been advocated . Nevertheless effects on soil quality and belowground biodiversity and the implications for sustainable intensification remain poorly documented particularly when cattle grazing is included in the study . We evaluated the impact of forage system diversification with herbaceous and woody legumes on soil properties and soil macrofauna communities and their spatial heterogeneity in a three year old field trial in Cauca Valley Colombia . Three forage based systems were compared a conventional monoculture species grass pasture system of

@highlight The implications of belowground diversity for sustainable intensification are poorly documented.
@highlight Impact of forage diversification with herb and tree legumes on soil properties were evaluated.
@highlight Diversification of tropical pastures improved soil structure and abundance of soil macrofauna.
@highlight Both diversified systems pastures with legume herb and silvopasture are suitable alternatives to conventional pastures.
@highlight High spatial heterogeneity of soil properties under silvopastures warrant careful evaluation.
