 Ecological intensification of farming proposes that more effective use of ecosystem services can in part replace external inputs allowing farmers to maintain high crop yields while reducing adverse effects on the environment . However uptake of ecological intensification among farmers is currently hampered by a lack of realistic studies on the agronomic benefits of enhancing ecosystem services vis vis the benefits of conventional external inputs . Here we use a full factorial field experiment to test the relative and interactive effects of fertilisation irrigation and pollination on crop yield of three parental crop lines of leek

@highlight Effects of fertilisation irrigation and pollination on yield were mainly additive.
@highlight Reduction in insect pollination greatly decreased crop yield.
@highlight Reducing fertiliser use by 50 did not affect seed yield.
@highlight Effects of irrigation are likely to work through pollinator attractiveness.
@highlight The magnitude of effects differed between genetic crop lines.
