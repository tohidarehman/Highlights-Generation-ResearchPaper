 One of the early reactions of plants to high levels of NaCl is the generation of reactive oxygen species which is critical for stress signaling Na

@highlight protonema growth is highly sensitive to the salt stress.
@highlight Salt stress induces generation of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals In

@highlight The endonucleolytic double strand DNA breaks are induced by NaCl to a lesser extent than the single strand breaks caused by free radicals.
