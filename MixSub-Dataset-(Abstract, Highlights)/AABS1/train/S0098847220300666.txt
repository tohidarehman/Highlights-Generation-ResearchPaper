 Plant hormones play a vital role in promoting growth development and metabolism of the plant as well as act as a protector against various environmental stresses . In particular salicylic acid is a potent phenolic signaling biomolecule and a multifaceted plant growth regulator which participates in a wide range of growth metabolism and defense systems . Exogenous application of SA facilitates seed germination growth and flowering up regulates photosynthesis and increases the activity of enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidants . SA is a potent tool for sustainably mitigating environmental stresses in many plants by modulating physiological and metabolic processes of plants . Based on recent reports SA biosynthesis and its regulation are discussed . This review highlights oxidative post translational modifications involvement of various proteins and ROS interaction during SA signaling . Furthermore it evaluates the role of exogenous application of SA in regulating diverse physiological and biochemical processes in healthy and stressed plants and assesses SA effects in plants exposed to various abiotic stress . Additionally the cross talk of SA with other phytohormones and polyamines under normal and stressed conditions is also discussed .
