 Little is known about environmental factors that mitigate or intensify drought effects on tree functioning . We hypothesized that higher nutrient availability and manipulations of the source sink ratio can partially compensate negative drought effects when drought is not too severe whilst too extreme drought can inhibit carbon and nutrient uptake and allocation irrespective of nutrient availability or the plant source sink balance . We exposed three year old

@highlight Extreme drought reduced photosynthesis growth and NSC mild drought only slightly affected biomass and NSC.
@highlight Fertilization increased growth and root biomass fraction but did not mitigate extreme drought stress.
@highlight The effects of mild drought stress could be compensated by increased nutrient availability and lower source sink balances.
