 UVA radiation is the main component of solar UV radiation . Although it shares photoreceptors with blue light its function in plant biology is unclear to a large extent . This study aimed at exploring how UVA radiation affects plant morphology and physiology and at distinguishing to what extent these effects differ from those of blue light . Tomato plants were grown under monochromatic red dichromatic red and blue as well as red and two different levels of UVA radiation with identical photon flux density 250 molm

@highlight UVA cannot be unequivocally considered as an abiotic stress factor.
@highlight UVA induces a shade avoidance response phenotype.
@highlight UVA has similar functions as blue light in shaping the development of the photosynthetic apparatus.
