 Zinc oxide nanoparticles have been widely used in food storage containers and food additives in daily life . However the impact of oral intake of ZnONPs on nervous system is extremely limited especially on children and adolescents . In this study four weeks old mice were treated with either vehicle or ZnONPs suspension solution at 26mg kg by intragastric administration for 30 days . Our results demonstrated that oral ZnONPs exposure could induce pathological changes in gut and abnormal excitement of enteric neurons . Interestingly we found that ZnONPs caused enhancement of 5 hydroxytryptamine in gut by activation of its biosynthesis transport and receptors and subsequently resulting in increased level of 5 HT in brain via gut brain communication by blood . Our data also showed that there were no apparent changes on the expressions of
