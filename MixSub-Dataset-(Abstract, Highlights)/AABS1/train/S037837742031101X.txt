 An integrated research coupling a field study with an agronomic economic model was conducted to investigate the combined effects of irrigation levels and crop loads on fruit quality water productivity and profitability of mature date palms . The study took place in Israels hyper arid Arava Valley where date palm trees are widely cultivated and rely exclusively on brackish water irrigation . Three fruit load intensities and two irrigation levels were applied in a 22 year old date palm orchard in 20182019 . Irrigation amount fruit quality and yield were measured . Profitability for each treatment was analyzed with the ANSWER APP . Higher fruit load resulted in higher yield and water productivity but on the other hand led to reduced fruit physical properties regardless of the irrigation treatment . The improved fruit physical properties and net profits in W2 compared to W1 treatment in each fruit load group resulted from excess salt leaching in the root zone . Notably trees under W2FL2 treatment were found to have highest net profits . It is concluded that adequate irrigation amounts contribute to net profits in date palm trees treated with high fruit load intensity under saline irrigation conditions .

@highlight High fruit load increased yield and water productivity but reduced fruit quality in each irrigation treatment.
@highlight High irrigation levels did not lead to remarkable yield increase in each fruit load group.
@highlight Fruit quality and net profits were pronouncedly improved by elevated irrigation levels.
@highlight Trees under commercial fruit load intensity and high irrigation level treatment exhibited the highest net profits.
