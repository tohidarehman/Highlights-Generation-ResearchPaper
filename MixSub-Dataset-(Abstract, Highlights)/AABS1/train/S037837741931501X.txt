 Based on sufficient pollutants in pretreated swine wastewater this study aimed to explore feasibility of growing water spinach in a hydroponic system using PSW as a liquid fertilizers in a hydroponic system . The tolerance values of WS to Cu Zn total phosphorus and ammonium N NH

@highlight Production of WS and purification of PSW could be achieved by hydroponic technology.
@highlight Tolerance values of WS to NH
@highlight  N TP Cu and Zn were 0.5 2.0 150 and 300mgL
@highlight NH
@highlight  N and TP removal rate from PSW were 87.91 and 92.38 in hydroponic system.
