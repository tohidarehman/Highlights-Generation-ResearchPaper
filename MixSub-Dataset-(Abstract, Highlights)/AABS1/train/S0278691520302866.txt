 Currently no validated animal model is predictive of human responses in ranking purified dietary proteins in the prevalence or potency of food allergy in humans . Since the gastrointestinal microbiota is thought to influence oral tolerance we hypothesize that a germ free mouse model will more accurately predict atopic human responses than conventional mice . Germ free C3H HeN mice were immunized with 60g Ara h 2 BLG or LOX by three weekly intraperitoneal injections with alum adjuvant . One week following the final immunization an IP challenge of 500g of Ara h 2 BLG or LOX was administered . Thirty minutes post challenge clinical scores were graded and body temperatures recorded . The presence of protein specific IgE and mast cell protease concentrations in mouse sera were determined using ELISA . Upon challenge germ free mice sensitized with Ara h 2 and BLG exhibited significantly more severe clinical scores compared to germ free mice immunized with LOX . Hypothermic responses in challenged mice differed between the three proteins post challenge . Results indicate that this model can differentiate between potent and non allergens based on temperature drop clinical scores and biomarkers . Additional proteins with known human exposure and allergenicity are needed to confirm the predictive accuracy .
