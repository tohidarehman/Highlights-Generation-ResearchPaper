 The trees in agroforestry plots create spatial heterogeneity of high interest for adaptation mitigation and the provision of ecosystem services . But to what distance exactly from the tree We tested a novel approach based upon geostatistics and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle sensing to infer the distance at which a single agroforestry tree affects the surrounding under crop to map yield litter and compute crop partial Land Equivalent Ratio LER

@highlight A novel method to assess the distance of influence of agroforestry trees on crops.
