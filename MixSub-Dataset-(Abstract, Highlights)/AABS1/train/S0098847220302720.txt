 Drought severely restricts global crop yield and quality . These limitations may be partially addressed through genetic engineering to improve crop drought tolerance . The HD Zip I transcription factors play important roles in the regulation of plant drought tolerance but their specific functions in the regulation of apple drought response remain unclear . In this study we found that

@highlight This study revealed the HD Zip I transcription factor
@highlight contributes to the water deficit response in transgenic apple.
@highlight Through drought stress treatments and phenotypic assessments we found that
@highlight expression enhanced the drought tolerance of apple plants.
@highlight Our results lay a foundation for further research on the mechanisms by which HD Zip I proteins promote drought tolerance.
