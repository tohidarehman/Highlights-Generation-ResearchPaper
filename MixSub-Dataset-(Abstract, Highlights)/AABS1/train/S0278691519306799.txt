 Tetramethyl bisphenol F has been shown to impart unique physical properties critical for high performance of epoxy can coatings without the estrogenic activity concerns associated with other bisphenols . To further characterize the toxicological profile of TMBPF additional endocrine related endpoints including

@highlight In separate assays TMBPF did not inhibit aromatase activity and weakly induced E2 and T synthesis.
@highlight TMBPF showed no androgenicity at any dose and equivocal anti androgenicity only at 1000 mg kg bw d by Hershberger assay.
@highlight In a 90 day study NOAELs for TMBPF were determined to be 750 and 1000 mg kg bw d in female and male rats respectively.
@highlight TMBPF has a distinct toxicological profile that generally does not correlate with some other bisphenols.
