 Intensive agricultural cultivation in hilly catchments is subject to significant environmental risks because the local terrain and exceptionally fragile ecosystem usually promote high levels of nutrient loss . In order to assess such negative effects we compared long term water quality dynamics of four ponds that are fed by runoff from agricultural hillsides with contrasting slopes and land cover near Tianmu Lake in Eastern China . Averaged total nitrogen levels in ponds increased from 7.0 mg L

@highlight Long term water quality dynamics in four contrasting pond systems were revealed.
@highlight N levels showed an increase by a factor of five once the land cover was changed.
@highlight N P loss is sensitive to the slope gradients of the cultivated hillsides.
@highlight Forests and grasslands are crucial in reducing N P loss from the hillsides.
@highlight An integrated management strategy is needed to reduce N P loss in hilly regions.
