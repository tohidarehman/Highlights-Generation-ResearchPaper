 Numerical responses of animals to habitat perturbation often seem inconsistent spreading skepticism about the predictive capacity of applied ecology . Domestic grazing changes several habitat variables that can affect seed eating birds . Birds in turn show adaptations that could allow them to overcome habitat perturbations . Here we modelled habitat variables in grazed and ungrazed habitats of the central Monte desert Argentina to detect those affected by grazing activity . There was no effect of grazing on shrub and tree cover but grazing reduced the abundance mostly of large grass seeds but also of small grass and forb seeds . Then we used models outputs and knowledge of feeding preferences of the five most common seed eating passerines in the Monte to make species specific predictions changes in abundance of grass seed specialists

@highlight We modeled the main effects of cattle grazing on vegetation variables.
@highlight And used seed preferences of birds to predict their numerical response to grazing.
@highlight Grass seed specialists responded to the reduction of large grass seeds only.
@highlight Some expanding specialists responded to the reduction of all kinds of seeds.
@highlight Natural history knowledge conciliates results often interpreted as unpredictable.
