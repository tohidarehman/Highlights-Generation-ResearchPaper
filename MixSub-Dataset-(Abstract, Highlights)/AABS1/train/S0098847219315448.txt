 The objective of this study was to characterize and compare mechanisms of drought avoidance and tolerance specifically rooting characteristics osmotic adjustment and antioxidant metabolism among different bermudagrasses . Six different bermudagrasses were grown in field and growth chamber conditions and exposed to drought treatments . A range of drought performance was observed across bermudagrass genotypes with TifTuf being only the genotype to maintain a minimum acceptable turf quality rating of 6 at the end of drought treatments under field conditions . Along with TifTuf UGB 42 and UGB 70 performed well in terms of percent green cover normalized difference vegetation index leaf water status and membrane stability in both field and growth chamber conditions indicating these three genotypes had the best drought performance in the current study . Drought tolerant bermudagrasses were able to better maintain photosynthesis and transpiration after being exposed to drought . TifTuf had 15 27 and 200 greater osmotic adjustment compared to poor performing Celebration in 2017 and 2018 field and grown chamber experiments respectively . Antioxidant enzyme activities including activities of superoxide dismutase ascorbate peroxidase peroxidase catalase and glutathione reductase were mostly greater in drought tolerant bermudagrasses . Greater antioxidant activities reduced formation of damaging H

@highlight A range of drought performance was observed in bermudagrass genotypes.
@highlight TifTuf along with UGB 42 and UGB 70 had the greatest drought performance.
@highlight Drought tolerance and avoidance mechanisms were associated with top performer.
@highlight Osmotic adjustment antioxidant metabolism and rooting were important traits.
