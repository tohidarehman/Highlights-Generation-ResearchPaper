 Increasingly limited global freshwater resources coupled with low water use efficiency increases the need for water saving irrigation technologies in agricultural production . Numerous studies have investigated the emerging water saving irrigation technology of alternate partial root zone drip irrigation on crop yield and WUE . This study investigated the effects of lower soil water thresholds for alteration of the irrigation to the previously dry root zone on tomato plant growth yield and irrigation water use efficiency under APDI in year 2016 with field plot area of 6.48 m

@highlight Alternate partial rootzone drip irrigation APDI can promote tomato yield quality.
@highlight Lower soil water threshold for alternation of irrigation LTAI affects APDI.
@highlight APDI with LTAI at 70 field water capacity is optimal for irrigation management.
