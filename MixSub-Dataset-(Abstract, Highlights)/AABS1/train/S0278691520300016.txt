 Perfluorooctanoic acid is a per and polyfluoroalkyl substance once used as a surfactant in the polymerization of chemicals . Because of its ubiquitous nature and long half life PFOA is commonly detected in the environment wildlife and humans . While skin exposure to PFOA is of concern studies evaluating the immunotoxicity of dermal exposure are lacking . These studies evaluated the immunotoxicity of PFOA following dermal exposure using a murine model . PFOA was not identified to be an irritant or sensitizer using the local lymph node assay . The IgM antibody response to sheep red blood cell . was significantly reduced in the spleen following 4 days of dermal exposure . PFOA exposure produced a significant decrease in thymus and spleen weight along with an increase in liver weight . Immune cell phenotyping identified a reduction in the frequency and number of splenic B cells . To further define the mechanism of immunotoxicity gene expression was also evaluated in the skin . The findings support a potential involvement of the nuclear receptor PPAR . These results demonstrate that dermal exposure to PFOA is immunotoxic and raise concern about potential adverse effects from dermal exposure .

@highlight Health effects related to dermal exposure to PFAS are largely unexplored.
@highlight Dermal exposure to PFOA induces immunotoxicity in a murine model.
@highlight Health outcomes of dermal exposure are comparable to oral exposure.
@highlight Exposure to PFOA alters genes involved with skin integrity.
