 The karst region in southwestern China is a typical region with fragile ecological environments and the coordination of regional agricultural development and environmental protection faces enormous challenges . Based on the soil and hydrological characteristics of karst in southwestern China this study summarized water related environmental issues caused by agricultural activities in this karst region . Agriculture in the karst hills is more likely to cause soil and nutrient losses due to the fast hydrological flow through special karst structures with high permeability . Thus this review emphasized the impacts of agricultural development on the riverine biogeochemical cycles of elements based on previous studies . Meanwhile the carbon cycle is also strongly impacted by agricultural activities in this karst region due to enhanced carbonate weathering by nitric acid from the nitrification of ammonium . This weathering mechanism represents a net source of atmospheric CO

@highlight Agriculture in karst hills is more likely to cause more soil and nutrient losses.
@highlight Karst structure might lead to fast nutrient loss and low fertilizer use efficiency.
@highlight Results suggest nutrient losses controlled by landform and climate condition.
@highlight Carbonate weathering and carbon cycle are strongly impacted by agriculture in karst regions.
@highlight Beneficial management practices should be considered for sustainable development.
