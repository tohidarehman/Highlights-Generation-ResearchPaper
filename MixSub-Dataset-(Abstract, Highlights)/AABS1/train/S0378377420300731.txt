 Maize production in semi arid areas is increasingly at risk due to limited and uneven precipitation and is further constrained by unvalidated nutrition management practices . Matching fertilization levels to regional precipitation however can ensure sustainable water use and crop productivity . From 20142017 a 4 year field experiment was performed to evaluate the effects of fertilization at five levels N 0 P

@highlight Full film mulching maintained the water balance better than half film mulching.
@highlight Full film mulching was also better at promoting maize production within four years.
@highlight We demonstrated optimal matching of fertilization and regional precipitation.
@highlight Critical water deficit values were established as a warning system.
