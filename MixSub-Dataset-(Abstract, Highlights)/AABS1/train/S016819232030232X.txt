 Agricultural systems experience numerous management associated events during the growing season that can significantly influence seasonal and annual carbon balances . Measurements of carbon fluxes from agricultural fields using micrometeorological techniques such as eddy covariance can improve our understanding of management and weather driven changes in carbon budgets . In situ carbon flux data are also valuable in developing remote sensing based models for extrapolation of biome specific carbon budgets to higher spatial scales . In this study net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange was continuously measured for two years from a cotton

@highlight Precipitation significantly affected carbon uptake and release from cotton.
@highlight High soil moisture conditions stimulated ecosystem respiration.
@highlight Off season fluxes from weeds had a significant impact on the annual carbon balance.
@highlight Growing season carbon uptake and remotely sensed vegetation index were correlated.
