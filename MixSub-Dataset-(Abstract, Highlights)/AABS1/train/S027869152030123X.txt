 Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether is an epoxy resin used for the inner coating of canned food and beverages . BADGE can easily migrate from the containers and become a contaminant . In this study we examined the effects of BADGE exposure to the dams on the behavioral structural and developmental abnormalities in the offspring . Female pregnant mice were fed with a diet containing BADGE during gestation and lactation periods . In an open field test the time spent in the corner area significantly increases in male mice of high dose BADGE group at 5 weeks old . The histological analysis using offspring brain at postnatal day 1 delivered from BADGE treated dams demonstrates that positive signals of Forkhead box P2 and COUP TF interacting protein 2 are restricted in each cortical layer but not in the control brain . In addition the maternal BADGE exposure reduces nestin positive fibers of the radial glia and T box transcription factor 2 positive intermediate progenitors in the inner subventricular zone . Furthermore a direct BADGE exposure promotes neurite outgrowth and neuronal connection in the primary cultured cortical neurons . These data suggest that maternal BADGE exposure can accelerate neuronal differentiation in fetuses and induce anxiety like behavior in juvenile mice .
