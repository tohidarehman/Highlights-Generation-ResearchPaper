 Paralytic shellfish poisoning episodes cause important economic impacts due to closure of shellfish production areas in order to protect human health . These closures if are frequent and persistent can seriously affect shellfish producers and the seafood industry among others . In this study we have developed an alternative processing method for bivalves with PSP content above the legal limit which allows reducing toxicity to acceptable levels . A modification of the PSP detoxifying procedure stablished by Decision 96 77 EC of the European Union in

@highlight An industrial protocol aimed at reducing PSP toxin levels was developed and optimized in mussels clams and scallops.
@highlight The procedure was applied to some batches of PSP contaminated molluscs obtaining 85 detoxification and a safe product.
@highlight However one sample with an exceptionally high toxicity 9000g STX diHCl equiv kg did not fall below the European limit.
@highlight An economically feasible bivalve canning processing was implemented guaranteeing the manufacture of a safe product.
