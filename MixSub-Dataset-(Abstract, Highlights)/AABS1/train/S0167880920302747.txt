 Erosion induced land degradation in the northeastern China the Chinese breadbasket has become one of the biggest risks to national food security . Apart from depleting topsoil incising gullies and waterlogging depositional sites slope scale erosion also spatially redistributes soil nutrients and introduces localized soil degradation . This requires to systematically understanding topography specific spatial distribution patterns of eroded soil compositions and the relative abundance of each nutrient at different topographic settings . In this study topsoil at predetermined space intervals were collected from two adjacent but differently curved segments on a sloped cropland in northeastern China . The spatial distributions of topsoil soil organic carbon total nitrogen total phosphorous and the variations of their atomic ratios were compared . Our results show that Compared with the nearby undisturbed tree rows the SOC and TN was halved on the investigated slope demonstrating great degradation since the land use conversion . The spatial distribution of topsoil nutrients were evidently topography specific with the SOC being comparable at slope summit but declining from 27.57 to 4.72 g kg

@highlight Soil and nutrient redistribution caused localized land degradation.
@highlight The SOC and TN were halved on the sloped cropland compared to the nearby tree rows.
@highlight Atomic ratios of C N P differed as the slope curvatures diverted.
@highlight Minor geomorphic features govern localized biochemical cycling of major nutrients.
@highlight Topography specific conservation practices must be integrated to local land use policy.
