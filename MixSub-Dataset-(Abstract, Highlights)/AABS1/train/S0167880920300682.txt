 Nitrogen deposition plays a key role in ecosystem function as one of the major N sources for natural vegetation particularly in karst agricultural areas with thin soil cover which drive the karst N fate via rainwater . To understand the seasonal and spatial variation in nitrogen deposition and to identify the major sources of nitrate in wet deposition in a karst agricultural area in southwestern China two sites with different land use were selected to assess wet and dry deposition for one year . Houzhai village is an area highly influenced by agriculture whereas Muzhu reservoir is a more pristine environment with less anthropogenic influence . Nitrogenous species and dual nitrate isotopes were analyzed . The results showed that agriculture derived NH

@highlight A high wet N deposition rate was observed in a study of a karst agricultural area.
@highlight Agriculture derived NH
@highlight  N contributed more than 55 of total wet N deposition.
@highlight Isotopic modeling showed major contributor of NO
@highlight is from farmland soil emission.
