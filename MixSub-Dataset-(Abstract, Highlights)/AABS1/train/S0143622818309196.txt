 To reduce drowning fatalities and health damage during recreational activities in coastal waters this paper proposes a dynamic risk management system . Based on the operational definition of risk management potential risks of coastal recreational activities are first identified as surfzone hydrodynamic and water quality . The safety criteria for each factor are discussed accordingly . The depth velocity product is adopted to evaluate hydrodynamic safety . Salinity is adopted as a proxy indicator which could be monitored in real time of

@highlight A dynamic risk management system was proposed to give an early alert.
@highlight Salinity is proved as a proxy indicator of
@highlight colonies.
@highlight Low cost drifter and mini wave buoy are developed for the surfzone measurement.
