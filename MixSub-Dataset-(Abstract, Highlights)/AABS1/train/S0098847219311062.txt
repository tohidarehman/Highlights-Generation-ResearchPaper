 The photosynthetic characteristics of crops under droughtflood abrupt alternation provide a foundation for the precise modeling of yield formation . However current modeling practices are largely based on single water stress conditions or continuously well watered conditions that differs considerably from the actual rice growing conditions in South China where DFAA occurs . This study aims to investigate the cumulative effects of DFAA on the photosynthetic characteristics of rice . The experiments were conducted in 2017 and 2018 and six DFAA groups with different combinations of drought and flooding were tested during the jointingheading stage of rice . Three additional treatments were also used to compare the photosynthetic characteristics of rice under different water conditions namely those under continuous well watered continuous drought and continuous flooded conditions . The results showed that there was photosynthetic inhibition after the DFAA stress followed by recovery and compensation . Interestingly two different kinds of interaction between the prior drought and the subsequent flooding were observed the antagonistic effect of the preceding drought on the subsequent flood induced photosynthetic inhibition and the synergistic effect of the subsequent flooding on the preceding drought induced photosynthetic inhibition . In addition the antagonistic effect on

@highlight There was a stomatal and photosynthetic recovery in rice after DFAA stress.
@highlight Prior drought caused an antagonistic photosynthetic effect on the later flooded rice.
@highlight Subsequent flooding damaged the photosynthesis of preceding drought rice.
@highlight The effects of DFAA on rice stomatal conductance varied with the
