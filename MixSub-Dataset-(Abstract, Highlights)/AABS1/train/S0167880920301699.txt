 A drained boreal bog with active drainage ditches and the introduction of forage grass was compared with a natural bog site to assess the effect of agricultural drainage on the photosynthetic capacity of boreal peatlands . In this study the net carbon dioxide uptake and the ecosystem respiration were measured using a pair of clear and dark chambers connected to a greenhouse gas analyzer in order to estimate the gross primary production . Environmental factors including photosynthetically active radiation peat soil temperature soil moisture electrical conductivity and water table depth and dissolved organic carbon in the soil pore water were also investigated at each site . Our results confirmed a correlation between water table depth peat soil temperature electrical conductivity and peatland productivity . Changes in electrical conductivity water table depth and peat soil temperature together explained 61 of gross primary productivity variance at our drained peatland pasture site . In general plant functional types growth forms did not have any significant difference in their GPP at the drained site except shrubs which had a significantly higher GPP at PAR level greater than 1000 mol m

@highlight The pasture had a much higher photosynthetic capacity than the bog.
@highlight Photosynthetic capacity did not vary among vegetation types at the pasture.
@highlight Photosynthetic capacity varies among microforms at the bog.
@highlight Different environmental variables regulate GPP variation at the bog and the pasture.
