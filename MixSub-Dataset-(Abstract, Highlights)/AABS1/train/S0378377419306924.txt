 Canopy water interception is an important factor in water use efficiency analysis and sprinkler based fertigation technique development . In the present study alfalfa canopy water interception and its influence factors were assessed under low wind conditions . The canopy interception capacity for three growth stages of alfalfa S

@highlight The canopy interception of alfalfa at different growth stages under two low pressure sprinklers were evaluated.
@highlight The dynamics of alfalfa canopy interception across irrigation depths were determined.
@highlight Canopy interception capacity prediction model of alfalfa was established based on growth indices.
