 Optimizing nitrogen fertilization is an integral component of maximizing crop yields while minimizing environmental harm . Aerated irrigation significantly improves the soil permeability and water productivity and is increasing in popularity . However little information is available on the effects of AI on soil characteristics crop yield and N use efficiency . The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of AI under different N fertilization rates on tomato

@highlight Aerated irrigation AI increased soil oxygen content and urease and catalase activities in the tomato field.
@highlight AI significantly increased crop N accumulation and its translocation to tomato fruit.
@highlight AI along with reduced N application rate significantly increased tomato yield and NUE compared with conventional irrigation.
