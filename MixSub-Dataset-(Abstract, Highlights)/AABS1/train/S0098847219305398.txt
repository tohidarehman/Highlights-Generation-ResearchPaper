 Flowering phenology is an important life history trait strongly influenced by the environment that directly affects plant fitness . Climate change is bringing about shifts in flowering time caused by adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity but their relative contributions and effects are poorly understood . This is especially critical in Mediterranean alpine species which experience steep environmental gradients at short distances characteristic of alpine environments and an intense summer drought period derived from the Mediterranean climate . Moreover tracking climate change through migration to higher elevations is not always possible for alpine species since many already find their optimal niche at mountain summits . In this study we aimed to determine if flowering phenology is genetically differentiated among populations inhabiting contrasting environmental conditions and ascertain if it has been subjected to past selection . This knowledge is crucial to understanding adaptation of alpine plants to current environmental gradients and to provide insight about what adaptations may be necessary to cope with future and ongoing climate warming . We used a common garden experiment to analyze genetic differentiation in phenological traits of nine populations of
