 We investigated the protective effect of silibinin on rat liver and kidney after hepatic inschemia reperfusion injury . Sixty three male Wistar type rats were subjected to I R injury of the liver . They were randomly divided into three groups Sham Control and Silibinin . The last group received intravenously silibinin . The C and Si groups were each subdivided in four subgroups according to euthanasia times . We assessed expression of caspase 3 and TUNEL assay and biochemical and histological parameters . At 240min expression of caspase 3 and TUNEL assay were statistically significantly lower in the Si compared to the C group for both liver and kidney . SGOT and SGPT were also statistically significantly lower in the Si than in the C group at all time points . Histological parameters of the liver were also improved in the Si group . Silibinin was found to exhibit a protective effect on liver and kidney after hepatic I R injury . The present results are encouraging for further studies and future clinical application .
