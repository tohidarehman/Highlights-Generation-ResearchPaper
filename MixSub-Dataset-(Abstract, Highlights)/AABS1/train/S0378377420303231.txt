 Global warming induced climatological changes limited water resources and water restrictions for agriculture during drought force producers to invest in crops more suited to the potential future climate such as drought tolerant pomegranate trees . Skilful management of limited and poorer quality water resources is critical to optimize production and fruit quality for a total farm unit and requires appropriate knowledge regarding the crop . The review focuses on irrigation methods water requirements of the crop water use efficiency and productivity and water management strategies under limited water supply .

@highlight Drip irrigation systems saved water and improved water productivity in some orchards.
@highlight Seasonal evapotranspiration ranged from 53 to 953mm for one to six year old trees.
@highlight Water deficits during flowering and fruit set may increase aril red colour.
@highlight Water deficits during ripening may improve peel juice red colour but reduce fruit weight.
@highlight Sustained deficit irrigation applying 50 ET
@highlight or less not recommended over the long term.
