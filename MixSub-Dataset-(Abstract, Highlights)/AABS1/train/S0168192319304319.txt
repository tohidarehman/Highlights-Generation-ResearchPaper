 Accurate estimation of land surface heat fluxes is critical to climate and air quality forecasting which needs an appropriate parameterization in land surface models . The benchmarking method was applied to search for the optimal combination of the physical parameterization based on Noah land surface model with multi physics options . The effect of integrated physical mechanisms on the simulation of land surface energy fluxes in a typical subtropical forest over South China is further investigated . The most sensitive process is the soil moisture threshold for evaporation while there are six processes have little or no effect on heat simulation . The optimal combination options are referred as follow prescribed table leaf area index and vegetation fraction Jarvis scheme for canopy stomatal resistance Noah soil moisture scheme SIMGM model for runoff and groundwater original Noah consistent scheme for surface layer drag coefficient and two stream applied to grid cell scheme for radiation transfer .

@highlight Expanding capabilities of Noah MP model was estimated over subtropical forest.
@highlight Nuances of land surface processes could be touched on by using benchmarking metrics.
@highlight Soil moisture threshold for transpiration is important for simulate LH SH fluxes.
