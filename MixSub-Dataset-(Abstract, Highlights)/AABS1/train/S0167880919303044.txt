 Numerous studies have documented the distribution of plant and animal communities with respect to spatial structure however relatively little is known about the involvement of spatial structures in the diversity of soil organisms such as plant parasitic nematodes . Host plants such as olive trees are of particular interest because they host a large number of PPN and have a high economic and cultural importance . In this study we investigated how different aspects of the environment and spatial structure shaped the variation of species composition and species richness of plant parasitic nematodes infesting the soil rhizosphere in 376 commercial olive orchards in the south of Spain . We used variation partitioning to assess the relative importance of the unique and shared contributions of the factors describing the environment and spatial structure . To identify sites and species of particular interest we partitioned beta diversity into local and species contributions .

@highlight We reveal new insights about the influence of environment in comparison to agricultural management on patterns diversity of PPN in olive ecosystems.
@highlight Relatively high levels of shared contributions for space and soil variables.
@highlight Effects of agricultural practices on species richness and beta diversity of PPN were less than expected.
