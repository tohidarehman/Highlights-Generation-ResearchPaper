 Elucidation of the soil erosion processes induced by extreme rainstorms provides better understanding and responding of agricultural system to global climate change . However less attention has been given to the field investigation of soil erosion in the actual event of heavy rainfall . The purpose of this study was to assess the response capacity of agricultural land use and management to the heavy rainfall on northern rocky mountain area of China . Compared with abandoned land and forest grass land the agricultural land experienced strong erosion . The erosion modulus

@highlight Agricultural land experiences strong erosion in extreme rainstorms.
@highlight Concentrated flow is the main factor causing soil erosion in the agricultural land.
@highlight Bare soil should be protected with appropriate vegetation to reduce the erosion.
@highlight Drainage measures should be built to control soil erosion on agricultural land.
@highlight Agricultural land use and managements weaken soil erosion in heavy rain event.
