 Acrylamide is a common food contaminant with neurotoxic effects that are formed in the Maillard browning reaction during the heat processing of food . Importantly pregnant women are also exposed to ACR in food during pregnancy and thus the fetus is likely affected . However the mechanisms of ACR caused neurotoxicity on human brain development are still unclear . Many recent studies employed cerebral organoids based on human embryonic stem cells for investigating human neurodevelopmental disorders and toxicity . Here we generated hESC derived cerebral organoids to evaluate the neurodevelopmental toxicity of ACR . The results indicated that exposure to ACR significantly altered the transcriptional profile increased nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 mediated gene expression induced cell apoptosis repressed neuronal differentiation and promoted tau hyperphosphorylation in cerebral organoids which may contribute to ACR induced neurodevelopmental toxicity . These results indicate that the risk of transplacental exposure of the fetus to ACR should be evaluated and pregnant mothers should limit their exposure to ACR .
