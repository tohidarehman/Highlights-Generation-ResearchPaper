 Skin contact or exposure to sensitizers often occurs as a consequence of occupational exposures wearing jewelry or use of cosmetics . However many of the known skin sensitizers or their chemical variants are also consumed orally through foods or other sources . Since oral exposure to antigenic substances can lead to tolerance consumption of sensitizers may impact the development and potency of skin sensitization especially if the sensitizer is consumed early in life prior to the first skin contact . To address this issue we have reviewed human clinical and epidemiological literature relevant to this subject and evaluated whether early oral exposures to relevant sensitizers or their chemical variants are associated with reduced prevalence of skin sensitization to three main allergic sensitizers nickel urushiols of poison ivy and sesquiterpene lactones of chrysanthemum and other plants .

@highlight Many skin sensitizers are consumed orally through foods or other sources.
@highlight Specific antigen tolerance can be induced through early oral exposure to antigen.
@highlight Developmental tolerance to nickel urushiol and sesquiterpene lactones was explored.
@highlight Associations are established between early exposure and reduced sensitization rates.
@highlight Controlled studies with specific sensitizer early life exposure are needed.
