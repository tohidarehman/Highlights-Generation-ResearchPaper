 Microphysiological systems are emerging as potentially predictive models for drug safety and toxicity assessment . To assess the utility of these systems the Food and Drug Administration partnered with Emulate to evaluate the Human Liver Organ Chip in a regulatory setting . Diglycolic acid a known hepatotoxin was evaluated in the Liver Chip and compared to a multi well plate format to assess the Liver Chip s capabilities limitations overall performance and concordance with other

@highlight Liver Chips and 24 well plates exhibited similar toxicity due to diglycolic acid exposure.
@highlight Flow of media or addition of LSECs may aid in slower toxicity seen in Liver Chips.
@highlight Liver Chip platform had high sensitivity and specificity low variability and good power.
@highlight Liver Chip and 24 well plates showed concordance with toxicity seen in
@highlight studies.
