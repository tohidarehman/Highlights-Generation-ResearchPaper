 The recent application of manufactured nanomaterials in plant protection products enhances stability of the active substance minimizes application losses reduces the quantities of a.s. increases coverage on leaf surface improves precise application etc . Besides offering benefits there is high concern about the potential risk for human and environment associated with the use of nanopesticides . In this study a panel of complementary methodologies were used to determine size distribution and chemical identification of four different formulations of nanopesticides . Measurements were performed by dynamic light scattering transmission electron microscopy asymmetric field flow fractionation multi angle light scattering gas liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry or diode array detector and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry . Results indicated average size values in the ranges 27.4148.7nm by DLS 39.182.0nm by AF4 FFF MALS and 4290nm by TEM . Linked to these nanosized particles both organic active ingredients and inorganic ones were identified . In addition the obtained data revealed that all the four PPPs contained more than 50 of particles with number size distribution between 1 and 100nm and according to the European Commission definition they can be defined as nanopesticides .

@highlight Risks of nanomaterials used in plant protection products PPPs are still unknown.
@highlight Different formulations of PPPs were analysed applying state of the art techniques in a tiered approach.
@highlight PPPs formulations contained more than 50 in number of particles smaller than 100nm.
@highlight Results provided the basis for the exposure assessment to PPPs nanoformulations.
