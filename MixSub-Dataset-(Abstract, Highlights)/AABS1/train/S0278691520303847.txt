 There are various types of hepatic steatosis of which non alcoholic fatty liver disease which may be caused by exposure to chemicals and environmental pollutants is the most prevalent representing a potential major health risk . QSAR modelling has the potential to provide a rapid and cost effective method to identify compounds which may trigger steatosis . Although models exist to predict key molecular initiating events of steatosis such as nuclear receptor binding we are aware of no models to predict the apical effect steatosis . In this study we describe the development of a QSAR model to predict steatosis using freely available machine learning tools . It was built using a dataset of 207 pharmaceuticals and pesticides which were identified as steatotic or non steatotic from existing data from
