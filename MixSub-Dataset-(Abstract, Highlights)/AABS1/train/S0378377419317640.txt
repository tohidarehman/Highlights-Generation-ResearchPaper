 Quinoa is a very versatile crop amenable to the hot agronomical conditions of the Middle East where it is cultivated under irrigation frequently using saline water . This study aims to compare different approaches for early detection of the effect of salinity on the agronomic performance of this crop . A set of 20 genotypes was grown under drip irrigation in sandy soil at the International Center for Biosaline Agriculture . The crop was established using fresh water 0.3dSm

@highlight Quinoa is a promising agricultural option in desert areas.
@highlight Heavy manuring may trigger salinity in quinoa regardless of irrigation conditions.
@highlight Ion concentrations and
@highlight N allow early diagnosis of salinity effects.
@highlight Mg
@highlight content predicted best seed yield regardless of water regime.
