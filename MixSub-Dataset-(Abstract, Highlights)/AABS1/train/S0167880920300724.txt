 Coffee is a key export commodity of East Africa but average smallholders yields are low . To guide sustainable yield improvements of smallholders coffee systems we investigated coffee yield components in three different types of coffee cropping systems along an altitude gradient during two production years . We selected 810 coffee trees distributed over 27 farms and monitored number of stems per tree fruit load per branch productive nodes per branch and number of productive branches per stem in both years . Additionally we monitored productive stems per ha coffee tree density and cherry weight in combination with pest and disease occurrence and management information from interviews . Coffee farms were classified as Coffee Open Coffee Banana or Coffee shade Tree . Coffee Banana had larger yield per ha green bean kg ha

@highlight Coffee intercropped with banana had larger yield per ha than coffee under shade trees or in open conditions.
@highlight Coffee yield components reduced when shade cover was above 30 .
@highlight Reducing number of stems per coffee tree can help to increase coffee yields.
