 This study aims to understand the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation on the regulation of carbon and nitrogen metabolites in

@highlight AM inoculation decreased the ratios of shoot root sucrose under Pb stress.
@highlight AM inoculation promoted the ability of sucrose transport under Pb stress.
@highlight AM inoculation and Pb stress stimulated the capacity of sucrose cleaving.
@highlight AM fungi may regulate minor amino acid such as cysteine to cope with Pb stress.
@highlight Sucrose content was negatively related to asparagine content.
