 The nutritive peculiarities and original distribution of 24 Chinese cowpeas cultivars achieved from Jiangxi Jilin Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces in China were evaluated . Their nutritional components were determined and nutrient characteristics were discussed . Principal component analysis was applied to classify the cowpea samples based on their nutrient composition . The results discovered that the proximate composition varied among 24 cowpeas in protein fat high level of dietary fiber and resistant starch . The total tocopherol varied from 74.20 to 187.07g g. PCA results presented that the 24 cowpeas cultivars were automatically grouped with provinces of origin indicating a relationship between nutrient composition and cultivating religion for cowpeas . The results of this study provide us the information on the nutrients characteristic of current cowpeas in China and give a guideline on cowpea cultivating optimization and processing .

@highlight Nutrient component of 24 Chinese cowpeas from four provinces are observed.
@highlight 24 cowpeas cultivars present different nutritional characteristics.
@highlight Different cowpeas can be recommended for special physiological needs.
@highlight This research provides the support for future studying functional activity of cowpea.
