 Grazing regime is the most important factor that alters nutrient cycling in grassland ecosystems . Grazing exclusion has been used for restoration of degraded natural grasslands in Northern China during past two decades while we propose that summer grazing could be a better management than grazing exclusion for this purpose . Summer grazing allows plants to resorb more nutrients in autumn thus preventing grazing induced grassland degradation while keeping grassland in production . However our understanding of grazing effects on nutrient resorption remains limited . In the present study we examined plant nitrogen and phosphorous resorption at plant species and community levels in a natural steppe grassland that had experienced contrasting summer grazing versus no grazing treatments over a 6 year period in central Inner Mongolia . Plant community nutrient resorption efficiency and resorption fluxes were estimated along with nutrient return fluxes via animal excreta and litter deposition . We found that Summer grazing at moderate intensity increased plant production but did not alter soil quality indicators such as soil organic carbon total nitrogen and total and plant available phosphorous . Summer grazing increased plant community nutrient RE as the post grazing plant re growth with elevated nutrient concentration compensated for the nutrient removal by defoliation . Summer grazing increased nitrogen RE in

@highlight We estimated plant nutrient RE under summer grazing vs. no grazing in a steppe.
@highlight Grazing effects on plant nutrient RE differ among species.
@highlight Grazing increased plant N and P resorption at community level.
@highlight Grazing did not alter nutrient resorption flux but enhanced nutrient cycling rate.
