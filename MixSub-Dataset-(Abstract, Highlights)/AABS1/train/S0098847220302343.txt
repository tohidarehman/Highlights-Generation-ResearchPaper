 Understanding the stoichiometric characteristics of plants to a substrate shift is a key step in the use of a stoichiometric framework to predict ecosystem responses to environmental change . However the response and mechanism of stoichiometry to a substrate shift in facultative epiphytes remains unknown .

@highlight Facultative epiphytes exploit rock and bark interchangeably in a Chinese karst forest.
@highlight Lithophytes were enriched in
@highlight N and Ca and depleted in Fe K and Mn.
@highlight Stoichiometry differences between two ecotypes suggested the flexibility of non organically bound elements.
@highlight A substrate shift led to foliar stoichiometry differences between two ecotypes.
