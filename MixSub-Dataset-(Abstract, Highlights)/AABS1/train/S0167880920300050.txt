 There is evidence of higher levels of pedogenic carbonate than soil organic carbon in cropland and a positive relationship between PIC and SOC in salt affected soils of arid and semi arid regions . This study is designed to test the hypothesis that PIC is influenced by intensive cropping and salinization in semi humid regions in which soil carbonate often exceeds SOC . We select a typical cropland with a maize wheat rotation in the North China Plain which covers two distinct regions i.e . the Hebei Plain under intensive cropping and the Yellow River Delta under soil salinization . Our data show large variations in soil carbon stocks with slightly higher values for PIC 3.914.5kg C m

@highlight PIC stock was significantly larger than SOC stock over 0100cm in the cropland of the North China Plain.
@highlight There was a significant positive correlation between PIC and SOC stocks.
@highlight Intensive cropping resulted in an increase in both SOC and PIC stocks in the semi humid region.
