 More frequent and severe disturbances increasingly open the forest canopy and initiate tree regeneration . Simultaneously increasing weather extremes such as drought and heat are threatening species adapted to cool and moist climate . The magnitude of the microclimatic buffering capacity of forest canopies to mitigate hot and dry weather conditions and its disturbance induced reduction remains poorly quantified . Also the influence of disturbance legacies on forest microclimate is unresolved . In a unique manipulation experiment we investigated the microclimatic buffering capacity of forest canopies in years with different climatic conditions the impacts of spatial disturbance patterns on surface light and microclimate and the effect of deadwood presence and type on microclimate .

@highlight We replicated nine disturbance treatments at five European beech dominated sites to study their effect on microclimate
@highlight The buffering capacity of forest canopies increased in warm and dry years
@highlight An increase in surface light by 10 elevated Tmax and VPDmax by 0.42C and 0.04 kPa
@highlight The presence of standing and or downed deadwood did not change the forest microclimate notably
@highlight Managers should harness the buffering capacity of closed canopies under climate change
