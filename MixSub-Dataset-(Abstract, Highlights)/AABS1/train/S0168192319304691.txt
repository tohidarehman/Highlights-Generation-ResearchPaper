 The southern hemisphere and especially Australian arid and semi arid ecosystems played a significant role in the 2011 global land carbon sink anomaly . Arid and semi arid regions occupy 70 of the Australian land surface dominated by two biomes Mulga woodlands and spinifex grasslands or savannas . We monitored carbon and water fluxes in two of these characteristic ecosystems a Mulga woodland and a

@highlight Long term monitoring of fluxes in two semi arid ecosystems with similar climate.
@highlight Water availability and air temperature were important drivers of C and water fluxes.
@highlight The previous year s rainfall affected C fluxes in both ecosystems.
@highlight The precipitation threshold was higher in a C
