 Dormancy is an evolutionary strategy to overcome adverse conditions during winter through the interruption of growth and metabolism . Winter dormancy is divided into two phases endodormancy when bud growth is inhibited internally and ecodormancy when adverse environmental conditions impede growth . The study of winter dormancy is limited because the onset and transition between the two dormancy phases do not have any visual symptoms . Therefore the goal of this study was to develop a model to predict the occurrence of the onset and release of dormancy phases and budbreak in grapevines Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay . An integrated phenological model was developed assuming that the shortening of the photoperiod induces the onset of endodormancy when a critical day length specific for each cultivar is reached . Then a period of exposure to chilling temperatures induces the transition from endodormancy to ecodormancy followed by a period of warm temperatures that forces budbreak . The model showed that Cabernet Sauvignon has a longer endodormancy period caused by the cultivar specific sensitivity to shorter photoperiods as well as a slower completion of the chilling requirements compared to Chardonnay . For both cultivars relatively high temperatures were effective for chilling accumulation . The base temperature for heat effect accumulation was the same for the two cultivars at 5.6

@highlight Bud dormancy onset was not related to the onset of fruit ripening in both cultivars.
@highlight Cabernet Sauvignon showed an earlier initiation of dormancy compared to Chardonnay.
@highlight A wide range of temperatures was effective for chilling in both cultivars.
@highlight Chardonnay required less heat accumulation causing an earlier budbreak.
@highlight The phenology model showed satisfactory accuracy for both cultivars.
