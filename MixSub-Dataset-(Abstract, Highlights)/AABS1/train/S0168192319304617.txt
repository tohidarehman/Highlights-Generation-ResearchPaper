 Spring vegetation phenology is one of the most sensitive bio indicators of the ongoing climate warming . Climate warming has substantially advanced spring phenological development and increased productivity of terrestrial ecosystems . However the relative importance of spring phenology and climatic factors on vegetation growth has not yet been thoroughly investigated . We extracted Start of Season dates using five standard methods from satellite derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data in temperate China from 1982 to 2015 and explored the spatio temporal variation in vegetation growth and its linkages to spring phenology and climatic factors . In line with previous studies we found that in temperate China spring phenology was significantly advanced on the average by 1.160.25d per decade during 19822015 . Spring and summer vegetation growth that was defined as mean value of NDVI over spring and summer respectively were significantly increased on the average by 2.610

@highlight We found advanced spring phenology to be a major reason for increased vegetation growth in temperate China.
@highlight Phenology effect on summer vegetation growth was weaker comparing to spring vegetation growth.
@highlight For vegetation growth the effect of spring phenology reduced during the growing season.
@highlight Our results suggest both climate factors and spring phenology should be considered in modeling vegetation growth.
