 Grasslands cover more than a third of the European agricultural area and are often intensively managed to support the livestock farming sector . Despite grassland intensification can greatly influence soil carbon cycling changes in soil C stocks both across years and at increasing soil depths remain difficult to quantify simultaneously . Here we measured spatial and temporal changes in soil C stocks to assess C stocks response to intensive grassland management . We measured soil C stocks in a long term nutrient fertilization experiment on permanent grassland and in 126 grassland fields distributed across 11 lowland farms in Northern Ireland which are associated with different frequencies of soil tillage . Using 45 years of data from the plot scale grassland experiment we found evidence that significant changes in soil C stocks mainly occurred in the soil top 20cm and only between extreme nutrient treatments

@highlight Grassland intensification and soil C stocks under cool and humid climate conditions.
@highlight Low response of soil C stocks to grassland intensification across years and soil depth.
@highlight 45 years of high cattle liquid manure applications increased C stocks of top soils.
@highlight No evidence of negative soil tillage effects on soil C stocks.
