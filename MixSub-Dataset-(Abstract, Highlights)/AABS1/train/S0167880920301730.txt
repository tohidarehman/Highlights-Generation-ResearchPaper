 Nitrogen and phosphorus loss in runoffs has been a serious problem in China due to the amount of chemical fertilizer currently applied to farmland . Biochar has been used as a soil amendment for increasing nutrient retention water holding capacity and crop yield . However little is known about the influence of biochar on the runoff erosion from both surface flow and subsurface flow especially in sloping regions . Experimental runoff plots were therefore set up on Entisols in a sloping farmland involving four treatments control conventional NPK fertilization optimum NPK fertilization and biochar combined with 85 of optimum NPK fertilizer . The effects of the four treatments on the runoff fluxes sediment yields and the runoff coefficients as well as the N ammonium NH

@highlight Subsurface flow was the major runoff pathway in the study sloping land.
@highlight Surface flow dominated P transport subsurface flow dominated TN and NO
@highlight transport.
@highlight Biochar and fertilizations increased subsurface flow runoff flux.
@highlight Biochar treatment showed higher P runoffs in subsurface flow than NPK fertilizations.
