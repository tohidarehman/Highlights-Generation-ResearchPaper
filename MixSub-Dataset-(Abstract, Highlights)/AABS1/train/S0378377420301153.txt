 Groundwater irrigated Boro rice is produced on 83 of the net cultivable area in North West region of Bangladesh . Falling groundwater levels in many parts of the region raised concerns about the sustainability of groundwater irrigation . It is generally accepted that in the absence of a comprehensive scientific study uncontrolled groundwater use for Boro rice cultivation leads to water wastage and low water productivity . Therefore it is crucial to know the actual field level water usage and irrigation water productivity which will help identifying options to sustain groundwater irrigation . This study provides a comprehensive account of these aspects of Boro rice cultivation based on field observations at 420 farmers plots in 201516 and 201617 seasons across seven sites in the NW region . Necessary data including land type soil type rice varieties seeding and transplanting times grain and biomass yields pump discharge and irrigation amount were recorded . Average water productivity was 0.67 kg m

@highlight Water productivity of Boro rice based on 420 farmers field data over 2 seasons.
@highlight Water used by the farmers are several times lower than general perception.
@highlight Reducing water supply to Boro rice may not have impacts on groundwater decline.
@highlight Inform policy makers to identify options for sustainable groundwater irrigation.
