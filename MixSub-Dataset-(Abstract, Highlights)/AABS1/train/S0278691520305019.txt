 Paraquat produces hippocampal neuronal cell death and cognitive dysfunctions after unique and continued exposure but the mechanisms are not understood . Primary hippocampal wildtype or APP Tau silenced cells were co treated with PQ with or without E2 N acetylcysteine NS 398 MF63 and or recombinant brain derived neurotrophic factor during one and fourteen days to studied PQ effect on prostaglandin E2 and BDNF signaling and their involvement in hyperphosphorylated Tau and amyloid beta protein formation and oxidative stress generation that lead to neuronal cell loss through estrogenic disruption as a possible mechanism of cognitive dysfunctions produced by PQ . Our results indicate that PQ overexpressed cyclooxygenase 2 that leads to an increase of PGE2 and alters the expression of EP1 3 receptor subtypes . PQ induced also a decrease of proBDNF and mature BDNF levels and altered P75

@highlight PQ induces apoptotic cell death on primary hippocampal neurons.
@highlight PQ induces cell death partially through ROS A and Tau proteins generation and dysfunction of ER PGE2 and BDNF signaling.
@highlight PQ disrupt PGE2 EP1 4 and BDNF TrkB P75
@highlight signaling trough ER signaling dysfunction.
@highlight PQ induces ROS and A and Tau proteins generation through PGE2 and BDNF signaling dysfunction.
