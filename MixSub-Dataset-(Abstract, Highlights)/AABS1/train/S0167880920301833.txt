 Many studies have focused on the responses of phenophases to warming in natural non degraded grasslands . However degraded grasslands widely distribute in the world due to climate change and overgrazing . So far a comprehensive understanding of how plant phenology responds to warming degradation and their interactions remains elusive . Here the relative effects of warming and degradation on the phenological sequences of two dominant plant species were tested using a two factorial experiment of warming and moderate degradation during three successive years . We found that WND significantly delayed the onsets of early phenophases and shortened the total activity period only for the early spring flowering

@highlight Warming alone only delayed reproductive phenophases of an early flowering species.
@highlight Moderate degradation did not affect phenophases of the two species.
@highlight Moderate degradation weakened effect of warming on reproductive phenophases.
