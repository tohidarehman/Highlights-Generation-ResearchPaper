 TLR4 induced mitigation of the BMP down regulation and activin membrane bound inhibitor and the consequent enhancement of the transforming growth factor beta profibrogenic signaling has not yet been studied in cisplatin induced hepatotoxicity . miRNA 9 and29 have been previously reported to modulate TLR4 signaling via either tempering the expression of nuclear factor kappa B p50 or downregulation of extracellular matrix genes respectively . Hence we aimed to investigate the involvement of TLR4 induced modulation of TGF receptor 1 signaling as well as the implication of miRNA 9 and 29 in CIS induced hepatotoxicity . Moreover we examined the ability of the phytochemical crocin to interact with either TLR4 or TGF R1 through a molecular docking study and subsequently explore its capability to attenuate CIS induced hepatotoxicity . CROC pretreatment ameliorated the CIS induced enhancement of TLR4 and TGF signaling and enhanced the expression of BAMBI miRNA 9 and 29 . Accordingly it may be assumed that the protective effect of CROC against CIS induce hepatotoxicity is mediated via the crosstalk of TLR4 NF Bp50 signaling and BAMBI modulation of TGF 1 activity in addition to the up regulation of miRNA 9 and 29 . These findings came in alignment with our molecular docking results emphasizing the molecular antagonistic activity of CROC in both TLR4 and TGF R1 .
