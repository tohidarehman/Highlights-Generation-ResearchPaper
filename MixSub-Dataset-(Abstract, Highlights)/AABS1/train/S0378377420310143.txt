 Water saving by agricultural virtual water trade is regarded as a new way to address water shortage and many studies have considered it at local and global scales . However the existing calculation methods do not consider how agricultural products should be produced in export and import areas without crop trade . We believe that three facts related to irrigation should be considered in water saving in agricultural VWT evaluation 1 arable land is highly restricted 2 irrigation increases crop yield significantly and 3 green water does not require cost . The role of irrigation which is important for both the export and import region is very important for determining how to cultivate crops without virtual water trade . In the case of grain VWT between Heilongjiang and Guangdong China the national blue water saving in 2010 with this consideration was 2562.1 Mm whereas the figure was 975 Mm under the existing calculation framework . Therefore there is a possibility that VWT can be used in agricultural development and water management decision making while considering the role of irrigation .

@highlight Virtual water trade has a bright future in agricultural water management due to its water saving effect.
@highlight Essential features of arable land irrigation and green water are ignored in existing water saving evaluation frameworks.
@highlight Unexpected results were obtained when the role of irrigation was considered.
@highlight Research on virtual water should be carried out in combination with the agricultural water utilization process.
