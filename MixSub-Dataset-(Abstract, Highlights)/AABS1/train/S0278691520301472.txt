 Food allergy and allergen management are important global public health issues . In 2011 the first iteration of our allergen threshold database was established based on individual NOAELs and LOAELs from oral food challenge in roughly 1750 allergic individuals . Population minimal eliciting dose distributions based on this dataset were published for 11 allergenic foods in 2014 . Systematic data collection has continued and the dataset now contains over 3400 data points . The current study provides new and updated EDp values for 14 allergenic foods and incorporates a newly developed Stacked Model Averaging statistical method for interval censored data . ED01 and ED05 values the doses at which 1 and respectively 5 of the respective allergic population would be predicted to experience any objective allergic reaction were determined . The 14 allergenic foods were cashew celery egg fish hazelnut lupine milk mustard peanut sesame shrimp soy walnut and wheat . Updated ED01 estimates ranged between 0.03mg for walnut protein and 26.2mg for shrimp protein . ED05 estimates ranged between 0.4mg for mustard protein and 280mg for shrimp protein . The ED01 and ED05 values presented here are valuable in the risk assessment and subsequent risk management of allergenic foods .

@highlight The current study provides new and updated population minimal eliciting dose EDp distributions for 14 allergenic foods.
@highlight Updated dataset increased from the previously reported 1750 allergic individuals to currently over 3400 allergic individuals.
@highlight Utilizes novel Stacked Model Averaging statistical method for interval censored data.
@highlight The results presented can be used in the risk assessment and subsequent risk management of allergenic foods.
