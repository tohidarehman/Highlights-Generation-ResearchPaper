 Smoking is an acknowledged risk factor for vascular disorders and vascular complication is a main outcome of diabetes . Hence we investigated the impact of cigarette smoke on blood vessels in diabetes postulating that smoking might aggravate diabetic vascular impairment . SpragueDawley rats were divided into four groups control cigarette smoke exposed diabetic and cigarette smoke exposed diabetic groups . Streptozotocin induced diabetic rats were exposed to cigarette smoke by inhalation at total particulate matter concentration of 200g L for 4h day 5 day week for a total of 4 weeks . Diabetes caused structural change of aorta but additional cigarette smoke exposure did not induce further alteration . Collagen a marker for fibrosis was increased in media of diabetic aorta and this increase was augmented by cigarette smoke . Cigarette smoke induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling in the diabetic group . Malondialdehyde was increased and glutathione was decreased in blood from diabetes but these effects were not exaggerated by cigarette smoke . Cigarette smoke caused NADPH oxidase 2 expression in diabetic aorta and enhanced diabetes induced NOX4 expression in aorta . Taken together cigarette smoke exposure can aggravate vascular fibrosis and induce eNOS uncoupling in diabetes under experimental condition suggesting that smoking might exacerbate diabetic vascular impairments .

@highlight Impact of cigarette smoke on the progress of diabetic vascular impairment was investigated.
@highlight Diabetes induced structural change of aorta was minimally affected by cigarette smoke exposure.
@highlight Cigarette smoke induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase eNOS uncoupling in diabetic aortas.
@highlight Cigarette smoke further enhanced diabetes caused collagen deposition in aorta.
@highlight Cigarette smoke exposure induced NADPH oxidase NOX 2 and increased NOX4 expression in diabetic aorta.
