 Irrigation contributes to enhance and sustain agricultural production in the U.S. across all aridity regimes via mitigation against interannual environmental variability . Currently a quantitative understanding of the role of irrigation in stabilizing agricultural yields is lacking limiting the realization of irrigation adoption impacts . Here we use 220 000 historical county year irrigated and rainfed yield records for the top nine U.S. crops maize

@highlight Quantified irrigations role in stabilizing U.S. agricultural yields.
@highlight Irrigation Induced Reduction in Yield Variability IIRYV computed for nine crops.
@highlight Derived from 220 000 historical records mean U.S IIRYV was 41 range 090 .
@highlight Maize and cotton demonstrated the highest and lowest IIRYV.
@highlight IIRYV increased during 19502015 for most crops albeit crop and space variation.
