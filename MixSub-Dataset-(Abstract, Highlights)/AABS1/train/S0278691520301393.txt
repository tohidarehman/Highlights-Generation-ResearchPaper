 Cyclophosphamide is one of the famous anti cancer drugs . However CP induced hepatotoxicity is a dose limiting side effect . The present study aimed to investigate the potential protective effect of geraniol the main ingredient of Palmarosa oil and rose oil against CP induced hepatotoxicity in rats . Results showed that CP provoked a marked elevation in serum levels of alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase . In addition oxidative stress was significantly boosted in CP treated rats as compared to control rats . On the other hand GOH administration attenuated CP evoked disturbances in the above mentioned parameters . Moreover histopathological aberrations in CP treated rats were significantly ameliorated in GOH treated rats . GOH markedly abrogated CP induced inflammation via decreasing the protein expression of nuclear factor kappa B inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclo oxygenase 2 as well as reducing the levels of pro inflammatory cytokines in CP treated rats . CP induced activation of MAPK p38 and JNK and diminished PPAR protein expression . GOH effectively reversed all these effects . In conclusion GOH is suggested to be a potential candidate for attenuation of CP induced hepatotoxicity . This effect is attributed to its antioxidant and anti inflammatory activities as well as modulation of MAPK and PPAR signaling pathways .

@highlight Geraniol GOH decreased levels of liver enzymes in cyclophosphamide CP treated rats.
@highlight GOH mitigated CP induced oxidative stress.
@highlight NF kB iNOS COX 2 TNF and IL 1 were diminished in GOH treated rats.
@highlight GOH increased hepatic PPAR expression in CP treated rats.
@highlight GOH abrogated p38 MAPK and JNK activation in CP treated rats.
