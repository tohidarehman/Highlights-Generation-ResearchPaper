 Applying saline water resources for irrigating croplands requires serious attentions when sustainable agriculture is considered . A two year field investigation was carried out in a drip irrigated sunflower field under six irrigation treatments including full freshwater irrigation full irrigation with diluted seawater alternate DS freshwater irrigation freshwater PRD irrigation with 25 less water than full PRD

@highlight Eco environmental issues should be considered when irrigating with diluted seawater.
@highlight Fully irrigating crops with diluted seawater caused significant yield losses.
@highlight Alternate application of fresh saline water ensured crop productivity improvement.
@highlight Partial root zone drying reduce negative impacts of diluted seawater application.
