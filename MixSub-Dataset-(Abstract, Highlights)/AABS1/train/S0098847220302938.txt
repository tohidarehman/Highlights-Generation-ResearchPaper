 While seagrass communities serve important ecological and economic purposes their health has been declining worldwide . Sediment sulfide toxicity might be an important stressor of seagrasses but isolating single variables is difficult in the field and few studies have investigated direct physiological effects . We used flow through respirometry to investigate whether sulfide affects fluxes of metabolic gases O

@highlight In response to sulfide root O
@highlight consumption in
@highlight decreased 50 .
@highlight In response to sulfide shoot photosynthesis and respiration were not affected.
@highlight The roots showed concentration dependent removal of H
@highlight S from the medium.
@highlight Root O
@highlight uptake increased with increasing shoot root mass but only without sulfide.
@highlight Root mass controls the physiological space of
@highlight across sulfide conditions.
