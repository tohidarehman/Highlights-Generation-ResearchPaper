 Sporadic and unpredictable extreme hot weather events associated with global warming have been an increasingly serious problem and are difficult to test under natural field conditions . In this study we used subtropical summer to mimic extreme hot weather under realistic field conditions to test for heat tolerance in the cold adapted emergent oil crop

@highlight Seed yield of the temperate
@highlight is reduced in subtropical area.
@highlight Subtropics adapted
@highlight were cultivated with mutant breeding.
@highlight Subtropics adapted mutants are late flowering.
@highlight Subtropics adapted mutants exhibited enhanced antioxidant and defense response.
