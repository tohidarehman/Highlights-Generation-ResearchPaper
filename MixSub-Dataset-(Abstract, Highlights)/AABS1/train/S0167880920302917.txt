 To meet growing global food demand producers are actively searching for ways tocrop yield . One way to boost yield is to reduce arthropod damage . However insecticides are becoming less effective and can have detrimental effects on human health and the environment . Learning how to harness natural pest control is one way to reduce arthropod damage to crops and avoid adverse effects of insecticide use . Therefore we examined the diets of two bat species that are likely to provide pest control services across the United States corn belt the eastern red bat

@highlight The Eastern red bat 
@highlight  and big brown bat 
@highlight  are common across the United States corn belt.
@highlight We examined the diets of both species to determine the agricultural pests they consume.
@highlight We provide new insight into the diversity of bat diets by using the recently developed ANML DNA primers.
@highlight 92 of big brown bat samples and 94 of red bat samples contained agricultural pest genera.
@highlight Individual guano sample for both bat species contained nearly two pest genera each.
