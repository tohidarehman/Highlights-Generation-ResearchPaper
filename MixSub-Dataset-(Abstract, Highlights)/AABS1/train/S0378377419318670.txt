 Precision Agriculture has been booming lately in alignment with the proposal of several surface energy balance algorithms . The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land remains one of the most validated and implemented systems worldwide . This model enables the estimation of Evapotranspiration in different vegetation settings . In Lebanon winter cereals including wheat are arguably the most important crop types as they enter directly into the Lebanese diet . Yet no recent studies were produced to estimate their water consumption particularly with the pressing global warming trend . In this paper a developed version of the open source SEBAL python script surnamed SEBAL Improved or SEBALI was proposed to estimate evapotranspiration for winter cereals in the Bekaa plain of Lebanon with missing soil related datasets . Main enhancements of SEBALI over py SEBAL concern the ability to choose a random shape for the study site the selection of Hot Cold pixels over agricultural areas only thus better selection process as well as the usage of atmospherically corrected satellite images . More importantly ET rates could be assessed in regions lacking soil related datasets due to the usage of the Water stress factor .

@highlight Proposing an ET retrieval model for regions with missing non updated datasets.
@highlight Drawing a winter cereal ET seasonal trend in a semi arid climate.
@highlight Calibrating and validating SEBALI in four different countries between 2013 and 2014.
@highlight Flux towers have best accuracies occurring at the buffered zone of 2km.
@highlight SEBALI could be implemented in any agricultural regions with high accuracy.
