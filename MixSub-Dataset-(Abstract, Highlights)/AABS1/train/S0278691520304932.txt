 Exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds during pregnancy and early development can lead to adverse developmental outcomes in offspring . One of the endpoints of concern is feminization . The present study aimed to investigate for any possible correlations with endocrine sensitive parameters in the testes of male rat offspring following dam exposure to three EDCs by assessing the expression of endocrine related genes . Dienestrol linuron flutamide as well as their binary mixtures were administered to sexually mature female rats from gestation day 6 until postnatal day 21 . Gene expression analysis of

@highlight Flutamide significantly upregulated
@highlight and
@highlight expression in rat pup testis.
@highlight Deregulation of
@highlight and
@highlight in pups correlated with feminizationfollowing FLU administration in dams.
@highlight Mixtures with flutamide revealed upregulation of
@highlight in rat testis.
@highlight Deregulation of
@highlight in rat pup testis was correlated with feminization following FLU mixture administration in dams.
