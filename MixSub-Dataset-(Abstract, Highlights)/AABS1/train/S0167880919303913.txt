 The aim of this work was to evaluate monthly the presence of pollutants especially nitrates in the Limia river and tributaries in order to evaluate the quality of surface water samples during 2018 . An isotopic analysis

@highlight 36.5 of the analysed water samples showed a very good quality.
@highlight The highest nitrate levels 25mg L were observed in the Antela lagoon area.
@highlight The main source of nitrates seems be the organic inputs through livestock waste.
@highlight A relationship between the accumulated rainfall and nitrate levels in waters was found.
@highlight Nitrates were correlated with conductivity and with alkalinity and chlorides .
