 Accurate estimates of light absorption in addition to other interactions is imperative to quantify growth productivity energy and water balance and other physiological and biophysical processes in any vegetative surface . Currently a comparative assessment of light interaction patterns across row crops is lacking especially under current levels of productivity achieved in the U.S. High Plains . Here we continuously measured canopy light balance components at high frequency to characterize transmittance reflectance fraction of intercepted PAR fraction of absorbed PAR light extinction coefficients and light use efficiency comparatively across maize soybean sorghum and winter wheat under optimal growth conditions . While maximum fAPAR was 88 96 of incoming PAR in all crops mean fAPAR varied from 82 in sorghum to 46 in winter wheat while k ranged from 0.36 to 0.48 and these differences reflect highly crop specific signatures . Conversion factors among fIPAR and fAPAR and LUE based on either component LUE

@highlight Measured high frequency PAR interaction in maize soybean sorghum and winter wheat.
@highlight Crop specific signatures were revealed in all indicators of canopy light dynamics.
@highlight Solar noon instantaneous PAR sampling approach revealed substantial errors.
@highlight LUE was 5.3 4.1 4.0 3.1 g MJ
@highlight in maize sorghum winter wheat and soybean.
@highlight Sub seasonal variability in LUE and light extinction was quantified for all crops.
