 Accurate estimation of infiltration coefficients in surface irrigation is essential for proper design reducing water losses preventing erosion and increasing water use efficiency . This study was conducted to evaluate various methods for estimating the coefficients of infiltration equations . We have selected 17 different methods with better performance based on previous studies out of many methods which have been introduced for infiltration estimation . In order to compare the methods 50 furrow data sets were selected which are different based on field and irrigation conditions . The results indicated that the performance of the infiltration estimation methods is variable because of various field conditions and required data requirements . Amongst the two point methods the Elliott and Walker method with an average Relative Error of 16 the Vatankhah et al . method between one point methods and the Multilevel Calibration method as compared with other computer based models were concluded as the most accurate methods for estimating infiltration coefficients . The sensitivity analyses indicated that variations in relative error for estimating infiltration parameters are a function of soil texture furrow length inflow discharge and field slope .

@highlight Seventeen different methods were evaluated for estimating the coefficients of infiltration equations.
@highlight Performance of each method is very variable because of various field conditions and required data requirements.
@highlight Multilevel Calibration was introduced as the best method between computer based models.
@highlight Variations in relative error for estimating infiltration parameters are a function of soil texture furrow length and slope and inflow rate.
