 Lysimeters have been used for centuries to understand hydrological cycles . Nowadays high resolution weighing lysimeters allow precise determination of the water balance components . While major efforts have been focused on the definition of appropriate methodologies for data processing in order to obtain results with high accuracy it is still unknown to what extent measurements registered by a lysimeter can reflect soil water dynamics and the transport phenomena in a defined agroecosystem . The aim of this work is to analyze temporally coherent discrepancies in the estimation of soil parameters based on time series recorded inside and outside a lysimeter installed in a volcanic ash derived soil . Continuous wavelet transforms and cross wavelet analyses were used to understand temporal differences and similarities between time series respectively . Inside and at a 2m distance from the lysimeter soil temperature volumetric water content and matric potential were measured at different depths . Despite that the Pearson s correlation between the studied time series indicated good correlations r

@highlight Time series recorded inside and outside a lysimeter presented high Pearson s correlation.
@highlight Temporal variations are unnoticed by commonly used statistics as Pearson s correlation.
@highlight Wavelet analyses are an interesting approach to identify temporal coherency patterns in soils.
@highlight A Cross wavelet approach was able to identify temporal similarities between data collected inside and outside a lysimeter.
