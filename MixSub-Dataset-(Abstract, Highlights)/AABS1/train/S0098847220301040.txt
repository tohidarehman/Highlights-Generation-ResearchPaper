 Waterlogging is one of the main causes of agricultural losses around the world and nitrate nutrition has been demonstrated to mitigate the negative effects of waterlogging in plants . Here we evaluate the effect of short and long term nitrate fertilization in waterlogged nodulated soybean plants and comprehensively examine the mechanisms underpinning nitrate fertilization and soybean tolerance against hypoxia . Waterlogging increased fermentation and oxidative stress and decreased ATP levels in the roots of soybean . Waterlogged plants that received nitrate nutrition increased the levels of nitric oxide and partially restored ATP levels . Also nitrate nutrition reduced the activity of fermentative and antioxidant enzymes as well as the fermentation substrates and reactive oxygen species in waterlogged plants . Few metabolic differences resulted from short and long term fertilization and these differences were not sufficient to impair waterlogging tolerance in soybean plants . By infiltrating roots from waterlogged plants with cPTIO we show that enhanced nitrate nutrition induced accumulation of NO in waterlogged plants proved to be a key factor for soybean tolerance against waterlogging . Increased ATP accumulation and decreased levels of ROS and toxic products derived from fermentation reactions are suggested as crucial mechanisms underpinning the tolerance of soybean plants under waterlogged conditions .
