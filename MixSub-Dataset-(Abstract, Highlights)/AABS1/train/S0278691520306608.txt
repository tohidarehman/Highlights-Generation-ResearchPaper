 Glyphosate has been banned in some herbicidal formulations . We analyse for the first time 14 marketed products in Europe where glyphosate was replaced by acetic pelargonic caprylic or capric acids or even benzalkonium chloride to be supposedly less toxic . 35 heavy metals 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and essential minerals were tested by specific mass spectrometry associated with gas chromatography or inductively coupled plasma methods in the formulations . Essential minerals do not reach toxic levels but heavy metals are found at levels up to 39mg L depending on the product and include silicon arsenic lead iron nickel and titanium . Their presence at up to several hundred times the admissible levels in water may be due to nanoparticles embedding pesticides . PAHs reach levels of 322430g L in 12 of the 14 samples for instance the carcinogen benzopyrene was detected . It was found to be present at up to several thousand times above the norm in water as was benzoanthracene . These compounds did not add significant herbicidal effects . Low levels of glyphosate were detected in 2 samples . These variable levels of undeclared toxic chemicals violate European Union rules on pesticides and may have health and environmental consequences especially when exposure is long term .

@highlight Glyphosate free herbicides are now sold due to a debate on glyphosate toxicity.
@highlight 14 formulations of these compounds have been studied by mass spectrometry.
@highlight Heavy metals are at levels up to 39mg L with Fe Ni Pb Si Ti and As.
@highlight Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons reach 322430g L in 12 pesticides studied.
@highlight Their non declared presence is discussed at legal and toxicity levels.
