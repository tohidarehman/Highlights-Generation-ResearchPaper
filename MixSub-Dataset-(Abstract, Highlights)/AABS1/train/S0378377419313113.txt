 Irrigation and fertilization play key roles in crop production . Scarcity of available water resources and low nutrient use efficiency calls for a need to improve water and nitrogen use efficiency . This study aimed to investigate the effects of different irrigation and nitrogen treatments on the growth yield irrigation water use efficiency and fertilizer N utilization of tomato plants by using pre buried soil columns in a field . The irrigation treatments included conventional drip irrigation and alternate partial root zone drip irrigation with sufficient or deficient water supply . Nitrogen fertilizer was set as high and low N input 8.30g or 4.15g

@highlight Alternate partial rootzone drip N fertigation ADI promoted root growth and yield.
@highlight ADI increased fertilizer N 
@highlight N use efficiency and IWUE.
@highlight ADI increased
@highlight N accumulation in the soil profile while decreased
@highlight N loss.
@highlight ADI has great potential in saving irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer.
