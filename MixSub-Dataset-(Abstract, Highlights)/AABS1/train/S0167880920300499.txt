 It is important to understand nutrient use efficiency based on the interaction between nutrient allocation and plant growth . This study utilized mulberry

@highlight Nutrient allocation of mulberry leaves impacted by P availability in the karst area.
@highlight Mulberry leaf development was limited by N availability at the late stage.
@highlight Plant absorbs different N species during various growth stages based on isotopes.
@highlight N was more important than P for Zn allocation in mulberry leaves under N deficiency.
