 Food additives such as titanium dioxide iron oxides and hydroxides silver and gold are highly used as colorants while silicon dioxide is generally used as anticaking in ultra processed foodstuff highly used in the Western diets . These additives contain nanosized particles and there is a rising concern since these nanoparticles could exert major adverse effects due to they are not metabolized but are accumulated in several organs . Here we analyze the evidence of gastrotoxicity hepatotoxicity and the impact of microbiota on gut brain and gut liver axis induced by E171 E172 E174 E175 and E551 and their non food grade nanosized counterparts after oral consumption . Although no studies using these food additives have been performed to evaluate neurotoxicity or alterations in animal behavior their non food grade nanosized counterparts have been associated with stress depression cognitive and eating disorders as signs of animal behavior alterations . We identified that these food additives induce gastrotoxicity hepatotoxicity and alterations in gut microbiota and most evidence points out oxidative stress as the main mechanism of toxicity however the role of oxidative stress as the main mechanism needs to be explored further .

@highlight E171 E172 E174 E175 and E551 food additives contain a fraction of nanoparticles.
@highlight E171 E172 E174 E175 and E551 are accumulated inducing gastro and hepatotoxicity.
@highlight Microbiome is altered by oral consumption of E171 E172 E174 E175 and E551.
@highlight Neurotoxicity and alterations in behavior and cognition are potentials effects.
@highlight Oxidative stress is important in their toxicity but further studies are needed.
