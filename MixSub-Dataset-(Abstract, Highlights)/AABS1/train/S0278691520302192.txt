 The resemblance of physiological traits of cell lines with their target original tissue is an important prerequisite for the choice of the

@highlight Antioxidant detoxifying cytoprotective defences of murine enterocyte cells Mode K resembles those of mouse duodenum.
@highlight Mode K mimics cytoprotective defences of human duodenum better than differentiated Caco2 DCaco2 .
@highlight Mode K cells are more responsive than DCaco2 to cytotoxic pro inflammatory effects of gliadin from bread wheat PT b .
@highlight Mode K are more susceptible to pro oxidant pro inflammatory effects triggered by PT b than to T. durum wheat PT d .
