 Soil salinization is a global problem that inhibits plant growth and limits crop production . Recretohalophyte plants secrete excess salt via salt glands thus avoiding excessive accumulation of salt within their cells and protecting themselves from salt associated damage . However the molecular mechanisms underlying salt secretion via salt glands are unclear . Here we used brefeldin A a specific inhibitor of Golgi mediated cell secretion to test whether vesicle transport participates in salt secretion in the recretohalophyte

@highlight Salt secretion of
@highlight salt glands is inhibited after treatment with BFA.
@highlight is significantly upregulated by 200 mM NaCl treatment.
@highlight After silencing of
@highlight  the salt secretion is obviously reduced.
@highlight Vesicular transport participates in salt secretion of salt glands.
