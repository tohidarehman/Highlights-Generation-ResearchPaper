 Abiotic stresses including low temperature severely affect plant yield and productivity throughout the globe . Low temperature sensing and signalling is a complex process and significantly alter morphological physiological and biochemical processes in plants . To make the plant tolerant towards cold stress it is a prerequisite to explore the regulatory hubs involved in the intricate networks of cold stress perception signalling and response in plants . In recent years several transcriptional factors have been identified and characterized from different plant species that regulate plant growth development and response towards cold stress . Besides the existence of cross talk between different transcription factors and plant response towards cold stress has been recognized . In this review an overview of the current understanding of sensing signalling and transcriptional regulation of cold stress has been provided . The review presents the current understanding of the different transcription factors involved in regulating the cluster of the cold response pathway . Additionally it reckons that new insights and focus research are required for developing resilient plant species towards low temperature for achieving agricultural sustainability and ensuring food security in the coming years .
