 As a process affecting animal communities urbanization has been the subject of numerous studies . However amphibians are still among the least studied vertebrate groups in urbanized landscapes . Generally it has been found that the process of loss of amphibian diversity is nonrandom with species from older evolutionary lines at greater risk . Regional data on amphibian assemblages in urban areas is a very useful tool for assessing how these assemblages react to changes .

@highlight We used various metrics to explore amphibian diversity in Polish cities.
@highlight On average 9.05 species were recorded per city.
@highlight The number of species was positively correlated with functional evenness followed by evolutionary distinctiveness sum and functional richness.
@highlight The most evolutionarily unique species in the study assemblages are
