 Human exposure to aluminum mainly occurs through food intake . However influences of Al on the gastrointestinal tract have been rarely reported . In particular the effect of Al on the metastasis and angiogenesis of colorectal cancer cells has not been studied . Thus we investigated the effect of Al on the metastatic proclivity using the human colorectal cancer cell line HT 29 . Cells were exposed to 116mM AlCl

@highlight Aluminum AlCl
@highlight  exposure promoted the migration and invasion ability of colorectal cancer CRC cells HT 29.
@highlight AlCl
@highlight induced epithelialmesenchymal transition EMT by modulation of EMT markers in HT 29cells.
@highlight AlCl
@highlight activated TGF Smad2 3 and increased mRNA expression of MMP 7 and 9 in HT 29cells.
@highlight AlCl
@highlight  treated HT 29cells promoted the angiogenesis of endothelial cells via increasing the secretion of VEGF.
