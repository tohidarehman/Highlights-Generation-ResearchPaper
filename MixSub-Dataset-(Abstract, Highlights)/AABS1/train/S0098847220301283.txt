 Pigeon pea the only woody legume in the world is also a medicinal food homogenous crop . At the same time the calcineurin B like proteins that mediate a variety of abiotic stress responses are largely unknown . Here we performed a bioinformatics analysis of the CBL family in pigeon pea and initially verified the function of CcCBL4 in stress resistance and secondary metabolic synthesis . CBL family genes respond to 4 C 42 C NaCl and drought stresses and we observed the chlorophyll relative water proline and soluble sugar in CcCBL4 OE were significantly higher than CK plants after stresses and the integrity of the cell membrane was better . Seven secondary metabolites were detected and we found that the p coumaric acid in OE was 1.4 fold that in CK plants but the apigenin and pterostilbene were reduced . And the expression of genes in these pathways was also confirmed changes . Altogether our work revealed a potential regulation mechanism between CcCBL proteins stress resistance and flavonoid metabolism which is conducive to enhance the adaptability of pigeon pea to the environment .
