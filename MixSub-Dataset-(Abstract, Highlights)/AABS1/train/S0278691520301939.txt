 Transporters are divided into the ABC and SLC super families mediating the cellular efflux and influx of various xenobiotic and endogenous substrates . Here an extensive literature search was performed to identify

@highlight Extensive literature review of human
@highlight transporter probe substrate variability.
@highlight Hierarchical Bayesian meta analysis to quantify inter and intra ethnic differences.
@highlight Data for variability in P gp BCRP and OATs are mostly limited to healthy adults and covered by the default kinetic UF.
@highlight Polymorphisms are more robust to study human variability in transporters kinetics compared to geographical ancestry alone.
