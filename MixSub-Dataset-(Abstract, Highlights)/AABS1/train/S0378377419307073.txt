 Irrigation and nitrogen fertilization play important roles in grain yield . However amounts supplied in excess of crop demand are responsible for water and N leaching during intensive agricultural production . A three year winter wheat

@highlight Optimal irrigation could be adjusted in variable precipitation years in Guanzhong Plain.
@highlight Maize seedling and wheat jointing stages were the sensitive phases to water deficit.
@highlight Irrigation at different crop growth stage significantly influenced N leaching and NUE.
@highlight Increasing N input led to higher WUE and lower deep percolation water.
@highlight Appropriate N rates were 140 and 240kg N ha
@highlight for maize and wheat respectively.
