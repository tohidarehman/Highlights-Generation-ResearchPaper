 T 2 toxin one member of the type A trichothecene family induces the apoptosis of human hepatocytes and murine Leydig cells as well as mitochondrial dysfunctions . In the present study we attempted to investigate whether T 2 toxin toxicity is related to mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy . We found that T 2 toxin might induce autophagy and mitophagy in TM3 cells in a concentration dependent manner . In addition T 2 toxin could induce mitochondrial dysfunction depolarization and fission concentration dependently . The inducible effects of T 2 toxin on mitophagy mitochondrial dysfunction and cell apoptosis could all be significantly reversed by autophagy inhibitor 3MA . Finally DRP 1 participated in the inducible effects of T 2 toxin on TM3 cell mitophagy mitochondrial dysfunction and cell apoptosis . In summary mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction are essential mechanisms of the toxicity induced by T 2 toxin . Thus our findings provide a rationale for further studies on selectively targeting mitophagy to improve mitochondrial dysfunction and to protect cells from T 2 toxin induced toxicity .
