 Key issues around the evaluation of risks to humans from mineral oils in food and feedstuffs are discussed . MOHs occur in food due to intentional use contamination from environmental sources and during transport processing or through migration from food contact materials . Problems in setting and enforcing human health guidelines for MOH include uncertainty around MOH toxicity and the specialist expertise needed for analysis of complex food matrices .

@highlight MOHs are complex mixtures historically characterised on physical properties not chemical structures molecular weight.
@highlight The method of choice for the routine quantification of mineral oils LC GC FID is sometimes not sufficient for the characterisation of complex food matrices.
@highlight Toxicological studies in F 344 and Sprague Dawley rats show very different sensitivities to the adverse effects of MOSH.
@highlight Differences in sensitivities between rat strains are likely due to variation in absorption and accumulation of MOSH.
@highlight Characterisation of MOH used in early toxicity studies is often poor impacting on their use for evaluating food safety.
