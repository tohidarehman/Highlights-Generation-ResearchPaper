The purpose of this study was to assess via telemedicine and using bioelectrical impedance analysis in schools the levels of adiposity and other body composition parameters of Greek adolescents in relation with their metabolic syndrome characteristics .

@highlight Telemedicine in schools identified adolescents at risk for obesity complications.
@highlight Bioelectrical impedance can discriminate adolescents with without abdominal obesity.
@highlight Waist circumference is a robust assessment tool for adolescent visceral adiposity.
@highlight Osteosarcopenic elements exist in adolescent abdominal obesity metabolic syndrome.
