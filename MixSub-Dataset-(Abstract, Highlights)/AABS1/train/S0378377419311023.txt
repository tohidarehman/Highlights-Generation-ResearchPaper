 Precise estimations of energy fluxes and evapotranspiration for cropland in arid areas with shallow groundwater are necessary but limited . There is also a need to better understand the contribution of groundwater for meeting crop water consumptive use . In this study considering the environmental conditions such as meteorological variables crop growth and water regimes energy fluxes and actual evapotranspiration
