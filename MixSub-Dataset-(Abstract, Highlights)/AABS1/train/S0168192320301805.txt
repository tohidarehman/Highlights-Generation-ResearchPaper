 Drought induced dieback episodes are globally reported among forest ecosystems but they have been understudied in scrublands . Chronically stressed individuals are supposed to be more vulnerable prior to drought which triggers death . We analyzed drought triggered dieback and mortality events affecting Mediterranean

@highlight Junipers shrub dieback and mortality triggered by drought are understudied.
@highlight We compared growth and isotopes of living vs. dead junipers in two different sites.
@highlight Growth and isotopes showed site specific patterns in living and dead junipers.
@highlight Growth was constrained by warm dry summer conditions enhancing evapotranspiration.
@highlight Growth statistics were not robust early warning signals of impending shrub death.
