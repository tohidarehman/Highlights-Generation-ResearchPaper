 In this study two accurate precise selective and sensitive methods were developed for determining aflatoxin M1 in infant formula milk using immunoaffinity column clean up followed by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection . The validated methods were used for determination of AFM1 in 29 samples of 6 different infant formula milk brands and the risk of AFM1 in infants aged zero to 6 months old was assessed using cancer risk Margin of Exposure and Hazard Index . Only one sample was contaminated with AFM1 . Although the results showed that MOE values for the mean and median exposure to AFM1 was 10 000 in infants the additional cancer risk due to mean and median exposure to AFM1 in infant 6 months were 0.00010 and 0.00012 additional cases per year per 10

@highlight Application of the methods on real infant formula milk samples.
@highlight Additional cancer risk due to mean and median exposure to AFM1 in infant 6 months were 0.00010 and 0.00012 additional cases per year per 10
@highlight individuals respectively.
@highlight HI values for the mean and median exposure to AFM1 for infants were quite below one which indicates no health concern.
@highlight Necessity of cumulative risk assessment of AFM1in infants from different provinces in IR Iran consuming infant formula milk along with milks from other sources.
