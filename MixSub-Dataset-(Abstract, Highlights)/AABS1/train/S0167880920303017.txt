 Knowledge of plant aboveground and belowground biomass allocation is fundamental for our understanding of terrestrial carbon sequestration in a changing climate . However how multiple global change factors interactively affect biomass allocation in terrestrial ecosystems remains unclear . We used meta analysis to synthesize main and interactive effects of global change factors on AGB BGB and root shoot based on 129 multiple factor studies . Elevated CO

@highlight Treatments with nitrogen addition and or irrigation markedly decreased root shoot.
@highlight The synergistic interactions were more on AGB than BGB and root shoot.
@highlight Variation of root shoot was mainly caused by AGB for trees but BGB for herbs.
