 Common manifestations of COVID 19 are respiratory and can extend from mild symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress . The severity of the illness can also extend from mild disease to life threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome . SARS CoV 2 infection can also affect the gastrointestinal tract liver and pancreatic functions leading to gastrointestinal symptoms . Moreover SARS CoV 2 can cause central and peripheral neurological manifestations affect the cardiovascular system and promote renal dysfunction . Epidemiological data have indicated that cancer patients are at a higher risk of contracting the SARS CoV 2 virus . Considering the multitude of clinical symptoms of COVID 19 the objective of the present review was to summarize their pathophysiology in previously healthy patients as well as in those with comorbidities . The present review summarizes the current though admittedly fluid knowledge on the pathophysiology and symptoms of COVID 19 infection . Although unclear issues still remain the present study contributes to a more complete understanding of the disease and may drive the direction of new research . The recognition of the severity of the clinical symptoms of COVID 19 is crucial for the specific therapeutic management of affected patients .
