 Due to the growing number of applications of cadmium oxide nanoparticles there is a concern about their potential deleterious effects . The objective of our study was to investigate the effect of CdO NPs on the immune response renal and intestine oxidative stress blood antioxidant defence renal fibrotic response bone density and mineral content . Six week old female ICR mice were exposed to CdO NPs for 6 weeks by inhalation particle size 9.82nm mass concentration 31.7g CdO m

@highlight Six week inhalation of CdO NPs resulted in significantly increased percentage of thymus CD3
@highlight CD8
@highlight cells in mice.
@highlight Significantly higher concentrations of advanced glycation end products were found in the intestine but not in the kidney.
@highlight Moderate blood reduction of the ratio of reduced glutathione and oxidized glutathione was observed in CdO exposed mice.
@highlight Significant increase was found in kidney pro fibrotic factors TGF 2 smooth muscle actin and collagen I.
@highlight In tibia ten fold higher Cd level was found while Ca P Mg and other bone parameters BMD BMC BA were not changed.
