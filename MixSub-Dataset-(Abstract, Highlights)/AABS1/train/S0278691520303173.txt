 The existing information supports the use of this material as described in this safety assessment . p Trimethylbenzyl alcohol was evaluated for genotoxicity repeated dose toxicity reproductive toxicity local respiratory toxicity phototoxicity photoallergenicity skin sensitization and environmental safety . Data show that p trimethylbenzyl alcohol is not genotoxic . The repeated dose reproductive and local respiratory toxicity endpoints were evaluated using the threshold of toxicological concern for a Cramer Class I material and the exposure to p trimethylbenzyl alcohol is below the TTC . The skin sensitization endpoint was completed using the dermal sensitization threshold for non reactive materials exposure is below the DST . The phototoxicity photoallergenicity endpoints were evaluated based on ultraviolet spectra p trimethylbenzyl alcohol is not expected to be phototoxic photoallergenic . The environmental endpoints were evaluated p trimethylbenzyl alcohol was found not to be persistent bioaccumulative and toxic as per the International Fragrance Association Environmental Standards and its risk quotients based on its current volume of use in Europe and North America are 1 .

@highlight  alpha alpha Trimethylbenzyl alcohol a safety assessment based on RIFM s criteria.
@highlight A safety assessment based on 7 human health endpoints plus environmental.
@highlight All endpoints were cleared using target data read across and or TTC.
