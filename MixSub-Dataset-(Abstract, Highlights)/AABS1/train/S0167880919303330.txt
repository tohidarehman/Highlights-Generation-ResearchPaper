 Over application of fertilizers is very common in solar greenhouse vegetable production . Therefore understanding nutrient balances and changes in soil is important for crop production and the environment . A five year consecutive monitoring was conducted to investigate the nutrient balances and changes of soil properties including soil organic matter nutrient contents pH and electrical conductivity in thirteen newly built solar greenhouses in the Loess Plateau . The average annual nutrient inputs from manure and mineral fertilizers were 1 871kg N ha

@highlight Nutrient balances and accumulations in newly built solar greenhouses were studied over five years.
@highlight High nutrient surpluses resulted in low use efficiency and high accumulations in soil profiles.
@highlight The accumulated nitrate in 02m soil profiles averaged 1814kgNha
@highlight after five years of cultivation.
@highlight Soil nutrients and EC were increased linearly with the cultivation years.
