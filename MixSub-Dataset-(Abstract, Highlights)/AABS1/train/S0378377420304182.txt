 Rice is one of the largest water consuming crops . Alternate wetting and drying is now an effective water saving practice for rice cultivation that has been widely applied across the world . AWD may increase denitrification loss . However the underlying mechanism remains unclear . This study investigated denitrifier activity abundance and community structure in the rice rhizosphere and bulk soil in response to water management at the internode elongation and flowering stages . The results revealed that at the IE stage AWD significantly increased denitrification capacity in the rhizosphere compared with continuously flooded practice . DC was significantly and positively related to electrical conductivity and the abundance of
