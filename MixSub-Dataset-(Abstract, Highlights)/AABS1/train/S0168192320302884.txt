 Forest microclimate is strongly affected by local topography and management activities as these directly alter overstory structure . In the present work we analysed the dependence of observed patterns of spatio temporal microclimatic variations on topographic canopy and management related factors . A forestry experiment was conducted in managed fir beech forests in the Dinaric Mountains which are characterized by rugged karstic terrain with numerous sinkholes . In 2012 cutting treatments representing a range in the intensity of overstory removal were performed uncut controls 50 cut of stand growing stock and 100 cut creating 0.4 ha canopy gaps . Fine scale variation in aspect and slope and its effects on microclimate was assessed by comparing central south facing and north facing within sinkhole positions . We measured microclimatic variables 0.5 m above the ground over three consecutive post treatment growing seasons . Microclimatic variables showed an increase or decrease with management intensity . Daily T

@highlight Maximum daily temperatures in cutting induced canopy gaps were up to 5.9C higher compared to closed stands.
@highlight High management intensity resulted in larger temporal variability daily and seasonal fluctuations of microclimate.
@highlight Topography within sinkhole position effects on microclimate were increased by more intensive cutting.
@highlight After the cutting south facing slopes within karst sinkholes exhibited the highest air temperatures and lowest humidity.
@highlight Microsites with extreme microclimatic conditions high VPD are likely unfavourable for typical forest plant species.
