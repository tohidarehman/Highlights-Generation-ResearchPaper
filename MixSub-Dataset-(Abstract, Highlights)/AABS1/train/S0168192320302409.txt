 In seasonally frozen soil areas voluminous meltwater forms during the melting period with frequent winds . Research on the energy and mass processes during this snow melting period and on methods for estimating the amount of meltwater needs to be further improved . In this paper a real time snow melt detector was developed to monitor the amount of meltwater and water vapor simultaneously at constant wind speeds of 3.2m s and 0m s. Based on the monitoring results we use the snow blown energy coefficient to describe the effect of wind on snow ablation and the mass coefficient to describe the meltwater proportion . Based on the law of mass conservation a formula for estimating meltwater was established with the occurrence probability of different wind speeds as the main variable . The local meltwater ratio of this study was 0.726 . Higher ambient temperatures inhibit SVS . Wind greatly increases SVS . In most cases wind can reduce the amount of meltwater . The EC under a 3.2m s wind speed was 50 150 . These research results have important significance for understanding the snow melting process and efficiently guiding agricultural irrigation and water resource development .
