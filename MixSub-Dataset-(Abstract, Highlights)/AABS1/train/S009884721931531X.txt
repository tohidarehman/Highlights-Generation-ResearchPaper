 Mitogen activated protein kinase cascade is conserved in eukaryotic organisms and plays a crucial role in signal transduction pathways related to biotic and abiotic stress responses . The current study was aimed to target at cloning structural and functional characterization of 1023bp

@highlight Functional characterization of 1023bp
@highlight gene was done from
@highlight We identified TVY and MEY as well as LKY CAY and SKY motifs at both termini.
@highlight Phylogenetic relationship revealed that
@highlight belonged to group D.
@highlight Overexpression of
@highlight gene conferred to salt tolerance here down regulation was observed at 1.0M salt concentration.
@highlight Transgenic plants were more tolerant along with better growth than non transgenic plants.
