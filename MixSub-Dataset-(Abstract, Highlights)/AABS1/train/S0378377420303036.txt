 A thorough understanding of the plant drought response mechanism and the relationships between plant functional traits and drought will help to improve the key biophysical process parameterization scheme in ecological and crop growth models . In this study a drought level evaluation indicator named water stress degree D

@highlight Water stress degree D
@highlight  was established as an evaluation index to investigate maize functional traits responses to drought.
@highlight Leaf photosynthesis is more sensitive to drought and less available to recover in rewatering during the reproductive than vegetative period.
@highlight Leaf water content WC is more sensitive to drought than photosynthesis and the response and recovery in daily sap flow rate depend on D
@highlight The drought caused reductions in leaf stalk and plant total dry matters as well as in leaf and stalk WCs are positively correlated with D
