 The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential protective role of sildenafil and tadalafil in contrast induced nephropathy by modulating oxidative stress . Thirty Wistar male rats were equally assigned into five groups sham CIN CIN sildenafil CIN tadalafil and CIN N Acetyl Cysteine as a positive control . CIN was induced by 12h dehydration and administration of indomethacin N nitro L arginine methyl ester and iopromide . Blood was drawn prior to and 24h after CIN induction for evaluating renal function and oxidative stress . In the CIN group total antioxidant capacity reduced glutathione and catalase levels were significantly decreased and protein carbonyl and thiobarbituric reactive species were significantly increased compared to the sham group . Pre Sildenafil and tadalafil pre treatment reduced CIN risk and reversed oxidative stress almost to the sham group levels . These results suggest that PDE5Is can be good candidates for preventing CIN based on their ability to modulate the oxidant antioxidant balance .

@highlight Contrast induced nephropathy is determined by disturbances in oxidant antioxidant balance.
@highlight TAC GSH and CAT levels decrease while TABRS and PROTC levels increase in CIN.
@highlight Sildenafil and tadalafil reduce CIN risk.
@highlight Sildenafil and tadalafil increase TAC GSH and CAT levels.
@highlight Sildenafil and tadalafil decrease TBARS and PROTC levels.
