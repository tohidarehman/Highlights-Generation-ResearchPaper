 The arid areas east of the Cascade Mountains in the Pacific Northwest have high irrigation water use and changing the elevation of sprinkler nozzles in these systems has been proposed as a strategy to reduce evaporative losses in order to diminish the total irrigation water demand . Validation of any structural modifications requires techniques able to identify water losses from these systems that were non productive particularly soil evaporation . In this study we quantified evaporation losses from soils under Mid Elevation Spray Application and Low Elevation Spray Application irrigation systems by using stable isotope tracers to estimate the fraction of non productive water losses i.e . the ratio of soil water evaporation to irrigation water applied

@highlight Irrigation system height did not significantly influence surface soil moisture content.
@highlight Irrigation system height did significantly influence surface soil moisture isotope ratios.
@highlight Low elevation as compared to traditional center pivot irrigation had reduced evaporation.
