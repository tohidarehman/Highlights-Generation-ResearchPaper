 To manage the potential conflict between outdoor recreation and nature conservation managers of nature areas need information to select effective interventions . For large nature areas information on visitor use is often lacking and managers often make decisions based on expert judgement . In this paper we use monitoring data gathered with GPS devices to develop a tool and derive rules of thumb managers can use to estimate the impact of management actions on visitor densities . Using a dataset of 1563 tracks from the New Forest UK we developed a random forest model and identified which landscape and environmental features account for the spatial variation in visitor densities . The random forest model shows that distance to car park distance to roads and openness are the most important factors for predicting visitor densities . The model was used as a tool to assess the impact of potential management interventions on the population of Nightjar . As developing this type of tool requires a lot of data we also derived rules of thumb and a simple algorithm that managers of other nature areas can use to estimate the impact of their interventions on visitor densities . The derived rules of thumb show that changing the location of car parks in relation to tarmac roads can help managers to reduce local visitor densities by 80 . Further research in other nature areas should verify the feasibility of these rules of thumb and the simple algorithm .

@highlight GPS data provides information to understand what drives visitor densities.
@highlight Random forest models can be used as tool to assess the impact of interventions.
@highlight Current recreational use lowers the Nightjar population by 38 in the New Forest UK.
@highlight Changing the location of car parks in relation to roads is an effective intervention.
@highlight Managers might use a simple algorithm for a first estimation of visitor densities.
