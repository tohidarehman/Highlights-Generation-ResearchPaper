 Coronavirus disease 2019 and previous pandemics have been viewed almost exclusively as virology problems with toxicology problems mostly being ignored . This perspective is not supported by the evolution of COVID 19 where the impact of real life exposures to multiple toxic stressors degrading the immune system is followed by the SARS CoV 2 virus exploiting the degraded immune system to trigger a chain of events ultimately leading to COVID 19 . This immune system degradation from multiple toxic stressors means that attribution of serious consequences from COVID 19 should be made to the virus toxic stressors nexus not to any of the nexus constituents in isolation . The leading toxic stressors are pervasive contributing to myriad chronic diseases as well as immune system degradation . They increase the likelihood for comorbidities and mortality associated with COVID 19 .

@highlight Toxicology contributions to COVID 19 are mostly ignored relative to virology contributions.
@highlight Exposure to myriad toxic substances degrades the immune system whose resulting dysfunction is then exploited by SARS CoV 2 to result in COVID 19.
@highlight Attribution of serious consequences from COVID 19 should be made to the virus toxic stressors combination nexus not to any of the nexus constituents in isolation.
@highlight Effective treatments need to address toxicology and virology interactions.
