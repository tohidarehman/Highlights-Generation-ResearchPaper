 Silver nanoparticles represent one of the most abundant biocidal nanomaterials contained in more than 30 of nano enabled consumer products and 75 of nanomedical products . The cumulative exposure of the general population may therefore reach critical and potentially hazardous levels . Due to data gaps on AgNP effects in humans it is urgent to further evaluate their possible toxicity particularly in vulnerable systems like the nervous one . As AgNPs may cross the blood brain and placental barriers this study evaluated the

@highlight This study evaluated neurotoxicity of AgNPs stabilized with different coating agents.
@highlight Murine neural stem cells mNSCs were used as cellular model.
@highlight All AgNPs exhibited significant toxicity at doses lower than 5mg Ag L.
@highlight Neurotoxic potential of AgNPs was not dependent on surface charge or coating.
