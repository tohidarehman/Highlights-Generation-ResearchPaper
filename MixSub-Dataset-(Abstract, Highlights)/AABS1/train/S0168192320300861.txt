 The Albany Thicket biome contains outstanding global biodiversity as well as the potential to achieve carbon credits associated with water efficient Crasslucean acid metabolism . Understanding the water fluxes in the AT is crucial to determining carbon sequestration rates and water use efficiency . Despite large variation in water fluxes across the AT only a few studies have been conducted in this region with their results validated against short periods of observed data . This study aims to evaluate three models of water fluxes over AT against data from an eddy covariance system active from October 2015 to May 2018 . ET was modelled using the BioGeoChemistry Management

@highlight The models BGC MAN PML and
@highlight estimated ET.
@highlight Rainfall was the most varied environmental parameter in the region.
@highlight Albany Thicket is likely to be supported by groundwater at some point .
