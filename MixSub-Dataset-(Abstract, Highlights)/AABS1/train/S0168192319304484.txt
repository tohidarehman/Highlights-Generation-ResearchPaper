 Spring phenology of plants in temperate regions has shifted earlier in response to increasing temperature . However the respective influences of daytime and nighttime warming on the changes in SOS remain poorly understood although an ongoing asymmetric diurnal warming has been observed . In this study we characterized the responses of satellite derived SOS to daily minimum temperature

@highlight Start of season SOS shows different responses to daytime and nighttime warming.
@highlight Such responses also display geographical variations from cold to warm regions.
@highlight A new phenology framework considering such responses has been proposed.
