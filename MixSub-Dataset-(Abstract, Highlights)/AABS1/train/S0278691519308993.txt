 Organic crop production has become a highly attractive way of production over the world and thus the need for robust analytical techniques for their authentication . The main aim of this study is to identify appropriate biomarkers to discriminate between organic and conventionally grown chicory . Chicory is an appreciated leafy vegetable among producers and consumers especially due to its undemanding cultivation and content of bioactive substances . Six different fertility management practices were used to produce five chicory cultivars in a glasshouse pot experiment . Analysis of bioactive compounds nitrogen assimilation multi elemental profiling and stable isotope ratio determination of carbon nitrogen and sulphur were performed to differentiate between organic and conventional production . In this study nitrogen isotopes are found to be an excellent way of identifying organically produced chicory of a different variety with the highest
