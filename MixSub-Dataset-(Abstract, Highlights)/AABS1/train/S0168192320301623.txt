 Quantifying intraspecific genetic variation and phenotypic plasticity of traits involved in drought tolerance is essential to forecast forest tree vulnerability to climate change . Tree ring analysis was applied to retrospectively assess the resistance recovery and resilience of a Mediterranean pine in the face of extreme climate episodes . We combined a dendrochronological approach with the analysis of common garden tests to disentangle genetic environment and genetic by environment effects in growth responses of 10

@highlight Resistance to and recovery from drought significantly varied among populations
@highlight Atlantic origins showed higher resistance and Mediterranean origins higher recovery
@highlight Resistance and recovery traded off among each other
@highlight Tree survival negatively correlated with resistance and positively with recovery
@highlight Climate change will differentially affect P. pinaster populations
