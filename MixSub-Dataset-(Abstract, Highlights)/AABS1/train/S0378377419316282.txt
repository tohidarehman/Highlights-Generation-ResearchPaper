 About 80 of global farmland is under rain fed conditions and most of it is prone to drought which limits crop productivity . Due to climate change drought will become more frequent and severe threatening world food security . Antitranspirants materials that reduce transpiration could potentially result in greater food production by realising more of a crops potential yield during drought . Despite antitranspirants reducing photosynthesis research has shown that they can mitigate drought stress and increase grain yield . Although this paper is not restricted to specific years part of it is a systematic review of 173 original research articles published between 2009 and 2018 . Overall the analysis suggests that interest in the potential of antitranspirants is growing . One major achievement in antitranspirant research during the past decade was establishing the optimal timing of application of the substances which is linked to reproductive processes most vulnerable to drought . Despite research evidence of the efficacy of antitranspirants in ameliorating drought stress they are not widely used for commercial arable crop production . However in fruit horticulture products with antitranspirant effects are already being used commercially for various non antitranspirant purposes . More recent research shows that with knowledge of a crop s growth stage and soil moisture antitranspirants can be a valuable option for managing drought impacts on yield in arable crops .

@highlight Increasing drought drives need for mitigation technologies.
@highlight Drought mitigation technologies include antitranspirants.
@highlight These are substances sprayed on crops to reduce transpiration.
@highlight Various antitranspirant mechanisms but all increase plant water status.
@highlight Antitranspirants applied at sensitive growth stages can improve crop yield.
