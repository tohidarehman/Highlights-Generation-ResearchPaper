 A GIS based multi criteria approach is applied in the Upper Murray River basin and Rapel River basin to project both biophysical and irrigation potential land suitability . Agricultural adaptation guidelines are then suggested in the context of agricultural expansion land use change and water management . The findings show first the orographic hydro climate patterns are the primary control over land suitability its uncertainty and sensitivity . Second the expected land suitability reduction during the 21st century will be driven primarily by catchment level irrigation potential deficits even over the declining farm level biophysical conditions . Third a distinctive functionality for flatter and steeper agricultural systems is likely to be identifiable from land suitability trajectories . Further applications should be focused on regional type studies and improvements regarding the effectiveness of expert judgement validation non linear daily dynamics and the influence of extreme climatology on land suitability .

@highlight The land suitability concept is expanded to cover biophysical and irrigation potential perspectives.
@highlight Orographic driven climate patterns are significative land suitability controls in sub alpine areas.
@highlight By 2100 irrigation potential reductions will drive such systems closer to their full water management capacity.
@highlight Knowledge transfer can be approached through different regional type land suitability trajectories.
