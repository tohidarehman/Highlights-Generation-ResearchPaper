 Waterlogging has been one of the major problems in plant cultivation worldwide . As its frequency and severity are increasing in the era of climate change waterlogging tolerance of fruit cultivars is an important factor that should be considered before plantation . In this study we investigated leaf morphological traits photosynthetic responses and plantwater relations of the two most popular apple cultivars in Korea Hongro and Fuji under long term waterlogging conditions . Experimental bi leader trees grafted on a single M.9 rootstock were subjected to two irrigation regimes for 75 days . Waterlogging stress adversely affected most of the morphological physiological and anatomical characteristics as well as the plantwater relations in both cultivars the negative effects of waterlogging were more pronounced in Hongro than in Fuji . Both cultivars experienced a significant decrease in leaf size whereas leaf length was reduced significantly in Hongro and leaf width in Fuji . Predawn leaf water potential

@highlight Waterlogging significantly reduced leaf size in both cultivars.
@highlight Photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance declined 10 days earlier in Hongro.
@highlight  stem sap flow and plant hydraulic conductance declined more in Hongro.
@highlight Lower reduction in vessel density area and diameter under waterlogging improved plantwater relation and photosynthetic performance.
@highlight Physiological and anatomical traits render Fuji more fit for cultivation in waterlogging conditions.
