 Classical biological control programs introduce primary parasitoids into new geographic regions often exposing them to existing populations of hyperparasitoids . Hyperparasitoids are frequently implicated in the failure of parasitoid biological control agents to establish and provide control of insect pests . The outcome of competition among two or more parasitoid species may be altered if the parasitoids are differentially attacked by the same hyperparasitoids . A reliable assessment of the hyperparasitoid community is needed to understand how top down trophic interactions influence the effectiveness of introduced parasitoids . We examined the diversity of hyperparasitoids attacking
