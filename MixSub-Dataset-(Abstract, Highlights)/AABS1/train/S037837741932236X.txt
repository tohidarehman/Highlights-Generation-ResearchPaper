 Soil salinization in agricultural environments is a major soil degradation process particularly in dry regions . Soil salinization puts at risk the natural ecosystem and the agricultural crops which are usually sensitive to elevated salinities . In this work a conceptual model is proposed and tested experimentally to examine the impact of root system dimension and distribution on solute transport and accumulation in the root zone . For this purpose tomatoes were grown in growing chambers under conditions of salty water irrigation . Root density salt concentration and soil water content distributions were measured and correlations between the three parameters were found for different root system sizes . Results show that confined root systems were highly salinized with a strong correlation between root location and salt distribution in the soil . Broad root systems on the other hand showed a reduction in soil bulk salinity at the root zone and that about 50 of the root system is under conditions of low salinity . The physical reasons for this observation are proposed herein and it is suggested that in the future development of crops with large root systems could be considered as another tool to cope with soil salinization .

@highlight We discuss the impact that the size of the root system may have on solute transport and distribution in the root zone.
@highlight Tomatoes were irrigated with salty water and soil salinization wetness and root distribution were measured.
@highlight Results have shown that larger and well developed root systems had favorable conditions in respect to soil salinization.
