 Nitrate is a highly concerned pollutant in global aquatic ecosystem resulting in eutrophication and water quality deterioration . As a result of the dissolved inorganic carbon fertilization effect lake ecosystem is expected to respond more sensitively to nitrogen addition in karst region than in non karst region . Identifying accurately the sources of nitrate in lake system is an important prerequisite for formulating effective strategies on reducing nitrate and restoring water ecosystem . Quantitative identification of nitrate sources to lakes in karst region is limited until now . In this study

@highlight The
@highlight N NO
@highlight and
@highlight O NO
@highlight of lake water displayed significant seasonal variations.
@highlight The average contribution of nitrate from agricultural activities reached up to 42 .
@highlight The average contributions of nitrate from precipitation and sewage were 41 and 17 respectively.
@highlight Combined use of
@highlight N 
@highlight O is a promising method of identifying nitrate sources in lake system.
@highlight Stricter measures should be taken to reduce the influences of agricultural activities on karst lake.
