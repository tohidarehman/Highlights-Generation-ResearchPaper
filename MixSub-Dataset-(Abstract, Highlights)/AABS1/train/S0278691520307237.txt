 The induction of vomiting by activation of mechanisms protecting the body against ingested toxins is not confined to natural products but can occur in response to manmade medicinal and non medicinal products such as liquid cleaning products where it is a commonly reported adverse effect of accidental ingestion . The present study examined the utility of an historic database reporting emetic effects of 98 orally administered liquid cleaning formulations studied

@highlight Constituents causing the emetic effect of ingested liquid cleaning formulations are unknown.
@highlight Recursive partitioning was used to model historic
@highlight data on 98 liquid cleaning formulations.
@highlight Emesis was positively associated with ionic strength non ionic surfactant and high alkaline pH.
@highlight The mathematical model predicted the ED
@highlight from formulation composition.
@highlight Application to product development safety and wider assessment of emetic liability is discussed.
