 The increasing extent and intensity of agricultural land use has led to an increase in the volume of agrochemicals applied to the landscape including those used to improve the nutritional quality of soils as well as those used to control undesirable species in the agroecosystem . Chemicals can disperse in the air and surface and ground water leading to exposure of non target organisms . Ruderal disturbance tolerant plants on which many flower visiting insects rely are commonly exposed to these chemicals in agroecosystems . Our research questions were 1 how does non target exposure to agrochemicals affect plant growth 2 what are the indirect effects of non target exposure to agrochemicals on flower visitation by insects We designed a two year field experiment imitating field realistic fertilizer run off and non target herbicide exposure scenarios to explore the impact of low concentrations of fertilizer and herbicide alone and in combination on communities of seven plant species including six native perennials and one non native annual commonly found in agricultural systems in Ireland

@highlight Plant growth can be affected by even very low concentrations of non target agrochemical exposure.
@highlight The size of the floral display is a primary driver of insect visitation to flowers.
@highlight Insects also change their visitation to plants exposed to agrochemical exposure independently of floral display.
@highlight Flower visiting insects visit herbicide exposed plants at a significantly lower rate in their first year of growth.
@highlight The effects of agrochemical exposure continue into the second year of growth for perennial plants.
