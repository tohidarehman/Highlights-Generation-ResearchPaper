 Measurements of turbulent energy fluxes between land surface and the atmosphere are commonly carried out applying the eddy covariance method . Nevertheless in some cases the use of a Large Aperture Scintillometer is more appropriate . We compared LAS and EC measurements of sensible heat flux

@highlight Scintillometry was compared to eddy covariance in two contrasting climate vineyards.
@highlight Roughness length of the vineyard was strongly influenced by wind direction.
@highlight Scintillometer closely matched eddy covariance measurements of sensible heat flux.
@highlight Energy balance closure was better 79 at the drier site compared to humid 64 .
@highlight Deployment of scintillometer close to roughness sublayer resulted in lower fluxes.
