 In this study the effect of Phycocyanin to ameliorate the cognitive dysfunction in experimental model of Alzheimer s disease was evaluated . Intracerebroventricular induction of Streptozotocin was done bilaterally twice in rats on alternative days . Rats were injected with Pc for 28 days daily for behavioural and cholinergic activity assessment . As the effect was only significant at 100mg kg later molecular experiments were performed using the same only . STZ induction led to increased activity of hippocampal cholinesterases and BAX and decreased activity of BCL 2 and ChAT . It enhanced TNF and NF B in rat s brain and reduced BDNF and IGF 1 levels . Dysfunctional insulin signaling and decreased gene expressions of PI3K AKT was also observed . However Pc treatment significantly prevented STZ induced increased activity of hippocampal cholinesterases and BAX as well as increased the levels of BCL 2 and ChAT . Neuroinflammation was significantly attenuated and BDNF and IGF 1 levels were upregulated . Further Pc also alleviated dysfunctional insulin signaling as evidenced by increased gene expression of IRS 1 PI3K AKT . In conclusion our study demonstrated the immense potential of Pc in attenuating STZ induced cognitive decline and it may be further explored as a therapeutic agent in managing AD .

@highlight Phycocyanin significantly attenuated Streptozotocin STZ induced behavioral and molecular alterations in rat model.
@highlight Reduced gene expression of signaling markers phosphorylated PI3K AKT 1 and INS IRS 1 were significantly enhanced.
@highlight Enhanced BDNF as well as IGF 1 levels after Phycocyanin treatment could be attributed to increased IRS 1 levels and subsequent PI3K AKT phosphorylation.
