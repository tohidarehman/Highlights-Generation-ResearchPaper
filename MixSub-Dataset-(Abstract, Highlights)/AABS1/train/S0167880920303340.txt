@highlight 4R strategy for controlling AGNPS pollution was applied in Yangtze River basin.
@highlight N and P fertilizer rate reduced by 20 and 27 without any yield loss.
@highlight More than 40 of N P in the drainage was removed by eco ditches eco ponds.
@highlight TN in the final field drainage was lower than 2 mg L during 3 out of 19 times.
@highlight TN NH
@highlight  N TP in the river decreased by 28.9 30.4 21.9 after eco restoration.
