 . 4 Methylpentanoic acid was evaluated for genotoxicity repeated dose toxicity reproductive toxicity local respiratory toxicity phototoxicity photoallergenicity skin sensitization and environmental safety . Data from read across analog 2 ethylbutyric acid show that 4 methylpentanoic acid is not expected to be genotoxic and provide a calculated margin of exposure 100 for the repeated dose toxicity and reproductive toxicity endpoints . The skin sensitization endpoint was completed using the dermal sensitization threshold for non reactive materials 900g cm

@highlight 4 Methylpentanoic acid a safety assessment based on RIFM s criteria.
@highlight A safety assessment based on 7 human health endpoints plus environmental.
@highlight All endpoints were cleared using target data read across and or TTC.
