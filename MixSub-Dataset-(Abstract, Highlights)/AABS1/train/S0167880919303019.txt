 Grazing is a key factor in grassland disturbance that affects plant biomass soil properties and carbon exchange in grasslands . The objective of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the effects of grazing on grassland ecosystems in Mongolia . To this end we developed a new method for determining the actual and quantitative livestock effects . Fenced plots were established in two nomadically grazed grasslands in Mongolia Bayan Unjuul and Baganuur and time lapse cameras were installed at the plots for photographing outside the fences every 10min . Using images collected for 3 years we counted the number of livestock animals by species and calculated grazing intensity . In addition we investigated plant biomass CO

@highlight Using time lapse images enabled us to determine quantitative grazing intensity GI .
@highlight Grazing consistently decreased aboveground biomass of grasslands.
@highlight CO2 and soil parameters declined as GI increased but increased when GI was low.
@highlight Values of GI at which the grazing effect shifted from plus to minus were obtained.
