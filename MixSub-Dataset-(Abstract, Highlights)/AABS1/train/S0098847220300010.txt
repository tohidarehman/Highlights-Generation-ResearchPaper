 Waterlogging is a serious environmental threat that limits crop growth and yield in low lying rainfed areas in many regions across the globe . Here we investigated the effects of waterlogging and subsequent re oxygenation on the physiology and biochemistry of three soybean

@highlight Soybean genotypes suppressed waterlogging stress with distinct mechanisms.
@highlight PELBR10 6000 activated the fermentative enzymes.
@highlight BMX Potncia restored metabolism to control levels at the end of the recovery.
@highlight PELBR11 6028 and PELBR11 6042 activated the antioxidant defenses in leaves.
@highlight TEC IRGA 6070 was the only genotype that did not delay flowering.
