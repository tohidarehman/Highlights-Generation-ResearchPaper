 The pickled radish can be kept at room temperature for years without spoilage . 2 6 dihydroxyacetophenone 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde and 4 hydroxyphenethyl alcohol were first found from the pickled radish . The structures of three phenolic compounds were elucidated by analysis of their nuclear magnetic resonance and high resolution electro spray ionization mass spectrometry data . All these phenolic compounds showed good free radical scavenging capacity except HBA . Both DHAP and 4 HPEA also showed high ferric reducing ability . DHAP showed good antimicrobial activity against
