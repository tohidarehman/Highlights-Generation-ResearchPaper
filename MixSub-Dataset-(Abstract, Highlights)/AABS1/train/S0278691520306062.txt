 Humans are ubiquitously exposed bisphenol A and epidemiological studies show a positive association between BPA exposure and diabetes risk but the impact of parental exposure on offspring diabetes risk in humans is unknown . Our previous studies in mice show disruption of metabolic health upon maternal BPA exposure . The current study was undertaken to determine whether exposure in fathers causes adverse metabolic consequences in offspring . Male C57BL 6J mice were exposed to BPA in the diet beginning at 5 weeks of age resulting in the following dietary exposure groups Control Lower BPA and Upper BPA . After 12 weeks of dietary exposure males were mated to control females . Mothers and offspring were maintained on the control diet . Post pubertal paternal BPA exposure did not affect offspring body weight body composition or glucose tolerance . However when fathers were exposed to BPA during gestation and lactation their female offspring displayed impaired glucose tolerance in the absence of compromised

@highlight Prolonged BPA exposure impairs glucose tolerance in male mice.
@highlight Paternal BPA exposure does not influence offspring body composition.
@highlight BPA exposure in fathers impairs glucose tolerance in female offspring.
@highlight Timing of paternal BPA exposure is a critical determinant of offspring health.
