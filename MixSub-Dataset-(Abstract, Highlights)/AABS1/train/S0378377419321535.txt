 In stone fruits the pit hardening period is usually one of slow fruit growth that is considered relatively insensitive to an imposed moderate water stress . For this reason this period is commonly employed for a first phase of reduced water input in regulated deficit irrigation strategies . However in previous studies with the Japanese plum cv . Angeleno the identification of a period of slow growth just before harvest suggested the need to reconsider the most suitable RDI strategy for this cultivar . In this 3 year study three irrigation strategies were compared Control designed to meet tree water requirements throughout the season Regulated Deficit Irrigation with two separate periods of water deficit one preharvest with no irrigation inputs during an intermediate period of fruit growth and the other postharvest with a 30 reduction of the CON inputs and Preharvest Regulated Deficit Irrigation with a single period of deficit irrigation initiated before harvesting and extended until the end of the irrigation campaign . Both deficit irrigation treatments were found to be effective at controlling tree vigor with lower trunk cross sectional area growth and pruned wood weight than in the CON treatment . Average water savings with the RDI and RDP strategies over the three years of the study were 24 and 18 respectively compared to CON with no impact on yield and no carry over effect . Fruit size in the RDP treatment was similar to the CON . The differences in fruit firmness soluble solids concentration acidity lightness hue h

@highlight We propose a new stress period for a RDI strategy in the late Japanese plum Angeleno
@highlight RDI in the long cycle Japanese plum improves water productivity without yield loss.
@highlight Pre irrigation soil water content was determinant for the response to RDI.
@highlight The RDI strategy did not modify the fruit characteristics at harvest.
