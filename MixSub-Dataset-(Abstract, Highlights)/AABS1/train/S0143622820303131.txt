 Soils have been widely transformed and degraded by human activities . The area occupied by soils that remain unmodified is decreasing while recent rural outmigration and land abandonment provide new opportunities for soil restauration across larger area.Little is known about the spatial distribution of both near natural and anthropogenically influenced soils on large scales . We here present a new methodology to assess soil naturalness across Europe combining CORINE land cover and anthropogenic diagnostic features of the World Reference Base for soils . Based on these features we defined soil naturalness groups ranging from dominantly natural to dominantly anthropogenic soils . This yielded a European soil naturalness map for the year 2018 covering 37 countries . Using the dataset resurveys we spatially assessed changes in land cover in 19902018 and used these to estimate changes in soil naturalness . On average 50.74 of the examined soil surface was classified as natural or near natural 41.66 of the surface was moderately but recognizably transformed by human activities while 4.43 of the soils were found to be strongly affected or created by human activities . Over the study period increased anthropogenic influence on soils was stated for 42745km

@highlight Land cover classes combined with soil diagnostics allows an evaluation of the grade of human impacts on soils.
@highlight Four grades of human impact on soils are distinguished and the extent of each was calculated for European countries.
@highlight Changes in human impact on soil according the changes of land cover classes were calculated.
@highlight Hot spots for increasing human impacts proved to be suburbs of capitals harbors and industrial developing regions.
@highlight Extent of decreasing human impacts exceeds the area of increasing human impacts in many of peripheral regions of Europe.
