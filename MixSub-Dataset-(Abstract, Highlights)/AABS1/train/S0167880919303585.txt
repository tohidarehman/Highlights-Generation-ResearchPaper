 Livestock grazing acts as a disturbance that alters ground level habitat structure and can shape faunal communities . Invertebrate fauna have complex responses to grazing driven by grazing induced changes to vegetation structure and may also be influenced by changes to predation pressure and prey availability . However there is a dearth of knowledge about the effects of grazing on invertebrates and research is rarely conducted across multiple orders or at multiple trophic levels . We examined the ordinal level response of a tropical savanna invertebrate assemblage to four replicated grazing treatments in two vegetation types at a long term grazing trial in northern Australia . We used overall measures of abundance order richness and the assemblage composition to compare invertebrate communities among grazing treatments and between vegetation types . Responses of individual orders were modelled in relation to microhabitat variables . At the end of the dry season in October 2014 and 2015 we sampled 25 785 invertebrates from 17 orders . Ants accounted for over 80 of all individuals captured . We found that overall invertebrate abundance was higher in the most heavily grazed treatments driven by the response of ants but assemblage composition was not significantly different among grazing treatments . Araneae Orthoptera Scolopendromorpha and Scorpiones responded to vegetation type and were associated with cover of

@highlight We captured 25 785 invertebrates from 17 orders at a cattle grazing trial.
@highlight Ants accounted for more than 80 of invertebrate captures.
@highlight Ant numbers were highest in the grazing treatments with the highest stocking rates.
@highlight Four other orders responded to vegetation type and microhabitat variables.
