 Seed flooding stress is one of the most important constraints that affects the yield and quality of soybean . However very little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying seed flooding tolerance . Hence the present study investigated the transcriptome profile in root tissues of two contrasting soybean genotypes viz . PI342618B SFT tolerant and NN86 4 SFS sensitive under seed flooding stress using RNA Seq approach . A total of 1563 and 1958 differentially expressed genes were identified in SFT tolerant and SFS sensitive respectively suggesting that the former is less affected by flooding stress . Both Gene ontology enrichment and MapMan pathway analyses revealed that response to seed flooding stress was mostly enriched in the DEGs that are involved in the cell wall antioxidant activity catalytic and transcription factor activities as well as protein metabolism and signaling . Based on gene annotation GO enrichment and protein protein interaction network analysis a total of 807 DEGs were screened from the above terms related to the stress including response to stress defense response and response to stimulus for candidate gene prediction analysis . Out of them 51 genes revealing significant opposite gene expression pattern between tolerant and sensitive genotypes along with

@highlight Pigmented seed coat genotypes SFT tolerant were found highly tolerant to seed flooding stress compared to yellow seed coat genotypes.
@highlight Based on the results of DEGs it has been reported that SFT tolerant genotype is less affected by seed flooding stress compared to the SFS sensitive.
@highlight Response to seed flooding stress was mostly enriched by the terms viz. cell wall TF antioxidant activity catalytic and transcription factor activities as well as protein metabolism and signaling.
@highlight Based on qRT PCR and sequencing analysis five genes viz. were considered as the most possible candidate genes for seed flooding but needs further validation.
