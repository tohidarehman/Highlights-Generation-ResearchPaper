 Pesticides used in agriculture to prevent yield and economic loss are a threat for the natural heritage worldwide . Finding win win solutions for pest control management in sustainable and profitable agriculture is a current yet elusive challenge for human societies . The main alternative to reduce pest damage in a sustainable manner consists in fostering natural enemies through the extensification of agricultural practices or the promotion of heterogeneous landscapes . However very few studies have analyzed the combined effects of these components on natural enemies and pests simultaneously .

@highlight Extensive management and landscape heterogeneity benefit insectivorous birds and pest control.
@highlight Abundance of insectivorous birds were poor predictors of pest abundance and damage.
@highlight Pest abundance and pest damage were relatively decoupled measures.
@highlight Colder heterogeneous sites tended to have higher pest damage.
