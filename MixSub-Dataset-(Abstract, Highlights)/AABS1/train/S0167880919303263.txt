 Continuous agriculture has led to sustainability problems linked with production decreases environmental contamination crop failure and soil degradation in many regions of the world . Crop pasture rotations are management alternatives that contribute to environmental sustainability and productive diversification . Long term experiments play a major role in evaluations of the impact of different management practices on soil quality . However the results can be misleading if the data are not adequately analyzed . A unique dataset of annual soil samples from a 55 year old LTE was used 1 to evaluate the effects of a crop pasture rotation on soil quality and crop productivity and 2 to provide robust statistical models to measure long term changes in chemical soil quality parameters . Treatments were seven rotations including CA or CPR with different proportions of pasture in the system . Soil organic carbon total nitrogen N

@highlight Oldest long term cropping system experiment in Latin America.
@highlight Significant impact of pasture integration for sustainable cropping intensification.
@highlight Punctual analysis of soil quality in long term experiments is not enough.
@highlight High soil sampling frequency in no till experiments necessary.
@highlight SOC and N
@highlight are key soil quality indicators in long term fertility studies.
