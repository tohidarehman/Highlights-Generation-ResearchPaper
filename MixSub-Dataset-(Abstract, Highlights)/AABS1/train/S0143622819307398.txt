 The level of anthropization in one of the most urbanized areas of central Chile is analyzed using a Coastal Sustainability Index . It is constructed from variables associated with driving forces acting on geomorphological units with a known level of fragility . The coastal conservation and intervention status was determined using analytical hierarchy process and frequency ratio models combined with GIS . A correlation between driving forces and a high level of sustainability indicates a high degree of conservation of these geomorphological units while a correlation between driving forces and a moderate or low level of sustainability indicates a high degree of intervention and little conservation of these natural units . It was established that 89.7 of the total area of Concn Bay presented low or moderate levels of sustainability associated with residential and industrial uses and proximity to major roads . The high sustainability areas account for only 10.3 of the total area and consist of wetlands beaches and dune fields that are under great pressure from real estate projects and various economic activities . Based on this index and the determination of areas with different sustainability levels it is possible to orient decision making in land use planning to control the driving forces in highly anthropized urbanized coastal zones in order to incorporate conservation measures for coastal ecosystems of high natural and cultural value .

@highlight The 89.7 of the total area of Concn Bay presented low or moderate sustainability.
@highlight This condition has been promoted by the urban sprawl model.
@highlight The causes are to urban land use demand proximity to roads and industries.
@highlight There is an urgent need to regulate land use through land use planning instruments.
