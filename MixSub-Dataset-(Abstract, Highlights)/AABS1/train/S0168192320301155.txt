 Vegetation canopy plays a key role in the local water balance by partitioning rainfall into interception throughfall and stemflow in dry forests . Many invasive plants have the capacity to replace native species and alter the net amount and spatial distribution of rainfall reaching the soil . In this paper we aimed to compare the rainfall partitioning for the invader
