 Sky islands are characteristic of sequential mountain valley terrain where mountains form an island archipelago rising from surrounding valleys of desert sea . At high elevations in the Madrean sky islands of the southwestern United States and Mexico mixed evergreen conifer forests occur near the latitudinal extent of their distribution . This setting provides a unique opportunity to explore the ecosystem response to warmer and drier conditions that are forecasted to become more common throughout the species range . Accordingly this work used the eddy covariance method to quantify carbon and water cycling dynamics from a Madrean sky island forest ecosystem for nine years between 2009 and 2018 . The forest functioned as net sink of carbon dioxide throughout the year which resulted in more carbon sequestration than other monitored montane forests in the continental western USA . Sustained forest activity was made possible by the combination of mild winter temperatures and a bimodal precipitation regime that delivered moisture during both summer and winter .
