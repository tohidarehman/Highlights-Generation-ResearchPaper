 High latitude boreal forests are experiencing dramatic changes in climate and hydrology . It is not clear how boreal forests will adapt to hydrological change or how stable they will be to extreme climate fluctuations and shifts in ecosystem water availability . Although there have been numerous studies in North American and European boreal forests the Siberian boreal region is underrepresented . Moreover Siberia is dominated by deciduous conifers that may have different response to shifting hydrology than boreal evergreens do . We observed evapotranspiration

@highlight Precipitation and phenology regulate pattern and partitioning of water fluxes.
@highlight Boreal forest poses larger EWA but smaller

@highlight in boreal deciduous and evergreens are comparable while their EWA and
