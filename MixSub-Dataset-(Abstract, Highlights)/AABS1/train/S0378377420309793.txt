 Olive trees are iconic to the Mediterranean landscape and in recent times have expanded to other regions across the globe that share similar climatic conditions . Olive oil production benefits from irrigation but with a changing climate and uncertainty in precipitation patterns wastewaters will likely play a larger role supplementing irrigation water requirements . However due to their relatively poor quality wastewaters present challenges for sustained long term use in olive production . Wastewaters include all effluents from municipalities agricultural drainage animal production facilities agricultural processing and industrial processes . This review focuses on potential opportunities and limitations of sustaining olive oil production in the Mediterranean region using wastewater of various sources . The primary challenges for using such wastewaters include concerns related to salinity sodicity metals and trace elements nutrients organics and pathogens . Organics and plant nutrients in the effluents are typically beneficial but depend on dosages .

@highlight Wastewaters present challenges for sustained long term use in olive production.
@highlight Organics and plant nutrients in the effluents are typically beneficial but depend on dosajes.
@highlight Soil conditions can be affected if salts and trace elements are not monitored.
@highlight Untreated wastewaters from the many industries have limited long term potential for reuse.
@highlight Health risk of table olives and olive oil is very low.
