 A new database of antimicrobial enriched chemicals for the Threshold of Toxicological Concern approach has been compiled comprising 1357 chemicals with 276 54 and 1027 substances in Cramer Classes I II and III respectively . To enrich the chemical space of the No Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level database a reference Antimicrobial Inventory was established for chemical inclusion . To this database the three existing TTC datasets were combined via robust data fusion process . From the final AM TTC Dataset the fifth percentiles were derived to be 2.7 0.43 and 0.12 mg kg bw day for Cramer Classes I II and III respectively . Considering the high percentage of AMs being Cramer Class III the thresholds are remarkably stable across various TTC datasets . Based on the AM enriched database a set of AM categories stratified across potency were developed to classify AMs beyond the capability of the conventional Cramer Tree approach . Grouping the query chemical within the AM category further distribution analyses were conducted to identify subclasses and differentiate potency . This study proposes a new framework for potential assessment of chronic toxicity made possible with the power of modern reliable databases and chemoinformatic methods .
