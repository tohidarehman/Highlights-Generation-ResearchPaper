 Future projections of climate extremes are expected to become more frequent . Parts of Europe experienced an extensive heatwave and drought during 2018 . However its impacts on terrestrial carbon cycle remain elusive . Here we investigated the vegetation responses to the heatwave and drought during 2018 based on satellite solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence and near infrared reflectance data which were used to estimate gross primary productivity . Results showed that there were no significant

@highlight The impacts of 2018 European heatwave and drought on vegetation GPP were analyzed.
@highlight At annual scale no significant reductions of GPP occurred across Europe in 2018.
@highlight Warmer spring compensated the impacts of summer heatwave on vegetation GPP.
