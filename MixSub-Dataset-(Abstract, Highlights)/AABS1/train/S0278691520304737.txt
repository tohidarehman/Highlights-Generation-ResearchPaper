 Aggregate exposure assessments using co use scenarios could provide more realistic estimations than single product exposure assessment . Co use scenarios for cosmetic products were determined from a ranking of the frequency of occurrence of co use patterns and the number of cosmetics used . We conducted aggregate exposure assessments using the co use scenarios and validated the new methodology by comparing the results to those of a receptor based aggregate exposure assessment . The aggregate exposures of diphthalate di n butyl phthalate and diethyl phthalate in cosmetics were estimated by co use scenarios for cosmetics . The co use scenario based AED increased with the number of cosmetics in the co use scenarios and was higher in female and younger groups . The major contributors in females were facial cream for DEHP nail polish for DnBP and shower cologne or perfume for DEP . The major contributors in males were body lotion for DEHP facial sunscreen for DnBP and hair styling product for DEP . The distribution of the co use scenario based AEDs displayed a similar trend to that of the receptor based AEDs with the 95th percentiles of the AED slightly underestimated in the co use scenario . The applied methodology could provide reasonable aggregate exposures with relatively few resources required .

@highlight Aggregate exposure assessments were performed using 16 cosmetic co use scenarios.
@highlight The major contributors in co use scenarios for each phthalate were determined.
@highlight The aggregate exposure dose using co use scenario showed acceptable estimation.
@highlight The co use scenarios could be assessed reasonable aggregate exposures.
