 Plant based pigments are widely present in nature they are classified depending on their chemical structure as tetrapyrroles carotenoids polyphenolic compounds and alkaloids and are extensively used in medicine food industry clothes and others . Recently they have been investigated due to their role in the areas of food processing food safety and quality packaging and nutrition . Many studies indicate a relationship between bioactive pigments and Non Communicable Diseases derived from oxidative stress . Their biological applications can help in preventing oxidative injuries in the cell caused by oxygen and nitrogen reactive species . Those pigments are easily degraded by light oxygen temperature pH conditions among others . Nanotechnology offers the possibility to protect bioactive ingredients and increase its bioavailability after oral administration . Safety to humans is the first concern for these products . In the present work we present a comprehensive outlook of the most important plant based pigments used as food colorants the principal nanotechnology systems prepared with them and the relationship of these compounds with the oxidative stress and related Non Communicable Disease .
