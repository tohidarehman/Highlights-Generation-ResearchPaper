 Drought stress is one of the major stressors for plants under climate change depressing growth through inhibition of photosynthesis and causing oxidative cell damage . It has been shown that plants can form a drought stress memory improving their performance under recurring drought stress after they have been primed by drought before . Mechanisms underlying such a drought stress memory and possible cross stress tolerance are currently unclear . We aimed to test whether previous waterlogging stress and drought stress leads to improved performance and changes in morphological photosynthetic and anti oxidative parameters under recurring drought . Therefore we repeatedly subjected

@highlight Grass plants primed by drought show improved performance under repeated drought.
@highlight Drought memory is linked to higher levels of anti oxidative enzymes and pigments.
@highlight These higher levels are kept over several weeks after recovery from pre stress.
@highlight Plants previously subjected to high water levels are most vulnerable towards drought.
