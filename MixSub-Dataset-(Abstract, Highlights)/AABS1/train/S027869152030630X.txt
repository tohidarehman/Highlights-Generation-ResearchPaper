 3 chlorpropane 1 2 diol is a heat induced food process contaminant that threatens human health . As the primary target organ the morphological and functional impairment of kidney and the related mechanism such as apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction were observed . However the precise molecular mechanism remains largely unclear . This study aimed to explore the important role of mitochondrial fission and autophagy in the 3 MCPD caused apoptosis of human embryonic kidney 293 cells . The results showed that blockage of dynamin related protein 1 by mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 apparently restored 3 MCPD induced mitochondrial dysfunction accompanied by prevented the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP depletion and suppressed the occurrence of autophagy . Induction of autophagy occurred following 2.510mM 3 MCPD treatment for 24h via AMPK mediated mTOR signaling pathway . Meanwhile enhancement of autophagy by pretreatment with rapamycin alleviated the loss of cell viability and apoptosis induced by 3 MCPD whereas suppression of autophagy by 3 methyladenine further accelerated apoptosis which was modulated through the mitochondria dependent apoptotic pathway . Taking together this study provides novel insights into the 3 MCPD induced apoptosis in HEK293 cells and reveals that autophagy has potential as an effective intervention strategy for the treatment of 3 MCPD induced nephrotoxicity .
