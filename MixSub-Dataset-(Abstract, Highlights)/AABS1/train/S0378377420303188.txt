 Water scarcity has become a salient problem in southern New Mexico . A combination of drought and a decrease in surface water for irrigation encouraged to search for other sources of water . Desalination of brackish groundwater using reverse osmosis results in a highly salty water or RO concentrate . In this study impacts of using BGW and RO concentrate for irrigating pecan trees inside a greenhouse were evaluated . The objective was to determine if pecan trees are suitable for irrigation with BGW and RO concentrate and evaluate the possible effects on pecan growth and physiological parameters . For each of two growing seasons three irrigation treatments of 0.8 4.0 and 8.0 ds m were applied every 14 days for 8 months . Four year old pecan trees were planted in pots filled with sandy loam soil . Response variables included plant height and diameter as well as physiological data including photosynthetic rate chlorophyll content transpiration rate stomatal conductance stem water potential and leaf ions concentrations . Net pecan growth was 2.75 cm less in RO concentrate irrigated pots than control by the end of the second season . Plants irrigated with RO had the lowest chlorophyll content and the lowest stem water potential . Na

@highlight Decline in water quality and quantity is a challenge for arid areas.
@highlight Pecan growth and physiology was studied under irrigation water salinity gradient.
@highlight Irrigation with RO decreased chlorophyll content and increased sodium and chloride accumulation in leaves.
@highlight Continuous long term irrigation with saline water not suitable for pecan.
