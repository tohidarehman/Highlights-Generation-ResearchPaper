 Phenology is an important indicator of the biological responses to climate change and previous studies have reported divergent phenological responses of grasslands in Inner Mongolia from the analyses of in situ measurements and satellite observations thus robust phenology models are required to understand and simulate the relationship between ecosystems and climate change . However phenology models for natural grasslands in which heating accumulation chilling requirements precipitation effects and other climate factors are introduced at the same time are relatively deficient as a result the accuracy of the herbaceous plant phenology model and its universality across different species and regions are restricted . We proposed an improved phenology model that reflects the combined effect of temperature and precipitation at the forcing unit level . Green up evaluation based on satellite observations shows that the UMPD phenology model achieves better accuracy than previous models and the simulated spatial distribution of green up date change is more consistent with the ground observation which means that the inclusion of the precipitation driving effect in the temperature based phenology model improves model applicability at a regional scale and under complex climatic conditions . Based on the UMPD model and its parameters spatial and temporal changes in green up dates for
