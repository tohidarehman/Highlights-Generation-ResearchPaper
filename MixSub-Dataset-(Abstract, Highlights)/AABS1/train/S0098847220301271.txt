 Physiological effects of irrigation frequency at the same irrigation volume have received little attention but might determine crop yield and water use efficiency . Potted plants of two species tomato and basil received two irrigation treatments that both supplied the same irrigation volume but either frequently or infrequently . Stem diameter variations whole plant gas exchange root and leaf water potential and foliar hormones were monitored for 11 days after applying the treatments and whole plant biomass accumulation determined at the end of that period . Treatments showed temporal and spatial differences in soil moisture with FDI resulting in a wet upper layer and dry lower layer . In both species water stress integral in IDI was three fold higher than in FDI and gas exchange lower than FDI plants . Despite these differences both treatments accumulated biomass and stem diameter growth similarly . In tomato IDI induced compensatory stem growth after re watering and attenuated hormone accumulation that maintained growth . In basil stem growth of IDI plants only recovered to WW and FDI levels upon re watering but lower sensitivity of stem growth to water deficits explained similar final biomass accumulation to FDI plants . Although both deficit irrigation treatments showed similar cumulative growth temporal differences in physiological responses suggest that irrigation frequency could be tailored to specific crop species depending on their sensitivity to soil water deficits and re hydration .

@highlight Irrigation volume but not frequency determined biomass growth.
@highlight High deficit irrigation frequency increased plant water status and gas exchange.
@highlight Attenuated growth responses to water deficit explained lack of differences in basil.
@highlight High deficit irrigation frequency changed foliar hormone levels of tomato.
@highlight Low deficit irrigation frequency caused compensatory growth after rewatering tomato.
