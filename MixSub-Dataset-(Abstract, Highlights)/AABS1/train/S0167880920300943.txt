 Agricultural areas make up over one third of the worlds terrestrial area with past and ongoing agricultural land use change and intensification being a major threat to many animal populations . In Europe maize grown for biofuel and fodder is increasingly replacing traditional crop types which might affect wildlife populations . Here we used spotlight counts to estimate densities of the European hare

@highlight Maize replaces traditional crop types potentially affecting wildlife populations.
@highlight Hare density decreased with increasing maize cover.
@highlight Other vegetation habitat heterogeneity and predators did not affect hare numbers.
@highlight Incentivizing maize cultivation likely has adverse effects on animal populations.
