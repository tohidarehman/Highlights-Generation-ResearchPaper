 Homeodomain leucine zipper is a plant specific transcription factor family that in particularly important in plant development and stress tolerance . Our previous studies identified a cotton

@highlight The overexpression of
@highlight in cotton and
@highlight resulted in a decreased sensitiveness to ABA and decreased salt drought tolerance by suppressing the expression of ABA responsive genes and stress related genes 
@highlight and
@highlight  . Down expression of
@highlight increases the tolerance to abiotic stress in cotton.
@highlight cooperated with other transcription factors kinases and enzymes to regulate plant development and abiotic stress tolerance.
@highlight There was an expansion of
@highlight homologous genes in
@highlight  and the homoeologous gene pairs showed biased A subgenome or
@highlight  subgenome expression.
