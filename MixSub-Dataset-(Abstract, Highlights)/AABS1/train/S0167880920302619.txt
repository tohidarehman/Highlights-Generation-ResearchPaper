 Livestock derived phosphorus loading values are largely based on studies performed in small experimental fields leading to uncertainties when applying the results at larger scale . This five year study estimated annual loads of P nitrogen dissolved organic carbon and total suspended solids in a small 3.2km

@highlight Intensive livestock production system was studied under boreal conditions.
@highlight Average annual TP load from an agricultural sub catchment representing grass based livestock production was 1.0kgPha
@highlight A large proportion of TP was exported as DRP hampering future water protection.
@highlight Point source pollution can markedly increase TP load.
@highlight In the agricultural sub catchment relationship of TP to DOC was stronger than TP to TSS in most monitoring years.
