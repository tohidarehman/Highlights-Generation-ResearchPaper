 The Common Land Model has been widely used to estimate carbon and water fluxes at site or regional scales but the model is still underperforming in dryland ecosystems . Our research focuses on the joint analysis of both modifying the model process and using parameter optimization techniques to improve the model s performance in a semi arid grassland ecosystem in Xinjiang China . The study presents a comparison of the simulated carbon and water fluxes by replacing the root water uptake function of the CoLM and by using particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize the most sensitive parameters . Prior to PSO the method of Morris one factor at a time is utilized to screen out parameters that have strong effects on gross primary production and latent heat flux in CoLM . Either modifying the root water uptake process in the CoLM or optimizing model parameters can significantly reduce the biases of the simulated GPP LE and water use efficiency . The coefficient of determination R

@highlight Model s sensitive parameters vary with the refinement of the model process 
@highlight Both process refinement and parameter optimization improve the model performance 
@highlight Refinement of model process contribute more to improve the model s ability.
