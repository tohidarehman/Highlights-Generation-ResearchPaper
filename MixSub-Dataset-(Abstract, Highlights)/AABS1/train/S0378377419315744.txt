 Intensive agricultural activities especially in artificially drained agricultural landscapes generate a considerable amount of nutrient export which has been identified as a primary cause of water quality impairment . Several management practices have been developed and installed in agricultural watersheds to reduce nutrient export e.g . nitrate nitrogen NO

@highlight Our high frequency measuring system captured the rapidly changing nitrate concentration drainage flow relationships in a drained field.
@highlight High frequency measurements indicate that the top 10 of drainage flow generated more than 50 of nitrate export from the field.
@highlight The application of animal wastewater was the most influential factor that affected the internal hydro biochemical processes.
