 Time series of stem diameter variations recorded by dendrometers are composed of two components irreversible radial stem growth and reversible stem shrinking and swelling caused by dynamics in water storage in elastic tissues outside the cambium . However SDVs measured over dead outer bark could also be affected by absorption and evaporation of water from remaining dead bark layers after smoothing the stem surface to properly mount dendrometers . Therefore the focus of this study was to determine the influence of hygroscopicity of a thin dead outer bark layer on the reversible component of dendrometer records of Scots pine

@highlight Dead outer bark periderm is a highly hygroscopic tissue
@highlight Reversible stem diameter variations SDVs are affected by bark hygroscopicity B
@highlight Relative air humidity is closely related to SDVs of dead and living Scots pine trees
@highlight affects detection of environmental drivers of SDVs and radial stem growth
