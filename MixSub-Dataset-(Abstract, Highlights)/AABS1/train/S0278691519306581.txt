 Pyrrolizidine alkaloid forming plants are found worldwide and may contaminate food products at levels being of concern for human health . Due to the high biodiversity of PA producing plants many different types of PA structures are formed . PAs themselves are not toxic but require metabolic activation to exert toxicity .

@highlight The
@highlight metabolism of 22PA with human and rat liver microsomes was investigated.
@highlight Species specific differences in degradation rates were obtained for monoesters.
@highlight Both species showed similar levels of formed DHP glutathione conjugates.
@highlight DHP glutathione conjugates have been detected mainly for PA diesters but not for monoesters.
