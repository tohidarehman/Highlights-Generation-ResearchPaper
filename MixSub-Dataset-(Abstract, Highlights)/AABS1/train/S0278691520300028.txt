 The physicochemical properties and hepatoprotective effects of fish scales peptides and the glycated peptides conjugated with xylose via Maillard reaction were investigated . Results showed that the FSP was rich in oligopeptides within 210 amino acids the degree of grafting of FSP MRPs was 52.971.58 and the antioxidant activities

@highlight FSP MRPs formed by fish scales peptides and xylose were firstly investigated.
@highlight FSP MRPs showed improvement in antioxidant activities
@highlight FSP MRPs showed significant hepatoprotective effects
@highlight FSP MRPs could be used as a potential functional ingredient in food industry.
