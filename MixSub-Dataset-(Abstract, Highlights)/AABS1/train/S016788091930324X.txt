 Crop production intensification often leads to the structural simplification of production systems . This structural simplification is expected to have strong impacts on biodiversity and the provisioning of ecosystem services but information about this topic is scarce . For instance no information exists for Mediterranean olive

@highlight Crop production intensification entails the structural simplification of olive groves.
@highlight Structural simplification impacts the activity levels of bats but not those of the olive pest
@highlight Bat mediated biocontrol services within olive groves can be compromised with decreasing structural complexity.
@highlight Agri environmental schemes targeted at this culture should consider these deleterious impacts.
