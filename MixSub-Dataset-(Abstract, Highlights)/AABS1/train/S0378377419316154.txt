 Nutrients and water are major factors that affect corn production and resource use efficiency as well as the soil water storage and WUE in dryland cultivation regions . The development of water saving cultivation practices is essential instead of relying on irrigation resources . However the interactive effects of cultivation practices and nitrogen application for maize crop in semi arid regions have not yet been clear . Therefore in 2015 and 2016 we studied the interactive effect of three cultivation practices furrow planting with soil crust ridges traditional cultivation under three different nitrogen rates 300 200 and 100kg ha

@highlight Exploiting crop productivity through co benefit of cultivation patterns and fertilization.
@highlight Adopting ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting system can reduce ET and improve WUE and NUE.
@highlight Fertilization had positive effect on improve yield and N accumulation.
@highlight N rate 200kg ha
@highlight was the best choice for the economic benefit under the ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting system.
