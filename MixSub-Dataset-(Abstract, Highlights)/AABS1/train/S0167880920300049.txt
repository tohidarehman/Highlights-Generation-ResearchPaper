 Agricultural landscapes are spatially and temporally dynamic habitats that force wildlife to interact with different management practices such as harvests and mowing events which cause sudden changes in resource availability . Animals may avoid agricultural management events and the changed habitat to search for undisturbed areas or they might use and explore such areas due to beneficial changes in vegetation structure . Further landscape structure might influence the movement processes that are underlying reactions to agricultural management . Here we study how agricultural management events affect animal movement behaviour in two contrastingly structured agricultural landscapes .

@highlight Hare movement behaviour was studied before and after agricultural management events.
@highlight Hares spend more time on recently harvested crop fields but not on mown grasslands.
@highlight Management events affect hare range sizes only in areas with large crop fields.
@highlight Hares shift their ranges away or towards fields depending on the management type.
@highlight Energy expenditure of hares is unaffected by agricultural management.
