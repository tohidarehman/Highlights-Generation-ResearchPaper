 In the arid region of Central Asia climate change leads not only to changes in water availability generated by glacier snow melt in the alpine regions but also to changes in water consumption . This paper evaluates agricultural water demand and water supply for the five Central Asian countries under global warming conditions of 1.5C and 2.0C . As Central Asia is more sensitive to climate change compared to the global average the temperature is predicted to rise by 1.7C and 2.6C and precipitation to increase by 9 and 12 in global warming scenarios of 1.5C and 2.0C respectively . The average crop water requirement is expected to increase by 13mm and 19mm per year respectively under the global warming scenarios of 1.5C and 2.0C . A widening gap between water supply and water demand is expected compared to the historical period under global warming scenario of 2.0C . Under global warming of 2.0C the anticipated water gaps between precipitation and CWR are projected to increase by 2.810

@highlight Increased precipitation and temperature are expected under 1.5 2.0C warming in Central Asia.
@highlight is projected to increase in Central Asia under 1.5C and 2.0C global warming.
@highlight Water gap precipitation CWR will widen for rainfed north Kazakhstan and irrigated Fergana.
