 Nitrogen applied with fertilizers is not efficiently used in agriculture . In the soil this N is transformed into different compounds by means of several biological processes . As a result there is a negative economic and environmental impact due to water contamination via nitrate NO

@highlight Bacterial diversity was higher in conventional tillage CT than in no tillage NT .
@highlight DMPSA inhibited nitrifying bacteria in both CT and NT.
@highlight DMPSA application decreased the bacterial diversity under NT management.
@highlight Several non target bacteria shifted their abundances with DMPSA application in NT.
@highlight DMPSA increased the abundance of Cyanobacteria and decreased certain phytopathogens.
