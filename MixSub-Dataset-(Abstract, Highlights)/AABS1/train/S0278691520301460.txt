 Although many studies have shown that inflammatory response plays a crucial role in the various toxic effects of T 2 toxin there are relatively few reports on the mechanism of this phenomenon . Meanwhile accumulating evidence has shown that miR 155 5p is activated in the inflammatory response . As molecular pathways and mechanisms involved in T 2 toxin induced inflammatory response are poorly elucidated we assessed whether miR 155 5p is involved in the inflammation effects mediated by T 2 toxin . Treatment of RAW264.7cells with T 2 toxin resulted in inflammatory response and associated with alteration of the gene expression signature of miR 155 5p . Knockdown or overexpression of miR 155 5p both indicated that miR 155 5p positively regulated the expression of the inflammation factors . Moreover bioinformatics prediction and luciferase assay indicated that atg3 and rheb are targets of miR 155 5p . However atg3 and SOCS1 play positive roles in the inflammatory response regulated by miR 155 5p while rheb plays a negative role . In addition the

@highlight As targets of miR 155 5p rheb increases while atg3 and SOCS1 inhibit inflammatory factors induced by T 2 toxin.
@highlight MiR 155 5p plays dual roles in production of inflammatory factors caused by T 2 toxin by targeting SOCS1 rheb and atg3.
