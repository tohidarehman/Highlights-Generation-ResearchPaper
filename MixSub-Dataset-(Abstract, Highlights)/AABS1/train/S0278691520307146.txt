 Hyperglycaemia induces a vascular inflammatory process that is a critical event in cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes . Cocoa and its flavanols have been widely investigated for its antioxidant and anti inflammatory properties and several clinical and pre clinical studies support their vascular benefits . However the effects of cocoa flavanols on vascular inflammation in diabetes remains to be elucidated . Herein we evaluated the anti inflammatory effect of a cocoa rich diet on the aortas of Zucker diabetic fatty rats . Moreover the potential role of flavanol derived colonic metabolites to modulate the adhesion and inflammatory processes were also evaluated using TNF stimulated endothelial cells . Results demonstrate that cocoa attenuates the levels of phospho p65 nuclear factor kappaB and the expression of inflammatory factors including intercellular adhesion molecule 1 vascular adhesion molecule 1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase in the aortas of ZDF rats . Experiments with endothelial cells further confirm that a mix of flavanol derived colonic metabolites effectively down regulate the levels of p p65 NF B and the cell adhesion molecules ICAM 1 and VCAM 1 preventing thus the increase of monocyte endothelial adhesion induced by TNF . These novel data provide the first evidence of the relevant role of cocoa and their flavanol derived metabolites to avoid the development of endothelial inflammation and diabetic complications .
