 The main aim of turfgrass fertilization is to maintain high turf quality and obtain proper turf colour . Fertigation has been recognized as the best fertilization method for proper turfgrass nutrition and for minimizing nitrogen leaching . The aim of this study was to determine the optimum fertilizer rate and frequency for obtaining high quality turfgrass and minimizing nutrient losses using a fertigation system .

@highlight Optimum fertilizers rate and frequency was investigated.
@highlight Fertigation parameters affected nutrients content in leachate.
@highlight Fertigation parameters influence on colour and turf quality.
@highlight Optimal fertigation parameters were of 60 kg N ha
@highlight and fertigation interval of 4.4 days.
