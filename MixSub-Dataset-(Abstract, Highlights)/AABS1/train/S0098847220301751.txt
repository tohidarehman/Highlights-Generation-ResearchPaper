 During their life cycles plants are often subjected to periods of fluctuation between water deficit and re irrigation events . Efficient communication and rapid signaling between the shoot and root systems are needed for adaptive stress responses . Abscisic acid and the hydraulic signal are the main long distance signals responsive to water deficit . Nevertheless ABA is susceptible to interactions with electrical signals and may not be sufficient as a sign of stress in plants . Therefore we aimed to investigate the relationship between hydraulic chemical and electrical signals after a re irrigation stimulus to induce changes in gas exchange of ABA mutant microtomato plants . Three genotypes of tomato cultivar Micro Tom MT

@highlight The propagation of action potentials is related to the plasma membrane depolarization during water deficit.
@highlight Re irrigation stimulus induces the evocation of action potentials in wild type and ABA mutants microtomatoes.
@highlight Action potentials increase
@highlight and
@highlight in MT
@highlight In ABA mutants gas exchange reduction in response to action potential was due to the effects of ABA on stomatal conductance.
@highlight Action potentials may also induce photosynthesis inactivation by adjusting stromal pH.
