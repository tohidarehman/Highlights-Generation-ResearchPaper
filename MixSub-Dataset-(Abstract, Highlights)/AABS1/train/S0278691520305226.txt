 Neonicotinoid insecticides have been widely used in plant protection against pests worldwide . Generally more than one neonicotinoids are detected in plants and foods and such mixtures may show combined toxicity and increase the risk for both insects and higher organisms . In this study the combined toxicity of imidacloprid acetamiprid and thiamethoxam was investigated using human neuroblastoma cell line and lepidopteran cell line . Results showed that binary and ternary mixtures could enhance the inhibition of growth of both SK N SH and Sf 9 cells at low doses . In SK N SH cells based on CompuSyn software analysis all the mixtures of IM AC IM TH AC TH and IM AC TH showed synergistic effects at concentrations 50 mg L but IM AC IM TH showed antagonistic effects at higher concentrations . For Sf 9 cells all mixtures revealed synergistic effects at low concentrations except IM AC showing antagonism at higher concentrations . The toxicity thresholds of mixtures denoted by BMDL

@highlight Thiamethoxam had the highest toxic potential both on Sf 9 and SK N SH cells.
@highlight Synergy effects observed from combined treatment at low concentration.
@highlight The benchmark dose lower bound of acetamiprid plus thiamethoxam was the lowest one.
