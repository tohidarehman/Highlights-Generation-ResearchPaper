 The loss of phosphorus and nitrogen from agricultural non point source is one of the main causes of eutrophication in rivers lakes and reservoirs in the Karst region southern China . The lakeside buffer zone has proven to be effective in reducing the input of ANPS pollutants . However the interception efficiency of natural soil for P and ammonia nitrogen is insufficient to control ANPS pollution . In this study natural zeolite aluminium modified clay and lanthanum modified bentonite were used to amend the natural soil collected in the lakeside zone of Kelan Reservoir Guangxi China . An experimental study was conducted to examine the dissolved inorganic P and ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency and fixation mechanism of three amended soils under simulation conditions . The results showed that natural soil had a high fraction of clay and silt and had a high removal rate of 95 for the DIP at the beginning of the experiment . With the intermittent input of farmland drainage the P removal rate of natural soil from runoff decreased gradually . Compared with the control group P removal rates of AMC and LaMB amended soils remained at a high level within 46 days with means of 93.6 and 93.9 . However NZ amended soil has a weak interception capacity of runoff P pollutant . The chemical sequential extraction showed that AMC increased soil P capacity by forming NaOH P and NaHCO

@highlight NZ AMC and LaMB were used to amend the lakeside soil.
@highlight P removal rates of amended soils remained are more than 93 .
@highlight LaMB amended soil can simultaneously remove ammonia.
@highlight AMC and LaMB amended soil is effective for ANPS pollution control.
