 The effects of water stress on plant growth yield primary metabolites and secondary metabolites accumulation were evaluated for greenhouse production . A pot experiment was conducted on two species of chilies

@highlight Deficit irrigation negatively affected yield quantity for both chili species.
@highlight Concentrations of sugars were lower at both plant species under deficit irrigation.
@highlight C.
@highlight  Chili AS Rot fruits had higher organic acids content at field capacity.
@highlight Capsaicin concentration in C.
@highlight  Chili AS Rot was higher under water deficit.
