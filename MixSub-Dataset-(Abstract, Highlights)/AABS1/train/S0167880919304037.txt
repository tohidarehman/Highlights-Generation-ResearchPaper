 Nitrate leaching losses from arable cropping systems cause severe damage to environmental services worldwide . There is a considerable need for methods that allow rapid easy and area covering detection of nitrate leaching to guide nitrogen management . We used three years of data from the 5

@highlight Cover crops significantly reduced nitrate leaching in autumn and winter.
@highlight Above the thresholds of cover crop biomass or aboveground N nitrate leaching was low and stable.
@highlight A positive linear relationship was found between nitrate leaching and soil water nitrate concentration.
@highlight It is possible to assess nitrate leaching based on newly launched satellite remote sensing platforms.
