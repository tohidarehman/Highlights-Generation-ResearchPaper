 Despite the versatility of quantum dots in optoelectronics and biomedical field their toxicity risks remain a considerable hindrance for clinical applications . Cytotoxicity of Cadmium containing QDs is well documented and reveals that they are toxic to cells . Reports suggest that the presence of toxic elements at the QD core is responsible for its toxicity in

@highlight Green synthesis of ZnSe ZnS QDs carried out via aqueous colloidal route.
@highlight Optical physicochemical characterization confirms authenticity of the QDs.
@highlight 24h exposure of 100 g ml ZnSe ZnS QDs induced necrosis in HEK cells.
@highlight toxicity mainly due to the endocytosis of QDs.
@highlight No visible variation in
@highlight parameters as part of 10mg kg dosage of QDs.
