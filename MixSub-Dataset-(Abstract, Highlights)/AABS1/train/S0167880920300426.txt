 Damming effects on sulfur cycling remains unclear at basin scales due to the lack of basic data prior to dam construction . To explore the influence of damming on the riverine S cycle we investigated the spatiotemporal variations of water chemistry sulfate SO

@highlight Biogeochemical processes of sulfur were enhanced by damming especially in summer.
@highlight Damming decreased seasonal differences but increased spatial differences of SO
@highlight and
@highlight S SO
@highlight SO
@highlight decreased whilst
@highlight S SO
@highlight increased from upstream to downstream.
@highlight Cumulative effects on
@highlight S SO
@highlight could derive from HRT and mean depth of reservoir.
@highlight SO
@highlight and
@highlight S SO
@highlight could be useful indicators in assessing the damming effects.
