 Unsustainable urbanisation has radically deteriorated the natural hydrological phenomena within cityscapes of developing countries . Such neo urban spaces have inadvertently disrupted the hydrological balance both within and around themselves . As a result tumultuous hydro dynamism is being faced in atmospheric and sub surface locales of even small planned neo urban townships like New Town West Bengal wherein rainfall regimes evapo transpiration rates land surface temperatures and groundwater levels have been affected . Using Built up Index to identify the spectacular urban growth TRMM rainfall data MODIS 11B3 LST and MODIS 16A2 ET rates have been further correlated 3 dimensionally as well as statistically to understand the changing hydrological regime of the township for two time periods i.e . 2001 02 and 201819 . The variables were found to be significantly related and partial aggressors for average piezometric fall . Results from average annual estimates depict that over the past 18 years of urban growth of New Town rainfall has decreased by 10mm LST has increased by 5 units 30
