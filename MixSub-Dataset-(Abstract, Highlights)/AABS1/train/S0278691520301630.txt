 Diisononyl phthalate is commonly used as a plasticizer in industrial and consumer product applications . Several studies have suggested a possible link between exposure to DINP and the development of allergic asthma and the synergistic effect of DINP combined with Ovalbumin is a possible way to promote an immune response . These findings are still speculative since there is insufficient evidence to assess the ability of DINP to influence allergic asthma pathology . This study was designed to determine any effects of OVA DINP exposure on airway reactivity particularly when combined with allergen exposure . Experiments to determine these effects were conducted after 15 days of combined exposure and a subsequent challenge with aerosolized ovalbumin for one week . Airway hyper responsiveness lung tissue pathology cytokines and oxidative stress biomarkers were investigated . We showed that oral exposure to OVA DINP could induce airway hyper responsiveness and aggravate airway wall remodeling and that this deterioration was concomitant with increased immunoglobulin E and Th2 cytokines secretion . The data also demonstrated that DINP could promote oxidative damage in the lung . In summary this study showed that DINP has an adjuvant effect on allergic asthma affecting lung function lung histopathology immune molecules and causes oxidative damage .
