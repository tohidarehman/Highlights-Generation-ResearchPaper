 Snowmelt is a major source for summer soil water storage that supports tree growth in the Mediterranean climate of the Sierra Nevada California . The timing and magnitude of snow water contributions to soil moisture are controlled by energy and water availability that varies based on climate and topography . Few studies thus far have explored how transpiration rate is affected by differences in the timing and magnitude of snowmelt across years and locations . Here we used meteorological and hydrological measurements on north and south aspects in the Sagehen Creek catchment to investigate the controls on the timing of conifer sap flow a proxy for transpiration rate in response to the timing and magnitude of snowmelt . We found that sap flow prior to its seasonal peak in July was largely controlled by air temperature and that spring sap flow was reduced by cloudy conditions . Years with earlier snow disappearance caused earlier peak sap flow which was nearly coincident with the beginning of soil moisture limitations than years with later snow disappearance . Because Sagehen Creek receives little summer rainfall years with earlier snowmelt and peak sap flow had more total days with soil moisture limitation on sap flow . Overall our results suggest that earlier snow disappearance and more spring rain will potentially shift the peak of sap flow earlier in the growing season and increase the duration of water limitations during summer . These insights about the timing and duration of water limitations could be used as benchmarks to test physically based models and better constrain predictions of transpiration rates in snow dominated landscapes similar to the study site .

@highlight Peak sap flow occurs earlier when soil moisture limitations start earlier
@highlight Earlier snowmelt leads to longer soil moisture limitations on sap flow
