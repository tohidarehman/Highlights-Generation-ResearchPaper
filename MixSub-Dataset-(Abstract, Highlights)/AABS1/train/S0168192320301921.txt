 Climate smart agriculture management practices such as no tillage and cover crops have been widely applied and are expected to offer multiple environmental benefits . However the long term effects of these management practices especially their synergistic interaction have not been well addressed . This study used an improved agroecosystem model to explore the synergistic effects of NT and CCs on soil carbon dynamics in a continuous maize system in the middle south of the United States for 19702099 . Simulation results for 19702018 show that NT relative to conventional tillage led to carbon gains 0.22 Mg C ha

@highlight Long term synergetic effects of no tillage and cover crops on soil C were simulated.

@highlight and warming may benefit cover crops growth and increase soil C input.
@highlight No tillage and cover crops would synergistically enhance soil C sequestration.
