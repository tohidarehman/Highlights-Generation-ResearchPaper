 This research describes the intra metropolitan distribution patterns of airport accessibility employment density and labor productivity using municipality level datasets from the Tokyo metropolitan region . The geographic data analyses present that inner city bayfront airport accessibility and cross industrial employment density are high in municipalities with the designation of urban regeneration districts for economic efficiency and competitiveness but outer suburb airport accessibility is not . The intra metropolitan descriptions further reveal that labor productivity tends to be high in municipalities with high accessibility to the inner city bayfront airport and a high degree of cross industrial firm colocation for urbanization economies . From these findings this article concludes that the significance of spatial strategy in guiding airport linked firm colocation and intensifying the catalytic impacts of multiple airports through ground transportation investments needs to be more cautiously assessed in Asia s emerging megacities .

@highlight Inner city bayfront airport accessibility is associated with strategic locations.
@highlight Outer suburb airport accessibility is not associated with strategic locations.
@highlight Employment density is not associated with airport accessibility.
@highlight Labor productivity is associated with strategic locations with high airport accessibility.
