 Plant physiological responses to stress and subsequent damage have not been successfully integrated into leaf plant or land surface models . Water deficit leads to a series of plant responses stomatal closure decreases evaporative cooling leading to higher leaf temperature which it can affect photosynthetic dissipation of absorbed energy especially under high irradiance . Excess absorbed energy by PSII results in photoinhibition which is not typically included when modeling photosynthesis using the Farquhar von Caemmerer Berry model . We introduce a novel approach to represent plant atmosphere interactions a non steady state model of photoinhibition linked to the RuBP regeneration component of the FvCB model that accounts for the interactions between high temperature irradiance and water deficits . Gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence dynamics showed that under severe water stress the maximum quantum efficiency of PSII

@highlight Short term acclimation to irradiance affected photosynthetic parameters.
@highlight This model is especially relevant when representing long term photosynthesis dynamics.
