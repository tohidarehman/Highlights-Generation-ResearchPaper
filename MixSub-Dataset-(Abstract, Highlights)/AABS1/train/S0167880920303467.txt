 Increasing demand for cocoa and climate related yield declines have sparked a multi stakeholder debate on cocoa production strategies . Agrochemical inputs and pollination enhancement through hand pollination are two strategies to increase yields . Here we test both strategies with field experiments in Indonesia . We show that even partial hand pollination and not fertilizers or insecticides increases yield tree by 51 . The more laborious 100 hand pollination of the entire tree increases yield tree by 161 and farmers annual net income from 994 USD ha up to 1 677 USD ha or 69 in the study area after accounting for farm operational hand pollination labor and opportunity costs . Thus intensifying cocoa pollination appears to be a potential solution for closing cocoa yield gaps and should be considered in the current industry led discussion of designing farms for mitigation of climate change .

@highlight Agrochemical use and hand pollination are known strategies for improving cocoa yield.
@highlight 13 hand pollination but neither fertilizer nor pesticide enhancement increased yield by 51 .
@highlight 100 hand pollination increased yield by 161 .
@highlight Hand pollination can improve farmer income by 69 in Indonesia.
@highlight Future studies should focus on long term benefits of hand pollination and natural pollination.
