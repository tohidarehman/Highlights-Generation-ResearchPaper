 Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of droughts in most tropical regions in the coming decades . A passive phenomenon called hydraulic redistribution allows some plant species to take up water from deep and wet soil layers and redistribute it in the upper dry layers where other plants and soil biota can benefit from it . In addition soil fertilization particularly potassium may also affect drought adaptive mechanisms and increase water use efficiency on poor and acidic tropical soils . The present study aimed at quantifying the role of HR and K fertilization on both wood productivity and WUE for stemwood production WUE

@highlight A study of a tropical
@highlight experiment with water and K manipulation.
@highlight How hydraulic lift and K fertilization affect water use efficiency and wood growth 
@highlight K fertilization dramatically increased water uptake by 30 50 and WUE by 300 .
@highlight K fertilization alleviated constraints on light and water use.
@highlight K fertilization is beneficial to both wood biomass production and WUE.
