 How and why spatial patterns of soil respiration emerge and change or persist over time and what makes spatial patterning of SR and environment variables interdependent or non interdependent is poorly understood . Our objectives were to quantify temporal changes in spatial patterns of SR for a grassland dominated by

@highlight No spatial structure was detected for SR in May.
@highlight The strongest spatial heterogeneity was observed in July.
@highlight Biological factors were important determinants of the spatial pattern of SR in July.
@highlight Spatial patterns of SR varied remarkably across the different observations.
