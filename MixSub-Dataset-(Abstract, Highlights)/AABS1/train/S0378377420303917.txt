 The large diversity of irrigated agricultural areas hinders the development of social consensus and complicates decision making about the allocation of investments for irrigation modernization . A classification of irrigated areas permits the identification and mapping of different categories and reveals the strengths and weaknesses of each category regarding specific criteria . This paper proposes a binomial classification methodology of irrigated areas which was designed based on a participatory approach . Four internal properties determine the genus type of water source type of water energy on farm irrigation method and water availability . Four external properties classify the variability within each genus into species land tenure crop type existence of an environmental protection figure and socio economic level . The words used for the genus and specific name arise from the concatenation of syllables representing the state or level of each property . The method was applied to the irrigated area of the Ebro river basin in the Aragn region of Spain . A total of 435 851ha were classified . A large part of the irrigated land uses surface water does not have water availability problems is not affected by environmental protection figures is devoted to field crops and manifests a low or moderate socio economic level . A total of 24 genera and 126 species were identified . The two most representative genera are

@highlight A methodology to classify irrigated areas is proposed.
@highlight The method permits to identify and map strengths and weaknesses of irrigated areas.
@highlight The application of the method to an irrigated area can support decision making.
@highlight The method can be adapted to other areas of the world by adjusting criteria.
