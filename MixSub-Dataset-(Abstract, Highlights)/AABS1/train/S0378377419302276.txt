 Nitrogen application is a basic practice for increasing cereal yield and efficient utilization of N sources is key to sustainable intensification . A meta analysis was conducted to determine how organic fertilization affects yield yield variability and water use efficiency of winter wheat

@highlight Organic fertilization increased winter wheat grain yield and water use efficiency without affecting ET in northern China.
@highlight The positive effect of organic fertilizer on yield and WUE of winter wheat was greatest when yield levels was 4.0Mgha
@highlight Organic fertilization was more effective at improving yield and WUE in growing environments with SOM 1.4 and ET 500mm.
