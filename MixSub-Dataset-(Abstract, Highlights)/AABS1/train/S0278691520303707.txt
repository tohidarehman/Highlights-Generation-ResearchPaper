 Nitrites are present in the food chain as naturally occurring species or contaminants . Additionally sodium and potassium nitrites are authorised food additives . Nitrites exert acute toxicity through methemoglobinemia or cardiovascular effects chronic toxicity associated with endocrine reproductive and developmental effects and have been classified as probable gastric carcinogens . Ingestion of food and water are the main sources of human exposure . This study comprises a tiered risk assessment of nitrites for the Austrian adult population along with the identification of the food categories most contributing to their intake . The dietary exposure based on Austrian occurrence and consumption data was modelled with the Monte Carlo simulation method . In an additional scenario data gaps were addressed with the usage of occurrence data published by the European Food Safety Authority and from the available literature to account for the exposure from all sources . Risk estimates regarding only the exposure to nitrite additives and to contaminated water indicate low level of concern . However when exposure from all sources is considered the estimated exposure is elevated and exceeds the Acceptable Daily Intake for high consumers . Mean exposure attributed to the use of nitrites as additives accounts for only a very small proportion of the total intake .
