 It appears that electronic cigarettes are a less harmful alternative to conventional cigarette smoking as they generate substantially lower levels of harmful carcinogens and other toxic compounds . Thus switching from CC to EC may be beneficial for smokers . However recent accounts of EC or vaping associated lung injury has raised concerns regarding their adverse health effects . Additionally the increasing popularity of EC among vulnerable populations such as adolescents and pregnant women calls for further EC safety evaluation . In this state of the art review we provide an update on recent findings regarding the neurological effects induced by EC exposure . Moreover we discuss possible neurotoxic effects of nicotine and numerous other chemicals which are inherent both to e liquids and EC aerosols . We conclude that in recognizing pertinent issues associated with EC usage both government and scientific researchers must address this public health issue with utmost urgency .
