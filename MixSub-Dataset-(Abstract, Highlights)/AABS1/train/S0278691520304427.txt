 The growing use of zinc oxide nanoparticles in various applications has raised many concerns about the potential risks to human health . In this research the protective effects of cellular oxidative stress inhibitor N Acetyl cysteine and endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor Salubrinal on reproductive toxicity induced by ZnO NPs were investigated . The results showed that application of these two kinds of cell stress inhibitors after oral ingestion of ZnO NPs could prevent the weight loss of pregnant mice reduce zinc content in the uterus placenta and fetus reduce abnormal development of the offspring and decrease fetal abortion . Furthermore RT qPCR Western blot and immunofluorescence assay results indicated that NAC restored the expression of

@highlight ZnO NPs can cause maternal reproductive toxicity and fetal growth restriction.
@highlight ZnO NPs may induced toxicity via endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxide stress.
@highlight NAC and Sal can alleviate the reproductive toxicity caused by ZnO NPs.
