 The use of saline water is one likely option for sustainable cultivation of ornamental plants particularly in water scarce regions . To assess the feasibility of sustainable cultivation under saline irrigation water in such regions a field experiment was conducted at the nursery of the Ornamental Horticulture Department Faculty of Agriculture Cairo University Egypt during the seasons of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 in which five different management treatments were studied to evaluate their effectiveness on alleviating adverse salinity effects on

@highlight Salinity management treatments improved growth photosynthetic pigment concentration and leaf chemical constituents of
@highlight Humic acid was the most beneficial treatment followed by proline gypsum leaching and magnetite.
@highlight Na and Cl concentrations were significantly decreased by most of the applied treatments.
@highlight Treatments effect was remarkably close to that of tap water which may help in ensuring sustainable cultivation under saline irrigation water.
