 Calcineurin B like protein and CBL interacting protein kinase play an important role in regulation on plant abiotic stress tolerance . It is unknown whether CBL CIPK pathway regulates abiotic stress tolerance in bermudagrass . In the present study CdtCBL4 and CdtCIPK5 from triploid bermudagrass were characterized .
