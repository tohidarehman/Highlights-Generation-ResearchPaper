 Proteo transcriptomic landscape provides new perspectives on how invasive plants response to increasing climatic extremes triggered by global warming . Plants that colonize broad ranges across pronounced climatic gradients offer a unique opportunity to evaluate temperature effects on molecular events as a function of their adaptive response to heat stress . Here we used

@highlight Heat stress substantially altered leaf physiological traits.
@highlight Heat altered the expression of nearly 13 of transcribed genes and 4 of proteins.
@highlight Up regulation of genes encoding classical heat shock proteins HSPs .
@highlight Down regulation of genes associated with photosynthesis and secondary metabolism.
@highlight may down regulate photosynthesis to save energy.
