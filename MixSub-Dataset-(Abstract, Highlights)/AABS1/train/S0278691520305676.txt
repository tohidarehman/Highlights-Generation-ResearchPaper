 Halogenated organic compounds are a particular group of contaminants consisting of a large number of substances and of great concern due to their persistence in the environment potential for bioaccumulation and toxicity . Some of these compounds have been classified as persistent organic pollutants under The Stockholm Convention and many toxicity assessments have been conducted on them previously . In this work we provide an overview of enzymatic assays used in these studies to establish toxic effects and dose response relationships . Studies

@highlight Halogenated organic compounds HOCs are of environmental and human health concern.
@highlight Enzymes are involved in HOCs metabolisation or present an inhibited activity.
@highlight Enzymatic assays are used to establish toxicity and dose response relationships.
@highlight Exposure to HOCs
@highlight and
@highlight reflect the activity of relevant enzymes.
@highlight Biosensors based on these enzymes can be used as tools for monitoring HOCs.
