 The effect of 4 irrigation doses during the oil synthesis on virgin olive oil quality was evaluated in high density orchards of the cv . Arbequina . The control treatment kept a humidity bulb close to the field capacity . Three deficit irrigation treatments were applied during oil synthesis providing 68 40 and 17 of T1 respectively . The olive fruits were harvested and their oil was extracted and analyzed . Plant water status oil production fruit characteristics and fruit temperature were measured . During 2012mild water stress was produced in a less irrigated treatment T4 and deficit irrigation did not affect most of the oil quality parameters . However in 2013 a higher stress was observed in T4 and the oil showed higher values for K

@highlight Deficit irrigation during oil synthesis reduced the phenol content in olive oil.
@highlight This deficit irrigation reduced the percentage of oleic acid in olive oil.
@highlight The oxidative stability of olive oil was reduced with the deficit irrigation during oil synthesis.
@highlight The contents of vitamins A E and F of olive oils increased with deficit irrigation during oil synthesis.
