 Focus on risks to human health and the environment from combined exposure to multiple chemicals has increased in the last couple of decades . There has been a rise in awareness and concern in the community especially concerning unintentional environmental exposure to unknown chemical mixtures . The Horizon 2020 project EuroMix has developed methodologies and tools for mixture risk assessment with a focus on component based approach where substances are grouped based on toxicological considerations . Dose addition is used as the model for calculating the combined toxicity of mixture components . The methodology is anchored in the Adverse Outcome Pathway concept which provides a structured basis for e.g . grouping substances into assessment groups and identifying and collecting relevant toxicity data . The aim of this paper is to describes development of the methodology for mixture risk assessment and to provide detailed methodology for problem formulation use of AOP networks for development of tiered testing strategies and grouping of substances as well as considerations for use of dose addition methodology .

@highlight Methodologies and tools for mixture risk assessment RA have been developed in the EuroMix project.
