 Researchers are challenged to design research that can generate credible claims regarding cross scale impact and adoption . However the context in which new knowledge or innovation is developed and tested may differ from that for the uptake and use of those findings . This paper reports insight into the problem of designing impactful research and proposes a model to assist bio physical researchers in accounting for non biophysical context when moving between scales or settings . We treat the scaling problem as the one shifting contexts . The use of the model is illustrated by application in two New Zealand based irrigation water use efficiency field studies . We hypothesised that to successfully transfer the learnings from these two pilot studies to other scales it would be important to understand the influence of context on WUE practices . To support this process we developed a social dynamics model from existing social systems frameworks . The CCM maps influential non biophysical dynamics to help interpret the WUE field study findings for other scales . The paper represents a contribution to researchers addressing two related challenges that of making credible claims regarding the possible future impact of their research and that of translating innovations across scales . By demonstrating the use of our CCM for documenting key non biophysical variables we aim to equip researchers with a practical tool to assist in the interpretation of findings across contexts that include both biophysical and non biophysical factors .

@highlight Context specific studies require interpretation to transfer their impact elsewhere.
@highlight Context is a unique combination of social and biophysical variables.
@highlight Interpretation and application of scientific findings are a matter of shifting between contexts.
@highlight Social dynamics models help interpreting of scientific knowledge within and across contexts.
