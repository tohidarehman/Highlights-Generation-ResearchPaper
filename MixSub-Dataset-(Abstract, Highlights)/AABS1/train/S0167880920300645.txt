 Soil changes matter for the global carbon balance although belowground response to land use change is slower and less obvious than that aboveground . Impacts of changes from natural forest to a range of intermediate tree based land uses and non tree agriculture remain contested . Standard C stock accounting for a fixed sampling depth depends on changes in both C
