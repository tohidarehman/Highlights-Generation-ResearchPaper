 The regulatory effects of competing endogenous RNA network have been highlighted on the occurrence and development of diseases . However the effect of ceRNA network in liver with subchronic deoxynivalenol exposure has remained unclear so far . Here lncRNA Gm20319 miR 7240 5p GNE network was identified in DON exposed liver tissues after DON exposure for 90 days . Subchronic DON exposure induced the mild inflammation in liver tissues . In DON treated liver tissues and Hepa 16cell line the expression of Gm20319 and GNE were both downregulated while miR 7240 5p expression was upregulated . The gain and loss of function expression

@highlight Low dose subchronic DON exposure may induce the mild inflammation in liver.
@highlight LncRNA Gm20319 inhibited miR 7240 5p through directly binding.
@highlight GNE was a direct target for miR 7240 5p.
@highlight LncRNA Gm20319 regulated GNE expression through sponging miR 7240 5p.
@highlight GNE may influence the expression of SOD1 and IL 1 via biosynthesizing sialic acid.
