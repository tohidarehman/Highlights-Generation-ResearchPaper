 Ants are known to provide valuable ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes including oil palm plantations . Their communities are less diverse and more uneven in oil palm compared with forest and this may increase their vulnerability to disturbance . This study quantifies ant communities in oil palm agroforestry and experimentally tests their robustness to a common practice high disturbance management intervention removing understory vegetation .

@highlight Ground foraging ants were highly abundant in oil palm plantations.
@highlight Species evenness was low seven species accounted for 78 of individuals.
@highlight There were fewer ants in plots where the understory vegetation was removed.
@highlight Management did not affect species richness species evenness or community composition.
