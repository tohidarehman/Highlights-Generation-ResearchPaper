 Shrimp aquaculture is a fast growing industry in many parts of the world . The expansion of the industry has raised concerns about its external impacts on the local environment and ecosystems including agriculture . This study examines changes over time in land use and soil salinity levels using satellite data and soil sample data from Satkhira district in Bangladesh . Moreover the study measures the impact of shrimp aquaculture on soil salinity in neighboring paddy farms and evaluates how this in turn affects paddy farm profits using farm level data from 316 paddy plots . Results show that the land covered by shrimp ponds almost doubled in terms of percentage of land area expanding from 22 in 1990 to 38 in 2016 . Soil salinity also increased significantly over the same period . Farm level analysis shows that salinity levels are relatively higher in paddy plots that are closer to shrimp ponds . Each additional 1 meter decrease in the distance between paddy plots and shrimp ponds induces a 0.14 increase in soil salinity in both

@highlight Shrimp pond area increased from 22 in 1990 to 38 in 2016 in Kaliganj sub district of coastal Bangladesh.
@highlight Soil salinity in the study area also increased significantly over the same time period.
@highlight Shrimp aquaculture imposes external costs on neighbouring paddy farmers.
@highlight Salinity levels are relatively higher in paddy plots that are closer to shrimp ponds.
@highlight Paddy profits per hectare are relatively lower in paddy plots closer to shrimp ponds due to higher salinity levels.
