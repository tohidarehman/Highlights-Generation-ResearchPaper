 Theophylline is a kind of methyl xanthine which has been suggested to inhibit the activity of phosphodiesterase and increase the intracellular level of cyclic adenine monophosphate . Theophylline has also been reported to increase the length and complexity of the dendritic process in melanocytes . However the mode of action of theophylline in melanogenesis has never been reported . In this study the effects of theophylline on melanogenesis were evaluated spectrophotometrically by the mushroom tyrosinase activity assay and by the determination of the intracellular tyrosinase activity and melanin content . The expression levels of melanogenesis related proteins were analyzed by Western blot . The results indicated that theophylline effectively enhanced melanogenesis in the B16F10 murine melanoma cells . Moreover theophylline increased the protein expression levels of microphthalmia associated transcription factor tyrosinase and tyrosinase related protein 1 and the level of phosphorylated extracellular regulated protein kinase and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3 were also increased . In summary the results revealed that theophylline promoted melanogenesis in B16F10cells by upregulating the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 1 and Wnt catenin signaling pathways .
