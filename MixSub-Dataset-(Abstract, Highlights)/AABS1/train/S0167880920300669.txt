 The highly heterogeneous surface environment and subsurface conduit network in karst areas make estimating soil erosion extremely complicated . Sediment fingerprint techniques have been successfully applied in soil erosion research in karst areas as a new way to more effectively collect information on soil loss . However few sediment fingerprint factors most of which are based on radioactive fallout tracers such as

@highlight Soil loss rates in watersheds gradually decreased from 1954 to July 2018 on the whole.
@highlight Soil erosion was extremely sensitive to human activities and land use change.
@highlight Soil loss and rocky desertification are reciprocal and interact with each other.
@highlight Composite fingerprint was an effective and reliable way to estimate soil loss.
