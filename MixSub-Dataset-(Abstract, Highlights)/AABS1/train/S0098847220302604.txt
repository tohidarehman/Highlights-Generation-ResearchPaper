 With the ongoing climate change widespread changes could be noticed in both the extent of the geographical distribution as well the patterns of phenotypic variation of plant species in response to environmental heterogeneity . Whether these changes are a direct consequence of global climate change and whether they result from phenotypic plasticity or evolutionary forces are currently main areas of interest . In the present study 130 lines belonging to ten Tunisian

@highlight The genetic variation of the response to drought for Tunisian
@highlight populations was analyzed using functional traits.
@highlight The response to drought was shaped by an interplay between natural selection and phenotypic plasticity
@highlight The studied populations and the analyzed traits differed significantly in their degree of phenotypic plasticity.
@highlight Plasticity of most analyzed traits seems to be unrelated to climatic factors
