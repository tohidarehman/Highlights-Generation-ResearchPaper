 The maximum efficiency attainable by surface irrigation in any particular situation is determined largely by the soil infiltration characteristic and the flow rate onto the field . Performance evaluations have suggested that higher flow rates than those traditionally recommended can lead to increases of about 20 in the application efficiency of bay irrigation across the dairy regions of southern Australia . However substantially reduced irrigation durations are required to realise these efficiency gains and greater precision is required in the selection and management of these shorter durations .

@highlight A guidelines for high performance bay irrigation.
@highlight Higher flow rates and lower irrigation duration can deliver higher application efficiencies.
@highlight Preferred flow rates for the major soil groups are recommended.
@highlight A simple linear function can be used to estimate the irrigation duration at constant soil moisture deficit.
