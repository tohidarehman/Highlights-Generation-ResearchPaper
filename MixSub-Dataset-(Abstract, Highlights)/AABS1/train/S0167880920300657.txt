 Traditional land use cessation allows the spread of invasive tall grass species and thus leads to a reduction in grassland biodiversity . We hypothesized that long term multi year mowing of invaded grassland fosters the recovery of its taxonomic diversity and functional composition by reducing the dominance of the tall grass species

@highlight Mowing reduced tall grass abundance in abandoned sub Mediterranean grasslands.
@highlight Mowing changed the distribution pattern of species cover and functional composition.
@highlight Mowing increased species richness and exponential Shannon index but not evenness.
@highlight Mowing caused an increase in relative abundance of palatable species over time.
@highlight Mowing is appropriate in the restoration of abandoned sub Mediterranean grasslands.
