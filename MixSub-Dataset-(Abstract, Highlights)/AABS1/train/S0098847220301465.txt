 Worldwide contamination of agricultural soils with cadmium not only leads to reduced plant yield but accumulation within the edible plant parts also poses a serious threat to human health . In this study the rice leaf growth zone was used to examine how the effects of Cd on leaf growth are mediated by its effect on cell division and expansion . Based on a kinematic analysis and flow cytometry we show that both processes are inhibited upon root Cd exposure . The Cd inhibited leaf growth was confirmed by the overall downregulation of cell cycle genes upon Cd exposure . In addition Cd preferentially accumulates within the leaf meristem and the transition zone whereas the concentration steeply drops in the elongation zone . As Cd induces an oxidative challenge which is also related to plant growth it was further investigated whether this could be involved in the mode of action of the Cd inhibited leaf growth . Therefore gene expression patterns of antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutases catalases and ascorbate peroxidases were investigated in different leaf growth zones . Whereas no significant differences were seen for

@highlight Cadmium reduces rice leaf growth in a concentration dependent manner.
@highlight Cadmium reduces both meristem size and mature cell length leading to smaller leaves.
@highlight Cadmium accumulates preferably within the leaf meristem and first transition zone.
@highlight Catalase and ascorbate peroxidase show different leaf zone expression patterns.
@highlight Cadmium upregulates specific catalase and ascorbate peroxidase gene isoforms.
