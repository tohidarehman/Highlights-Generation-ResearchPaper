 The aim of the study was to investigate the potential of sildenafil and tadalafil to ameliorate structural kidney damage in contrast induced nephropathy . A rat model of CIN was developed by dehydration administration of a nitric oxide inhibitor and a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor and contrast media exposure to iopromide . The effect of pre treatment with sildenafil tadalafil or N acetyl cysteine for 7 days prior to CIN induction was investigated . All animals were sacrificed at 24h after CIN induction and both kidneys were collected . Histopathological examination was performed under light microscopy in serial tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin . CIN group showed hydropic changes of the renal tubules an increased Bowman space with lobulated glomerulus and alteration of macula densa region of distal convolute tubules . The groups pretreated with sildenafil and tadalafil showed nearly normal histological aspects of renal tissue . The group pretreated with NAC showed similar but less intense histopathologic changes compared to CIN group . Sildenafil and tadalafil pre treatment ameliorates CIN related structural kidney damage and the protective potential of these agents is superior to NAC .
