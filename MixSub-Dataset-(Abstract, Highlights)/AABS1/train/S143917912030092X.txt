 Retention forestry intends to promote biodiversity by retaining deadwood and tree related microhabitats . Simultaneously production forests undergo major structural changes by conversion into near natural forests . As insect biomass is declining it is important to understand how insect communities respond to management related changes in forest structure . While some structural elements such as deadwood are studied extensively three dimensional forest structure is often neglected . Terrestrial laser scanning offers new approaches to quantify three dimensional structure but their suitability has not been evaluated with field based insect surveys .

@highlight Uneven aged mixed species forest stands promote total insect abundance.
@highlight Total insect abundance in forests is positively related to multi layered vegetation.
@highlight Non herbivorous taxa are further related to understorey vegetation structure.
@highlight Terrestrial laser scanning provides structure indices relevant for insects.
