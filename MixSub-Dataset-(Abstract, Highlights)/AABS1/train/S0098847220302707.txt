 Dopamine mediates numerous physiological processes in plants . Tyrosine decarboxylase is a common enzyme prevalent in plants and mediates numerous secondary reactions but little is known about the role of TyDC in the dopamine derivative biosynthesis and function in salt tolerance . Here apple and apple calli were utilized to study the function of

@highlight overexpression resulted in higher dopamine contents in apple plants and apple calli.
@highlight Increased antioxidant activity and ROS scavenging alleviated salt tolerance.
@highlight Overexpression of
@highlight mediated ion homeostasis.
