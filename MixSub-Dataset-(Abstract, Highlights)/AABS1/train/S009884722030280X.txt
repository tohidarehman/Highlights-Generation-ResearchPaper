 Saltwater intrusion is the landward movement of seawater which can salinize coastal farmlands and affect crop yields . Germination is an especially vulnerable life history stage for crops . Salt stress reduces a seeds ability to absorb water and causes an ion imbalance within the seed ultimately inhibiting germination and preventing crop production . Therefore growing standard crops in the face of SWI can risk crop failure . If alternative crops are more tolerant of osmotic and ionic stress they may be more suited to withstand SWI . Our objectives were to determine how salt stress and osmotic stress levels affect seed germination in standard and alternative crops in a controlled environment experiment and compare germination rates in the controlled environment with field trials . In our study region of the Eastern Shore of Maryland standard crop species include corn soybean and wheat alternative species and varieties include sorghum chloride excluding soybean barley and quinoa . Seeds of these species were germinated under different levels of salt and osmotic stress ranging from 0 to 4MPa 0111.1dSm

@highlight Salinity stress on crops is increasingly a concern for coastal farmers.
@highlight Germination is a particularly vulnerable life history stage to salinity stress.
@highlight We germinated standard and alternative crop varieties under osmotic and salt stress.
@highlight We observed no difference in germination rate between standard and alternative crops.
@highlight Barley and wheat were most tolerant of osmotic stress quinoa and soybean of salt stress.
