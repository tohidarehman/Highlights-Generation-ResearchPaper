 Forest stands fundamentally alter hydrology of a region through impacting area micrometeorology and corresponding variability in snow accumulation and melt . Bushfires significantly change these interactions through removal of forest canopy darkening of tree stems and post fire stem decay . This study quantified the impact of pre and post bushfire

@highlight Bushfire affected forests have higher snowpack evaporation result in less runoff.
@highlight Debris shed by burned trees lowers snow albedo and increases shortwave radiation flux.
@highlight Canopy cover moderates snowpack radiative and turbulent fluxes.
@highlight Reduced snowpack longevity and increased melt occur in bushfire disturbed forests.
