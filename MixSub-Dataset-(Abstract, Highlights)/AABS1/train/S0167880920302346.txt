 Euro Mediterranean countries have undergone radical changes in their traditional landscapes due to the abandonment of rural areas . Natural vegetation rapidly colonizes abandoned lands and cause changes in ecosystem functioning . Our main objective was to study how time since abandonment of vineyards influences the physical chemical and biological properties of the soil and the vegetation composition and cover . In 2016 we selected a chronosequence of six abandoned vineyards an active vineyard and a plot of land that has not been used as a vineyard for at least the last 60 years . Soil physical chemical variables including the organic matter fractions and available nutrients were analysed . To observe the variation in the biochemical properties of the soils the activities of 11 enzymes were determined relating to the main macronutrient cycles carbon nitrogen phosphorous and sulphur cycling .

@highlight The land abandonment changes the ecosystem functions.
@highlight The major changes in ecosystem occurs the first two decades since abandonment.
@highlight Soil C and N contents and biological activity increase along chronosequence.
@highlight Grassland composition determines soil microbial activity.
