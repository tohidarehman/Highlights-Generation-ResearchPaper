 To investigate the developmental exposure effect of diacetoxyscirpenol on postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis pregnant ICR mice were provided a diet containing DAS at 0 0.6 2.0 or 6.0ppm from gestational day 6 to day 21 on weaning after delivery . Offspring were maintained through postnatal day 77 without DAS exposure . On PND 21 neural stem cells and all subpopulations of proliferating progenitor cells were suggested to decrease in number in the subgranular zone at2.0ppm . At 6.0ppm increases of SGZ cells showing TUNEL

@highlight Maternal exposure effect of diacetoxyscirpenol DAS on offspring hippocampal neurogenesis was examined in mice.
@highlight Neural stem cells NSCs and all progenitor cell populations were suggested to decrease at the end of exposure on weaning.
@highlight Apoptosis due to oxidative DNA damage may be responsible for the reduction of NSCs and early stage progenitor cells.
@highlight A reduced number of PVALB
@highlight GABAergic interneurons may cause suppression of type 2 progenitor cell differentiation.
@highlight Increased RELN signals at the adult stage may ameliorate the response to recover neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity.
