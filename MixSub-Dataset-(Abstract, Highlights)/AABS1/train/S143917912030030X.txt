 We studied the role of spatial and environmental processes in the structuring of rodent metacommunities in three contiguous ecoregions that share the same species pool . The two northern ecoregions are mainly affected by anthropogenic processes while the southern one is mainly affected by natural processes . Local communities were described based on the analysis of 77 samples of barn owl pellets . To identify which processes structure each metacommunity we evaluated the percentage of variance explained by space and environment in three Variation Partitioning Redundancy Analyses . The percentage of variance in rodent metacommunities composition explained by space and environment was between 38 and 61 and was significant in all three analyses . The pure space fraction was significant for two of the three ecoregions while the pure environmental fraction was significant for all three ecoregions . The processes that structure rodent metacommunities change across the region . In all three ecoregions the species sorting played a key role while mass effect was a structuring factor for northern metacommunities . These results can be explained by species specific dispersal characteristics and environmental filtering .

@highlight The processes that structure rodent metacommunities change across the region.
@highlight Environmental processes determine the species composition in each local community.
@highlight Environmental processes determine relative abundance of each species in each local community.
@highlight Spatial processes vary among ecoregions.
@highlight Species specific dispersal characteristics act differentially in each ecoregion.
