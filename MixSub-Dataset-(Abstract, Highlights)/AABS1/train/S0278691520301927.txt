 This study aims to estimate dietary exposure to deoxynivalenol and fumonisins of infants and toddlers in Turkey . A total of 75 processed cereal based foods intended for infants and toddlers collected between July and October 2018 were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography . DON was determined in 21.3 of samples with mean middle bound level of 28.4g kg . Of the 16 quantifiable samples only one showed values above 200g kg . Fumonisin B

@highlight Dietary exposure to DON FBs for infants and toddlers in Turkey has been estimated.
@highlight DON was the most abundant mycotoxin in cereal based foods for infants and toddlers.
@highlight Of the 16 quantifiable samples only one contained DON above EU ML of 200g kg.
@highlight Mean and P95 chronic exposures to DON and FBs were below the PMTDI TDI.
@highlight There is no health risk from the DON FBs exposure for infants and toddlers in Turkey.
