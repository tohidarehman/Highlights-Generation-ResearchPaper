 The food environment is a target for policy interventions aimed at improving diet but there is a lack of consistent evidence to guide such policy interventions partially attributed to spatial measures of the food environment that are too narrow in scope . This study developed a workflow in the R programming language for characterising food access using multivariate methods adapted from community ecology not previously applied in food environment research . The workflow was tested in the city of Perth Western Australia and applied to both standard business directory data and open crowdsourced data . The workflow was run on all Census Mesh Blocks in the Perth urban area using the following steps 1 collect and process food outlet and MB data calculating a 15 min walking network isochrone around each MB centroid 2 cluster the MB based on food outlet availability and verify identified clusters using multivariate methods and 3 profile clusters using measures of diversity and accessibility . The results show three zones of food access in Perth differentiated by the type and abundance of food outlets available with better accessibility and diversity in established suburbs . The workflow is a flexible and quick tool that can help professionals and practitioners to calculate a comprehensive set of indicators of food access in any location where food outlet data is available . The combination of open and standard business directory data provides a more complete picture of the food environment than one dataset alone .

@highlight Adapt multivariate methods from community ecology for describing food environments.
@highlight Workflow developed using open tools that can be applied to any food outlet dataset.
@highlight Results in Perth indicate 7 clusters of distinct food access.
@highlight Analysis of multiple data sources provides a more complete picture of food access.
@highlight Data bias and analysis assumptions influence results.
