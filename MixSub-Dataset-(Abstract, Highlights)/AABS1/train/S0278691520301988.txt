 Seven US FDA batch certified synthetic food colors are approved for use as food additives in the United States . Perceived neurodevelopmental concerns for these colors persist . This study assessed the plausibility of such an association through the evaluation of mechanistic evidence collected from

@highlight Systematic identification of molecular events potentially related to neuro relevant processes and outcomes.
@highlight Mapped high throughput screening HTS assays from the ToxCast Tox21 database to such molecular events and or related genes.
@highlight Evaluated HTS data for seven FDA approved synthetic food colors for the mapped neuro relevant assays.
@highlight Evaluated neuro relevant data for seven FDA approved synthetic food colors in new approach methods NAMs published in the literature.
@highlight Findings support an overall lack of neuro related activity of the seven food colors with the exception of neurotransmitter signaling by erythrosine.
