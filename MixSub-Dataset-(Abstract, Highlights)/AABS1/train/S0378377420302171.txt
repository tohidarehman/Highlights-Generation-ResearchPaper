 Agricultural engineers crop physiologists and hydrologists are often forced to deploy instrumentation close to the canopy top to estimate surface eddy fluxes . This is a widely recognized problem either at farm level or research level . The eddy covariance method is grounded on hypothesis simplifications and relationships valid in the inertial sublayer and alternative methods may require either calibration or inputs that are not commonly available . The present study enables a method that combines similarity transilient and surface renewal theories in conjunction with the analysis of small eddies to estimate the friction velocity and surface fluxes of different scalars taking measurements at the canopy top . SRSE minimizes estimation of canopy parameters allows implementing a primary flux quality control and to guide instrumentation deployment . For a mature maize crop SRSE and EC surface energy balances indicated that EC was slightly more reliable than SRSE during daytime . For unstable cases the normalized mean absolute error to the available net surface energy MAE ANSE obtained by the EC and SRSE methods were 9 and 13 respectively . For stable cases during the day 10 and 11 respectively . For stable cases at night SRSE performed better than EC MAE ANSE were 23 and 16 respectively . Regardless of the half hourly eddy flux the EC and SRSE were highly correlated and in average flux of scalars nearly matched including water use efficiency . To avoid acquisition of expensive and stringent instrumentation the closure of the surface energy balance equation was forced to derive affordable approaches to estimate the latent heat flux for different stability cases .
