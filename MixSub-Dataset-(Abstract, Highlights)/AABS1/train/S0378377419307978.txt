 Irrigation and fertilizer management are essential for sustainable development of agriculture in the arid and semiarid regions . In order to obtain high yield production over irrigation and fertilization are frequently conducted by the farmer which results in a series of environmental problems in particular in the shallow groundwater areas . In this paper two year field experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of irrigation and fertilization regimes on grain yield water and nitrogen productivity of mulching cultivated maize

@highlight Fate of N fertilizer in different irrigation and fertilization regimes is quantified.
@highlight Water and N use efficiencies of mulching cultivated maize were analyzed under different regimes.
@highlight A proper irrigation and fertilization regime was proposed for maize in arid region.
