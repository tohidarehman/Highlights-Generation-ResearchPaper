 Annually variable and synchronous seed production or masting is often correlated with environmental factors and in oaks involves differential pollination success that depends on phenological synchrony in flowering . The synchronization of phenology of flowering was thought to be driven by temperature during flowering . We tested an alternative whereby phenological synchronization is driven by the timing of the onset of flowering . This hypothesis assumes that flowering synchrony is driven by interaction between daylength and temperature and individual variation in sensitivity to daylength as a phenological cue . We used long term records of airborne pollen in

@highlight Phenological synchrony of flowering drives pollination success in oaks.
@highlight We tested two mechanisms driving the flowering synchrony.
@highlight Late pollen seasons were short supporting photoperiod sensitivity hypothesis.
@highlight Long term changes in pollen phenology supported photoperiod sensitivity hypothesis.
@highlight Warming will lead to more stochastic and variable patterns of oak reproduction.
