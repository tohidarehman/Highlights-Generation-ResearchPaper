 Agricultural land use change is a global issue with significant implications for global warming and ecosystem functionality . Uncertainty regarding carbon and nitrogen sequestration and their dynamics after land use change hampers an accurate understanding of the C and N cycles . To address the influence of converting agricultural land to forest on organic carbon and N sequestration and their coupling relationships we collected topsoil and subsurface soil in afforested woodlands 10 20 and 35 yrs after the establishment of

@highlight Conversion of agricultural land to forest accelerated aggregation of soil particles.
@highlight Afforestation on farmland could sequestrate synchronously OC and N in mineral soils.
@highlight Macroaggregates dominated the accumulation of OC and N in bulk soils.
@highlight OC and N increased most during the first 20 years of afforestation.
