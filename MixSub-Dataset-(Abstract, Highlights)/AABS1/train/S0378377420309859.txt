 Different cultivation practices with mulching materials have been applied in the semi arid areas of China . However there is still insufficient systematic research on its e ects on ecological indexes and crop water productivity . Therefore a eld trial was carried out in three consecutive study years to evaluate ecological productivity crop water productivity and wheat production under six different treatments CT conventional flat tillage without mulching TSM conventional flat tillage with gravel mulching TPM conventional flat tillage with plastic film mulching RP ridges covered with plastic film and furrows without mulching RSM ridges covered with plastic film and furrows with gravel mulching RPM ridges and furrows covered with plastic film mulching . We found that different cultivation and mulching materials practices considerably improved soil moisture content crop productivity ecological e ects and evapotranspiration rates . The RP cropping system with different mulching practices signicantly increased soil moisture and ecosystem CO

@highlight Cultivation and mulching materials reduced evapotranspiration and improved soil water storage.
@highlight Different mulching materials reduced greenhouse gas emissions and increased the leaf area index and the soil water status.
@highlight Plastic film mulching significantly increased dry matter accumulation and winter wheat production.
