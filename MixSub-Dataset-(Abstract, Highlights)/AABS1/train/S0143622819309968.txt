 Broadband service providers readily use time series models to forecast broadband related to minimise disruptions to customers but also from an operational perspective . Within a competitive market minimizing future broadband faults is important for customer retention . Whilst broadband faults happen at the household level broadband service providers typically forecast broadband faults at the regional scale which hides local geographic heterogeneity . In this paper we address the issue by applying Bayesian spatio temporal statistical models to analyse the local geography of broadband faults for North West England . It drew on a unique aggregated broadband fault dataset compiled by the large British commercial broadband service provider Virgin Media . Our results support the proposed spatio temporal model which provided a significantly higher forecast accuracy and model fit when compared to the standard time series model . Incorporating geographic effects allowed the forecaster to identify how the spatial distribution of faults changes over time at a much finer spatial scale . We also found several significant predictors of broadband faults in the study area .
