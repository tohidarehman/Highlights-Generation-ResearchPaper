 Guanzhong Plain is one of the most critical maize production areas in Northwest China . It is essential to study the maize irrigation requirement and improve water use efficiency in this area . There is a lack of knowledge about the evaporation portioning and irrigation requirements of crops grown in this region . Based on evapotranspiration observed in a maize cropland using the eddy covariance technique during four growing seasons the seasonal variation of evapotranspiration components and the crop coefficients

@highlight The reliability of eddy covariance technique to measure the
@highlight in
@highlight cropland was evaluated.
@highlight The diurnal and seasonal variation of energy fluxes and seasonal variations of
@highlight in maize field were revealed.
@highlight This study provided the local
@highlight and revealed its controlling factors.
