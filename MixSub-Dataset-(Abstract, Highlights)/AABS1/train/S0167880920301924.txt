 Resilient agroecosystems are foundational for stable and profitable food feed and fiber production in the face of increasing climatic perturbations and environmental stresses . Enhanced soil and environmental benefits of cover crops applied to conservation tillage systems has been well documented . However little is known about the timespan for interactions of no tillage and cover crops to achieve enhanced yield and yield stability while lowering N fertilization . Using a long term continuous cotton experiment in southeastern USA we analyzed yield data collected from 1986 to 2018 from 32 management systems to identify how management duration controls the synergistic effect of applied mineral N rates 0 34 67 and 101 kg ha

@highlight Management duration controls the response of cotton yield and yield stability to tillage bio covers and N rate management.
@highlight Long term interaction between legume covers and no tillage increased yield stability in adverse environmental conditions.
@highlight Long term incorporation of legume species especially hairy vetch further enhanced the yield outcome from no tillage system.
