 Many agricultural communities depend on groundwater irrigation as a supplemental or primary water source . However groundwater resources are finite and depletion can make continued irrigation inviable . When modeling the economic impacts of future aquifer decline studies often assume that irrigated cropland will transition uniformly to dryland crop production . In reality irrigation has allowed crops to be grown across a wider range of soil and climate conditions than can support dryland crop production . Here we test the agronomic and economic importance of this assumption by mapping the spatiotemporal distribution of anticipated future irrigation losses across the Ogallala or High Plains Aquifer at annual 30 m resolution . We then develop a land use suitability model to determine whether these lands would transition to dryland agriculture or pasture use . We find that 22 000 km

@highlight Depletion threatens 24 of irrigated areas in the Ogallala Aquifer by 2100.
@highlight Studies often assume irrigation will transition to dryland farming upon depletion.
@highlight We map projected irrigation losses annually and land use suitability for crops or pasture.
@highlight 13 of projected irrigation losses are not suitable for dryland cropping.
@highlight Not accounting for suitability underestimates the economic impacts of depletion.
