 The quantity and composition of fatty acids in milk can influence an infant s growth and development through maternal diet . Therefore associations between maternal diet and FA composition in 74 mature human milk samples were investigated . This study aimed to obtain FA patterns in mature milk arising from different dietary habits in two geographically different areas in Slovenia Koper a coastal area and Pomurje an inland area . The results revealed statistically significant differences in the dietary intake of game freshwater fish and fresh and frozen seafood between the study areas . Among the mean percentages of 35 individual FAs in milk 19 were higher in KP and 16 were higher in MS . In KP despite the higher intake of fresh seafood the levels of saturated and monounsaturated FAs were higher and the levels of PUFAs 3 and 6 were lower compared to those in MS . The 6 3 ratio did not differ significantly between the study areas . This finding was not expected and indicates a discrepancy between the measured and self reported data the latter lack reliable data on dietary supplements . Therefore determination of FA profile is important as a promising biomarker of dietary intake in environmental health studies .

@highlight Fatty acid FA composition of mature human milk samples from an inland and a coastal area in Slovenia were investigated.
@highlight The mean percentage of 19 and 16 individual FAs in human milk was higher in the coastal and the inland areas respectively.
@highlight  6 3 ratio did not differ significantly between the study areas.
