 Despite the bioaccessibility of nutrients and contaminants present in individual seafood products has been thoroughly studied information is extremely limited in what concerns complete seafood based meals where interactions between ingredients may occur . Hence this study aimed to evaluate the effect of different ingredients and cooking processes in mercury and cadmium bioaccessibility in complete meals of tuna

@highlight Ingredients added to tuna meals decreased Hg levels but increased Hg bioaccessibility.
@highlight The consumption of two tuna meals per week 300g does not represent a potential risk for consumers.
@highlight Ingredients added to brown crab meat meal decreased Cd levels but did not change Cd bioaccessibility.
@highlight The consumption of brown crab meals 50g should be limited to once a month.
