 N fertilization is often viewed as a cheap insurance against yield loss in vegetable production because of the generally large added value resulting in application of fertilizer N often in excess of actual crop demand . In combination with the low fertilizer N recovery by many vegetable crops and the often excessive irrigation this may lead to both health and environmental risks related to high nitrate concentrations in water leaving the root zone . In this review we discuss the decisive factors in the overall N balance of field vegetable production systems and the different tools at hand to increase fertilizer use efficiency and consequently reduce N losses to the environment . Based on this we identify areas of research and technology transfer where further work is required . Only an integration of the different methods and strategies for N management may really mitigate the risk of nitrate leaching and maintain crop yields while enhancing the environmental sustainability of vegetable production systems .

@highlight Drawing up the N balance in the soil crop atmosphere continuum is the first step of N management.
@highlight Monitoring soil and crop N status can assist N management in vegetable crops.
@highlight Integrating different agronomic methods and strategies improve sustainability of N management.
@highlight A sound N management can effectively reduce N losses to water bodies in vegetable cropping systems.
