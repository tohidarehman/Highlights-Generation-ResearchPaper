 Agriculture in the semiarid region is undergoing radical changes driven by global warming and increasing incidences of extreme weather events . Predicting and evaluating the responses of crop yield and water use patterns of rainfed cropping systems according to future temperature and precipitation changes could provide important information regarding adoption of climate smart farming systems that could offer great resilience and sustainability . The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential changes in agronomic productivity hydrological balance and economic profitability of cropping systems with perennial legumes and rotation on the Loess Plateau of China affected by different future temperature and precipitation scenarios using APSIM based modeling . Five different cropping systems were investigated continuous maize continuous winter wheat continuous lucerne maize wheat soybean rotation and lucerne winter wheat rotation in Xifeng Gansu China . Five series of temperature and precipitation changes scenarios no changes in atmospheric CO

@highlight Modeling yield evapotranspiration and economic profit in different cropping systems using APSIM under projected climate scenarios.
@highlight Maize and wheat yield underwent significant reduction in projected scenarios compared with the baseline data.
@highlight Plant transpiration have not changed significantly between scenarios but evaporation decreased in some conditions markedly.
@highlight Lucerne winter wheat rotation presented the greatest potential of the sustainability under projected scenarios.
