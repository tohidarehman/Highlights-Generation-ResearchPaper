 Agriculture is one of most important economic activities that requires large amounts of water which in addition to changes in climate presents a major impact on the water availability . Excess of salt and nutrient concentrations build up damages to soil such as reduced drainage and increase in anoxic conditions in the root zone as well as decreasing productivity and usable farm lands . The objective of the present study was to evaluate the chemical vulnerability of an aquifer in arid conditions with a high level of extraction through the detection of risk zones and potential subregions of different risks . An evaluation of the quality of the groundwater was performed as a reconnaissance prior to more detailed studies in which samples of 30 wells were analyzed to determine physical chemical parameters recorded

@highlight The chemical species composition of groundwater in an agricultural zone under arid conditions was evaluated.
@highlight Risk zones were determined based on high concentrations of nitrates sulphates TDS and arsenic in the groundwater.
@highlight A multivariate analysis was used to look for the possible origins of the chemical composition of the groundwater.
@highlight The origin of salinity in irrigation water and the crop leaching requirements were obtained.
