 Oil palm growth and production is highly dependent on potassium fertilization . Presently monitoring K fertilization is difficult since it depends on soil properties crosses and other nutrients . To adjust K fertilization precisely during cultivation leaf biomarkers that can indicate changes in tree K status before the appearance of symptoms on fruit production and yield are required . However the metabolic response of oil palm leaves to K availability is poorly documented . Here we investigated the response of oil palm leaf metabolome and proteome to K availability in two crosses

@highlight Oil palm growth and production is highly dependent on potassium K fertilization.
@highlight To adjust K fertilization precisely during cultivation leaf biomarkers that can indicate changes in tree K status before the appearance of symptoms on fruit production and yield are required.
@highlight Here we investigated the response of oil palm leaf metabolome and proteome to different K fertilization regimes in two crosses 
@highlight  and
@highlight  grown in the field.
@highlight Our result show that one to two years only after the onset of K fertilization treatments there were changes in N metabolism photosynthesis and mitochondrial metabolism with a differential effect in the two crosses.
