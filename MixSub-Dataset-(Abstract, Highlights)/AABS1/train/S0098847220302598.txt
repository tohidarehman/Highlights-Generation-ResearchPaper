 Many studies ask how aluminum reduces the root growth but as Al is mostly retained in the root system physiological explanations for the also expected Al induced decrease in stomatal conductance

@highlight Aluminum Al toxicity causes significant root growth inhibition and stomatal closure.
@highlight In
@highlight  tomato Al reduces root hydraulic conductance 
@highlight  .
@highlight Al also induces abscisic acid ABA accumulation in roots and leaves of this species.
@highlight Al toxicity decreases plant water transport capacity and causes ABA accumulation.
@highlight Al induced stomatal closure may not be solely explained by the low root growth.
