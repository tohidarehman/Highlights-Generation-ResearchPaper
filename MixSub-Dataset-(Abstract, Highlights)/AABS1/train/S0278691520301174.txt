 Endoplasmic reticulum stress is a normal molecular process induced by the over accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins . ER stress induces the unfolded protein response which reduces global protein synthesis increases ER capacity and protein degradation to restart ER homeostasis allowing cell survival . However the over induction of UPR can also trigger inflammatory processes tissue damage and cell death . ER stress is involved in several pathologies like endothelial dysfunction diabetes and heart liver kidney or neurological diseases . Although the progression of these diseases is the result of several pathological mechanisms oxidative stress has been widely related to these pathologies . Moreover ER stress can establish a progressive pathological cycle with oxidative stress . Therefore the use of natural antioxidants able to modulate both oxidative and ER stress can be a new strategy to mitigate these diseases . This review is focused on the effects of natural antioxidant compounds on ER stress in endothelial dysfunction diabetes and heart liver kidney or neurological diseases .

@highlight Natural compounds with antioxidant properties can regulate ER stress and UPR.
@highlight Several diseases are related to oxidative stress and ER stress induced apoptosis.
@highlight Natural antioxidants reduce apoptosis and inflammation by reducing ER stress.
@highlight Antioxidants can induce a hormetic effect and regulate other signaling processes.
@highlight Natural compounds can be a promising strategy to counteract many diseases.
