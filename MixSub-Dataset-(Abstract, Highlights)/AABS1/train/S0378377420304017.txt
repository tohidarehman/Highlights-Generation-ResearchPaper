 Global warming and declining water resources are threatening the sustainability of rice production and global food security . Conventional continuously flooded system of rice production is a major contributor to rice production but it requires a huge amount of water input and poses a severe threat to the ecosystem due to emission of greenhouse gases and accumulation of heavy metals and mercury in the rice grains . The declining soil health increasing micronutrient deficiencies and declining organic matter are are also threatening the long term sustainability of the conventional rice production system . In this scenario alternate wetting and drying irrigation system is a promising water saving economically viable and ecofriendly alternative to CF . In this review we discuss the influence of AWD on nutrient dynamics rice growth and yield formation grain quality water use efficiency emission of GHGs and economics in comparison with the CF rice production system . Overall AWD irrigation technique can reduce the total water inputs CH

@highlight Conventional rice production requires 35 times more water than other cereals.
@highlight Alternate wetting and drying AWD is a water saving and eco friendly option.
@highlight AWD requires 2570 less water than conventional system without yield reduction.
@highlight AWD reduces GHGs emission and restrict As and Hg accumulation in rice grains.
