 Vineyards are important perennial often intensively managed agroecosystems . In most vineyards ground vegetation is controlled by tillage and or the application of broadband herbicides with scarcely known effects on the soil fauna . We studied a total of 16 commercial vineyards in the Trnave wine region a typical viticultural region in Transylvania Central Romania . As a model organism for surface dwelling arthropods we examined the response of springtail species richness and activity density to vineyard tillage practices fertilization and herbicide application . A total of 24 species in 10 families were found in the studied vineyards . Principal coordinates analysis identified three distinct springtail communities linked to tillage and fertilization practice . Springtail species richness was positively associated with high tillage intensity . Springtail activity density in inter rows was positively correlated with inter row tillage and herbicide application under grapevines . For the first time we could show that springtail species assemblages in vineyards were characterized by high niche overlap regarding soil quality organic matter pH CaCO

@highlight Vegetation management in vineyard inter rows includes tillage and or herbicide application.
@highlight Diversity and activity of surface Collembola communities was positively correlated with tillage intensity and herbicide application.
@highlight Increased Collembola activity after disturbance appear to be the result of disrupted competitor predator control mechanisms.
