 Deep frying is the most common food preparation method manifestations of color taste flavor and fried consistency . The beneficial role of vegetable oils become deteriorate when repeatedly treated with higher temperature and air . Repeatedly heated cooking oils produce various byproducts containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and aldehydes well known to be a carcinogenic mutagenic and tumorigenic properties . RCO is nowadays one of the often consumed media for cooking and frying which intake can cause various unhealthy adverse effects including various cancer in the multiple organs . Hence the present comprehensive study targets to provide the intake of RCO elevate the risks of human breast cancer . The data on RCO and its impacts were obtained via various electronic findings and library databases . Notable studies have confirmed that the effects of RCO have been attributed to their unfavorable effects and underlying molecular mechanisms can also strongly promoting tumorigenic effects in the mammary organ .

@highlight Cooking oil fume exposure has adverse effects on human well being.
@highlight Deep heated frying emits polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAH and aldehydes.
@highlight PAH and aldehydes are significant contributors to carcinogenic and mutagenic effects.
@highlight Consumption of RCO and its oxidized compounds elevate the risk of mammary tumors via DNA mutations.
@highlight RCO promotes endocrine disruption through estrogen receptor signaling pathway.
