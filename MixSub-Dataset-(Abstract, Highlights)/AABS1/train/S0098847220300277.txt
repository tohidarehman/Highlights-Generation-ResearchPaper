 Fragmentation and increased summer drought are two main threats to Mediterranean forests . Forest fragmentation has many negative impacts on forests but could attenuate water stress on Mediterranean species by reducing intraspecific competition or improving soil properties at forest edges . However little is known about the combined effects of drought and fragmentation on tree functioning . We evaluated the effect of forest fragmentation on tree functioning under severe drought periods in continental holm oak forests

@highlight Forest fragmentation attenuates severe drought effects maintaining tree functioning.
@highlight Drought severity increased the positive effects of fragmentation on tree water status.
@highlight Trees located at forest interiors had clear symptoms of leaf photochemical inhibition.
@highlight Small forest fragments cope with severe drought maintaining better tree functionality.
