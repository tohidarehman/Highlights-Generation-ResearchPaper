 Robusta coffee is critically important for the economy and farmers of Vietnam but also requires substantial irrigation leading to dwindling water resources . Developing clear recommendations for improved irrigation water management while maintaining or increasing yield is therefore a key knowledge need for the coffee industry . We analyse 10 cropping year data of 558 farms across four major coffee producing provinces in Vietnams Central Highlands using CROPWAT and hierarchical Bayesian modelling to identify irrigation requirements under different climatic conditions and investigate the potential for improved irrigation management strategies . In average rainfall years the majority of farmers in Dak Nong and Lam Dong supplied an equivalent of 455909 L tree
