 Terrestrial evapotranspiration is a major component of the surface hydrological cycle and controls land atmosphere feedbacks by modulating the surface energy budget . Accurate ET quantification at global or regional scales is crucial for understanding variations in carbon and water cycling in a changing environment . Although various grid based ET data models have been developed using multiple approaches these vary in concept and physical scheme leading to differences in performance . We examine uncertainties associated with the limitations of the physics used to assist in model selection and improvement . We evaluate multiple ET data models including estimates derived from a variety of land surface models based on the operational North American Land Data Assimilation System phase 2 and the experimental NASA LIS based NLDAS Testbed drivers and satellite retrievals compared to water budget derived ET and tower observations . Overall all models are able to capture the spatial variability of mean annual water balance based ET ET

@highlight We evaluate multiple ET data models including NLDAS 2 and experimental NLDAS Testbed.
@highlight The NLDAS Testbed ensemble mean has a slightly lower uncertainty than that of NLDAS 2.
@highlight The comparison suggests some weaknesses and strengths in NLDAS Testbed.
@highlight The findings help further improvement of these models and support NLDAS development.
