 Management practices environmental and social factors shape complex agricultural landscapes . In turn the structure of such landscapes impacts biodiversity conservation for instance by mediating wildlife migration between agricultural and habitat patches and thus determining the persistence of metapopulations . Landscape ecology has used heterogeneity metrics and has systematically examined how they change with grain size and landscape extent to formally characterize a landscape its structure and potential role in the persistence of wild metapopulations . These metrics provide valuable information regarding the landscape connectivity patch diversity and shape . However heterogeneity metrics have rarely been applied to tropical or subtropical peasant managed landscapes even though this type of landscape occupies most of the agricultural surface in or near biodiversity hotspots . We focus on a peasant managed agricultural landscape in Oaxaca Mexico . For this landscape we mapped and quantified the land use classes 48 for agricultural land use with

@highlight Peasant agricultural landscapes in the tropics are characterized by high heterogeneity.
@highlight In the peasant landscape studied agriculture constitutes a highly connected matrix.
@highlight Highly connected landscapes enable the coexistence of agriculture and conservation.
@highlight Subsets of heterogeneity metrics can help characterize and compare these landscapes.
