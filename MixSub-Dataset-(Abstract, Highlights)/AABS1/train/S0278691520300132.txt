 Syringic acid a natural polyphenol found in fruits and vegetables is claimed to show notable hepatoprotection . Nevertheless low solubility and bioavailability hamper the application of SA . This study aimed to investigate the potential of TPGS F127 F68 mixed polymeric micelles as a sustained and liver targeting nanocarrier for SA . Herein the prepared SA loaded TPGS F127 F68 mixed polymeric micelles were spherically shaped and homogeneously distributed nanoparticles with high entrapment efficiency and sustained release . Besides
