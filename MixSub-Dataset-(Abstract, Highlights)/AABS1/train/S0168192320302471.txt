 Unmanned aerial system based remote sensing can provide high spatial and temporal resolution crop monitoring for precision management . Existing crop monitoring UAS primarily use conventional techniques such as multi spectral broadband vegetation indices to track canopy structure biomass . Recently developed lightweight hyperspectral sensors can track crop physiology and performance via complementary signals such as solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence and photochemical reflectance index that can be derived from hyperspectral reflectance . However few existing UAS can acquire high quality SIF and hyperspectral reflectance . We designed a novel UAS that simultaneously captures far red SIF and hyperspectral reflectance using a single bifurcated fiber and motorized arm to measure downwelling and upwelling irradiance . The UAS was tested over a heterogeneous corn field with spatially varying crop yield potential and a set of soybean and corn plots under differing nutrient treatments . Our UAS can maintain stability under low to moderate winds with 0.4m geolocation accuracy 0.1m altitude drift and 1.5 error of the fiber optic from nadir position during scanning . Weekly seasonal campaigns reveal that SIF outperforms conventional VIs such as the normalized difference vegetation index for distinguishing plots with different crop yield potential especially after canopy closure when NDVI tends to saturate . The UAS can capture the diurnal dynamics of SIF and PRI for both corn and soybean . At the seasonal scale SIF acquired from the UAS correlates well with that from a fixed SIF tower system
