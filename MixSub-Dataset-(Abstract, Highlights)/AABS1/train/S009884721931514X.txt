 Seed crop yield is determined by manipulating source sink interaction . To characterize the metabolic and signaling network encompassing plant hormones and sugar seed yield in two cultivars of

@highlight Enhanced hexose sucrose ratio is an indicator of leaf senescence progression.
@highlight Sucrose phloem loading at the bolting stage is an important determinant of seed yield.
@highlight Sucrose phloem loading is modulated by ABA responsive sucrose signalling network.
@highlight Seed yield is determined by ABA dependent sugar signalling pathway.
