 In irrigated Mediterranean conditions there is a lack of knowledge about the best combination of tillage and N fertilization practices to reduce soil nitrous oxide N

@highlight An increase in the fertilizer N rate increased N

@highlight Denitrification was the main pathway under no tillage for N
