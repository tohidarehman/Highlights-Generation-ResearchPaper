 Excessive accumulation of white adipose tissue is a hallmark of obesity and perturbs systemic metabolism . Intermittent Fasting is a periodic and repeated energy restriction strategy utilized to combat obesity and improve metabolic parameters . Many studies have shown that one of the main targets of IF is WAT . This heterogenous organ is sensitive to nutritional conditions and undergoes dynamic remodeling to mediate IF benefits . In this review we aim to discuss the impact of IF on various WAT cell components including adipocytes adipocyte precursor cells immune cells and vascular cells . Furthermore we highlight areas of research that require further exploration and propose overarching mechanisms that may mediate IF benefits observed in preclinical models .

@highlight IF induces dynamic remodeling of white adipose tissue cellular components which mediates IF induced weight loss and metabolic improvements.
@highlight IF promotes white adipose tissue beiging thermogenesis and angiogenesis while decreasing inflammation and extracellular matrix deposition.
@highlight BHB and AMPK are potential overarching mechanisms for IF induced WAT remodeling.
