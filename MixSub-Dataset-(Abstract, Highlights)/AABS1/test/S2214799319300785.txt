 The production chain of fermented sausages can be considered a major source of the dissemination of antibiotic resistance spreading from farm to the final product . The natural microbiota involved in the complete process may carry AR genes which can be potentially transferred to pathogens or opportunistic bacteria thus representing a risk to human and animal health . Coagulase negative staphylococci are a dominant microbial group in fermented sausages and often used as starter cultures . Few studies are available on their potential for AR gene transference . This mini review focuses on the assessment of AR in staphylococci associated with sausage production chain combining traditional analyses with a metagenomic approach in order to draw some guidelines to prevent AR spread .

@highlight Meat fermentation can be successful to reduce the antibiotic resistance spreading.
@highlight Starter cultures without antibiotic resistance can contribute to food safety.
@highlight Traditional and metagenomic analyses are important to assess antibiotic resistance.
