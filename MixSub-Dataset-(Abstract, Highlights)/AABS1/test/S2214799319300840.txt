 In the last few decades the search for new bioactive compounds able to fight several chronic degenerative diseases has increased . In this context natural sources are especially appealing . Among these new products peptides are included for the promising bioactivities and potential applications . In fact bioactive peptides represent specific sequences of amino acids with numerous health effects so they can be used for the formulation of new drugs nutraceuticals and ingredients for functional foods . They can be obtained from different protein sources both of animal and of vegetable origin . In particular here it is shown an overview of recent data on some bioactive peptides of plant origin .

@highlight Plant biopeptides can have high biological value like animal ones.
@highlight Bioactive peptides can be obtained also from by products and waste of plant origin.
@highlight Enzymatic hydrolysis represents the main method for the production of biopeptides.
@highlight Fermentation represents a significant alternative to the enzymatic method.
