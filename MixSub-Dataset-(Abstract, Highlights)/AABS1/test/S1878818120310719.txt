 Steep declines in the development of antimicrobial agents have been reported in recent years however there has been an increase in both the number of antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria and immunocompromised patients susceptible to opportunistic pathogens . Therefore the development of antimicrobial agents with new modes of action became vital to address the threats posed by the advent of bacteria that are resistant to current therapeutic agents . Nowadays filamentous fungi are regarded as a source of novel pharmacologically beneficial bioactive compounds . In the current study the crude extracts of three locally isolated fungal strains were biologically evaluated for their antimicrobial activity using a paper disk diffusion method . A fungal isolate genetically identified as a new
