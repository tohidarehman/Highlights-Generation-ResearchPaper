 Fish industry has been growing continuously over the last decades and generates huge amounts of by products . These by products come from fish head skin bones thorns and viscera . Part of them are processed for feed collagen and oil production and to a lesser extent to produce biofuels and fertilizers but many other high value bioactive compounds can be recovered . Fish fermentation which is traditionally used to increase fish shelf life results into the formation of bacteria metabolites of interest . Applied to by products fermentation increases the quality of protein hydrolysates oil and produces antioxidant compounds . This technology which is safe environmental friendly and poor energy consuming presents advantages for future applications .
