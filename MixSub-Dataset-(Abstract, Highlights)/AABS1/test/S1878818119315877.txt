@highlight Response surface methodology enhanced decolourization of 2g L methylene blue.
@highlight The use of banana peel as growth substrate provides smart conversion of waste to wealth.
@highlight Decolourization under highly alkaline pH is advantageous since most textile wastewater is alkaline in nature.
@highlight Immobilized cells in polyurethane foam could be reused up to 12 cycles without loss in activity.
