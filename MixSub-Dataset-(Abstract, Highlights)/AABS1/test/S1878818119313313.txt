 Palm oil mill effluent the liquid discharge of palm oil milling process is rich in organic carbon nitrogen and minerals . Over the years dark fermentation has been chosen to treat POME and to generate biohydrogen . This study was conducted to further improve this process by evaluating the effect of the nitrogen to carbon ratio and concentration of ferric ion Fe

@highlight Synthetic media was used as a model for POME in the fermentation study.
@highlight Three different sources of nitrogen were tested on biohydrogen productivity.
@highlight The fermentation process has been subjected to the C N ratio and ferric ion concentration variations.
@highlight Fermentation of POME resulted in biohydrogen yield of 1.88 mol
@highlight  mol
