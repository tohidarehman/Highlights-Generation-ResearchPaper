 Microalgae offer fascinating highlights to be enable them as elective raw material for different applications through bio refining process . They have special capacities to use them for biotechnology oriented applications . In this way this review examines to grow the extent of incorporating microalgae along with different other biorefinery applications to upgrade their maintainability . The utilization of microalgae as animal and fish feed manures pharmaceutical cosmeceutical environmental and other biotechnological applications are altogether assessed . It additionally features the boundaries openings improvements what s more probabilities of expanding the extent of microalgae through techno economic analysis . This review infers that subsidizing supported research and a move of microalgal research objective from biofuels generation to bio refinery co items can ensure them as valuable resource . In addition innovation joining is inescapable to bypass the expense of biomass handling of microalgae . It is anticipated that this review would be useful to decide the future job of microalgae in bio refinery applications .
