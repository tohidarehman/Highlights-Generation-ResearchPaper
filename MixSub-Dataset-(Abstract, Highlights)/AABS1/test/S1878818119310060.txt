 In this study response surface methodology was employed for the optimization of bioprocess parameters for enhanced extracellular protease production by a native

@highlight Protease production from
@highlight Ab15 ES was optimized using RSM.
@highlight The quadratic model of RSM was significant for protease optimization studies.
@highlight The bioprocess parameters significantly influenced protease production.
@highlight A 4.4 fold enhancement in protease yield was obtained in the optimized medium.
@highlight The predicted fermentation conditions could be used for mass protease production.
