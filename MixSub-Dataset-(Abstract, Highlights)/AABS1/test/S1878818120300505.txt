 known as Murikuti is a traditionally used medicinal plant . Phytochemical screening of leaves shows the presence of bioactive reducing agents . Gold nanoparticles were prepared using aqueous extract of HA leaves at various conventional methods . Concentration variation of gold nanoparticles was studied and optimized under room temperature conditions . Gold nanoparticles were obtained in 5s . Refluxing method and homogenization method was used to prepare reduced graphene oxide and nanocomposite respectively . The prepared metal and non metallic nanoparticles were characterized by spectroscopic techniques such as UVVisible spectroscopy Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy X Ray Diffraction Raman spectroscopy Thermal analysis and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy . The average size of the gold nanoparticles is 22.02nm as of XRD calculations with desired peaks at 38.4 and 44.6 and this attributed to 111 and 222 planes respectively . Gold nanoparticles of size 34.80nm were seen under FESEM . The synthesized nanoparticles were active against selected Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria . Synthesized nanoparticles showed less cell viability on A431 skin cancer cell lines . Apoptotic cell death for HAaNP treated cancer cell lines was noted by Acridine Orange Ethidium bromide dual staining and Propidium Iodide staining method . The findings of this study clearly portray the application of nanoparticles using
