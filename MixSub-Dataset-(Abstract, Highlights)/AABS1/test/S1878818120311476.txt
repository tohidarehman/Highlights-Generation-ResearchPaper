 Chitooligosaccharides show interesting bioactivities being a promising product for the pharmaceutical industry . The use of immobilized enzymes for the COS is interesting as long as the enzyme is stable for industrial purposes . This paper investigated the best condition for immobilization of chitosanase cellulase and glucosidase via adsorption and covalent bond aiming chitosan hydrolysis . For both strategies the conditions were varied to define the best method for each enzyme and then they were compared in stability tests . The results showed the optimum hydrolysis temperature for all enzymes was 55C with pH 6.0 for chitosanase and cellulase and pH 4.0 for glucosidase . In relation to the immobilization by adsorption the pH 5.0 was the best for all enzymes and the enzyme load of 25 U g

@highlight Cellulases and Glucosidases chitosanolytic performances were not extremely affected by the pH change.
@highlight Chitosanases showed an stability improvement after immobilization comparable with the performances of commercial enzymes.
@highlight Chitosanases immobilized through adsorption preserved up to 70 of their initial chitosanolytic activity after 6 cycles.
@highlight For all three enzymes covalent bonding promoted more stability than adsorption as immobilization method.
