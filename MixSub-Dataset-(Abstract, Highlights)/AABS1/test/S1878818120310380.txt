 is an aromatic plant highly appreciated for its essential oil and used to treat various illnesses . The present work focuses on the study of certain pharmacological effects Pelargonium graveolens extracts . The contents of phenolic compounds were quantified by colorimetric methods . Antioxidant anti tyrosinase and anti urease activities were performed on a 96 well microplate . The photoprotective action of the extracts was also determined measuring the sun protection factor . Furthermore antimicrobial activity was evaluated against six bacterial and two fungal strains using the agar disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration . The results showed that the methanolic extract contained the highest amounts of total phenolic flavonoids flavonols and condensed tannins 381.252.65g GAE mg 330.0810.88g QE mg 181.522.35g QE mg and 246.623.26g CE mg of extract respectively . Important antioxidant activity was demonstrated by the extracts particularly the methanol extract which was the most powerful . In addition an interesting inhibitory effect was exerted by the extracts against urease and tyrosinase the methanol extract was the most potent with IC
