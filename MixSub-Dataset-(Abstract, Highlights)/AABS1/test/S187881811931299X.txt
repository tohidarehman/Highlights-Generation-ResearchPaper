 The cornerstone of nanoscience and nanotechnology are nanoparticles which have immense power and functional ability in diverse fields . Nanoparticles are synthesized by physical chemical methos but limitations are due to its toxicity . We have discussed few green synthesis routes which are eco friendly and less toxic methods including alage microorganisms plants etc .. Expoiting the potential of medicinal plants is one of the green synthesis routes and is significant because the current therapeutic approaches have toxicity problems and microbial multidrug resistance issues . As the metal nanoparticles have received great attention across the globe so in this study we have discussed and focused many different metallic nanoparticles obtained by green synthesis using medicinal plants . We have also discussed the types size and medicinal properties like antibacterial antifungal anticancer antiviral activities of nanoparticles . The biomolecules secondary metabolites and coenzymes present in the plants help in easy reduction of metal ions to nanoparticles . Such nanoparticles are considered as potential antioxidants and promising candidates in cancer treatment . The simplified model summarises the green synthesis its characterization using physicochemical means and their biomedical applications . Succinctly we have discussed the recent advances in green synthesis of metallic nanoparticles milestones therapeutic applications and future perspectives of biosynthesized nanoparticles from some important medicinal plants .
