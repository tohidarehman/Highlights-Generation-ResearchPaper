 Laccase has become a biocatalyst of interest in biotechnological and industrial sector due to the ability to degrade an array of natural and synthetic toxicants . Consequently laccase producing fungus was isolated from a soil sample collected from crude oil contaminated site and identified . Laccase production was carried out using medium formulated with agro wastes and the produced laccase was partially purified and characterized . Synthetic dyes decolorization potential of the laccase was likewise evaluated . The fungal isolate coded as CSB01 displayed remarkable laccase activity on agar plate . Based on the internal transcribed spacer sequence analysis it was identified as

@highlight Fungal isolate with laccase production potential was isolated from oil spill polluted site.
@highlight The isolated was identified as
@highlight sp. Omeje following ITS sequence analysis.
@highlight The isolate demonstrated considerable laccase activity in agro wastes formulated medium.
@highlight Purified laccase showed pH and temperature optima of 7.5 and 50C respectively.
@highlight The laccase showed considerable potential for the decolorization of synthetic dyes.
