 We investigated the solid state fermentation process as a tool to increase the levels of polyphenolic compounds of tamarind seed flour and mixed peel and seed flour . The 80 ethanol extracts from SF showed higher total phenolic and total flavonoid contents than fermented PSF . After fermentation PSF and SF showed TPC levels increased by 67 and 524 respectively and TFC levels increased by 650 and 1521 respectively when compared with unfermented flours . Gallic acid was the dominant compound in all extracts the extracts of fermented PSF had the highest levels of gallic acid ethyl gallate and propyl gallate when compared with extracts of unfermented flour . Extracts from fermented and unfermented tamarind by products showed potential as natural additives or sources of bioactive compounds .

@highlight Fermented seed flour showed higher TPC and TFC 
@highlight Gallic acid was the major compound in all extracts 
@highlight Propyl gallate was only found in mixed peel and seed flour 
@highlight SSF efficiently increased the polyphenolic compounds in tamarind by products.
