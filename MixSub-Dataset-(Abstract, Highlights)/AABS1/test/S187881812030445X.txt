 Plant tissue culture is considered as a basic and fundamental component of plant biotechnology and is considered a good approach for green synthesis of nanoparticles because it is safe eco friendly and clean method . In the current study callus extract of

@highlight Callus culture of
@highlight was produced by murashige and skoog MS medium.
@highlight Silver nanoparticles Ag NPs were Bio callus synthesized from
@highlight callus Bio callus synthesis .
@highlight Characterized by UVVis spectroscopy TEM SEM EDX DLS FT IR and XRD.
@highlight Callus mediated Ag NPs expressed the excellent anti bacterial activities.
