 Fast exhaustion of petroleum reserves and environmental pollution due to the ever growing consumption of petroleum fuels have been the two major distresses all over the world . This work mainly focuses on decreasing the usage of petroleum products and their demand . Accordingly it is aimed at investigations of the utilization of Jatropha Methyl Ester derived from Jatropha oil as fuel in four stroke Compression Ignition engine . The transesterification process is employed to prepare the JME and to investigate the influence level of the methanol quantity the concentration of catalyst as well as stirrer speed on the production of JME a process parameter optimization was carried out with the aid of response surface methodology and analysis of variance . The associations between the factors were established by a linear regression model . High yield production is obtained from the L

@highlight Ester yield is greatly influenced by methanol quantity stirrer speed and catalyst concentration.
@highlight The optimum methanol catalyst concentration and stirrer speed are found as 110ml 1.036g and 1200rpm respectively.
@highlight The yield increased with increased quantity of methanol catalyst and stirrer speed.
