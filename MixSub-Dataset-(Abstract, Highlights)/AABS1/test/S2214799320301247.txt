 Hematopoietic stem progenitor cells are self renewing multipotent progenitors that sustain hematopoiesis and occupy the bone marrow . The increasing incidence of obesity has led to an expanding body of literature examining the effects of high fat diet induced obesity on HSPCs . These studies indicate that diet induced obesity results in HSPC depletion and overproduction of myeloid cells during stress and steady state hematopoiesis . These effects are mediated by cell autonomous mechanisms and alterations in the HSPC niche . Emerging work is revealing that dietary components in high fat diets or altered by obesity such as saturated fatty acids cholesterol and vitamin D have effects on HSPC function that are distinct from obesity .

@highlight High fat diets increase hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell proliferation.
@highlight Omega 3 fatty acids in the Mediterranean diet reduce the inflammatory profile.
@highlight Hypercholesterolemia promotes hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell proliferation.
@highlight Hematopoietic stem cell intracellular cholesterol accumulation increases proliferation.
@highlight Vitamin D receptor signaling in niche cells induces hematopoietic stem cell mobilization.
