 Callus induction and its subsequent regeneration is an important issue to study the genetic variability in breeding and biotechnological program . Under this study various physiological characteristics of calli were evaluated based on ten indigenous and six exotic potato genotypes . Correlation matrix mean rank and standard deviation of rank related to the physiological states were also studied . According to the mean rank and standard deviation of rank potato genotypes were classified into three distinct groups such as good fair and poor . In this study Surjamukhi Granola Sheelbilati Arun and Sindurkouta exhibited good callusing while Courage Diamant Jamalu Sadaguti Patnai and Cardinal showed fair index . Lalpakri Asterix Chollisha Dohazari and Ausha displayed low callusing index . Among the tested genotypes ANOVA DMRT and correlation co efficient of all
