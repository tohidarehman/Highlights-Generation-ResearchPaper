 This work aimed to enhance the biodegradation of synthetic textile wastewater using pyrolyzed sludge from an effluent treatment plant of a textile industry as biofilm carrier . The control carrier was compared to a carrier supplemented with nutrients that were sequentially adsorbed . These nutrients are essential for microbial metabolism . First the decolorization of the azo dye Reactive Red 141 was tested and then the biodegradation of synthetic textile wastewater was analyzed . The microorganisms present in each condition were identified by mass spectrometry . The supplemented carrier enhanced RR141 decolorization 3.6 fold and 1.8 fold when compared to free biomass and control carrier respectively . The dye biodegradation followed a pseudo second order kinetics . The use of the supplemented carrier increased the rate constant 4.3 fold and 13.8 fold in relation to the use of control carrier and free biomass respectively . For the synthetic textile wastewater the supplemented carrier enhanced the decolorization 2.9 fold and 1.6 fold compared to free biomass and control carrier respectively . The decolorization also followed pseudo second order kinetics and there were increases of 8.8 fold and 3.5 fold in the rate constant with the use of the supplemented carrier in relation to free biomass and control carrier respectively . Biofilm microorganisms were identified by mass spectrometry which showed the presence of aerobic
