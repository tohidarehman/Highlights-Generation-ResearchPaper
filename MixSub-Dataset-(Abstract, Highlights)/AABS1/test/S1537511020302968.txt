 Commercial sand media filters adopt different underdrain designs with pod wand and spike designs being the most common . Studies about the consequences of using these configurations are often not conclusive since auxiliary elements and dimensions vary between filters . Here computational fluid dynamics simulations were carried out comparing underdrain designs in filters with equal sized diffuser plates and same inlet inner and outlet diameters . Seven underdrain pod type designs were analysed ranging from a market model to one with more than 50 of pods . Designs with equal number of pods but with different spatial distributions were investigated . Two wand and two spike type underdrain models were also evaluated . The main variables analysed were pressure and volumetric flowrate . Results confirmed that the flow uniformity through the filter was crucial to achieve low pressure drop values . Pressure losses through the sand were the most important contribution to the filter pressure drop for all cases . The water only region at the inlet had low relevance in terms of pressure losses . All underdrain designs had similar pressure drops at the exit collector chamber or pipe . Pod type designs with the same slot open area as wand and spike type configurations clearly had a better efficiency since wand and spike type designs had faces opposing the incoming flow . Pod and spike type designs with similar horizontal projected upward slot areas behaved alike in both filtration and backwashing modes with a better performance for the spike type configuration . Recommended spike type designs should cover most of the filter cross sectional area .
