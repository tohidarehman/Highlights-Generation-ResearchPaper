 There is a great interest in prebiotics consumptions eminence by their health promoting properties and economic market value . Filamentous fungi have been implicated as the key producers of fructosyltransferase and inulinase for synthesis of fructooligosaccharides which is used as a bioactive ingredient in functional foods . In this study sixty one indigenous coprophilous fungal strains were isolated purified to monoculture and investigated for their potential use in biotransformation of sucrose and inulin into fructooligosaccharides and inulooligosaccharides by producing Ftase and inulinase enzymes respectively . The molecular identification by 18S rDNA sequencing and morpho taxonomic keys revealed that axenic fungal strains belonged to the genera
