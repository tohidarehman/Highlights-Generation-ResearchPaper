 Probiotics are modern day panacea with claims to alleviate or cure everything from diarrhea to obesity and Alzheimers disease . They seem effective for numerous conditions although these views have been challenged recently . Greater issue is the lack of confirmed efficacy for majority of claims provided by producers . While offering products without adequate clinical research industry has more simplistic approach for probiotic treatments that is one formula fits all . In contrast recent studies showed different efficacies of probiotic mixtures with multiple strains without fully understanding factors behind it . Furthermore important parameter for prescribing probiotic treatment is the individual native microbiota . Interactions among probiotic strains and microbiota need more research so there is a long way paved with big data and chemometric analysis before it is possible to make full use of probiotics .
