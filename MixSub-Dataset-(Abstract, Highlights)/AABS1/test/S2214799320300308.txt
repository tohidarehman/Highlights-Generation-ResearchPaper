 Holistic methods at the basis of the foodomics approach are allowing the in depth understanding at molecular and supramolecular level of the complexity of food matrix . The latter in turn affects the nutrient bioaccessibility one of the crucial factors impacting on the final effect of diets . However many levels of complexity are emerging relating to food human interactions while bolus descends along the whole gastrointestinal tract . Such complexity makes

@highlight High resolution food description is essential for bioaccessibility modelling.
@highlight Integration of
@highlight and
@highlight models contributes to unravel the complexity of food human interactions
@highlight Biomarkers profiling needs time resolved analyses to include crucial kinetics aspects.
