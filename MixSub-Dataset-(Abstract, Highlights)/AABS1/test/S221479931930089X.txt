 There has been an explosion of research on the behavior of fatty foods under gastrointestinal conditions especially on the bioaccessibility of hydrophobic bioactives such as omega 3 fatty acids nutraceuticals vitamins preservatives and pesticides . This article provides a brief overview of recent advances in understanding the molecular and physicochemical basis of the digestion of lipids within the gastrointestinal tract as well as the bioaccessibility of hydrophobic bioactives . In particular we highlight the development of new methods of loading hydrophobic bioactives into colloidal delivery systems progress in excipient foods the use of

@highlight Many different colloidal delivery systems have been created for hydrophobic bioactives.
@highlight Researchers are developing new ways of loading bioactives such as the pH shift method.
@highlight Increasingly researchers are using
@highlight studies to test the bioavailability and efficacy of bioactives.
@highlight Progress is being made in developing standardized methods to test bioavailability and model food matrices.
