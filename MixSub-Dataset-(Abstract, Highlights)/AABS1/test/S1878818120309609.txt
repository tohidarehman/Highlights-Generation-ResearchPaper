 In the present practice central composite rotatable design of response surface methodology was used to optimise inulinase immobilization onto duolite XAD by gultaraldehyde cross linking . After optimization at optimal levels of variables maximal inulinase activity yield and immobilization yield attained was 53.2 and 76.45 respectively . A very narrow difference between predicted and experimental results confirms the authenticity of the present model . Besides coefficient of determination

@highlight Duolite XAD was successfully derivatized by glutaraldehyde treatment.
@highlight Inulinase was successfully immobilized onto GA activated duolite XAD.
@highlight Immobilized inulinase efficaciously used for fructose production in a batch system.
@highlight Developed biocatalyst showed good operational stability for inulin hydrolysis.
