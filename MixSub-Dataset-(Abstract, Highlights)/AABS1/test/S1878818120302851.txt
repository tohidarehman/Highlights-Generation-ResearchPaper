 Abiotic stress factors hugely affect the agricultural productivity worldwide out of which the most hazardous factor is soil salinization . Most of the crops species are susceptible to increased soil salinity there is a great interest in developing new strategies to ameliorate salt stress as well as to make robust crop species . In this study we have selected saline sodic soil . The isolation of bacterial species was carried out on the basis of salt tolerance ability and having PGP traits by enrichment technique . Characterization and identification of isolate was done by 16S rDNA and Gyrase B . The isolate SGM 1 could grow at increasing salt concentrations up to 12 w v NaCl with wide temperature and pH ranges .

@highlight SGM 1 is an indigenous salt tolerant isolate.
@highlight Increase in salt concentration causes negative chemotaxis and cell elongation due to inhibition of septum formation.
@highlight Wide range of pH and temperature tolerance were also exhibited by this indigenous stress tolerant isolate.
@highlight Different agriculturally important plant growth promoting traits possessed by the isolate SGM 1.
@highlight SGM 1 caused amelioration of the salt stress to
@highlight plants.
