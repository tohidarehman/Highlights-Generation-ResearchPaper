 A substantial proportion of African population is food insecure of low socioeconomic background . While much effort is made to address cost safety and nutritional quality of food for economically vulnerable consumers research specifically focusing on food acceptance and preference is seriously lacking . Here we present examples of recently published studies to demonstrate the value of food research involving African consumer testing . A systematic search of the literature was performed and 44 studies reviewed . Gaps in research on the topics and approaches used by researchers when conducting consumer tests with these consumers were identified . The review concludes with a discussion about modifications of test methodologies that may be required when conducting consumer tests with low income food insecure consumers . The consumer studies with undernourished or vulnerable individuals have clearly demonstrated the importance of doing such studies to formulate foods adapted for these target markets . These studies are important to fight undernutrition .

@highlight Economically vulnerable consumers are conscious of food sensory quality.
@highlight Development and validation of sensory test methods for use with low socioeconomic consumers are needed.
@highlight The food choice motives of consumers in African countries need to be better understood.
@highlight Researchers in African countries need to adapt best practice principles to apply under local circumstances.
