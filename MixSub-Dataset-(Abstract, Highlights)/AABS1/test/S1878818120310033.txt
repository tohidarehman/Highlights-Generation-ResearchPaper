 The current study attempts to statistically optimize various process parameters involved in the solid state fermentative production of lovastatin from endophytic

@highlight This is the first report on optimization of lovastatin production from endophytic
@highlight Rapeseed oil cake was successfully used as substrate to enhance lovastatin production.
@highlight B group vitamins MgSO
@highlight and sodium acetate were found to positively influence lovastatin production.
@highlight Statistical optimization resulted in a 42 fold increase in lovastatin production as compared to unoptimized conditions.
