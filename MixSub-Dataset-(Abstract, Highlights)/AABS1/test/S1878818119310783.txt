 In this study aqueous and ethanol extracts of Iranian produced green tea black tea and roselle calyces were considered for measurements with respect to their total phenol content total flavonoids content total tannin content total anthocyanins content and 2 2 diphenyl 1 picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity . In addition the concentrations of copper iron and zinc were quantified . High performance liquid chromatography analysis protocols were optimized for the quantification of 17 phenolic acids and flavonoids compounds . The highest TPC and TFC were observed in the ethanol extract of green tea . The aqueous extract of green tea showed the maximum TTC . The highest TAC was obtained in the aqueous and ethanol extracts of roselle calyces . HPLC analysis of the methanolic extract showed the presence of caffeic acid quercetin hesperidin and hesperetin in all of the studied samples . The minerals were present at concentrations well below the acceptable daily consumption level recommended by health limitation guidelines .

@highlight Determining phytochemical properties and concentrations of Cu Fe and Zn in green tea black tea and roselle calyces.
@highlight Green tea had higher levels of total phenols flavonoids and tannins content as well as antioxidant activity.
@highlight Amounts of Zn Cu and Fe were lower than the acceptable daily consumption recommended by health limitation guidelines.
