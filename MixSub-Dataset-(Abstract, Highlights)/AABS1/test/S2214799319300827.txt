 Electrotechnologies gained increased popularity as non thermal processing of foods as they offer many advantages over conventional thermal processing . These technologies effectively inactivate microorganisms enhance the processing efficacy at lower treatment intensity with preservation of nutritional functional and sensory characteristics of processed foods . Moreover these technologies can be applied for targeted and controlled enzymatic treatments . Structural and conformational changes under these treatments may influence enzymatic inactivation but also activate enzymes or enhance their activity . Therefore the enzyme characteristics and treatment conditions could be finely tuned toward desirable properties and effects in food production and processing .

@highlight Electrotechnologies induce enzyme activation inactivation or limit their activity.
@highlight Electrotechnologies provoke structural and conformational changes in food enzymes.
@highlight The mechanism of induced activation or inactivation of enzymes is still unclear.
