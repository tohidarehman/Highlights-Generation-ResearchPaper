This review recommends the possibility to use LAB as an economically sustainable and environmentally friendly plant probiotic in order to produce vitamins biofortificated crops . This new approach could lead something interesting in two aspects on one hand the promotion of plant growth and on the other hand a biofortificated food crop for human nutrition and health safety to food security .
