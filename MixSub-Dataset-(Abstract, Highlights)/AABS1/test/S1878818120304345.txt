 In recent years solid state fermentation has been used to produce bioactive compounds with high added value from agro industrial waste . This study was aimed to obtain extracts from moringa leaves flour with increased levels of polyphenolic compounds after SSF with

@highlight SSF improved the bioactive compounds content in moringa leaf flour extracts.
@highlight Novel bioactive compounds fourteen were released produced after fermentation.
@highlight Gallic acid the majority compound was more concentrated in fermented moringa leaf.
@highlight was only sensitive to extracts from fermented moringa leaf.
