 According to the proposed definition by FAO WHO probiotics must be alive and abundant once ingested . However during recent years new definitions are added to the probiotic terminology such as paraprobiotics and postbiotics because findings have shown that dead cells could also show significant health impacts on human . However mentioned terms are not accurate and impressive enough to reflect the intended meanings regarding all states of probiotic benefits and it seems that a disturbance and confusion in probiotic glossary has been occurred . As a result a new terminology based on a new efficient approach and conceptualization is needed for a global agreement and usage . In the present paper we are honored to propose such terminology to provide mentioned comprehensive approach and terminology for all aspects of probiotic benefits . We are proposing three main classes of probiotic including true probiotic referring to viable and active probiotic cell pseudo probiotic referring to viable and inactive cell in the forms of vegetative or spore PP
