 Rice plantation is one of the sectors that severely affected by drought stress worldwide and caused high loss of rice production . Latest approximately 1164ha rice plantation was affected due to water scarcity in Malaysia and reduced rice production . This study suggest that treatment by using liquid formulation containing macronutrient and plant growth regulators as one of the strategies to alleviate drought stress in plant growth and development . Hence this study aimed to assess the synergistic effect of KCl thiourea GA

@highlight Drought stress severely affected the germination performance of rice.
@highlight Liquid enhancer treatment is one of alternative to reduce drought stress in rice germination.
@highlight Ideal concentration of KCl thiourea GA
@highlight and SA able to alleviate drought stress in rice cv. MR220 germination.
@highlight Synergistic effect of KCl thiourea GA
@highlight and SA accelerate the germination performance of drought stressed MR220 seed.
