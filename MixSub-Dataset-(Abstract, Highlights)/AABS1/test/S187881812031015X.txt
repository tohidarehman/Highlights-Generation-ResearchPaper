 Lignocellulose the most abundant and renewable carbon resource is untapped due to its protective lignin shield . Biological pretreatment employs white rot fungi to remove lignin and expose the cellulose hemicellulose layers for exploitation . The present work was conducted to explore the possibility of biologically pretreating lignocellulose with WRF and using the sugars liberated from this process as renewable and inexpensive feedstock for the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates .
