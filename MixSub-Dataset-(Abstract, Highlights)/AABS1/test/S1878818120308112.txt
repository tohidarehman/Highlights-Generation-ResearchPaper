 Global efforts are being made to replace petroleum based products with renewable biomass based products through sustainable processes . Currently hemicelluloses are of great interest in the framework of the biorefinery approach . This work is aimed to develop a hemicellulose extraction process by combining instant controlled pressure drop and alkaline extraction methods and to optimize the process conditions . Opium poppy

@highlight Poppy stalks are important agro industrial lignocellulosic residues.
@highlight An integrated DIC treatment alkaline extraction process was developed and optimized.
@highlight Hemicellulose yield was increased by 49.7 .
@highlight Optimization allowed saving in process chemicals and shortening of processing time.
@highlight DIC assisted fractioning of lignocellulosic biomass results in high value added bioproducts.
