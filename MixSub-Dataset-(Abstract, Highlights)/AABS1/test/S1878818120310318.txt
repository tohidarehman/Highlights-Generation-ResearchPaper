 In this study enzymatic production of biodiesel from waste frying oil was investigated using fungal whole cell lipase as a sustainable technique . Seven Mucorales whole cell isolates and 6 mutants were tested for WFO transesterification to produce biodiesel . All tested isolates showed positive respond to qualitative lipase and esterase activity tests . A relatively strong positive correlation was detected between quantitative lipase activity that ranged between 15.91 and 25.42 U g and transesterification capabilities in terms of FAME that reached up to 46.35 . Two isolates that showed potent transesterification capability were identified molecularly using rRNA ITS sequences as

@highlight All Mucorales isolates and mutants showed incredible transesterification abilities.
@highlight Among them 2aNRC11 and 1aNRC11 showed high methanolysis yields of 38.72 and 46.35 .
@highlight Strong correlation was detected between isolates lipase and methanolysis yields.
@highlight Growth lipase and methanolysis of mutants and wild types showed swings in yields.
@highlight Ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenic effect on Mucorales may have a genetic pattern.
