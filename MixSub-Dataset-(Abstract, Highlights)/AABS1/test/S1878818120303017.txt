 The increased modernization and urbanisation of developing countries has resulted in a tremendous spurt in use of vehicles and automobiles . As a result of this enormous amounts of used engine oil and lubricating oils are generated which are released into soil and water bodies . Novel ecofriendly techniques must be developed to eradicate this issue . Hence in the present study a yellow pigmented circular flat mucoid colony of Gram negative bacillus capable of utilising used engine oil as a sole source of carbon was isolated from motor garage soil . This bacterium could degrade used engine oil on Bushnell Hass agar plates within 48h and could decolorize 6 dichlorophenol indophenol within 4 days . It was identified as
