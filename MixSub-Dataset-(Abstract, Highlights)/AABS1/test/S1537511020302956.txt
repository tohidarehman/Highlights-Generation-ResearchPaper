 Near infrared hyperspectral imaging over the spectral range of 9002500nm was investigated for its potential to identify maize kernels inoculated with aflatoxigenic fungus from healthy kernels and kernels inoculated with non aflatoxigenic fungus . A total of 900 kernels were used with 3 treatments namely each 300 kernels inoculated with AF13 AF36 and sterile distilled water as control separately . One hundred kernels from each treatment of 300 kernels were incubated for 3 5 and 8 days to obtain diverse samples . Based on the full mean spectra extracted from the same kernel side the best mean overall prediction accuracies achieved were 96.3 for the 3 class classification and 97.8 for the 2 class classification using the partial least squares discriminant analysis method . The 3 class and 2 class models using the full mean spectra extracted from different kernel sides had the best mean overall prediction accuracies of 91.5 and 95.1 . Using the most important 30 55 and 100 variables determined by the random frog algorithm the simplified type I RF PLSDA models achieved the mean overall prediction accuracies of 87.7 93.8 and 95.2 for the 2 class discrimination using different kernel sides information . Among the most important 55 and 100 variables a total of 25 and 67 variables were consistently selected in the 100 random runs and were therefore used further for establishing the type II RF PLSDA models . Using these 25 and 67 variables the type II RF PLSDA models obtained the mean overall prediction accuracies of 82.3 and 94.9 separately .
