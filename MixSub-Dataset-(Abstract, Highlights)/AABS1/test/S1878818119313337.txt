@highlight Coffee peel waste contains fibers including xylan a polymer that constituted hemicellulose.
@highlight Xylan can be extracted from coffee peel and used for xylooligosaccharide XOS production.
@highlight bacteria could grow perfectly in media with carbon sources of 20 XOS from coffee peel.
@highlight Product fermentation were lactic acid and other organic acids as products that could reduce the pH value.
