 During coffee processing lactic acid bacteria from multiple ecosystems find in the cherry pulp a rich environment for their development . They utilize pulp substrate as a source of carbon and nitrogen to produce significant amounts of lactic acid . This natural fermentation is purposely used by coffee growers to promote an efficient removal of the mucilage layer adhering to the fruits before storage and transport of the coffee beans . Besides lactic acid LAB metabolism produces a variety of compounds from the utilization of citrate and the catabolism of amino acids . Recent studies have demonstrated that these metabolites have a complementary function in the formation of taste and flavor precursors of coffee beverages . However the possibility of improving coffee quality by the use of LAB has largely been ignored . This review considers the importance of LAB associated with coffee processing exploring their diversity and metabolism and influences on coffee quality . The selection of appropriate LAB strains alone or in combination with yeasts is a promising research line in a near future leading to new perspectives on coffee quality .

@highlight The relationship between LAB and coffee quality is reviewed.
@highlight LAB promote an efficient coffee beans mucilage layer removal.
