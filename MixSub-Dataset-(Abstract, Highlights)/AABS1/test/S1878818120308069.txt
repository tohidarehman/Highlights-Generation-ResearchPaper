 sp . M9 was isolated after enrichment of microbial diversity in nitrogen free mineral salt medium supplemented with 300mg l of 4 chloroaniline . The isolate M9 was able to achieve complete degradation of 300mg l 4 CA supplement to NFMSM after 30h incubation . In addition to 4 CA isolate M9 was able to achieve complete degradation of 300mg l 3 chloroaniline 21 degradation of 300mg l 2 chloroaniline and complete transformation of 50mg l of 3 4 dichloroaniline was observed only in the presence of 0.02 yeast extract supplement to NFMSM . The presence of catechol 2 3 dioxygenase activity in cell free extract and detection of 4 chlorocatechol 2 hydroxy muconic semialdehyde in biologically transformed samples by mass spectroscopy analysis indicated to meta cleavage of the aromatic ring . A plug flow reactor was developed using polyurethane foam and refractory brick pieces as immobilization matrix . The treatment of simulated effluent supplemented with 300mg l 4 CA through PFR resulted in 88 transformation of 4 CA and 70 lowering of chemical oxygen demand . These observations suggest that

@highlight To the best of our knowledge this is the first study where
@highlight sp. M9 is being reported for degradation of chloroanilines such as 4 CA 3 CA 2 CA and 3 4 DCA.
@highlight The cell free extracts of M9 cells have potent C23O activity and LC MS analysis indicated towards the meta cleavage of 4 CA. Thus M9 has a wider substrate range as compared to earlier chloroaniline degrading microbes having C12O activity.
@highlight For bioremediation applications a plug flow reactor PFR was developed using immobilized cells of M9 which achieved 88 degradation of 4 CA 300mg l in simulated effluent with 70 lowering of COD load.
