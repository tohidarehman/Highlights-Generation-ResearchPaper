 This study aimed to evaluate for the first time the antimicrobial activity of lemongrass oil in its normal and nanoform against four microbial strains previously isolated from a historical parchment manuscript dated back to the third century AH . In addition examine their impact on the aesthetic physical and chemical characteristics of the disinfected parchment before and after artificial aging . The nanoemulsion of the oil was prepared using the low energy emulsification technique . The antimicrobial activity of Lg EO and Lg NE was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively . Fourier transform infrared scanning electron microscopy tensile strength and elongation and color change investigations were conducted to monitor any chemical morphological mechanical or physical variations of treated parchment samples before and after artificial aging . The obtained results declared that preparing essential oils in the form of nanoemulsions improves their antimicrobial performance that facilitates achieving biocidal activity in lower concentrations without adversely affecting any of the examined characteristics of the disinfected parchment . On the other hand using the oil in its normal state affected the optical properties of treated samples before and after aging . Additionally while improving the mechanical properties of the disinfected parchment the accelerated aging of the treated samples had brought about an obvious decrease in those properties . Thus essential oils nanoemulsions which are considered an ecofriendly system can be used effectively in the disinfection of historical parchment manuscripts without any adverse effect on their distinctive characteristics .

@highlight Preparing lemongrass essential oil in the form of nanoemulsions enhanced their antimicrobial activity.
@highlight Various microbial strains and diverse developing stages have different susceptibilities against antimicrobials.
@highlight Lemongrass essential oil in their normal state adversely affected the mechanical properties of treated parchment after aging.
@highlight Lemongrass essential oil in the form of nanoemulsions did not adversely affect any characteristic of treated parchment even after aging.
@highlight Using Lemongrass essential oil in the form of nanoemulsions in the disinfection of documentary heritage based on parchment is recommended.
