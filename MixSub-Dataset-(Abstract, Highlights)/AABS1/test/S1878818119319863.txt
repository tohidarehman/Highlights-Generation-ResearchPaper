 Mango peel is an agroindustrial waste with excellent nutritional value and a considerable content of bioactive compounds that can be used as a source of antioxidants . Additionally biotransformation processes by kefir fermentation increase the interest in obtaining products from agroindustrial wastes with good biological properties . In this context this work aimed to evaluate the effects of milk supplementation with mango peels on the growth rates of kefir microorganisms during fermentation as well as the antioxidant properties of the obtained fermented products . The results were comparatively evaluated between fermented samples in the presence of mango peels and in their absence . Significant increases in antioxidant activities for KMP were observed for all methods as follows 113 for DPPH radical scavenging 153 for the Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power assay 21 for ABTS radical scavenging and 43 for Total Reducing Capacity compared to those of KC fermented samples . According to microbiological analyses the KMP samples allowed microbial growth of up to 3 fold higher than the growth of KC samples reaching counts of up to 10
