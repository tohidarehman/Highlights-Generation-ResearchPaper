 Treatment of wastewater with purple nonsulfur bacteria simultaneously produces the biomass of plant growth promoting bacteria and the effluent containing plant growth promoting substances . Among 46 PNSB strains isolated from chicken slaughterhouse wastewater treatment unit only four strains grew well in non sterile effluent of the anaerobic digester under both microaerobic light and aerobic dark conditions . However only strains WS308 and WS502 were selected as inoculants for subsequent experiments since they released high levels of 5 aminolevulinic acid into the digester effluent medium under both incubating conditions . Based on 16S rRNA genes analysis the strains WS308 and WS502 were identified as

@highlight WS502 maximally released ALA in aerobic dark conditions.
@highlight WS308 secreted maximum ALA content in light conditions.
@highlight Mixed culture of both strains reduced sCOD of chicken abattoir wastewater by 85 .
@highlight Treated effluent contained enough biomass and ALA to act as plant growth promoter.
@highlight Treatment with potent strains of
@highlight added economic value to wastewater.
