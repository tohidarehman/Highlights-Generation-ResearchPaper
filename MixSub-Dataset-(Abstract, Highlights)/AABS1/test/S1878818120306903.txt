Betalains are water soluble pigments of red beet which have functioned as an antioxidant and colorant substance in food . The current study aimed to investigate the simultaneous usage of basil seed gum and red beet extract in probiotic yogurt formulations . The probiotic viability in MRS vancomycin agar post acidification rate through pH measurement viscosity using Brookfield viscometer antioxidative properties through DPPH free radical scavenging method and sensorial characteristics were evaluated in bio yogurts during 21 days of storage time
