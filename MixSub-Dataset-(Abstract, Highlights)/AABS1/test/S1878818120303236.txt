 The role of salicylic acid on photosynthetic electron transfer chain of mung bean plants grown under salt stress 0 3 6 and 9dS m

@highlight Salicylic acid with increasing K
@highlight content in leaves regulate photosynthesis efficiency.
@highlight Low stomatal conductance under saline condition losses the PSII efficiency undr salt stress condition.
@highlight JIP test can applied to assess the performance of photosynthetic apparatus of plants under salinity.
