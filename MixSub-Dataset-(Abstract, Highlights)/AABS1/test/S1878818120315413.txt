 Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria can suppress salt stress effects and improve plant productivity . This study elucidated the mechanisms of growth medium inoculated PGPRs

@highlight Rhizobacteria PGPRs isolated from rhizosphere of native wheat plants were positive for plant growth promoting activities.
@highlight PGPRs alleviated the adverse effects of salinity stress on wheat plants.
@highlight PGPRs significantly increased growth and yield and re balanced ion contents in salt stressed wheat.
@highlight PGPRs improved physiological attributes due to the improvements in antioxidant defense system components.
@highlight PGPRs supported wheat plants to increase their tolerance to salt stress.
