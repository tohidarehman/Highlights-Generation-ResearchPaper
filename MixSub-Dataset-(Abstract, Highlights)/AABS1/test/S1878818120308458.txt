 Decreasing in fossil fuel reserves and its adverse environmental effects motivate the development of the biofuels production such as biodiesel . Animal fats residues generated by agro processing industries in large quantities can be considered a low cost raw material for conversion to alkyl esters . This study aims to evaluate the production of biodiesel from enzymatic catalysis applying the novel commercial lipase in liquid formulation NS 40116 obtained from the modified

@highlight Low cost residual chicken fat was proposed for enzyme catalyzed biodiesel production.
@highlight The lipase NS 40116 from
@highlight in liquid formulation was utilized.
@highlight Temperature fat to methanol molar ratio and water content were assessed.
@highlight It was obtained 93.16 of fatty acid methyl esters FAME at feasible conditions.
