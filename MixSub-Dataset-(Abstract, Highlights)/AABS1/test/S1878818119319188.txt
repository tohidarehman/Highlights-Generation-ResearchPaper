 Invertase enzyme is a globular protein which hydrolyzes sucrose in living organisms . Invertase widely distributed in the biosphere especially in baker s yeast and plants . Invertase enzyme has recently been used in various biotechnological applications such as beverage confectionary bakery invert sugar high fructose syrup artificial honey calf feed food for honeybees and other applications . Thus invertase is an interesting enzyme which is widely used in industrial processes however there are no comprehensive reviews published on invertase enzymes . PubMed Scopus and Google Scholar search engines were searched from January 2013 to November 2019 . Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria 200 relevant experimental studies with moderate bias were selected . This paper provides comprehensive information on the invertase and their types sources production methods physical and chemical properties structures separation and purification methods and their applications .
