 Research on grape microbiome dynamics inaugurates new perspectives for sophisticated complex bio transformations that can profoundly enhance wine character . The exploitation of the significant variations in yeast biota of grapevines in different viticultural areas entails the potential to confer specific regional character in wines . Thereby numerous studies are following this flourishing oenological interest on distinct microbial fingerprints and dynamic interactions over fermentation . Premium quality natural wines are an emerging topic of the current decade in winemaking . Thus research is directed towards the characterization of genotypes of indigenous yeasts and their beneficial role in unique wine profiles . The identification of new fermentative yeast strains undertakes continuous challenges in the production of top of the line wines with exclusive regional traits . Herein distinctive major trends in winemaking are reviewed whereas novel and promising studies are being highlighted .
