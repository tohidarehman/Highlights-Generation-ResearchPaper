 The sulphide present in the Up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating sulphate rich post tanning wastewater was treated further using Sulfide Quinone oxidoreductase immobilized Carbon Silica Matrix and Functionalized Carbon Silica Matrix packed bed reactors . The production of SQR from

@highlight Carbon silica matrix CSM and Functionalized CSM FCSM was prepared from rice husk.
@highlight Sulfide Quinone oxidoreductase SQR was extracted from
@highlight SQR immobilized biocatalytic reactor was operated in continuous mode at varying HRT.
@highlight CSM SQR biocatalytic reactor showed 990.2 sulphide removal efficiency at 15h HRT.
@highlight Whereas FCSM SQR biocatalytic reactor showed 990.1 sulphide removal in 9h HRT.
