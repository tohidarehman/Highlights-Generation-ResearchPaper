 Actinomycetes have been identified as one of the most diverse groups of microorganisms that play a vital role in the production of enzymes and nutraceuticals . In addition prior studies on the wild type strain of

@highlight A wild type
@highlight sp. strain exhibiting high activity 37.0 U mL was obtained by a submerged fermentation.
@highlight A one step chromatographic procedure was employed for purification of the mannanase.
@highlight The mannanase could successfully purified with the molecular mass was approximately 37.0kDa.
@highlight The enzyme fairly stable at pH range of 6.09.0 with retained above 90 of its original catalytic activity.
@highlight The enzyme could hydrolyzed various mannan polymers and commercial mannan produced mannoligosaccharides and mannose.
