 Bacteria and wild yeasts contamination is usually observed during fuel ethanol fermentation . Moreover it is known that sucrose is breakdown into glucose and fructose by the yeast enzyme invertase but hydrolysis is much faster than hexoses metabolism resulting in monosaccharides accumulation which exerts osmotic stress on yeast and growth of

@highlight Invertase activity from different strains was studied during ethanolic fermentation with cell recycling.
@highlight The invertase influence on the contamination level by Lactobacilli was investigated.
@highlight Ethanol yield yeasts viability yeasts budding rate and bacterial contamination were reported.
@highlight No differences on the levels of contamination were observed during co culture fermentation processes.
