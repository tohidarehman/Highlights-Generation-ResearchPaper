 Fibrinolytic proteases are enzymes that provide a promising alternative to drugs for thrombolytic therapy since they degrade fibrin the major component of blood clots . Aqueous two phase systems using polyethylene glycol 8000 and sodium phosphate were used to select optimal conditions for extracting a cysteine protease with fibrinolytic and fibrinogenolytic activity from the legume

@highlight Fibrinolytic protease was recovered by PEG phosphate aqueous two phase system.
@highlight ATPS could be applied to partly purify proteases of
@highlight seeds.
@highlight This enzyme could be an interesting alternative as a new thrombolytic agent.
