 Contamination by cadmium is a serious problem in fragile sandy soils . In these soils the high amount of sand fractions with uncharged surface and low organic matter content cause the high mobility of Cd . Biochar has been shown to be highly promising for mitigating adverse effects on soils but little is known about its role in Cd contaminated fragile soils . The aim of this study was to obtain biochar from different biomasses and evaluate their effects on root growth in rice plants and their protective effects against Cd stress in a Planosol . Three biochar obtained were characterized by

@highlight Structurally aromatic biochars regulate growth and plants defense metabolism.
@highlight Biochar applied to fragile soil at 3.0 stimulated photosynthetic pigments and proline.
@highlight Biochar decrease ROS and preserve membrane integrity in plant under Cd stress conditions.
@highlight Biochar applied to fragile soil exert protective effect on plants under Cd stress conditions.
