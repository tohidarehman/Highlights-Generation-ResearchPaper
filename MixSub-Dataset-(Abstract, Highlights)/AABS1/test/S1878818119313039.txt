 In the present study genetic diversity among 48 muskmelon accessions was analyzed employing various morphological traits under well watered and water deficit condition and SSR markers . Maximum values for horticultural traits were 44cm for fruit polar circumference 33.2cm for fruit equatorial circumference 21 for number of fruits 41.5 for days to first male flowering 44 for days to 50 male flowering 44 days to first female flowering 45 days to 50 female flowering and 5.66 for number of shoot branching under well watered condition . While under water deficit condition maximum values of same parameters were 28.8cm 26cm 18 37.2 39 47 46.2 and 4.4 respectively . Based on morphological traits genotypes were clustered in three major clusters under well watered condition while grouped in five major clusters under water deficit condition . Out of the 52 SSR markers 35 produced polymorphic patterns a total of 125 amplification products were obtained the mean number of alleles per locus was 3.57 and the size of amplified products ranged from 120 bp to 605 bp . The average PIC value was estimated to be 0.492 . Jaccard similarity coefficients calculated from SSR data varied from 0.03 to 0.89 with a mean value of 0.46 . The clustering pattern of muskmelon accessions based on SSR markers was random but not in consonance with the groupings based on quantitative traits under well watered and water deficit condition . High genetic variability was observed based on various morphological traits under both well watered and water deficit condition and SSR markers indicating genetically diverse accessions .
