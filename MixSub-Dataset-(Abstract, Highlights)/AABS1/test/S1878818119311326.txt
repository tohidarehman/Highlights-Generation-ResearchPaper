 Harvesting and extracting lipids from the microalgal biomass are the most expensive processes in biodiesel production . This study focuses on reducing the lipid extraction cost using ozone rich microbubbles technique . The lipid extraction of

@highlight A new ozone rich microbubble bioreactor system for lipid extraction has been developed and tested.
@highlight The concentration of products increased significantly when the temperature was increased and smaller bubbles were introduced during extraction.
@highlight The energy usage for extracting
@highlight lipid with ozone is lower compares to centrifugation and solvent extraction methods.
@highlight This process has been tested on a non cell wall microalgae name
