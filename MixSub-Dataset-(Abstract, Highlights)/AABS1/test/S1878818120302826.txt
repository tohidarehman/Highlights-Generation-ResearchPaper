 In this present study selenium reducing bacteria were isolated from fresh water pond . The cell free supernatant from B2 strain was found to effectively reduce sodium selenite and was identified as

@highlight A rapid protocol for synthesis of Se NPs using fresh water bacteria
@highlight B2 was developed.
@highlight The synthesised Se NPs showed antibacterial activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria.
@highlight The cytotoxicity of Se NPs against A549 cell line was assessed by MTT assay that showed IC50 value of 3g ml.
@highlight Hence the Se NPs from
@highlight B2 with therapeutic potentials and can be effectively used in the biomedical research.
