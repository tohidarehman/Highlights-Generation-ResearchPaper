 Global climate change has in recent years increased the frequency and intensity of meteorological disasters . In particular damage to greenhouses caused by heavy snowfall continues to occur on farms in South Korea . Because heavy snowfall occurs over a relatively long time compared to other sudden meteorological disasters if an appropriate warning system for heavy snowfall events is in place then damage to greenhouses can be prevented . However the existing snowfall warning system in South Korea consists only of a simple alert that is unable to anticipate future risks to an area caused by heavy snowfall . In this study the aim was to develop a stochastic alarm model to minimise the damage to greenhouses caused by heavy snowfall events . A Markov chain was designed to construct the alarm model using snowfall data from nationwide weather stations as well as from greenhouse standards with various safety criteria . The snow depth data were divided into several sections using a cluster analysis and the failure probabilities of the greenhouses were derived for specific time interval according to current snow depth . This method considers the weather characteristics of each region as well as various greenhouse standards because the risks of heavy snowfall vary depending on location and type of the installation . Using the alarm model developed in this study it is possible to predict and therefore manage the negative impacts of heavy snowfall events on greenhouses .

@highlight Heavy snowfall alarm model for greenhouse is developed using the Markov chain.
@highlight Stochastic alarm system enables user to manage the damage caused by heavy snowfall.
@highlight The system reflects regional weather characteristics and various safety criteria.
@highlight The failure probability is alerted with the warning time enabling active response.
