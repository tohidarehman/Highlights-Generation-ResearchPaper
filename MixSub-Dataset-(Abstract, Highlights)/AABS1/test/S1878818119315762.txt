 Ionic liquids pretreatment is currently becoming an attractive approach for improving the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis on lignocellulose . Cholinium acetate ILs that contain choline cation combined with carboxylic acid based anion is not only marked as biocompatible ILs but also known as a useful catalyst in the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass which results in an increase of enzymatic saccharification rate of the biomass . In this study hydrolytic activities of cellulase and xylanase which produce extra cellularly by isolated actinomycetes under the presence of ChOAc were investigated . ChOAc biomass ratio were set up between 0.0 and 3.0 for pretreatment followed by hydrolysis using cellulase and xylanase that excreted when actinomycetes were grown up in pretreated bagasse successively . Act 7 was used as inoculum in saccharification and the optimum of ChOAc biomass ratio was as identified to be 1 which achieved high saccharification with a yield of reducing sugar 74.58 . Since the cellulase activities reduced to around 3070 while ChOAc biomass ratio was increased to 23 in contrast xylanase activities remain stable at the range of 58.9775.19 U mL . This experiment demonstrates the promising bio hydrolysis of biomass in green technology to increase the yield of the biomass saccharification process .

@highlight Isolated actinomycetes have a high both cellulolytic and xylanolytic activity.
@highlight Cellulase and xylanase of Act 7 were working in presence of Choline acetate ChOAc .
@highlight ChoAc bagasse 1.0 g g provided the best pretreated substrate in the hydrolysis.
