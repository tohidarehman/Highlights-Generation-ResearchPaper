 The growing era of nanotechnology has attracted the attention of people towards the inclusion of nanoparticles in our day to day life . The conversion of copper and silver into nanomaterial for biomedical application has increased the urge of working with different metallic nanoparticles . Considering these facts zinc nanoparticles are synthesized using biological sources like plants fruits bacteria fungi algae etc . The introduction of biological sources for the synthesis of ZnONPs will promote a safer and non toxic approach . The biomolecules present in biological sources act as capping or coating agents to enhance the stability and potentials of the ZnONPs . In the present study aqueous extract of
