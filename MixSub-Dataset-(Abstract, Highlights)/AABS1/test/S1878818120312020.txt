 The knowledge of flower metabolic changes during flower development is limited in dioecious species . To better understand the abundance and variation of metabolites between these flower types is of utmost interest . Our aim was to investigate metabolite diversity and accumulation in three different flower types of

@highlight Flower metabolite data was analyzed using HPLC CID QTOF MS approach.
@highlight Differentially expressed flavonoids distinguished among three flower types.
@highlight Kaempferol and quercetin derivatives showed major difference in PC1 analysis.
@highlight 17 pathways showed higher impact on flower development.
@highlight 12 joint pathways showed correlation between MADS box gene and metabolites.
