 Ultrasound has been employed in a wide range of processes as related to biotechnology fermentation and food processing . In this regard the use of ultrasound represents an emerging technology able to minimize processing and positively impact on both microbial safety and quality of different food products . According to the frequency and intensity used ultrasound has been proposed for monitoring fermentation processes and as an effective processing treatment . In addition ultrasounds have been recently studied as a very promising complement to mild heat processing even though the optimization of such integrated processes remains a wide research area . This review considers the importance of ultrasound associated technologies for microbial growth food fermentation processes effects on enzymatic activity and limitation of spoilage .
