 The market for prebiotics is gaining strength and is growing greatly in recent years since the consumers demand are changing and are highly influenced by the increasing consumption of healthier products . The fructosyltransferase mainly produced by filamentous fungi is responsible for the synthesis of fructooligosaccharides which are widely used as a bioactive ingredient in functional foods . The objectives of this work were to select the best

@highlight Extracellular fructosyltransferase FTase 89.7kDa from
@highlight Kita was purified and characterized.
@highlight The purification of FTase was performed at room temperature on a fast protein liquid chromatography system.
@highlight The specific activity of the FTase was 112 629.03 U gds with purification ratio of 49 times and yield of 36 .
@highlight FTase purified by
@highlight presented optimum temperature at 60C and pH 5.0 respectively.
@highlight FTase executed by
@highlight generate economical production of fructooligosaccharides.
