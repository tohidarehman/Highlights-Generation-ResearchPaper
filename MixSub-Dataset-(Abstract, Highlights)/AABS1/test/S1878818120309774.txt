 Succinic acid is a four carbon dicarboxylic acid used as a building block in the synthesis of valuable commodities and specialty chemicals . Succinic acid is produced petrochemically by hydrogenation of maleic anhydride and a greener alternative route is microbial fermentation . In this study a 2

@highlight Microbial fermentation is a cleaner alternative to produce succinic acid.
@highlight Process parameters were optimized to enhance succinic acid and biomass content.
@highlight Succinic acid productivity was increased 1.5 times through optimization.
