 extracts obtained by pressurized liquid extraction were microencapsulated in maltodextrin by spray drying . Different formulations were prepared with MD at 20 and with 2.5 and 5.0 of

@highlight Phenolic compounds from
@highlight leaves were microencapsulated with spray dry maltodextrin.
@highlight SEM and fluorescence morphological analysis confirm the true encapsulation of the extract by maltodextrin.
@highlight A UVA and UVB emission chamber was built with a temperature sensor and air exhaust system.
@highlight The photostability of phenolic compounds present in the microencapsulated extract was evaluated by UVA and UVB emission.
@highlight The encapsulation process has shown optimal efficiency and represents good prospects for industrial deployment.
