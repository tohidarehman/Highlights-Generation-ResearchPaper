 Microalgae are known as the potential feedstock for production of bio based fuels due to their high lipid contents . Residual microalgae biomass after conversion of lipids into biodiesel can be converted into bio oils in order to achieve complete exploitation of microalgae biomass in a microalgae biorefinery . Hydrothermal liquefaction is a promising way for converting high moisture biomass waste into high energy crude oil . Therefore this study intended to produce biooil from residual biomass of microalgae

@highlight Production of biooil from residual biomass of microalgae
@highlight was performed by HTL process.
@highlight The average bio oil yield 11.81 w w was obtained at 350C a residence time of 60min and pressure of 200bar.
@highlight The CHNS analysis showed that crude oil contains 4.82 nitrogen 68.53 carbon 1 hydrogen 21.9 sulfur.
