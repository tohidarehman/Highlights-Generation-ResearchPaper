 Abiotic stresses are increasing globally at an alarming rate . On the contrary demand for food is ever increasing with the rise in population and salts stress has been the major one reported to affect photosynthetic machinery and thereby reduce growth and yield . Halo tolerant plant growth promoting rhizobacteria that have ability to work under salt stress and promote plant growth along with enhanced synthesis of secondary metabolites including phytohormones and volatile compounds is being widely studied . The present work describes isolation characterization and identification of IAA producing halotolerant PGPR from
