 Nutrients are bio encapsulated by different structures in plant based foods which can behave as digestive barriers upon consumption . These natural barriers can be modified during food processing . On the one hand processing can be applied to fully disrupt naturally present barriers while on the other hand processing can be used for targeted modifications of these barriers in order to induce specific digestive responses . In this context many researchers recently explored different processing techniques and or intensities to modify the bio encapsulation level of plant based foods aiming to enhance and or modulate nutrient release . In this review we discuss the potential of processing as a tool to manage digestive barriers in plant based foods . Two representative case studies on carotenoids and starch are included .

@highlight Processing is an interesting tool to tailor digestive barriers.
@highlight Processing is essential to release carotenoids from their natural entrapment.
@highlight Carotenoid bioaccessibility can be enhanced as well by product formulation.
@highlight Nutrient digestion of processed pulses is regulated by cell wall properties.
@highlight Starch digestibility of pulses can be modulated by thermal process intensity.
