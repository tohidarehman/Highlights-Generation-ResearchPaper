 Structured triacylglycerides rich in linolenic acid were prepared using a three step process . First with the addition of molecular sieves at different addition times and loads the enrichment of GLA from evening primrose oil and 1 butanol was improved via

@highlight Molecular sieves allowed an enrichment of GLA in esterification reactions.
@highlight A 60 TAG content was achieved during glycerolysis reaction.
@highlight The structured triacylglycerides produced contain 49 of GLA.
