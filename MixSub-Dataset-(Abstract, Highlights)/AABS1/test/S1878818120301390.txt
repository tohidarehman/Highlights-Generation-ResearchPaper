 The agricultural and industrial wastes are environmental pollutants . So there is an increasing demand for more efficient exploitation of these wastes and their conversion into useful products . Recently the limited availability of calf rennet led to a search for rennet substitutes for cheese manufacture . In this study

@highlight Isolation of
@highlight MK775302 from the marine sponge
@highlight Exploitation of some agro industrial residues for production of milk clotting enzyme from
@highlight MK775302.
@highlight Optimization of the medium components by using statistical factorial designs for maximization of the enzyme yield.
@highlight Characterization of the produced enzyme and evaluation in cheese manufacture in comparison with commercial microbial rennet.
