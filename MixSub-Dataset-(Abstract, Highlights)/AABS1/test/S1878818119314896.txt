 High contents of cellulose and hemicellulose of corncob waste makes it suitable as a raw material for sugar saccharification that can be used as sugar source for bioethanol fermentation . However the presence of lignin inhibits the complete sugar conversion necessitating pretreatment of the corncob material . Therefore our study aimed to introduce a new pretreatment method for corncob to minimize lignin contents hydrolyze it using an enzyme cocktail and ferment it to bioethanol . Firstly we studied pretreatment of corncob powder to minimize lignin interference using various reagents like 2 H

@highlight The presence of lignin inhibit the full sugar conversion necessitating pretreatment of the corncob material.
@highlight The corncob powder was pretreated using 2 H
@highlight SO
@highlight  2 NaOH 2 H
@highlight SO
@highlight 2 NaOH and 15 NH
@highlight OH revealed that treatment with 15 NH
@highlight OH was the best pretreatment to minimize lignin interference.
@highlight The enzyme cocktails consisting of cellulase xylanase and xylose isomerase were isolated from microbes collected in Indonesia which can hydrolyze corncob waste.
@highlight Enzyme cocktail produced the highest amount of reducing sugars and can be fermented to bioethanol.
