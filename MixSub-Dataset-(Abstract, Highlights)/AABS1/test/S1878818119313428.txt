 Organisms living in an extremely cold environment utilize antifreeze proteins to inhibit ice formation and maintain their biochemical processes . AFPs are produced across various kingdoms including plants microorganisms and insects . In the present study several short peptides were designed based on the ice binding site of AFP found in a longhorn beetle

@highlight Novel antifreeze peptides were designed based on the active regions of
@highlight antifreeze protein.
@highlight The designed peptides are able to change ice morphology and reduce the size of ice crystals.
@highlight The antifreeze activity is dependent on the structural and dynamic properties of the designed peptides.
