 In aquaculture farming iron deficiency in fish causes anemia and also causes improper growth . Biologically synthesized nanoparticles are widely used in micro nutrient delivery in aquaculture as they are eco friendly and non toxic to the environment . Iron oxide nanoparticles can be the alternative supplement to overcome iron deficiency . Therefore the primary aim of this study was to determine the effect of

@highlight Production loss in aquaculture is mainly due to the retarded growth and improper development of fishes.
@highlight Fish fed with iron oxide nanoparticle supplemented diet shows improved growth performances.
@highlight Iron oxide nanoparticle possesses the capabilities to stimulate the growth in
