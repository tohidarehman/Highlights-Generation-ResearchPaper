 has been recognized as the major destructive cause of various economic crops in Egypt . Chemical insecticides have been frequently used however the development of insecticidal resistance is the current challenge thus searching for novel ecofriendly biocontrol agents is the prospective challenge . Fungal endophytes of plants have been recognized as a repertoire for bioactive metabolites . Thus the objective of this study was to isolate a potential endophytic fungal isolates from different medicinal plants with an efficient insecticidal activity against
