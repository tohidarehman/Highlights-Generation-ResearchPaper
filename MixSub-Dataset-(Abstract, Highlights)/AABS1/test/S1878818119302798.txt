 Citrus by products are rich in flavanone aglycons which have lower bioactivity than aglycone forms . Based on this the study evaluated the effects of enzyme biotransformation on antioxidant and vasorelaxant capacity of polyphenolic rich extracts from citrus waste . Enzymatic treatment produced extracts with high hesperetin concentrations and higher antioxidant capacity than non treated extracts . At the highest concentration tested 3mgmL

@highlight Enzyme assisted extraction produced aglycone rich extracts from citrus waste.
@highlight Enzyme treated extracts had higher antioxidant activity than crude extracts.
@highlight Citrus extracts caused concentration dependent relaxation on iliac artery rings.
@highlight Pectin by product extracts induced endothelium independent relaxation.
@highlight Enzyme treated pectin by product extracts enhanced soluble guanylyl cyclase activity.
