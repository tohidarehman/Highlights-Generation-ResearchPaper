 The oxidation activity of laccase on a broad range of substrates has attracted great interest in the development of technologies for industrial and environmental applications . In this work a crude laccase from

@highlight A novel laccase from
@highlight was immobilized in magnetic particles.
@highlight The activity of the immobilized crude laccase was 139.8 U.g dry support
@highlight The biocatalyst can be reused 30 times with 60 decolorization of methyl orange dye.
@highlight The biocatalyst can be easily separated from reactional medium.
