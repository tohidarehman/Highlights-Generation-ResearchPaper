 is a large tannase producing genus able to provide enzymes which hydrolyse condensed tannins in waste coir residues . In this work a tannase acyl hydrolase obtained from

@highlight was able to produce tannase with biotechnological potential.
@highlight The optimum pH for tannase activity was observed between 5.0 and 6.0.
@highlight The results showed that after hydrolysis the sweet aftertaste and overall acceptability improved.
@highlight The removal of phenolic compounds in green tea by Tannase was achieved.
@highlight The results showed that the phenolic compounds of the green tea were significantly influenced by the amount of tannase added.
