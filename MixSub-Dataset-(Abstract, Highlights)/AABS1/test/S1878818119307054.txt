 This study evaluated three biogas systems i biodigester 1 without agitation system and fed with swine manure plus 1 crushed placenta ii biodigester 2 without agitation system and fed only with swine manure iii biodigester 3 with automated agitation system and fed only with swine manure . The biogas and methane production were determined by the biochemical potential of methane during one month of operation . The addition of 1 of swine placenta increased by 20 the production of biogas and methane . Agitation was fundamental to increase by 20 of the biogas produced in biodigester 3 which was fed only with swine waste . The results show the biogas production potential under different conditions to be adopted according to each swine production unit has been an interesting method of final disposal of remains of the production in swine maternities on circular economy approach .

@highlight High potential of biogas production.
@highlight Co digestion of swine manure and placenta.
@highlight Circular economy approach in rural area.
