 The growing industrial applications of alkaline proteases urged the production of highly active stable enzymes . In the current study the enzyme production was achieved by submerged fermentation using the bacterial strain

@highlight Economic production of highly active alkaline protease using
@highlight ALW1.
@highlight The partial pure enzyme was thermophilic and possessed high stability in commercial detergent.
@highlight The enzyme was added in the detergent formulation and applied for the removal of blood stain.
