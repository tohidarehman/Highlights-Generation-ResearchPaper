 The evolution of multidrug resistance in bacteria instigates the decline in effectiveness of antibiotics . Nanoparticle enzyme bioconjugates are a recent interest in countering biofilm related infections due to their stability and targeted delivery . The synergistic effect of amylase and biosynthesized silver nanoparticles towards biofilms remains less explored . In this study we demonstrate the conjugation of amylase and AgNPs synthesized using the supernatant of

@highlight Alkaliphilic bacterial isolate can be utilized for the synthesis of AgNPs.
@highlight Biosynthesized AgNPs were successfully conjugated with amylase enzyme.
@highlight The bioconjugates displayed more potent antibacterial efficacy than AgNPs alone based on the measured zones of inhibition.
@highlight Bioconjugates exhibited higher efficiency than AgNPs and amylase when used individually against established biofilms.
@highlight All concentrations significantly reduced the formation of biofilms even at the lowest concentration used.
