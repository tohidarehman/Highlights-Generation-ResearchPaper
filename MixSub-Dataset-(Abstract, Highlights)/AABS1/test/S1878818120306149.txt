 The diversity and technological potential of freshwater microalgae is still poorly explored in tropical regions . The isolation and identification of these microalgae can contribute to a better knowledge of microalgal biodiversity and enables the discovery of new strains with biotechnological potential . In this work freshwater microalgae isolated from different locations were identified and evaluated for their ability to grow in autotrophy heterotrophy or mixotrophy . After confirming the mixotrophic capacity of the isolates they were cultivated in cheese whey under controlled conditions . After that the most efficient strain was cultivated in cheese whey under environmental conditions . The obtained biomass was then characterized regarding its composition of lipids pigments and carbohydrates . Seven microalgae were isolated corresponding to

@highlight Different microalgae were isolated from freshwater lakes.
@highlight Mixotrophy was the most efficient growth mode for all microalgae.
@highlight sp. L2B Bold was the microalgae with the highest growth efficiency.
@highlight sp. showed good growth in cheese whey under environmental conditions.
