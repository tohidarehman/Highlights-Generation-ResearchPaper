 Drought and heat events frequency and severity are expected to increase in the near future as responses to global warming influencing crops productivity and human diet as result in the increasing soil aridity and area affected by drought . It is becoming increasingly important to find new crop plants or genotypes of crops that have adaptation strategies to water loss at extreme arid conditions . It was hypothesized that growth and development of plants are affected differently by drought stress depending on their nature habitats whether desert or riverain . In this current research we compared the changes in physiological behavior between desert and riverain legume plants as response to drought stress at two levels of water regimes . Rates of transpiration were highly correlated to radiation . Transpiration increases with the increase in photosynthetic active radiation at both levels of water regimes . Highest photosynthesis and transpiration were achieved in

@highlight Changes in physiological behavior between desert and riverain legume plants was compared.
@highlight The rate of transpiration in desert plant
@highlight was lower than
@highlight under high water regime.
@highlight The photosynthesis rate decreased by increasing drought stress in all plants.
@highlight Drought stress induced significant accumulation of total sugars flavonoids saponins protiens and phenolics.
@highlight is an ideal desert plant acting as water saver under extreme arid environment.
