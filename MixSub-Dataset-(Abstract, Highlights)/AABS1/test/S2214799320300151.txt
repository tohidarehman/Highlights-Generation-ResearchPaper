 Nanotechnology has been employed for the creation of structured colloidal delivery systems that enhance the performance of functional food ingredients such as vitamins minerals nutraceuticals antimicrobials antioxidants colors and flavors . A successful colloidal delivery system must be specifically designed for the particular application which depends on the nature of the functional ingredient and end product . Nanotechnology principles are being used to tailor the composition size shape charge and morphology of the colloidal particles utilized for this purpose . This article provides an overview of some of the major developments in this area over the past few years . In particular it focuses on recent advances in the design and fabrication of multiple bioactive delivery systems plant based delivery systems and delivery systems for specific food applications .
