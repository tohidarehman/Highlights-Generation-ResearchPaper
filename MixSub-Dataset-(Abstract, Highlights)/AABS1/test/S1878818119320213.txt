 Fulvic acids are highly beneficial molecules promoting several soil functions such as nutrient absorption metal transportation and improving soil structure . These activities are assisted by their molecular structure upon interaction with soil medium . The present study describes the isolation of fulvic acids from mature marine fish waste and sugarcane bagasse co compost using alkaline extraction method and studying its molecular and structural characteristics using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques . UVvisible spectroscopic analysis of fulvic acids revealed presence of absorption peak at 264nm due to characteristics of double bonds of aromatic or unsaturated compounds . Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis of fulvic acids showed emission and excitation spectrum respectively . The photometric ratio E
