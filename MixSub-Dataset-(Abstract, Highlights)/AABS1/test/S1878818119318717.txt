 The current level of air pollution fossil fuel depletion rising demand for fuels and rising cost has been pressure the modern society to search clean fuels . An alternative is biodiesel because vehicles with diesel engines can use it with little or no modification . However the high cost of raw materials remains a challenge in to biodiesel production . Thus the use of alternatives low cost raw materials from industrial waste is a paramount to reduce the process costs . In this context the main objective of this work was the production of fatty acid methyl esters using low cost raw material with high free fatty acid content through enzymatic route . The catalyst used was NS 40116 . These analyses indicated that high FAME yields are achieved using 37C 2 equivalents of methanol added in 6 shots and 3wt . In addition using low cost materials has several advantages not competing with food products requiring no land for cultivation and being eco friendly . Summary the enzymatic process is a promising alternative for biodiesel production reducing its cost and benefiting sustainable development through the use of industrial waste .

@highlight The low cost raw material came from the physical refining of soybean oil.
@highlight Biodiesel were obtained through transesterification with enzymatic catalyst.
@highlight Process provides biodiesel with a high FAME 96 .
@highlight Was effective at 37C 2 equivalents of CH
@highlight OH 3wt of water and 6 shots of CH
@highlight OH.
