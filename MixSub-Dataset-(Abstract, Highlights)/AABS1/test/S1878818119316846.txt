 Hexavalent chromium is a toxic pollutant often released from tanneries after treating leather . Due to prolonged exposure to chromium the niche enables several microorganisms to develop resistance which exhibit high bioremediation prospects . Totally 126 bacterial strains were isolated from 20 different samples contaminated with tannery effluents collected from various geographical locations of Vellore and Dindigul districts Tamil Nadu India . Among them 52 morphologically diverse isolates were profiled by ARDRA into 19 groups . Based on reduction assays eight strains exhibited Cr resistance at different concentrations under varied growth conditions including pH and temperature . From eight the strain 1Ab1 identified as
