 Food byproducts derived from industrial processing present high potential to be reused as ingredients for human nutrition . However even though food byproducts are often reprocessed and studied few studies report the inclusion of such byproducts on new food products and assess the new product acceptability . Therefore on our work guava peels and cashew bagasse were subjected to solid state fermentation for protein enrichment through single cell protein and then included on cereal bars for human nutrition . The solid state fermentation of fruit byproducts was carried out at 30C with 70 equilibrium humidity 0.9 water activity and initial

@highlight Guava peels and cashew bagasse were treated by solid state fermentation for single cell protein enrichment.
@highlight Protein content was increased by 11 times after 6h of solid state fermentation.
@highlight Both enriched byproducts were included on three different cereal bars.
@highlight Cereal bars had good overall acceptability and high purchase intention.
