 This study aimed to find the effect of partial replacement of commercial feed with phytase fermented rice bran and turmeric flour on total cholesterol triglycerides low density of lipoprotein cholesterol and high density lipoprotein cholesterol contents in broiler meat . The experiment used a completely randomized design in which 36 male broilers were randomly assigned into six treatments . Those treatments were 100 commercial feed as the control 100 commercial feed 2 turmeric flour 95 commercial feed 5 PFRB 2 turmeric flour 90 commercial feed 10 PFRB 2 turmeric flour 85 commercial feed 15 PFRB 2 turmeric flour and 80 commercial feed 20 PFRB 2 turmeric flour . The results showed that broiler meat fed on the PFRB at all concentrations had significantly lower total cholesterol LDL c and triglyceride but higher HDL c content than that of control p 0.05 . However the inclusion doses of PFRB appeared to have no significant effect on total cholesterol triglyceride LDL c and HDL c content in broiler meat p 0.05 . Furthermore the supplementation of 2 turmeric flour gave no significant effect on all measured variables P 0.05 . These results suggest that partial replacement of commercial feed with PFRB can be used to lower cholesterol LDL c and triglyceride depositions while increasing HLD c content in broiler meat although further studies are still required to find the optimal concentration of PFRB inclusion in feed .

@highlight Rice bran is rich with mineral phosphorus.
@highlight Phytate content in rice bran can be degraded by phytase.
@highlight Turmeric contains 35 essential oils and 2.56 curcumin.
@highlight Cholesterol LDL and triglyceride in broiler meat could be reduced.
@highlight HDL in broiler meat could be increased.
