 Microalgae biomass is considered a sustainable feedstock to produce high value compounds including enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidants which are widely used for food pharmaceuticals textile leather and in the chemical industries . Suitable post harvest storage conditions to minimise deterioration of enzyme activity is therefore crucial .
