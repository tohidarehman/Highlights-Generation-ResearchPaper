 Microalgal biomass is regarded as quintessential feedstock for bioethanol production owing to its rapid growth and high carbohydrate content . The present study investigates the effects of nitrate and phosphate starvation magnesium and lysine supplementation and initial pH of culture medium on the growth and carbohydrate accumulation in the green microalga

@highlight Biomass yield and total carbohydrates of
@highlight were enhanced by Mg and lysine.
@highlight pH 9 was found stimulatory for biomass yield and carbohydrate accumulation.
@highlight Lysine supplementation at pH 9 boosted carbohydrate productivity to 38.4mgL
@highlight Bioethanol productivity under optimal condition was 4 fold higher than control.
@highlight could be a potential feedstock for bioethanol production.
