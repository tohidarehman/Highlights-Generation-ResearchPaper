 The effect of PEG induced osmotic stress was studied in twelve diverse indigenous finger millet genotypes under various levels . With the increasing PEG concentration germination percentage shoot length root length and biomass production decreased in all the genotypes . Among all the genotypes evaluated reduction in germination percentage seedling growth and biomass production was more in FM RT 01 and less in FM ST 01 . Principal component analysis resulted in the formation of three distinct clusters stress sensitive stress tolerant and moderately tolerant sensitive . Based on the germination percentage and growth parameters FM RT 01 was considered as PEG induced osmotic stress sensitive and FM ST 01 as stress tolerant genotype . PEG induced stress increases membrane damage and osmolyte accumulation in both the genotypes . Damage to the membrane was found more in the stress sensitive genotype compared to stress tolerant . The magnitude of increase in osmolyte accumulation was more in FM ST 01 than FM RT 01 . Antioxidative enzyme activities significantly increased with increasing PEG 6000 concentration up to 15 PEG but decreased at higher concentrations in both the genotypes . Our findings suggests genotype FM ST 01 genotype can be exploited for different crop improvement programs .
