 Rice bran is a potential ingredient for broiler chicken feed due to cheap and high unsaturated oil content . However the inclusion of rice bran also has anti nutritional factors in the form of phytic acid . Thus this study aimed to investigate the effect of commercial feed substitution with phytase fermented rice bran and turmeric flour toward eicosapentaenoic acid docosahexaenoic acid crude protein and crude fat deposition in broiler meat . The experimental design was adjusted to a completely randomized design in which forty eight broiler chicken were randomly assigned into six treatments . Treatment 1 100 commercial feed treatment 2 100 commercial feed 2 turmeric flour treatment 3 95 commercial feed 5 fermented rice bran 2 turmeric flour treatment 4 90 commercial feed 10 fermented rice bran 2 turmeric flour treatment 5 85 commercial feed 15 fermented rice bran 2 turmeric flour and treatment 6 80 commercial feed 20 fermented rice bran 2 turmeric flour . The data were analyzed using two way ANOVA and Duncan Multiple Range Test to detect any differences among the treatments . The results showed that the substitution of commercial feed with fermented rice bran and turmeric flour significantly affected the DHA EPA protein and fat deposition in broiler meat . The substitution of 20 commercial feed with the fermented rice bran and 2 turmeric flour gave the highest EPA DHA and crude protein content while reduced the crude fat level of broiler meat .

@highlight Rice bran is rich with phosphors.
@highlight Turmeric flour has high content of fibre.
@highlight The supplementation of phytase fermented rice bran increased protein EPA and DHA deposition in broilers.
@highlight 20 fermented rice bran substitution to commercial feed and 2 turmeric supplementation improved broilers meat quality.
