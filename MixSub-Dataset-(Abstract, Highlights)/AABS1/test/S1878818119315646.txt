 The aim of this study is to produce biohydrogen from untreated cassava pulp using a novel selected consortium of anaerobic thermophilic bacteria and the associated microbial communities were elucidated by metagenomic analysis . CP was chosen as a sole carbon source to enrich efficient hydrogen producers from a total of 100 different composts and soil sediments under anaerobic dark fermentation at 60C . The stable enrichment culture was selected base on CP degradation and hydrogen production . The selected consortium namely BK16 from the residue of soil sediment around mangroves at Bangkhuntiean province Thailand shows the highest hydrogen production yield 35.08ml H

@highlight The BK16 has isolated and identified the novel associated microbial communities.
@highlight Key biomass degrading enzyme e.g. amylase cellulase and xylanase were investigated.
@highlight One step hydrogen production using non pretreated cassava pulp were optimized.
