 Textile effluent is one of the major sources of land and water pollution due to the presence of dyes in addition to other contaminants . The lands receiving these toxic effluents have become deprived of a number of species of natural flora . Competency of indigenous bacterial strains to degrade the dyestuffs present in textile wastewater was evaluated . Decolourization by the bacterial strains was found to be 36 66 and 89 for

@highlight Three
@highlight strains effectively decolorized the textile effluent by adsorption.
@highlight highly reduced biological and chemical oxygen demand of effluent.
@highlight Total solid contents of effluent removed radically with all three
@highlight strains.
@highlight Plants grown with biological treated effluent showed maximum growth of plumule and radical.
@highlight Minimum percentage phytotoxicity was found with bioremediated industrial effluent.
