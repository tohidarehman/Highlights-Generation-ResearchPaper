 The present study demonstrates the comparative study between conventional batch extraction and nonconventional three phase partitioning for the first time to extract potent biomarker compound corosolic acid from the leaves of

@highlight Three phase partitioning TPP employed to extract corosolic acid from L.speciosa.
@highlight Comparative studies between TPP and batch extraction were effectively performed.
@highlight TPP enhanced the extraction yield of corosolic acid as compared to batch process.
@highlight TPP extract showed good amount of total phenolic content and antioxidant activity.
@highlight TPP was found to be superior extraction technique as compared to batch extraction.
