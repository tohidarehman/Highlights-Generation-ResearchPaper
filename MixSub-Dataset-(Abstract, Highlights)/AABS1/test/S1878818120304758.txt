 The aim of the present study was to obtain high levels of fermentative L lactic acid and find a better form of purification . The process was optimized by testing different compositions of the culture media evaluating alternative carbon and nitrogen sources using inexpensive procedures and improve the production recovery and purification of lactic acid from the fermented broth . Using 100g L crystallized sugar 30g L yeast autolysate and NH

@highlight L lactic acid purification and recovery by charcoal and celite.
@highlight Extraction with ethyl ether provided efficiency and purity.
@highlight Purification steps allow an average lactic acid recovery rate of 80 .
