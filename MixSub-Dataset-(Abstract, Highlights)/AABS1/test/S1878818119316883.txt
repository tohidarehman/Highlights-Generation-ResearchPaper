 Antimicrobial edible coatings containing natural herbal extracts and essential oil possess various benefits and are currently used to design novel active biodegradable packaging . In this study adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems model was used to predict the population of pathogenic microorganisms chemical changes and sensory characteristics of beef slices during 9 day storage period . First Cumin essential oil was incorporated into Shahri Balangu seed mucilage to fabricate an active and eco friendly edible coating for beef slice . Microbial populations psychrotrophic count

@highlight ANFIS adequately showed the correlation between the exerted treatments on the beef samples.
@highlight Thiobarbituric acid TBA and peroxide value PV correlated well with the microbiological data and sensory characteristics.
@highlight Shahri Balangu seed mucilage SBM extended the shelf life of beef slice.
