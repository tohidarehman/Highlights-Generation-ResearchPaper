 One of the important aspects of salt tolerance is the regulatory roles of some plant growth regulators . The objective of this work was to evaluate the capability of salicylic acid and 24 epi brassinolide to induce salt tolerance in black mustard

@highlight Exogenous brassinolid and salicylic acid decreased salt toxicity in black mustard.
@highlight Growth regulators induced catalase activity under all salinity levels.
@highlight Lipid peroxidation was declined by brassinolid and salicylic acid treatments.
@highlight Soluble sugars and chlorophyll content were enhanced by growth regulators.
@highlight Growth regulators increased secondary metabolites and salt tolerance of plants.
