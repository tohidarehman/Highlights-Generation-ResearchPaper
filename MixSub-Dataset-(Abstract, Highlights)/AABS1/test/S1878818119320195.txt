 The enzyme phytases facilitates in degradation of phytate . Phytate as a natural compound serving as primary source for storing phosphate among plants . From the biotechnological prospects there has been a considerable leap in the Enzyme technology which has massively broadened the commercial aspects of phytase . Their impact in the food and feed industry has become much more quintessential in the recent times . For nearly two decades there has been a wide array of commercially available microbial phytases in market with commercial significance as it facilitates the farmers with essential . Phytases in particular can not be neglected from being a threat for human diet due to its anti nutrient activity as they served as strong chelating agent against many divalent minerals . Similar to phytases activity PA also was found to showcase a potential towards binding positively charged proteins amino acids and or multivalent cations or minerals in foods . Besides the food industry has overlooked on the very fact of phytase significance as its supplementation results in improving the net availability of the essential trace elements and minerals to humans . Similarly they serve as an essential feed source for mongastric animals .
