 PC from soybean and C10 0 were subjected to lipase mediated acidolysis interesterification for the preparation of PC containing C10 0 . Free fatty acid form of C10 0 was selected as the best acyl donor in comparison to triacylglycerol from of C10 0 and ethyl ester from of C10 0 because higher C10 0 PC yield was obtained when free fatty acid form of C10 0 was used as acyl donor while that of triacylglycerol and ethyl ester were 24.93.1mol and N.D. respectively in a preliminary reaction condition . In addition Novozym 435 was selected as the best catalyst compared to the commercial lipases Lipozyme TL IM Lipozyme RM IM and Lipase OF because the highest C10 0 PC yield was obtained when Novozym 435 was used as a catalyst in a preliminary reaction condition . The reaction was then optimized based on the evaluation of acyl ratio solvents and reaction time with mainly pursing C10 0 PC yield . It was demonstrated that high levels of acyl ratio decrease C10 0 incorporation that solvents having low polarity are more effective in this reaction and that the hydrolysis reaction was superior to the acidolysis reaction at the early stage of the process . Finally C10 0 PC yield of 61.83.0mol was obtained in the optimum reaction conditions In this reaction system Novozym 435 showed regiospecificity at the
