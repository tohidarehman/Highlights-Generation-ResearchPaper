 Packaging is one of the most important issues regarding food safety . Nanoscale technology can be used to improve the quality of packaging components thereby ensuring food safety . The poor biodegradability and the environmental impact of discarded plastics have prompted scientists to develop newer plastic makes with higher environmental degradability particularly in the field of food packaging . The mechanical properties of the newly prepared nanocomposites films are of prime importance the packaging applications . These films can be evaluated for the tensile strength and modulus of elasticity yield strength ultimate tensile strength and toughness . In a watery mixture of pomegranate
