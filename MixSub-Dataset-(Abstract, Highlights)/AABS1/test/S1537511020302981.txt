 A discrete element model of citrus fruit stalk with a diameter of 3mm was established using the discrete element method . The intrinsic parameters and contact parameters of citrus fruit stalk were obtained through measurement . The bonding parameters of the discrete element model of citrus fruit stalk were calibrated through a three point bending test and shear tests . Based on these parameters the optimal bonding parameter combination was determined . This included normal stiffness per unit area
