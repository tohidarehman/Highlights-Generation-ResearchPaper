Polyphenols a major class of bioactive compounds in nature are known for their antiviral activity and pleiotropic effects . The aim of this review is to assess the effects of polyphenols on COVID 19 drug targets as well as to provide a perspective on the possibility to use polyphenols in the development of natural approaches against this viral disease .

@highlight Polyphenols interact with SARS CoV 2 viral proteins and its human cellular targets.
@highlight Virus binding entry and replication are affected by these plant derived compounds.
@highlight Modulation of immune response by polyphenols is a beneficial aspect.
@highlight Promising potential as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of COVID 19.
