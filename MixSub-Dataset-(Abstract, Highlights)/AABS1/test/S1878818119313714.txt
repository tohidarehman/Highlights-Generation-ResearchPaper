 The capacity for exopolysaccharide biosynthesis of a bacterial consortium culture was investigated . To obtain maximal EPS recovery pH carbon and nitrogen sources and inorganic ions were optimized . At pH 8 the flocculation index percentage was 62.6 viscosity was 1.380.015gm

@highlight The total exopolysaccharide EPS production of a bacterial floc consortium was determined under optimal conditions.
@highlight A high amount of EPS was produced at pH 9.
@highlight Among the carbon sources the highest EPS production was achieved when dextrose was used with and without crude oil.
@highlight Among the inorganic ions the maximum EPS production was realized with the addition of potassium chloride.
@highlight A high flocculation index was produced under optimal conditions.
