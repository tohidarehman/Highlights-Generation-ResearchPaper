 A thermo responsive switchable solvent which switched hydrophobicity by the change in temperature was successfully used for simultaneous cell disruption oil extraction reaction and biodiesel separation from wet microalgae . Catalyzed by immobilized lipase the entire process was carried out in a single pot using the same solvent without drying the microalgae . Besides being easier to operate the biodiesel yield using the TSS was 21 higher than that achieved using CO

@highlight Using Switchable Solvents SS simplifies biodiesel production process.
@highlight Thermo responsive SS was successfully used for direct biodiesel production from wet undisrupted microalgae.
@highlight Thermo responsive SS showed higher FAMEs yield compared to the CO
@highlight triggered SS.
@highlight Thermo responsive SSenzyme system has the potential for enhanced reusability.
