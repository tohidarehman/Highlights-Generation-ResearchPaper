 In this study we report a facile and cost effective system for selective measurement of uric acid using a cascade mechanism composed of Uricase and peroxidase mimicking trivalent DNAzyme . A three G quadruplex hemin complex was engaged as the peroxidase mimicking DNAzyme . In this cascade catalysis system UA was oxidized by uricase to produce hydrogen peroxide which was also acted as a substrate for the oxidation of 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine by a peroxidase mimicking trivalent DNAzyme . TMB oxidation showed a straight relationship with UA concentration . The cascade catalysis system displayed high selectivity toward UA because of the natural selectivity of uricase . This cascade uric acid sensing system revealed the best activity at 30C and pH 7.0 which indicated its capacity to uric acid sensing near physiological conditions . The linear regression equation for UA was quantified as A 0.0072C 0.0197 with a correlation coefficient of 0.9906 . Results suggested that this system could identify as low as 0.66M of uric acid with a linear range from 2.5 to 40M . Results exhibited that the interfering public components had no noticeable absorbance values . Overall these results indicated that this facile system would be valuable for uric acid measurement in the medical laboratory .
