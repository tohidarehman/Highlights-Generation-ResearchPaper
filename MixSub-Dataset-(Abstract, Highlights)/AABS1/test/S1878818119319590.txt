 The Tea rhizosphere microbial community harbor diverse plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and are relatively less explored . In our study we isolated 23 distinct bacterial morphotypes from the tea garden of Assam India . The isolates were screened for their plant growth promotion and antifungal traits against three pathogenic fungi namely

@highlight Rhizobacteria
@highlight A6 isolated from Tea rhizosphere of Assam has potential of plant growth promotion.
@highlight Along with PGPR and antifungal traits it also produces biosurfactant by utilizing dextrose as carbon source.
@highlight A6 positively influenced growth parameters of rice seedlings tested
@highlight however dry weight showed no significant difference.
