 The presence of acrylamide in the processed food items when cooked at a temperature above 120C is a fact that has been well researched for the past 15 years . Food samples rich in asparagine and reducing sugars processed at higher temperatures leads to the characteristic crispy brown appearance attributed to the formation of acrylamide and other intermediates which in the last two decades has been linked to be a potent carcinogen in humans . A contemporary approach for the reduction of acrylamide content in food items is the use of fungal
