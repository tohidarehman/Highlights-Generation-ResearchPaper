 There is a growing interest to design food emulsions with tailored digestibility functionality during their journey in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract . In the present paper we outline the current technology and provide some outlooks for future perspectives . Oil in water water in oil in water and water in water emulsions confer several compartments to partition a wide array of biopolymers and small molecules for governing digestibility and triggering specific functionalities . Pickering stabilization of O W emulsions enables to lower digestion and target enterocytes through decorating the particles with specific ligands . Moreover the internal lipid phase can be structured to decline lipolysis . In W O W emulsions the hydrophilic emulsifier type and oil viscosity determine the lipolysis and proteolysis extents rates . Digestibility of biopolymers such as starch can be tuned using W W emulsions . These latter emulsions also enable encapsulation of water soluble vitamins and enzymes and protection of probiotics in the stomach .
