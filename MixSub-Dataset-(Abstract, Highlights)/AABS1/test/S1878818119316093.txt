 Native microalgae were collected and isolated from various coastal habitats of Eastern coast of India and were scrutinized in a biodiesel viewpoint . 55 unialgal marine cyanobacteria were obtained by rapid isolation method developed for the present work . The isolates represented 8 genera and 10 species . To identify the promising candidate for biodiesel all the isolated microalgae were studied for its total lipid content . The study has identified 6 promising strains with 15 lipid and above . In terms of biomass as a growth component

@highlight Survey of Eastern coastline of India resulted in 55 unialgal isolates from 8 genera.
@highlight Development of rapid isolation technique for separation of unialgal marine cyanobacteria.
@highlight Lipid bioprospecting of the isolates identified 6 species with a higher lipid of 15 and above.
@highlight Characterization of high lipid producing organisms showed presence of ideal fattyacids for good quality biodiesel.
