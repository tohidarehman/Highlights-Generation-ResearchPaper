 Cheese whey is a by product of the dairy industry that is generated in large quantities . It is considered the main pollutant in dairy wastewaters due to its high organic load . The aim of this paper was to produce lipases using cheese whey as the sole nutrient source . Yeasts isolated from slaughterhouse fridge effluent and oil mill effluent were screened for lipolytic activities . The lipase activity of the target yeast strain was increased by improving the culture conditions using a statistical design and the lipase activity was biochemically characterized . Among 25 yeasts the L1 strain identified by molecular markers as

@highlight A new
@highlight lipolytic strain was isolated.
@highlight Cheese whey was used as the sole nutrient source.
@highlight Overall the process is effective in terms of lipase yield.
@highlight An unusual acid lipase with characteristics desired for feed purposes is described.
