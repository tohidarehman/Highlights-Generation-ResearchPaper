 Phospholipid is an important constituent of the body as the main component of cell membrane and various lipoproteins . As dietary lipids the normal dietary intake of phospholipids is estimated to be about 110 of the total daily fat intake with triacylglycerol being the main compound . Phospholipid intake especially phosphatidylcholine is important as they supply choline and essential fatty acids which are essential for good health and involved in various cellular functions . Recently phospholipid uptake in the enterocyte has been found to be a key step in intestinal dietary lipid absorption . In this review the general concept of phospholipid digestion absorption and metabolism especially concerning phosphatidylcholine is summarized . In addition the nutritional role of phospholipids as carrier molecules of choline and n 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids has been discussed .

@highlight Dietary phospholipids are mainly composed of phosphatidylcholine.
@highlight Phosphatidylcholine is a good dietary source of choline.
@highlight Dietary phospholipids also act as a carrier molecule of essential fatty acids.
@highlight The beneficial health effects of dietary phospholipids have been widely investigated.
@highlight The general concept of phospholipid digestion and absorption is summarized.
