 The contamination of foodstuffs especially nuts with aflatoxins affected by some of the fungal genera species is a major threat to the economy safe food supply and serious health concerns to any country in recent days . Recently different techniques including heat ozone and microbes are used for the decontamination of aflatoxin but all these are limited to achieve the desirable results . The present study objectives to decontaminate AFs in nuts by using three food grade organic acids . The aqueous solutions of three food grade organic acids namely citric lactic and propionic acid are used at five different concentrations to detoxify aflatoxin B

@highlight Detoxification of AFB
@highlight and TAFs is investigated in nuts by three food grade organic acids.
@highlight Citric acid significantly detoxified AFB
@highlight and total AFs in the selected nuts.
@highlight Lactic acid effectively converted the toxic AFB
@highlight into less hazardous product AFB
@highlight Propionic acid was found as a prominent acid for degradation of AFB
@highlight in walnuts.
@highlight Citric lactic and propionic acids could be a viable option for the reduction of AFB
@highlight and TAFs in nuts.
