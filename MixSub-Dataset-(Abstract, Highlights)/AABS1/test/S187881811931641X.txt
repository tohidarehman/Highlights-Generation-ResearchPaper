 The present study was aimed to evaluate the presence of harmful heavy metals in textile dyes and selected textile effluents . Physicochemical parameters are the significant alarming signs of water pollution . The textile waters analyzed in the study showed elevated TSS were samples DU1 and DU3 was recorded with 196mg L and 584mg L which is considerably high than the permitted limit . The dyes and effluents were characterized by the presence of predominant heavy metals such as cadmium chromium lead arsenic and zinc . Phytotoxicity analysis indicated all reactive dyes had less significance effect on seed germination and also affects the chlorophyll content which directly signifies the toxic effect of dyes whereas all four effluents showed restricted germination of seeds and also a significant reduction in chlorophyll content . Hemolytic assay implied Reactive Orange was the most toxic with 90 of RBC lysis where effluents DU1 and DU2 showed a total RBC lysis of around 87 .

@highlight Heavy metal determination in selected Reactive dyes and textile effluents provides baseline information about heavy metal pollution by textile industries.
@highlight LC
@highlight concentrations of Reactive dyes and effluents on selected plant variants were determined.
@highlight Relative sensitivity of selected plant variants towards textile dyes and effluents were studied.
@highlight lysis of erythrocytes demonstrates the cytotoxicity of Reactive dyes and textile effluents.
@highlight lethality bioassay was used to assess the aquatic toxicity of Reactive dyes and textile effluents.
