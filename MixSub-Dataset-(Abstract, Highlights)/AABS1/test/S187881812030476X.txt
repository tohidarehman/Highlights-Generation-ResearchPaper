 Xylo oligosaccharides are one of the classes of prebiotics obtained from lignocellulosic biomass by hydrolysis of hemicellulose abundant in agroindustrial residues . Several endoxylanases were studied in order to provide better conversion of the biomass to XOS . The resulting product presents multi benefits favoring the intestinal microbiota and maintaining the viability of probiotics in food . XOS production from sugarcane straw by action of thermostable recombinant endoxylanase of
