 Bioflocculant is an extracellular biopolymer substance secreted naturally by microorganisms during their growth . It has piqued the interest of many researchers due to its biodegradability nontoxic properties and potential as a substitute for conventional flocculant where its usage may lead to environmental and health issues . In the present study

@highlight DWB was investigated for the production of bioflocculant using oil palm empty fruit bunch fiber.
@highlight Under optimized conditions the maximum bioflocculant yield obtained is 9.48 g substrate.
@highlight The bioflocculant showed a good flocculating rate 60.55 in kaolin suspension at pH 6 within 15min of retention time and using 4ml of bioflocculant dosage.
@highlight FTIR spectroscopy revealed the presence of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups which attributed to flocculating abilities.
@highlight OPEFB fiber can serve as a suitable solid substrate for the production of bioflocculant.
