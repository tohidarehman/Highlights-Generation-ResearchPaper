 The hexose dehydration product and important renewable feedstock 5 hydroxymethylfurfural can be biocatalytically reduced to 2 5 furandimethanol in 96 yield using coconut

@highlight HMF was biocatalytically reduced to 2 5 furandimethanol in 96 yield.
@highlight Coconut water was used as the biocatalyst without a co substrate.
@highlight HMF dimer was reduced to the corresponding diol in 95 yield.
