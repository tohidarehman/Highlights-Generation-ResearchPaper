 Curcumin is a compound with multiple health benefits and limited use because of its low bioavailability . The latter can be significantly improved by means of encapsulation in form of nanoemulsions which are systems that offer the possibility of incorporating bioactive compounds such as conjugated linoleic acid and n 3 fatty acids . In this study the oral bioavailability of NE and curcumin carrying emulsions were evaluated in an

@highlight Nanoemulsions NE can improve the bioavailability of hydrophobic compounds as curcumin.
@highlight There are only few studies
@highlight that prove the increase in bioavailability of a curcumin nanoemulsions.
@highlight The emulsifier used in the stabilization of a nanoemulsion influenced its bioavailability.
@highlight NE with MAG and DAG structured with CLA and n 3 FA increased the bioavailability of curcumin in target organs.
