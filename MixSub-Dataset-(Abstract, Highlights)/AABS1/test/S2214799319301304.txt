 The application of pre treatments before drying represents an alternative to better preserve fresh food properties and reduce the energy needs . The aim of this review was to analyse the influence of different pre treatments on drying . For this purpose the effect on food matrices drying kinetics and different quality parameters has been addressed through the review of the most recent studies . The results can differ greatly depending on the type of pre treatment and the product considered but in some cases an increase in the drying rate and a better retention of quality can be observed . Even so it is necessary to continue studying these pre treatments to better understand the effect caused .

@highlight The influence of pre treatments on drying kinetic was updated.
@highlight Ultrasound pulsed electric field high pressure and ethanol were reviewed.
@highlight Pre treatments significantly reduce energy consumption.
@highlight Pre treatments can affect bioactive compounds retention colour or texture.
@highlight This influence depends on pre treatment process variables and products.
