 The aim of the study was the fungal production of fructooligosaccharides from solid state fermentation of different agro industrial wastes enriched with maguey sap . An exploratory statistical design with a factorial arrangement 2

@highlight FOS were produced via Solid State Fermentation SSF employing agro wastes enriched with aguamiel.
@highlight DIA MF was used as microorganism for SSF.
@highlight Sugar cane bagasse was the most promising substrate suited for the FOS production.
@highlight A FOS production of 7.64g L was obtained with a Yp s 0.45 based on sucrose consumed.
@highlight Use of sugar cane bagasse and aguamiel is an economical and excellent alternative source for the FOS production.
