 Chitosan microparticles have been investigated for drug delivery through different administration routes primarily oral . For this synthetic crosslinking agents such as sodium tripolyphosphate are used to prepare these microparticles . In this sense the objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of xanthan gum as a crosslinking agent aiming at the standardization of a natural polymer of low toxicity and low cost as an alternative to synthetic ones . The Ch XG microparticles were prepared by the complex coacervation method and demonstrated high mucoadhesive capacity

@highlight The chitosan xanthan system demonstrated promising physicochemical properties.
