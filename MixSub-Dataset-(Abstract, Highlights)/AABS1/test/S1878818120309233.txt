 Glucose isomerase converts glucose into fructose by a reversible reaction . This reaction is industrially valuable for the production of high fructose corn syrup which is used as a sweetener by food and beverage industries . GI being an expensive enzyme necessitates its usage in immobilized form for increasing its reusability and economic viability . Global HFCS production accounts to 10 million tons which is highest among products yielded by immobilized process . Current study evaluates different encapsulation systems for immobilization of GI produced by

@highlight Immobilization of glucose isomerase was carried out by alginate chitosan and agar.
@highlight Encapsulation systems were optimized for enhancing enzyme activity and stability.
@highlight High fructose corn syrup production was done using immobilized glucose isomerase.
