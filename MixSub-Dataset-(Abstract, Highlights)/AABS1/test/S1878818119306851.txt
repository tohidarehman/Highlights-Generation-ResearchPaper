 The low level of nutrients in acid sulfate soils presents a serious obstacle to plant growth . This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms that acid resistant purple nonsulfur bacteria use to resist acidic stress

@highlight  TLS06 VNW02 VNW64 and VNS89 are plant growth promoters.
@highlight Tested strains produced siderophores correlated to released PO
@highlight and increased pH.
@highlight Released NH
@highlight of all tested strains dramatically change acidic condition to neutral.
@highlight Release of plant growth promoting substances ALA IAA significantly increased pH.
@highlight Mechanism of acid resistant strains was due to action as plant growth promoters.
