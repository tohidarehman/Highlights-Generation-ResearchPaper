 Rice straw and corn cobs have proven as a promising waste in the bioconversion of biomass into bioproducts . The lignocellulose content found in rice straw and corn cobs has the potential to be hydrolyzed into sugar and used as a carbon source for the growth of microorganisms . This study aims to utilize lignocellulose waste from rice straw and corn cobs for biosurfactant production by
