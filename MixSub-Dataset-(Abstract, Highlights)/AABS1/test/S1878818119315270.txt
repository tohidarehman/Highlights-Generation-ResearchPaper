 The excessive use of agrochemicals generates damage to the environment so their controlled release from biodegradable nanoparticles represents a good solution . In this study chitosan nanoparticles were prepared by ionic gelation with sodium tripolyphosphate according to a 2

@highlight At a lower amount of chitosan and greater amount of TPP smaller CNPs were obtained.
@highlight Loading Capacity showed 1 0.25 as the chitosan IAA mass ratio for release trials.
@highlight The IAA controlled release trials were adjusted to the KorsmeyersPeppas model.
@highlight The CNPs IAA showed a beneficial effect on the hydroponic lettuce growth.
