 Biofilms in the environment can both detrimental and beneficial effects . On the other hand biofilms can be useful for wastewater treatment bioremediation and removal of toxic pollutants . Furthermore biofilms can be used for the productions of value added products such as biofuels polysaccharides antibiotics organic acids vitamins and enzymes . To establish biofilms in the reactors solid support materials made of inorganic compounds and various agricultural by products . For these several types biofilm reactors have been utilized such as stirred tank biofilm reactor fluidized bed biofilm reactor fixed packed bed biofilm reactor rotary disc biofilm reactor rotating biological contactor membrane biofilm reactor moving bed biofilm reactor and trickling filter biofilm reactor . The benefits of BRs increase product yield provide logarithmic phase growth reduce lag phase and fermentation time for repeated fermentations increase biomass population provide resistance toward toxic compounds and improve product recovery . This review paper will summarize the literature for biofilm formation and structure BR types biofilm support materials and various VAPs produced by using BRs .
