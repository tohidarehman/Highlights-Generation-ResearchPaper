 Recent climate change and the increase in unpredictable meteorological disasters has continue to damage greenhouses . Although structural safety standards have been established they do not fully reflect the environment where greenhouses are installed . Existing standard greenhouse designs assume that the boundary conditions are fixed even though the real boundaries move due to the absence of foundations . In this study a structural analysis model was developed that reflects the ground conditions for pipe structures installed without a foundation and their structural safety was reviewed under various levels of snow load . The structural analysis model was developed by applying the prescribed displacement and rotation boundary using values derived from an experiment that was performed considering loading and ground conditions . The developed model was compared with the existing methods considering only fixed and hinged boundaries by examining the bending moments and the axial forces . As the boundary at the ground moved according to the applied load the maximum bending moment reflecting the ground conditions was larger than the result from the fixed boundary . Additionally as the load is gradually increased the stress calculated reflecting the ground conditions was larger than the result from the hinged boundary . Safety review indicated that the marginal snow depth that could be sustained by the structure decreased by up to 25 when the ground condition was reflected . These results suggest that the current structural analysis methods applied to pipe greenhouse structures with no foundations could lead to the structure being under designed .

@highlight This study focuses on structural analysis of greenhouse installed without foundation.
@highlight New advanced structural experiment method is designed to reflect ground condition.
@highlight Prescribed boundary condition from experiment is used for structural analysis model.
@highlight Deformed ground makes the boundary more vulnerable than hinged boundary condition.
