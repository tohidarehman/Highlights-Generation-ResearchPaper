 Monitoring pig drinking has been a topic of interest to pig researchers and producers for many years . However challenges still remain due to the fact that pigs like to play with drinkers in nursery environments and that the drinking pig is often touching others . These factors negatively influence the performance of camera based pig drinking detection algorithms . The aim of this study is to investigate a deep learning method based on convolutional neural network and long short term memory to classify drinking and drinker playing . In the experiment two pens of pigs were video recorded for 3 days . In video from the first pen 5400 2s drinking episodes and 5400 2s drinker playing episodes were generated with 80 of these data being allocated as training set and the remaining 20 as validation set . In video from the second pen 12 000 2s drinking and drinker playing episodes were generated as a test set . Firstly the CNN architecture ResNet50 was used to extract spatial features . These features were input into LSTM framework to extract spatialtemporal features . Through the fully connected layer the prediction function

@highlight A novel video based deep learning method was used to study pig drinking behaviour.
@highlight Long short term memory was used to extract the spatialtemporal features.
@highlight Classification accuracy in the body and head regions of interest was 87.2 and 92.5 .
@highlight Drinking behaviour can be detected under conditions of pigs touching and overlapping.
@highlight Shortening the region of interest can be used to improve the classification accuracy.
