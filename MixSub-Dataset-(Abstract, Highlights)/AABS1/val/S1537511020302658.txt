 The accurate classification of plant organs is a key step in monitoring the growing status and physiology of plants . A classification method was proposed to classify the leaves and stems automatically based on the point cloud data of the potted plants . Leaf samples and stem samples were selected automatically by using the three dimensional convex hull algorithm and the two dimensional projection grid density respectively and were used to construct the leaf and stem training sets . Then the point cloud data were classified into leaf points and stem points by using the support vector machine algorithm . The point cloud data of three potted plants were used in the experiment . The proposed method was compared with the standard classification the random selection method and the manual selection method . Among these methods the proposed method is automated and time saving . The results show that the proposed method had a good overall performance on accuracy and running time . The proposed method is efficient and effective on the leaf and stem classification of the plant point cloud data .

@highlight An automated leaf stem classification method was proposed based on point cloud data.
@highlight The 3D convex hull algorithm was used to select leaf sample points automatically.
@highlight The projected point density was proposed to select stem sample points automatically.
