 The visual recognition of green fruits in natural environments is always a difficult problem for agricultural robots due to the colour similarity between fruits and background . This study proposed a green fruit detection method named deep bounding box regression forest for detecting green citrus in natural environments . First probabilistic class labels were designed for image patches used as training samples for the forest model . Then objective functions were used alternately while constructing the single layer regression forest to reduce the class uncertainty and bounding box uncertainty of the object . Furthermore the output of the model taken as the new features was concatenated with the input features to train multiple regression forests . With regard to the feature extraction a multi scale fusion feature was designed to describe the citrus in different scales with three aspects of features including shape texture and colour . By testing 800 randomly selected citrus images the experimental results showed that the average execution time of the method was 0.759s and that the mAP was 87.6 . This study provides technical support for green fruit detection in natural environments .

@highlight Citrus detection and bounding box regression were achieved both in a model.
@highlight Probabilistic class label of the image patches was designed for model training.
@highlight Multi scale features of colour shape and texture were fused to describe citrus.
@highlight The features and the output of each layer were concatenated to train a deep model.
