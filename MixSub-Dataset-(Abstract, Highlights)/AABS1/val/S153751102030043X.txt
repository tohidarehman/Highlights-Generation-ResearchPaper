 The surface temperature of all weather racetracks has previously been correlated to speed . However specific functional properties such as grip cushioning and impact firmness have not been directly compared to environmental conditions . The objective of this study was to assess how temperature influences functional properties of racetracks and categorise surface wax binders according to first thermal transition peak and compare responses at different operational temperatures . Functional properties were determined for UK all weather racetrack surfaces using mechanical testing equipment which assess the loads experienced by the forelimb at gallop . Tests were carried out using latex lined moulds embedded within a test box with a predefined boundary at 0C 20C and 40C . Wax binders underwent differential scanning calorimetry to identify thermal transition peaks . Changes in operational temperatures significantly influenced surface responses when a wax binder was part of the composition . Temperature was a factor that significantly contributed to the variation found in horizontal grip

@highlight Functional properties of UK racetracks alter during normal operational temperatures.
@highlight Greater variation in track cushioning and hardness was seen at lower temperatures.
@highlight Repeated drops akin to used tracks produced higher hardness at lower temperatures.
@highlight Individual first thermal transition peak influences track response to temperature.
@highlight A first thermal transition peak 40C showed greater range of hardness and grip.
