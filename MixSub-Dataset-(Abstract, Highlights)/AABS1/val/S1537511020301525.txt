 The quantification and identification of ground cover plays a key role in erosion modelling weed measurement plant disease identification and other environmental applications . Currently a variety of methods are used to mechanically classify digital images for ground cover . Only a few of these methods can distinguish green vegetation straw dormant vegetation and exposed soil using only the Red Green Blue spectrum . This research presents an approach to classifying ground cover using standard JPEG images and readily available
