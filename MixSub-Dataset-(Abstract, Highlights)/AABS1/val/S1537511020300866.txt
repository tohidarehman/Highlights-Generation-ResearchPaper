 Consumers increasingly desire ready to eat avocado fruit yet if supplies fall short of customer expectations complaints follow incurring considerable cost and waste . In the avocado sector wastage due to destructive testing and inaccurate assessment of firmness is significant . The aim of this study was to evaluate whether non destructive laser Doppler vibrometry was capable of assessing avocado ripeness . Data were sourced from two trials using preclimacteric imported Hass avocado fruit originating from Chile and Spain ripened at 12 and 18C respectively . Standard force deformation measurements and either single or simultaneous dual vibration time signals were recorded during shelf life and assessed against respiration and non structural carbohydrate content . Resonant frequencies measured from fruit by means of LDV decreased two to four fold during ripening and this corresponded with a concomitant decrease in firmness . The capability of the LDV system to non destructively discriminate between ripeness stages was demonstrated .

@highlight Laser Doppler vibrometry capable to non destructively differentiate fruit ripeness.
@highlight Trend of fruit resonant frequency corresponded with concomitant decrease in firmness.
@highlight Method applicable to fresh produce where structure vital for consumer acceptability.
