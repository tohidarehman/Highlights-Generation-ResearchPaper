 Advanced slurry processing is being promoted to generate renewable energy reduce ammonia emissions and optimise storage and transport respectively . However these processes could affect slurry phosphorus forms and bioavailability and hence P dynamics in soil after application . This study investigated the effect of slurry processing viz . separation acidification and anaerobic digestion on P forms and distribution of cattle slurry as well as P dynamics in soil following application of mechanically separated solid and liquid cattle slurry . The results showed that acidification and anaerobic digestion had little impact on TP distribution among particle fractions of slurry but had substantial influence on P speciation and distribution . Acidification increased the dissolved inorganic P IPH

@highlight Acidification increased labile inorganic P in cattle manure by dissolution.
@highlight Anaerobic digestion increased labile inorganic P in cattle manure by degradation.
@highlight Particles 63m accounted for the majority of P present in cattle manure.
@highlight Anaerobic digestion increased mass proportion of the 63m particles.
@highlight Slurry processing controls soluble P in soil but not the moderately labile P.
