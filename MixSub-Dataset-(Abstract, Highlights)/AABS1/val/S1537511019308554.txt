 The sequence pattern mining method aims to identify frequent sequences that exceed a user specified support threshold . The present study uses the same approach based on sequential standards to estimate the heat stress of broilers from a resulting behavioural pattern . Experimental data were recorded in a climate chamber where the behaviour of broilers was recorded under thermoneutral conditions set as standard and when exposed to thermal stress . The Generalised Sequential Patterns algorithm was used to evaluate the heat stress of broilers in the third and fourth week of growth . The results indicated that the mining of pattern sequences is a useful and straightforward technique to estimate the welfare of broiler chickens allowing the identification of temporal relations between thermal stress and the consequent behaviour of the broiler . Temperature 8C below the standard thermoneutral conditions showed that the broiler remained lying down most of the time walking only to the drinker and feeder trough . Broilers exposed to temperatures 8C above the standard thermoneutral conditions tend to decrease locomotor activities showing lower welfare status .

@highlight GSP is a promising tool to detect a behavioural pattern in broiler rearing.
@highlight A series of behaviours related to thermal stress in broiler rearing was detected.
@highlight The GSP approach can be used to detect animal behaviour under stress.
@highlight Heat stress might induce a different behavioural pattern in broiler production.
