 Reducing pesticide use is an important concern for many including the European Commission . One way to achieve this goal is to adjust the amount of pesticides in relation to canopy geometry and foliage . This objective currently poses an important challenge in vineyards with uniform vegetation but it is an added difficulty when the canopy shows spatial variability within the field . Is it possible to set a constant volume rate adjusted to this variability Or is it more convenient to adjusting different volume rates based on a prescription map Assuming a plant cell density vegetation index from multispectral images to be optimal for detecting variations in vigour two methods to adjust volume rates in spatially variable vineyards were proposed and tested i adjustment of a constant volume rate uniformly applied using a conventional sprayer and ii adjustment of two volume rates adapted to two vigour classes according to a prescription map . In both methods PCD was previously correlated to the leaf area index then taking the 70th percentile of LAI to determine adjusted volume rates through DOSA3D decision support system

@highlight Plant cell density index PCD and LAI derived measures can be used to adjust spraying volume rates.
@highlight Geostatistical optimised PCD LAI selection allows up to 25 pesticide savings without reducing treatment efficacy.
@highlight DOSA3D Decision Support System expands application to spatially variable vineyards.
