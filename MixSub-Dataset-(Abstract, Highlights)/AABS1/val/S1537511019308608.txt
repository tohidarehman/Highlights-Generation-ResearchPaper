 Currently the temperature humidity index is a common method of evaluating the risk of heat stress in cows by employing climatic parameters . However the THI is a general and indirect indicator that fails to consider individual cows . Various studies have used animal related parameters to account for the heat load of individual cows . This review provides an overview of different heat stress indicators that have been used in the past 10 years with a focus on animal related and non invasive indicators . These indicators are reviewed with regard to their potential for quantifying individual heat loads in ongoing and future studies of dairy cows . The review is divided into sections covering physiological behavioural and performance indicators . Parameters that appear to be suitable for assessing the individual stress loads of dairy cows include respiration rate and body temperature whereas losses in milk yield are more a consequence of heat stress than an indicator . Using activity and feeding behaviour as an indicator of heat stress may depend on the cows physiological state . However no thresholds for animal related indicators employed as signs of heat load can be found in the literature . In contrast thresholds for THI levels are described above which changes in cows physiology and behaviour are detectable under heat stress . In conclusion the development and use of non invasive sensors should focus on physiological indicators and further studies are needed to determine the thresholds for these indicators .
