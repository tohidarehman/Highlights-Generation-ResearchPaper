 Amending growing media with biochar has the potential to sequester carbon and enhance the properties of the receiving substance . However knowledge of the mechanisms of how biochar amends the physical properties of the material is incomplete . By combining 3D image analysis and more conventional methods this study aimed to characterise the pore structure properties of three different plant based biochars and quantify their impact on

@highlight 3D image analyses of biochar showed pore diameters 211m dominated pore space.
@highlight Plant tissue structure controlled the pore structure of biochars.
@highlight Biochar affected moss moisture in regions relevant to plant available water.
@highlight Biochar partly acted as an isolated unit lacking contact with adjacent growing media.
@highlight Quantifying biochar structure was needed to understand its water retention impacts.
