 Automated tracking of indoor housed farm animals is gaining an increasing interest in farming practice and research for monitoring animal behaviour and health . Several positioning solutions have become commercially available for different animal species but the insight on how these systems perform in pig facilities is still limited . In this study the feasibility of tracking sows in a barn using an ultra wideband based indoor positioning system was investigated . The system consisted of 7 base stations and multiple tracker tags and the determination of tags positions was based on time of arrival . For locating stationary tags the system achieved 0.37m accuracy at 1m height and 0.50m accuracy at 0.3m height . While tracking moving tags at 1m height 0.38m accuracy was achieved . Three filters were tested to further improve the positioning performance . The median filter had the highest improvement on locating stationary and moving tags . The bilateral filter had a balanced capability of uncovering complex moving trajectories . The double exponential moving average filter was more suited when real time updates were required . The overall results showed that tracking group housed sows inside a pig barn was feasible using the UWB positioning system .

@highlight A UWB positioning system achieved 0.5m positioning accuracy using in a sow barn.
@highlight The positioning accuracy was dependent on the location and height of tracker tags.
@highlight Filters were more effective for improving tracking precision than accuracy.
@highlight The choice of filters depends on the motion characteristics and the application.
