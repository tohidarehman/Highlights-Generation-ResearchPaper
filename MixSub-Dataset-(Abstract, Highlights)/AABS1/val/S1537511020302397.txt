 Effective ventilation reduces heat stress in sows . A numerical study was carried out to investigate the effects of airspeed and direction on the convective heat transfer around a sow having different postures and body mass . The convection characteristics of a sow were analysed in a virtual wind tunnel using computational fluid dynamics tools . The four postures of the standing sitting reclining and lateral lying were included . The investigated sow masses ranged from 130kg to 340kg . The results show that 1 The general convective heat transfer was higher when the sow was standing or sitting postures rather than in a reclining or lateral lying posture 2 Wind direction affects the sow convective heat transfer coefficient . The convective heat transfer coefficient of a sow was largest when it was standing or sitting with the body axis 60 to wind direction . When reclining or lateral lying sow axis at 45 to wind direction the convective heat transfer coefficient was the largest 3 The convective heat transfer coefficient of a single sow can be used to predict the convective heat transfer coefficient of a sow amidst rows of multiple sows 4 Sow body mass negatively affects the convective heat transfer coefficient 5 The convective heat transfer coefficient of the sow s trunk is relatively low compared with other parts such as the legs head etc . Based on these results when a sow needs to be cooled during hot conditions an oblique airflow is recommended and airflow speed around the sow s trunk should be increased as much as possible .
