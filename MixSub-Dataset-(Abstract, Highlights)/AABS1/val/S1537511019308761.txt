 Body lengths of harvested fish are key indices for marine resource management . Some fisheries management organisations require fishing vessels to report the lengths of harvested fish . Conventionally body lengths of fish are measured manually using rulers or tape measures . Such methods are however time consuming labour intensive and subjective . This study proposes an automated method to determine the snout to fork length of a fish in complex images . In this approach images of fish bodies and colour plates with a known dimension were acquired . A convolutional neural network classifier was then developed to detect the regions of fish head tail fork and colour plate in the images . Snout and fork points of the fish were next determined in the fish head and tail fork regions respectively using image processing . Fish body length was subsequently estimated as the distance between the snout and fork points using the pixel to distance ratio obtained from the colour plate . The developed CNN classifier reached an accuracy of 98.78 in detecting the regions of fish head fish fork and colour plate . The proposed approach reached a mean absolute error and a mean absolute relative error of 5.36cm and 4.26 respectively in estimating the body length of fish .
