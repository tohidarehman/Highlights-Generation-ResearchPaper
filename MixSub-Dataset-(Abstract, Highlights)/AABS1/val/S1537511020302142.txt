 The results of analysis of airflow resistance through a porous stone accumulator bed are presented with studies conducted in laboratory and in a full scale facility . The DarcyWeisbach equation and Ergun s equation were used to determine the flow resistance coefficients . It was found that a simplification of the Ergun s equation by omitting the viscosity term did not result in a significant error in estimating the flow resistance . Dimensional analysis was applied to analyse the flow resistance in the full scale facility and to determine the form and parameters of equation allowing a calculation of airflow resistance as a function of independent variables . The analysis showed a significant convergence between the friction factors and flow resistance calculated with the use of proposed equations and the values obtained from measurements . It is concluded that the following factors have the largest impact on the airflow resistance in order bed particle diameter followed by airflow velocity effective section diameter and to the same degree layer height and bed mass .
