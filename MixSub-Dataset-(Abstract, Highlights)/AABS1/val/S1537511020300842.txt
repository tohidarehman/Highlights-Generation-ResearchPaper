 Recognition of diseased Pinus trees in unmanned aerial vehicle images is beneficial to the dynamic monitoring and control of Pinus tree diseases in large areas . However the low resolution and complex backgrounds of UAV images limit the accuracy of traditional machine learning methods in recognising diseased Pinus trees . This study presents a method for recognising diseased Pinus trees that combines deep convolutional neural networks deep convolutional generative adversarial networks and an AdaBoost classifier . DCGANs can expand the number of samples of diseased Pinus trees to solve the problem of insufficient training samples . DCNNs are used to remove fields soils roads and rocks in images to reduce the impact of complex backgrounds on target recognition . The AdaBoost classifier distinguishes diseased Pinus trees from healthy Pinus trees and identifies shadows in background removal images . Experimental results show that the proposed method has better recognition performance than K means clustering support vector machine AdaBoost classifier backpropagation neural networks Alexnet VGG and Inception v3 networks .
