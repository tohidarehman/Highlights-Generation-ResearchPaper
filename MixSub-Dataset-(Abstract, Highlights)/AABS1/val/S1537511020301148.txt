 Non destructive estimates information on the desired properties of fruit without damaging them . The objective of this work is to present an algorithm for the automatic and non destructive estimation of four maturity stages of Fuji apples

@highlight Maturation stages estimated by computer vision validated over several video frames.
@highlight Hardware used includes camera spectrometer and colorimeter.
@highlight Results include accuracy under four different apple maturation stage classes.
@highlight System could potentially be embeded in automatic fruit harvesting robots.
@highlight System could potentially be adapted to industry environmental conditions.
