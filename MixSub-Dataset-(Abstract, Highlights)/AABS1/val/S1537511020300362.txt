 Forage intake is one of the most important indicators of health and productivity of ruminant livestock such as sheep . Forage intake estimation can also make an important contribution to the design and implementation of rotational grazing systems . In this paper sheep forage intake estimation models were developed based on acoustic analysis from data gathered by an audio recorder mounted on a sheep . A data set with 114 pieces of audio was constructed by collecting ingestion sound of eight female sheep . A Gaussian kernel based support vector machine classifier was trained to identify chewing sound segments from sheep ingestion audio . Seven explanatory variables were extracted from each chewing sound segment . These variables were used to establish single variable and multiple variable based forage estimation models . Least squares regression and elastic network approach were employed to determine the coefficients of the single variable and multiple variable based forage intake estimation models respectively . Validation results showed that the best single variable and multiple variable based model could explain 71.02 and 80.94 of forage intake changes respectively . The average accuracy of the two best models was 86.13 and 89.32 respectively . The results suggested that an automatic system to estimate the forage intake of sheep based on a wearable audio recorder could be developed in the future . This could contribute to sheep health disorder identification decisions on the number of sheep for a given grassland unit and so on . The latter is the foundation of sheep rotational grazing .

@highlight Two types of models were established to estimate sheep forage intake.
@highlight Trained SVM classifier to identify chewing sound segment with an accuracy of 95.34 .
@highlight Model coefficients of correlated variables were determined by using elastic network.
@highlight The best model can explain 80.94 of the forage intake changes.
