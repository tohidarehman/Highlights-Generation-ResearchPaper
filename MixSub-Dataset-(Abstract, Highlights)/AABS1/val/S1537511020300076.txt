 To reduce the variability of cleaning performance caused by uneven airflow distribution the theory of fan design and the characteristic parameters of threshed rice outputs were used to develop a prototype of cleaning fan . Computational Fluid Dynamics was employed to simulate the air distribution inside the fan and the airflow speed distribution at the fan outlet . Response surface methodology with three factors and three levels was employed to optimise fan impeller geometry parameters this included blade inlet mounting angle blade curvature and blade inlet curvature . According to the least squares analysis of RSM the influence of each factor on the airflow distribution at each sub outlet was estimated . The optimal values of blade inlet mounting angle blade curvature and blade inlet curvature were 107 190mm and 135mm respectively . The uniformity of the outlet airflow distribution of the optimised fan was clearly improved . The number of eddy currents in the flow passage were reduced and the transporting performance of optimised fan was improved . The maximum pressure at 5 blade height away from the central plate was reduced by 37.78 which indicates that the service life of the cleaning fan could be increased .
