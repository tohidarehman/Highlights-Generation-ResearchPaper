 Soil surface and furrow profiles in soil dynamics research and applications are usually measured using manual profile meters and laser based scanners . Manual profile meters are laborious to use and laser based scanners could be expensive and not portable . An approach was developed for measuring soil surface and furrow profiles using a portable and affordable 3D scanner . The developed approach was validated by using the 3D scanner to measure the width and depth of a V groove created in three types of soils at different soil water contents moulded in a soil box . Average error of 1.83 was found for all the three soil types and soil water contents . Results from the 3D scanner were also validated in the field by comparison to profiles measured with a pinned profile meter . In terms of percentage difference in readings the 3D scanner results showed 16 5 and 4 greater furrow width ridge height and cross sectional area respectively and 1 less furrow backfill . These differences were partly due to profile meter pins digging into loose soil and limitation with accurate width measurement . Data acquisition and processing with the 3D scanner unit were significantly faster than with the pinned profile meter . In general it could be concluded that the developed methodology has the level of accuracy required for soil surface and furrow profile measurements . Furthermore this approach is a cost effective alternative to using laser based scanners .

@highlight An approach using a 3D scanner unit to acquire soil surface profile was developed.
@highlight Average error in width and depth measurements with the 3D scanner unit was 1.83 .
@highlight The scanner s height above soil surface did not affect the accuracy of results.
@highlight Results were similar to a pinned profile meter but data processing was faster.
@highlight This portable unit is an accurate reliable alternative to laser based scanners.
