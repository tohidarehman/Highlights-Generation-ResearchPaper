 Industrial scale simulation of the interaction between rice grains and equipment using the discrete element method is limited due to the high computing power requirement . Volume based scaled up modelling of DEM rice particle and calibration of DEM input parameters were investigated as an alternative approach towards realising industry scale simulation based design support of rice grains flow behaviour . Calibration of DEM input parameters using scaled up DEM particles is challenging because distortions in the DEM material properties due to unavoidable disparities between the true and DEM particle sizes . A DEM calibration methodology that applies virtual design of experiment using scaled up DEM rice particle model was applied to predict bulk angle of repose of unshelled rice grains . Rice DEM particle shape was scaled up by three times its original prolate spheroid particle shape and then approximated using seven clumped DEM spheres matching the scaled up spheroid rice particle . Using DEM parameter values of the rice model calibrated to match AOR at a relative error of 0.39 the DEM model predicted hopper discharge rates from experiment and using the analytical solution of Beverloo etal analytical solution at relative errors of 0.66 and 0.03 respectively . Hopper unloading time predicted by DEM had a RE of 0.93 when compared with experiment . A 60 saving in CPU time was achieved relative to the unscaled DEM rice particle model with good agreement to the rice flow test . This showed that the techniques of volume based particle scaling and DOE calibration are effective methods for industry scale simulation of small grains .
