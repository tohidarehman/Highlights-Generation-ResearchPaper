 This work analyses how a mulch layer of mostly gravel particles affected the soil thermal dynamics in an unheated plastic greenhouse in a Mediterranean area where suboptimal regimes of soil temperature usually prevail in winter crop cycles . Soil temperature and heat flux profiles were measured in two soil types a 0.1 m thick gravel mulch placed at the top of a 0.30 m layer of imported loamy soil and the latter without gravel mulch . These measurements were conducted during a winter period when the dominant source of energy in the soil root zone was the heat from deeper soil layers . The higher albedo of the GM and its higher long wave radiation losses reduced substantially the daily net radiation at the mulch surface by

@highlight The gravel mulch layer substantially reduced daily net radiation at the mulch surface.
@highlight The gravel mulch substantially reduced soil evaporation.
@highlight The gravel mulch acted as heat barrier reducing conductive heat transfer.
@highlight The mulch enhanced heat storage and heating rate of underlying layers.
@highlight The mulch increased air temperature at daytime and decreased it at night.
