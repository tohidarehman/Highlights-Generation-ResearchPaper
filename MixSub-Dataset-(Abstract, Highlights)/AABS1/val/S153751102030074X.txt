 Body condition scoring gives a relative measure of subcutaneous body fat available as energy reserves in the dairy cow . It is an important management tool for maximising milk production and reproduction efficiency while reducing the incidence of metabolic and peripartum diseases . The feasibility of estimating the BCS by computer vision has been demonstrated in recent research . However the techniques explored to date may be limited in dynamic backgrounds or in applications for an imbalanced dataset of cows BCS which is likely to be encountered in dairy farming . In this study a dynamic background model was used to separate the cow from the background . Then a series of image processing algorithms were proposed for quantifying the indicators used in manual scoring including global features and local features . Finally an ensemble learning approach was used to model the imbalanced dataset . The results demonstrate that applying GMM on depth images can eliminate the difficulty of object detection caused by background changes . The image processing algorithms can automatically acquire valid images locate regions of interest and extract image features without any manual intervention . In 5 fold cross validation the ensemble model achieved an average accuracy of 56 within 0.125 point deviation 76 within 0.25 point deviations and 94 within 0.5 point deviations . Especially the proposed method has a better predictive performance for cows with extreme body condition than is possible with the current state of the art .
