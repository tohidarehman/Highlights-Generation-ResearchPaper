 Global warming has caused an increase in frequency and degree of heat stress over the last decades . In conventional livestock husbandry systems with insulated buildings mechanical ventilation systems and high stocking density pigs and poultry can be more affected by climate change than in free range husbandry systems . To reduce heat stress in livestock buildings adaptation measures are used . This article assesses a wide variety of adaptation measures including energy saving air treatment systems which cool the inlet air the use of certain building elements optimising building characteristics modification of the indoor climate at the animal level and adaptation of livestock management . The efficacy of some of these measures was quantified using simulation models and then used as a benchmark for assessing the efficacy of other measures . The efficacy of the various adaptation measures varies widely air treatment devices which are cooling the inlet air showed the highest performance while measures aimed at reducing the heat release of the animals performed poorest . In confined livestock systems the reduction of heat stress by implementing adaptation measures will reduce economical losses . The selection of appropriate adaptation measures in addition to improving animal welfare can also be seen as a contribution to strengthen the economic resilience of farmers .

@highlight Global warming has a strong impact on livestock kept inside buildings.
@highlight Effective adaptation measures are available to reduce heat stress for animals.
@highlight The achievable heat reduction depends on the selected system.
@highlight The best result can be achieved by air treatment systems.
@highlight Model calculations are appropriate to evaluate the efficacy.
