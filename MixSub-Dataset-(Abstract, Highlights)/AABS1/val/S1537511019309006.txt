 Intelligent lameness detection is important for improving cow welfare . A method based on YOLOv3 deep learning algorithm and relative step size characteristic vector is proposed to classify lame and non lame cows . Videos were decomposed into sequence frames and leg targets of cows in each frame were detected by YOLOv3 algorithm . Relative step sizes of cow s front and rear legs were calculated based on leg coordinates and the relative step size characteristic vector was constructed . Finally a trained Long Short Term Memory classification model was used to classify lame and non lame cows based on the characteristic vector . A total of 210 videos were selected for verification using LSTM support vector machine K Nearest Neighbour and decision tree classifier algorithms . Results showed that accuracy of lameness detection based on LSTM was 98.57 which was 2.93 3.88 and 9.25 higher than SVM KNN and DTC respectively . True positive rate of the LSTM was 0.97 which was 0.03 0.04 and 0.06 higher than SVM KNN and DTC respectively . False positive rate of LSTM was 0.03 which was 0.03 0.06 and 0.11 lower than SVM KNN and DTC respectively . A bidirectional LSTM performed slightly better than LSTM but would be more demanding on hardware . Comparison of LSTM with a purely deep learning method showed the latter performed slightly better but was less conducive to interpretation and diagnosis of lameness . The relative step size characteristic vector proposed was effective for classification of lame and non lame cows and could lead to intelligent detection of lameness .
