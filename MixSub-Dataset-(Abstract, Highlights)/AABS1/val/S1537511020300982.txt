 As a typical harmful social behaviour tail biting is considered to be a welfare reducing problem with economic consequences for pig production . Taking a computer vision based approach in this study we have developed a novel method to automatically identify and locate tail biting interactions in group housed pigs . The method employs a tracking by detection algorithm to simplify the group level behaviour to pairwise interactions . Then a convolution neural network and a recurrent neural network are combined to extract the spatial temporal features and classify behaviour categories . The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by quantifying the localisation accuracy and behaviour classification accuracy . The results demonstrate that the tracking by detection approach is capable of obtaining the trajectories of biters and victims with a localisation accuracy of 92.71 . The spatial temporal features trained by CNN and RNN are robust and effective with a category accuracy of 96.25 . In total our proposed method is capable to identify and locate 89.23 of tail biting behaviour in group housed pigs .
