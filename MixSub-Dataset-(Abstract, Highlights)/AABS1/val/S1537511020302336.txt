 The combination of active and passive tillage tools has been acknowledged as an effective way of dealing with the soil compaction due to reduced field trips required for preparing seedbed compared to conventional practices . A comparative analysis was carried out between an active passive configuration of combined offset disc harrow and conventional passively driven mode of offset disc harrow in sandy clay loam soil to achieve maximum tillage quality with a minimum expenditure of power . The test parameters consisted of forward speeds 3.46 4.55 and 6.82kmh

@highlight A comparative evaluation between CODH and passively driven ODH was performed.
@highlight CODH outperform ODH in terms of energy consumption and tillage quality parameters.
@highlight Better penetration ability and uniformity in tilling depth with CODH.
@highlight Higher pulverisation stubble cutting and residue burial efficiency with CODH.
@highlight CODH exhibited best tillage performance index at rotational speed of 133 rpm.
