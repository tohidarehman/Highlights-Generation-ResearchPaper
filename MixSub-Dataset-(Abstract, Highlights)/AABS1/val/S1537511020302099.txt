 Composites based on lignocellulosic fillers such as wood miscanthus or common reed have received much attention due to their low cost and positive impact . Knowledge of the physico chemical characteristics of plant flour is essential to obtain indications of the thermal stability and humidity behaviour of the resulting biocomposite . The different methods that can be applied to plant flours to characterise them for composite applications are presented . Chemical composition wettability and sorption curves are the most important data that can distinguish one plant filler from another . This article focuses on the

@highlight The fraction of hemicellulose is not the only lever of a plant flour hydrophilicity.
@highlight The nature of common reed soluble could be responsible for its hydrophobic behaviour.
@highlight The high amount of Silicon in common reed could explain its hydrophobic behaviour.
