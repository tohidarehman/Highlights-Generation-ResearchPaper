 The objective was to evaluate effects of structural design particle size and filter media height on pressure loss and surface velocity in the expanding filter layer during the backwashing process . The hydraulic behaviour of three commercial sand filter designs were compared . Experiments were conducted in an experimental closed circuit module . The treatments were based on the evaluation of three sand particle sizes combined with three filter bed heights for each filter design . The results showed that for the evaluated sand filters with their different drainage structures in terms of area and arrangements had different hydraulic behaviours during the backwashing . Coarser sand particles and greater filter layer heights produced larger slopes in the surface velocity curves as a function of percentage of filter bed expansion . No difference was observed in the minimum fluidisation velocity with changing the filter media heights but an increase in the minimum fluidisation velocity was observed with increasing sand particle size . Filter beds composed of coarse sand particles and low filter bed heights produced lower increases in the pressure loss with increasing backwash surface velocity . Determining the minimum fluidisation velocity using the graphical analysis method to determine the pressure loss across the filter bed proved to be a reliable method for evaluating the equipment used .

@highlight We evaluated different commercial sand filter models.
@highlight Different sand filter drainage led to heterogeneous hydraulic behaviours.
@highlight The use of coarser particles and lower layer heights led to lower pressure loss.
