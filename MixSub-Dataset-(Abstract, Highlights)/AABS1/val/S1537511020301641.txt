 The use of flexible and semi transparent organic photovoltaic modules as shading elements in a greenhouse tunnel with a tomato crop is presented . Experiments were performed in two similar greenhouse tunnels covered by diffuse polyethylene sheet during two summer growing seasons . In 2018 one tunnel was shaded using OPV modules and the second tunnel served as a control . In 2019 a 25 black shading screen was added to the control tunnel . The microclimate yield and physiological parameters were examined in the two tunnels . Results show that at noon there was no significant difference in the mean seasonal air temperature and humidity between the tunnels . In 2018 the tunnels differed in terms of the spatial radiation transmittance and leaf temperature . The average radiation level along the OPV tunnel centreline was much lower and the radiation distribution was less homogeneous than in the control . In 2019 with similar shading percentages in the tunnels similar average radiation levels were observed . The leaf temperature in the OPV was lower than in the control in 2018 and varied from higher to lower in 2019 . The leaf area index cumulative yield and average fruit mass were higher in the OPV than in the control in 2018 and similar in 2019 . The average value of the maximum power output of three OPV modules increased roughly linearly with irradiance .

@highlight Flexible semi transparent organic photovoltaic OPV modules were used for greenhouse shading.
@highlight 23 shading by OPV resulted in a lower canopy temperature and lower nonhomogeneous radiation.
@highlight Shading in the hot summer season improved the growth of tomato plants yield and quality.
@highlight OPV can be used for shading and electricity generation however it is expensive and degrades rapidly.
@highlight Additional studies are required to improve OPV efficiency and determine optimal shading percentage.
