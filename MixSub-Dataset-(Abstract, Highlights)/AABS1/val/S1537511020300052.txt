 Pressure gradients can not be avoided in jet fish pumps due to their contracting and expanding sections . Pressure gradients are an important source of fish injuries particularly for damage to fish scales . The distribution of pressure on the surface of a fish passing through a jet fish pump was studied experimentally and also by numerical simulation . A theoretical model of the forces on fish scales caused by pressure gradient was established . The results showed that the pressure on the surface a fish firstly decreases and then increases as fish passes through a jet pump . Surface pressures reach a minimum when the fish is in the throat . Pressure gradient is also a key factor for damaging fish scales . Axial pressure gradients were greater at the inlet and outlet of the throat than in other parts of the pump and radial pressure gradients increased with radial position . Also the greater the flow rate the higher both axial and radial pressure gradients produced . Radial position is therefore an important factor for both pressure gradients and determining the force on fish scales . The forces caused by pressure gradients on scales increase with radial distance and with flow rate ratio . Thus this study specifies the effects of pressure gradients on fish scales in a jet fish pump and discusses the relative influencing factors . These results could provide a basis for improved jet fish pump designs .
