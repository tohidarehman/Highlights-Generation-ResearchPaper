 Passive dew collection could be a viable option as a source of irrigation water in arid areas . The plastic foil acting as a condensing surface plays a key role in the passive dew collection regime . A laboratory method for comparing various plastic foils for dew collection was prepared and tested . The focus was on creating a method for measuring the attributes affecting dew condensation and the flow of dew droplets on the measured surface . A low density polyethylene foil designed for dew collection white polyethylene plastic black polyethylene plastic and white polyvinyl chloride plastic were used as the test plastics . The laboratory dew yields were compared with model calculations . In addition field trials were conducted in arid conditions in Maktau Kenya to compare with the laboratory measurement . Results from the hardware model tests were not reflected in the results obtained from the field conditions . The laboratory tests showed that the dew harvesting quality of plastic foils is difficult to evaluate using the laboratory test rig . A more comprehensive evaluation regime requires tests performed in field conditions or further development of the test rig used here .

@highlight A hardware model was constructed for testing plastic foils for dew collection.
@highlight Dew was harvested in controlled laboratory conditions and in arid field conditions.
@highlight No clear similarity was found between results in field and laboratory conditions.
