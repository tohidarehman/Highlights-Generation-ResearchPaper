 A Cyranose 320 and a Fast Gas Chromatograph analyser were used to measure the headspace odour of solid samples from dairy operations . The measurements of both sensors were trained by LevenbergMarquardt Back propagation Neural Network to match human assessments . A trained human panel was used to assess the odours based on hedonic tone method and provide the model targets . A multi sensor data fusion approach was developed and applied to integrate the eNose and zNose readings for higher predictive accuracy compared to each sensor alone . Principle Component Analysis Forward Selection and Gamma Test were applied to reduce the model input dimensions . Measurement fusion models and information fusion model approaches were applied . The information fusion prediction models were shown to be more accurate than all other models including single instrument models . The information fusion model based on eNose with Gamma Test data reduction zNose showed the best results of all cases in validation mean square error R value probability of the prediction falling within 10 of the target and probability of the prediction falling within 5 of the target .

@highlight Human happiness levels were measured and analysed using hedonic tone method.
@highlight eNose and zNose instruments measured volatiles from dairy odour samples.
@highlight Data fusion linked instrument values with panel assessments to predict hedonic tone.
@highlight Multiple data reduction approaches and neural networks were applied in fusion models.
@highlight Best fusion results improved on single instrument predictions for hedonic tone of odours.
