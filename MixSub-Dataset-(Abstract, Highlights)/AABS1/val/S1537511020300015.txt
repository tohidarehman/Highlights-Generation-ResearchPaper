 A mechanistic model for ammonia removal in a countercurrent biological air scrubber was set up . This model was used to study the effect of the influent characteristics air temperature ventilation rate and ammonia load on ammonia removal efficiency . Besides mass balances of the components participating in the biological conversions the water mass balance and the heat balance were considered . The effects of the pH and the concentration of the nitrogen components on the driving force for mass transfer were examined . The model output was compared against experimental data from a pig housing facility . Simulations were performed to assess the usefulness of pH control and to investigate the effect of inflow air conditions on the ammonia removal efficiency . The study found out that although pH control affected the nitrogen component distribution in the washing water it hardly affected the ammonia removal efficiency . Thus pH control for biological air scrubbers is not recommended in practice however an on off pH control system adding only acid at critical moments could be considered . The variations in the ammonia removal efficiency are mainly caused by a changing ventilation rate rather than air temperature fluctuations or ammonia load .
