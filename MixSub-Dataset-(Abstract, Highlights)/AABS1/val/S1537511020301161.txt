 Accurate positioning of fruit is a key issue that has attracted much attention in the field of harvest robots . The complex environment and close proximity make the perception of dense crops in greenhouses a challenging problem . Different from various solutions proposed involving special equipment or other auxiliary information we propose a novel positioning approach based on instance segmentation using a monocular RGB camera . To achieve high position accuracy we first design a deep convolutional neural network in a multi task framework to export a binary segmentation map and an embedded feature map . To solve the problem of performance degradation in the intersection over union for the binary segmentation task caused by multi task optimisation the encoder part of our network is redesigned on the basis of a Visual Geometry Group network with 16 convolutional layers . Then mean shift clustering is used to achieve instance segmentation . Finally a contour finding algorithm is presented for outlining fruit without the help of any contextual information . Based on these contours the five fruits with the largest contour areas are selected as the targets for positioning . We verify our method on a public sweet pepper dataset and achieve competitive results . Divided by the radius of the fruit the average position error for the first target in the harvesting order is 0.18 which shows that our method outperforms the semantic segmentation method . For the first five targets in the harvesting order this index is less than 0.3 on average similar to that of the semantic segmentation method with only one target output .

@highlight An approach is presented to detect and locate sweet peppers in monocular RGB images.
@highlight The segmentation approach for positioning does not require context information.
@highlight Multiple harvesting targets are assessed simultaneously in an image.
@highlight Average error in pixels of fruit centre position over fruit radius was 18.3 .
