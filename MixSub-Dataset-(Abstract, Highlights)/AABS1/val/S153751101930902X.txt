 Forchlorfenuron can increase the production of kiwifruit but it decreases the fruit quality and shelf life and increases the rotting rate during storage . Therefore identifying the kiwifruit treated with CPPU is an urgent task to be solved in the kiwifruit industry . This work presents a convenient low cost and sensor based handheld detector for identifying kiwifruit treated with CPPU by measuring reflectance at five wavelengths which were selected from 931nm to 1689nm and determined by available optical filters on the market . The detector consisted of a micro controller a light source a multi wavelength selection apparatus a light detection and signal processing module a display and a battery . The multi wavelength selection apparatus was carried out by five optical filters and the reflected light was sensed by five photodiodes . The whole system was controlled using a STM32 micro controller . Partial least squares discrimination analysis was used to build the model for distinguishing kiwifruit between CPPU treated and untreated . The detector was tested on two varieties of kiwifruit treated with different concentration levels of CPPU . The test showed that the detector could offer accuracies of 92.9 and 85.8 for Huayou and Xuxiang respectively and the detection result can be given in 2s . The study makes identifying kiwifruit treated with CPPU be possible and it offers valuable information for developing detectors for other fruits treated with CPPU such as grape strawberry etc .
