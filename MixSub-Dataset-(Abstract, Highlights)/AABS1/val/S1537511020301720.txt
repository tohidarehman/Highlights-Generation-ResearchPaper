 As the presence of a human observer can influence the behaviour of animals a camera based system in which the cows can not leave the surveyed area and that automatically detects the animals and the areas of the barn used would be a beneficial tool to analyse dairy cattle herd activity . The aim of this study was to provide such a system and to demonstrate it in an example analysis . A group of thirty six Holstein Friesian dairy cows housed at the Chamber of Agriculture in Futterkamp in Northern Germany were recorded with eight cameras . The barn was partitioned into rectangular areas and automated motion detection was implemented and applied to detect the areas with cow activity . For the automated motion detection high evaluation metrics were reached . Area under receiver operating characteristic curve and precision recall curve varied among the cameras from 0.85 to 0.94 respectively 0.68 to 0.95 while accuracies and precision ranged from 0.783 to 0.88 and 0.544 to 0.938 . As an example video recordings from five days in April and June 2019 were used each and compared afterwards . Areas visited more in April or June could be specified and herd preferences in the use of lying cubicles and feeding troughs were revealed . It was found that space usage was most stable in the middle of the period between morning and afternoon milking and it became more unstable towards afternoon milking . The presented tool has the potential to visualise and evaluate dairy cows space usage and was developed in Python code . It is available on GitHub .

@highlight An automated camera based system to visualise cows usage of the barn was presented.
@highlight Understanding herd activity is a matter of good dairy cattle husbandry.
@highlight Seasonal differences in space usage and preferences on herd level were observed.
@highlight Stability in space usage was linked to resting phases respectively increased unrest.
@highlight Detection of uneven use of resources or local variation in air flow became possible.
