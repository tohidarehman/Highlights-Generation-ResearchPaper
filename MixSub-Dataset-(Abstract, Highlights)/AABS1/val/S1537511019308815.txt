 The selection of sampling bags for odour measurement by olfactometry is critical and challenging since the loss of odorants during storage and transportation is usually high . However there are no recommendations or limitations on the storage time for the standard Triangle odour bag method used in China . In order to optimise the selection of sampling bags selected types of sampling bags were tested and compared by using selected key odorants . The concentrations of key odorants were detected by PTR MS. Firstly background contamination was tested with total amount of background pollutants produced by Tedlar being significantly higher than the other three types of sampling bags while FEP and BOPET had less background contaminants . Secondly recovery tests showed that the SOAV recoveries after 24h of storage of Fluode Tedlar FEP and BOPET were 19.5 24.2 47.7 and 27.7 respectively . FEP had better recovery than others especially for the storage of 4 methylphenol which is one of the key odorants emitted from intensive pig production . Finally the recovery tests for 2 3 butanedione were performed under various conditions and results indicated that the storage of 2 3 butanedione in sampling bags depends on bag type initial concentration level the inner surface area to volume ratio and light condition .

@highlight Four types of sampling bag Fluode FEP BOPET and Tedlar were tested.
@highlight Background contaminant concentrations from Tedlar bags were significantly higher.
@highlight FEP showed best performance for recovery of tested odorants especially p cresol.
@highlight Recovery of 2 3 butanedione depends on initial concentration and storage conditions.
