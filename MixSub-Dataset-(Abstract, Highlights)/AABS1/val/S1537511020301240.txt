 Farm scale anaerobic digestion is increasingly regarded as a greenhouse gas emission reduction measure . To get a full picture of its emission reduction potential greenhouse gas emissions from digestate storage need to be assessed . This work quantifies methane CH

@highlight First long term monitoring of CH
@highlight and N
@highlight O emitted by farm scale mono digested manure.
@highlight Refinement of closed chamber method for continuous on line emission measurements.
@highlight A larger stored digestate volume and a higher temperature both resulted in more emissions.
@highlight Determination of dairy manure composition in terms of carbohydrates proteins and lipids.
@highlight Model calibration by comparing experimentally measured data to simulation results.
