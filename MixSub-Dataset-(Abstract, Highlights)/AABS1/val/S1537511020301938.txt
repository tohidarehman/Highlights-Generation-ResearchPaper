 Nozzle functionality was systematically analysed by acoustic monitoring in view of practical applications . Sensor technology its measurement principle and installation location were investigated regarding its suitability as a monitoring system . The study demonstrates that acoustic monitoring of nozzles can provide accurate detection of operational defects such as changes in air supply damage and filter clogging . Applying this approach can not only detect changes in the system pressure but also measure its value . Acoustic properties are significantly influenced by engineering tolerances and nozzle defects and could be accurately classified by methods such as cluster analysis .
