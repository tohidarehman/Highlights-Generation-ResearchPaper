 In the hydro transport of biomass feedstock by pipeline to bio refineries the rheology of the biomass slurry directly impacts the specifications and therefore the cost of pipeline components . In this study the rheological characteristics of untreated fine wood chip slurries across a broad range of slurry temperatures and solids concentrations were experimentally studied . Slurry samples were pumped in a closed circuit pipeline facility where slurry flow longitudinal pressure drops were simultaneously measured . The rheological characteristics of the samples were then measured using a rotational viscometer with a vane in cup geometry . At low slurry concentrations the biomass slurry exhibited Newtonian behaviour however non Newtonian behaviour was seen at higher slurry concentrations . In order to approximate the corresponding rheological parameters different well known non Newtonian viscosity models were applied to experimental data . In addition a new approach for approximating the apparent viscosity of biomass slurries using longitudinal pressure drop measurements was introduced and validated . The method has not been previously applied to non Newtonian biomass slurries under turbulent flow regimes .
