 Emissions and ventilation rates in naturally ventilated dairy barns are usually measured using indirect methods where the choice of inside and outside sampling locations is crucial . The goal of this study was to quantify the influence of the sampling strategy on the estimation of emissions and VRs . We equipped a NVDB in northern Germany with an extensive measuring setup capable of measuring emissions under all wind conditions . Ammonia NH

@highlight Sampling strategy influences the estimation of NH3 and ventilation rates.
@highlight Maximum difference in sampling strategies for NH3 estimation was 26 .
@highlight Maximum difference in sampling strategies for ventilation rate estimation was 94 .
@highlight A sampling line in the middle of the barn does not provide extra information.
@highlight Measuring around the entire perimeter of the barn increased the dataset up to 210 .
