 The hydraulic performance of thin wall lay flat polyethylene pipes with non coaxial emitters were evaluated in this study . Two experiments were performed to measure the dimensional variation of commercially available lay flat drip irrigation pipes . A model for estimating the corresponding local head loss was developed and validated using dimensional analysis . The model was then implemented in a finite element algorithm to analyse the hydraulic performance of this type of pipes . Finally a design example was provided . The results revealed that for a wall thickness of 0.13 and 0.20mm the pipe height and width tended to be equal above a relatively low pressure and the pipe cross section rapidly inflated from a quasi rectangular form to circular . For thicker walls the equivalent diameter increased continuously with increasing pressure head but it hardly reached its nominal diameter . The proposed model indicated that the local head loss was affected by the equivalent diameter emitter geometry and flow velocity . The model had high accuracy in determining the local head loss . The estimated results were in close agreement with the measured data . According to the numerical simulation the ratio of local head loss to total loss along a pipe was up to 74.71 . The design results when using an earlier model demonstrated a longer maximum lateral length since the model did not consider further contraction of the flow caused by pipe deformation . However the model proposed here could be used in the design of systems for thin wall lay flat polyethylene pipes .
