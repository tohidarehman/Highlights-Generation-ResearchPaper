 Propane heating is both a financial and an environmental burden for broiler houses located in cold climate regions . Heat recovery can reduce propane consumption significantly by preheating fresh air inflow with stalled air outflow . While there have been many studies on the improvement of broiler houses direct ventilation little attention has been given to the integration of heat exchangers . In this study an existing broiler house 800m

@highlight Heat exchangers save fuel but achieving uniform housing conditions is a challenge.
@highlight One configuration C1 reduced the air age standard deviation from 477 to 179s.
@highlight Secondary vortex with low air quality can form with some configurations.
@highlight Excessive wind chill seems hard to eliminate with ductless heat exchangers.
