 Environmental controls in a greenhouse improve microclimates thereby enhancing photosynthesis but they create spatiotemporal non uniformity of photosynthesis with implications for unstable crop production . However there has been no research focussing on the spatiotemporal variability of photosynthesis arising from greenhouse environmental controls . Here we visualise spatiotemporal distributions of leaf photosynthetic rate
