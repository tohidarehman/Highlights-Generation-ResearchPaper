 A centrifugal rice seeding spreader with a baffle ring was designed for an unmanned aerial vehicle . Rice seeds ejected by a rotating disc are caused to rebound by a baffle ring to produce a non hollow fan shaped distribution at field level . Three factors produce influences on the distribution and they are the rotation of the disc UAV flying height and the angle of the baffle ring . The discrete element method was used to simulate the range of the three factors and to explore their influences . Experiments were then conducted using a central composite design approach to optimise these three factors . Simulation results showed that the influence of the three factors on distribution uniformity was in the order UAV flying height sowing disc rotation and baffle ring angle . Optimal parameters for the most uniform distribution in simulations were sowing disc rotation 600rpm flying height 2.1m and the baffle ring angle 26 . The coefficient of variance achieved was 21.39 . The bench tests were implemented where a CV of 23.24 CV was obtained . Field tests were carried out and the CV values between 22.21 32.90 were obtained because of the influence of the wake of the drone s propellers . At optimal parameters the crop yield in the field reached 76 66kgha
