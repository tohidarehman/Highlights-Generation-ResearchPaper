 Valparaso a central southern region in Chile has one of the highest rates of wildfire occurrence in the country . The constant threat of fires is mainly due to its highly flammable forest plantation composed of 97.5

@highlight Viable to reconstruct reflectance in the SWIR region from the VNIR region.
@highlight Kernel Ridge Regressor was most suitable method to reconstruct leaf reflectance.
@highlight Reconstructed leaf spectral signature is suitable to compute vegetation indices.
@highlight Low errors in estimation of leaf moisture content support the proposed method.
