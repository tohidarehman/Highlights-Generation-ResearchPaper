 Sand media filtration is frequently used in drip irrigation systems . Commercial filter designs may use different underdrain models but wand type designs provide a large ratio of horizontal area covered by underdrains and are expected to provide a uniform flow of water through the medium . The complexity of these designs makes it difficult to analyse the effects of changing the position of wand and the slot open area . These underdrain effects were studied by means of a computational fluid dynamics model assuming clean water conditions . The backwashing process was not considered . The CFD results were validated using experimental data from a commercial sand media filter with 10 wands . Unbalanced flows between underdrains were observed in the original configuration . Two new designs were proposed a design that uses the same type of wands as the original filter but distributes them so as to have an equal horizontal area served by each wand a design that uses the same spatial distribution as the original filter but with longer wands in those regions of the original filter with lower volumetric flow . CFD simulations indicate that design can reduce the pressure drop through the filter at nominal volumetric flow rates by up to 5.8 with a more uniform flow inside the medium and design could improve the performance of the filter by achieving an up to a 4.9 reduction of pressure drop . Thus the spatial distribution of underdrains is a key parameter in the hydraulic performance of sand media filters .
