 Core objectives of precision agriculture are to improve the economic and environmental performance of agricultural systems . This study used a long term experiment in citrus to assess whether site specific nutrient management was successful from these two perspectives . Variable and uniform rate fertilisation treatments were implemented in intercalated strips across two 25ha citrus groves in So Paulo state Brazil . To generate variable rate recommendations information from soil fertility and yield maps were fed into a traditional recommendation formula used by growers . The experiment was carried out for five growing seasons . An economic energy and nutrient balance analysis was conducted . Variable rate application increased average yield in grove 1 but sometimes reduced yield in grove 2 . As a consequence profit was increased by 34.7 US

@highlight A five year study was used to evaluate variable rate fertilisation in orange groves.
@highlight Economic and environmental performance were spatially variable within orange groves.
@highlight Environmental indicators were usually superior with variable rate application.
@highlight Mixed economic results were found for variable rate application.
@highlight Variable rate application must not rely on global recommendation rules.
