 Visual monitoring of behaviour on farm is mostly challenging due to the number of animals to be observed and the time required . However behavioural problems such as cannibalism in turkeys may be preceded by subtle changes in behaviour . Machine learning techniques allow automatic behavioural monitoring of livestock to be carried out under different farming conditions . The aim of this study was to develop and test a novel pecking activity detection tool for potential use on turkey farms by means of acoustic data and a convolutional neural networks model . Under near to commercial conditions two metallic balls were used as pecking objects and suspended from the ceiling . Each pecking object was equipped with a microphone connected via a cable to a top view camera positioned on the ceiling . The recorded sound data were sampled in slots of 1s and high pass filtering was performed to eliminate background noises . A total of 9200 filtered sound files were used for training and validation and 3900 for testing set . They were labelled manually as peck or non peck using 7360 for training and 1840 for validation files and fed into the CNN model . An additional 3900 new filtered sound clips were used to test the detection phase of the trained model . The experimental results illustrate that the deep learning based detection method achieved high overall accuracy precision recall and F1 score of 96.8 89.6 92.0 and 90.8 in the detection phase . This indicates that the proposed technique could be used as a precise method for the detection of pecking activity levels in turkeys .
