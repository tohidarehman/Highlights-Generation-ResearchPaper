 During top filling of a storage silo granular material containing a range of particle sizes the smaller particles accumulate under the filling point . This interferes with air distribution preventing effective aeration of regions with higher percentages of fine material . In the first part of the study the distribution of broken corn and foreign material was investigated in a small scale silo filled from a central filling point . In this second part a new variable filling point method was developed and tested as a means of reducing the non uniform distribution of fine material during filling . The VFP mechanism produces rotational and diametric motion of the fill pipe using a rotating rim placed at the top of the experimental silo . Factors that were varied included initial BCFM

@highlight A variable filling point VFP method was developed in a small scale silo.
@highlight Effects of initial BCFM volume flow rate and fill pipe diameter were studied.
@highlight VFP gave a more uniform distribution of BCFM broken corn and foreign material .
@highlight A comparison between VFP and CFP central filling point experiments was done.
