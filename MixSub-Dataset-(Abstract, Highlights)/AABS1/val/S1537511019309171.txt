 Reasonable capacity planning is important to improve the efficiency of agricultural operations and reduce the operating cost for maintenance service providers during the harvesting season . Many studies involve staffing and scheduling approaches that account for nonstationary demand . However these methods are not applicable in the field of agricultural operations because of the explosive growth of the failure rate during the harvesting season . In addition few studies have involved allocation methods and related models between different planning levels especially for the uncertain demand in agricultural machinery maintenance service which has a strong reliance on results between the different management levels . Motivated by this observed gap this paper proposes a two stage analytical methodology that connects the data between different planning levels and aims to develop a dynamic capacity planning method of maintenance service for agricultural machinery fleets . At the first stage we develop a scheduling model for agricultural machinery fleets based on the time window of harvesting . At the second stage we propose a following service mode and a dynamic covering model based on the scheduling results in which queuing theory is used to solve the service parameters . This study satisfies the needs of service providers to find the optimum balance between high service quality and reasonable costs . A real life case study is presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model as well as the effectiveness of the designed approach .
