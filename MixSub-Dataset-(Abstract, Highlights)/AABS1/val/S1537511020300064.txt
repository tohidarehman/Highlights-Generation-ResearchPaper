 A single passive acoustic emission sensor was used to collect signals coming from an obstructed pipe in a water recirculation system . Four geometrically different obstructions were investigated . The flow field of water around each obstruction was visualised with the use of 2D particle image velocimetry to identify the different flow features . In parallel the acoustic emission signals were acquired by locating a piezoelectric sensor on the outer wall of the pipe at the tip of the obstruction . The acoustic emission signals were then pre processed and the frequency domain was extracted for 100 recordings in each case . Signals were processed further by using principle component analysis and a matrix is created for supervised machine learning algorithms . This methodology was applied over a range of four flow rates all in fully developed turbulent flow . Results showed that different obstructions generated different acoustic signals and flow fields which reflected the different flow fields observed with PIV . The average velocity and amplitude of the acoustic signals increased in magnitude with increasing flow rate . The machine learning algorithm with highest prediction values was quadratic support vector machine with predictions in the area of 95 accuracy or above . This makes the combination of machine learning and a single passive acoustic sensor a viable option to predict pipe obstructions and the type of obstruction . This may lead to a useful application for urban water supply or sewage systems as well as agricultural practice for field irrigation or the detection of nozzle blockages .
