 In this paper a visual detection method by a UAV was proposed to detect green mangoes on the surface of the tree crown rapidly and meet the need of estimating the number of mango fruits in orchards . The YOLOv2 model was used for quick detection of mango images captured by a UAV . First mango images were collected by a UAV . These images were marked manually and used to build a training set and a test set . The parameters of the model were determined by experiments . The resolution of the images was 544544 pixels . The batch size was 64 and the initial learning rate was 0.01 . The mAP of the trained model on the training set was 86.4 . Good detection results were achieved on images containing different fruit numbers and different lighting conditions with a precision of 96.1 and a recall rate of 89.0 . Finally an experiment was conducted to estimate the actual number of green mango fruits . A method of generating an image of the whole mango tree was designed . The fruit numbers estimation model for green mango was obtained by linear fitting between the actual number and the detected number of mangoes . From the comparison of the fruit numbers of 10 mango trees determined by manual calculation and model prediction an estimation error rate of 1.1 was achieved . The result demonstrated that the algorithm was effective for green mango detection and provided a methodological reference for quick estimation of the number of green mango fruits in orchards .

@highlight A UAV based technique was developed to detect mango fruit in commercial orchards.
@highlight A method for estimating the number of mango fruits per tree was developed.
@highlight The algorithm proposed in this paper had a detection accuracy of 96.1 .
