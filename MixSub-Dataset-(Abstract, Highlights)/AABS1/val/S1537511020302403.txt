 In horticulture measuring sorting by shape and determining the size and volume of fruits are all essential processes for meeting market quality standards and increasing market value . Fruit sorting and grading processes are very laborious and time consuming task but machine vision based fruit grading systems have the potential to replace human labour . However a great challenge in vision based fruit grading system is the recognition of different features such as shape size skin flaw and sometimes even three dimensional shape . In this study a simple and efficient image processing algorithm is proposed for estimating volume and 3D shape of mango fruit . The width and length of mango fruit are obtained from two dimensional colour image . Then fruit thickness is estimated based on light intensity distribution in 2D of mango fruit and maximum widththickness correlation . The 3D shape of the mango fruit is then reconstructed . The accuracy of proposed method was compare with two existing volume prediction methods . Estimated volumes were compared with measured measurements using water displacement method and the reconstructed 3D shapes were compared with measured structures of mango fruits . For a total of 150 mango samples the results show that the proposed method gave an accuracy of 96.8 whilst the two other methods gave 91.7 and 91.5 respectively . The reconstructed mango shapes were therefore in close agreement with measured shapes .
