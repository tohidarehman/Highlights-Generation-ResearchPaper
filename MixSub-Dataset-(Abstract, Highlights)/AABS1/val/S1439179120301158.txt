 Environmental fluctuations such as changes in climate agricultural management and anthropogenic land use patterns can affect the diversity of organisms inhabiting an area . Losses of biodiversity alter ecosystems processes eroding their capacity to deliver ecosystem services . Dung beetles are critical ecosystem service providers making them an ideal ecological indicator to explore the effects of land use change on biodiversity . Dung beetles were sampled across three land use types in the summers of 2015 and 2016 in the Eastern Cape province South Africa . Game ranching is regarded as a relatively low intensity land use type . It was compared with cattle ranching and dairy farming to examine their effect on dung beetle assemblage metrics guild diversity and spatial turnover . The intermediate grazing intensity of cattle ranching supported a higher abundance and diversity of both whole dung beetle assemblage and the nesting guilds followed by the game ranches and then dairy farms . Differences between the sampling years were dependent on the beetle nesting guild and largely correlated with rainfall and temperature . Cattle and game ranches shared a higher number of species than either shared with dairy farms . Whittaker s Beta diversity index showed the highest species turnover between game ranches and dairy farms . A mix of game and cattle ranching minimising dairy farming or restricting it to already ecological degraded sites appears the best alternative for maintenance of dung beetle diversity and their ecosystem services . The year to year trends of the data were in general consistent confirming that dung beetles are reliable ecological indicators but also suggest that climate change that affects rainfall will result in the reduction of the abundance and diversity of this key ecological group .

@highlight Medium grazing intensity supports a higher abundance and richness of dung beetles.
@highlight Land use change has different effects on endocoprids paracoprids and telecoprids.
@highlight A mix of game and cattle ranching maintains dung beetles diversity and abundance.
@highlight Dung beetles are reliable ecological indicators with consistent annual trends.
