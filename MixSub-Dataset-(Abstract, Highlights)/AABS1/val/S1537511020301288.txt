 Orchard operations such as mechanical pruning and spraying are heavily affected by tree architectures . Quantified inputs are necessary information for achieving precise control of these orchard operations . Even in planar orchard systems trees grow differently . Therefore it is essential to measure the canopy at the individual tree level . A three dimensional light detection and ranging sensor imaging system was developed to estimate the main canopy specifications . The LiDAR sensor was installed on a utility vehicle and driven alongside tree rows in an apple orchard . A total of 1 138 frames of point cloud data were acquired from 69 apple trees in a tall spindle architecture . An algorithm was developed in the MATLAB environment to segment trellis wires support poles and tree trunks in these point cloud images . The results indicated that the proposed algorithm achieved overall accuracy values of 88.6 82.1 and 94.7 respectively in identifying the corresponding three objects . Furthermore canopy density and depth maps were created with the distribution of points in the point cloud images . The outcomes from this study provide baseline information for precision orchard operations such as mechanical pruning and precision spraying .
