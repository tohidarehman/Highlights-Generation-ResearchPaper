 Atomisation of agricultural spray solutions through nozzles is a mechanism for delivering pesticides to their target site . Previous research using mechanistic methods has shown that oil in water formulations produce more placid liquid sheets and succumb to a breakup mechanism that begins when holes nucleate within the liquid sheet caused by inhomogeneities of the spray system . The relationships between image analysis metrics obtained from spray images and the resulting atomisation droplet size were explored to estimate drop size statistics from image features . Breakup patterns for oil in water formulations obtained from high speed videos were used with deep learning techniques Monte Carlo dropout methodology and recurrent neural networks to predict droplet size . The videos used were part of a statistical design of experiment reported by Cryer etal . . A total of 353 694 train images and 174 208 test images of atomisation were used . Prediction time for the CNN model with standard dropout regularisation was rapid and achieved 99.4 accuracy whilst the CNN with MC dropout took longer depending on how many forward passes were used but achieved 99.8 and had the ability to estimate uncertainty . The 3D convolution model provided a simpler alternative than the CNN RNN model at reduced CPU intervals . Therefore any of these deep learning methods can be suitable to address the prediction atomisation spray performance based upon images of oil in water emulsion spray patterns at the nozzle .
