 This study characterised the geometric and aerodynamic parameters of 35 insect proof screens with different weft and warp threads with porosities ranging from 0.237 to 0.556m

@highlight Different models estimated aerodynamic characteristics from geometric parameters.
@highlight Pressure drop coefficient estimated from screen porosity using Re based on thread diameter.
@highlight Pressure drop coefficient also estimated from porosity and Re based on thread thickness.
@highlight Permeability estimated from pore surface area or thread diameter screen porosity.
@highlight Inertial factor estimated from screen porosity or thread diameter inner pore diameter.
