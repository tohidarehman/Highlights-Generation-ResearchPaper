 A method for quantifying aggregate size distribution from the images of soil samples is introduced . Knowledge of soil aggregate size distribution can help to inform soil management practices for the sustainable growth of crops . While current in field approaches are mostly subjective obtaining quantifiable results in a laboratory is labour and time intensive . Our goal is to develop an imaging technique for quantitative analysis of soil aggregate size distribution which could provide the basis of a tool for rapid assessment of soil structure . The prediction accuracy of pattern spectra descriptors based on hierarchical representations from attribute morphology are analysed as well as the impact of using images of different quality and scales . The method is able to handle greater sample complexity than the previous approaches while working with smaller samples sizes that are easier to handle . The results show promise for size analysis of soils with larger structures and minimal sample preparation as typical of soil assessment in agriculture .
