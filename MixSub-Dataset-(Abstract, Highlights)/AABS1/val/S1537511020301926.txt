 In this study hyperspectral imaging and machine learning were utilised to develop a technique for detecting different disease development stages of powdery mildew in squash . Data were collected in the laboratory as well as in the field using an unmanned aerial vehicle . Radial basis function was used to discriminate between healthy and diseased plants and to classify the severity level of a plant the most significant bands to differentiate between healthy and different stages of disease development were selected . Furthermore 29 spectral vegetation indices were tested and evaluated for their ability to detect and classify healthy and PM infected plants the M value was used to evaluate the VIs . The water index and the photochemical reflectance index were able to accurately detect and classify PM in asymptomatic early and late development stages under laboratory conditions . Under field conditions the spectral ratio of 761 accurately detected PM in early stages and the chlorophyll index green the normalised difference of 750 705 the green normalised difference vegetation index and the spectral ratio of 850 in late stages . The classification results by using RBF in laboratory conditions for the asymptomatic and late stage was 82 and 99 respectively while in field conditions it was 89 and 96 in early and late disease development stages respectively .

@highlight A lab and UAV based powdery mildew PM disease detection system was developed.
@highlight Spectral reflectance analysis of PM infected squash leaves was performed.
@highlight The most significant wavelengths and vegetation indices were selected.
@highlight The technique was able to detect different stages of PM progress in squash.
