 Variations in the moisture content of grains strongly influence machine performance analysis during crop harvesting and post harvest grain handling operations . For experimental or numerical methods such as discrete element method technique to include the effect of MC on physical and mechanical properties comprehensive study was conducted to investigate the effect of maize MC on single kernel properties and bulk grain dynamic responses which have relevance for DEM crop model calibration . Individual kernel properties of shape size coefficient of restitution and stiffness and bulk material responses of bulk density angle of repose direct shear test hopper flowability and grain machine interaction impact plate forces responses were measured on maize samples at 11 16 and 26 MC levels . At individual particle responses of coefficient of restitution and stiffness maize kernels at MC of 26 had significantly the lowest values compared to the values at the other MC . Increasing maize MC reduced the hopper discharge flowability by 20 and GMI impact plate forces by 25 . Significant effects of MC on the material behaviours should be considered for calibration of DEM maize models .
