 A greenhouse climate crop yield model was adapted to include additional climate modification techniques suitable for enabling sustainable greenhouse management at high latitudes . Additions to the model were supplementary lighting secondary heating and heat harvesting technologies . The model 1 included the impact of different light sources on greenhouse air temperature and tomato production 2 included a secondary heating system 3 calculated the amount of harvested heat whilst lighting was used . The crop yield model was not modified but it was validated for growing tomato in a semi closed greenhouse equipped with HPS lamps and LED in Norway . The combined climate yield model was validated with data from a commercial greenhouse in Norway . The results showed that the model was able to predict the air temperature with sufficient accuracy during the validation periods with Relative Root Mean Square Error 10 . Tomato yield was accurately simulated in the cases under investigation yielding a final production difference between 0.7 and 4.3 . Lack of suitable data prevented validation of the heat harvest sub model but a scenario is presented calculating the maximum harvestable heat in an illuminated greenhouse . Given the cumulative energy used for heating the total amount of heating pipe energy which could be fulfilled with the heat harvestable from the greenhouse air was around 50 . Given the overall results the greenhouse climate model modified and presented in this study is considered accurate enough to support decisions about investments at farm level and or evaluate beforehand the possible consequences of environmental policies .
