 Conventional ripeness analyses performed on olives require different analytical tools chemicals sample preparation and they are time consuming . The same analyses performed using an optical and non destructive technology such as visible and near infrared spectroscopy allow prediction of ripeness parameters in a simple and quick way . The purpose of this work is to compare the environmental impact of conventional ripeness analyses and an optical approach performed on olive fruits . The conventional analyses identified as reference were moisture oil and phenols content . Life Cycle Assessment was applied to assess the environmental impact . The approach from cradle to grave considered all the inputs and outputs of each analysis including machinery reagents and energy necessary for analyses . Furthermore for the optical analysis the activities required for the instrument calibration were also considered . Quantifying the environmental damage the results showed clear advantages for optical analysis allowing vis NIR spectroscopy to be defined as a green technology .
