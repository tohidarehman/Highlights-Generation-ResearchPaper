 Since honey bees are one of the most important actors in the whole world it is important to follow the life of these insects in order to preserve them from danger via a range of risk factors such as Colony Collapse Disorder pesticides pests etc . Therefore it is important to identify any abnormalities inside the honey bee colony at an early stage which may be possible using modern technologies e.g . monitoring systems data processing and analysis . This research proposes a solution for honey bee colony state identification using temperature data and fuzzy logic . The detection process proposes a Fuzzy Inference System that receives five input parameters and provides an output pointing to three defined possible states normal death and extreme . The rule base for the inference system was defined taking into account the knowledge of field experts literature research previous observations and was based only on temperature data and temperature changes inside the hive during different seasons . The proposed system proved to be quite robust showing an accuracy value of 98 100 precision and specificity 97 recall and 98 F1 score when tested with validation set .
