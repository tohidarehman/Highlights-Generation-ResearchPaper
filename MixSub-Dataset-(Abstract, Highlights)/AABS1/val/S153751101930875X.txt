 Accurate crop yield estimation is important for agronomic and economic decision making . This study evaluated the performance of imagery data acquired using a unmanned aerial vehicle based imaging system for estimating yield of maize

@highlight A low cost UAV based visual band imaging system was used in monitoring maize growth.
@highlight Corn yield was estimated using visual band image features with an error of 615 .
@highlight The spatial resolution and imaging time influenced the accuracy of yield estimation.
@highlight The effect of variable rate N application on crops might be evaluated by images.
