 Flower and fruitlet thinning can be an effective method of improving the yield and quality of fruit . Automatic detection flowers and fruits at different growth stages is essential for the intelligent management of apple orchards . The further segmentation of blossom areas contributes to extracting detailed growth information of apple flowers . However the precise detection and segmentation of blossom images is yet to be fully accomplished . An instance segmentation model which improves Mask Scoring RCNN with a U Net backbone is proposed for the detection and segmentation of apple flowers with three different levels of growth status bud semi open and fully open . The foreground and background of apple flower images were combined based on the growth characteristics of apple flowers . Furthermore 200 background images were added as background samples to form the image training dataset and a U Net backbone was used to improve the MaskIoU head of Mask Scoring RCNN model . This method can improve the efficiency of feature utilisation and promote the reuse of features through the concatenation of feature maps in the process of encoding and decoding . The performance of the MASU RCNN model was verified by 100 testing images . With ResNet 101 FPN adopted as the feature extraction backbone the precision of MASU RCNN reached 96.43 recall 95.37 F1 score 95.90 mean average precision 0.594 and mean intersection over union 91.55 . The segmentation results of MASU RCNN model outperformed those of the other state of the art models .
