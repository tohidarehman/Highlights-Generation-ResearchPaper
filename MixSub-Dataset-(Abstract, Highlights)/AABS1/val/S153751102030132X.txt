 Debarking has the potential to make short rotation woody crops more economically attractive by both improving the quality of woody material and creating a new product stream from separated bark . Thus in this research the ultimate strength of the wood bark interface was studied relative to the development and optimisation of debarking systems and strategies . Four genetically different cultivars of shrub willow three harvest times and different moisture levels were tested at a quasi static extension rate of 0.5mmmin

@highlight Debarking has potential to make short rotation woody crops more profitable.
@highlight Wood bark bond strength can vary significantly among shrub willow genotypes.
@highlight Wood bark bond strength is higher during dormant season compared to growing season.
@highlight Moisture content has inverse relationship with wood bark bond strength.
@highlight Cross linkages of Ca
@highlight in side chains of pectin may affect cell wall adhesion.
