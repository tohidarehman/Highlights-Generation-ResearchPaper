 In order to minimise nutrient losses comprehensive overviews of the magnitude of gaseous emissions from manure composting processes and the factors that influence these losses are urgently needed . This study presents a meta analysis of greenhouse gases and ammonia NH

@highlight Silo composts perform better in reducing GHG emissions than static turning windrow.
@highlight Lower initial TC and TN minimises emissions better than adjusting environmental conditions.
@highlight Applying compost biofilters is most effective to reduce NH
@highlight emissions during composting.
@highlight Adding sawdust or straw could significantly reduce CH
@highlight and N
@highlight O emissions during composting.
