 A study was conducted to simulate numerically the effects of internal inserts in the form of an annular segment attached to the wall of a cylindrical container . A series of DEM simulations were performed with an assembly of 200 000 spherical particles with a mean diameter of 3.79mm

@highlight Flow patterns in the presence of annular inserts were visualised.
@highlight Extent of development of dead zones during discharge was determined.
@highlight The experimental and simulated load asymmetries are consistent.
@highlight Maps of circumferential distribution of wall pressure were generated.
@highlight Inserts may reduce load asymmetry during eccentric discharge.
