 This research studied microclimate and evapotranspiration of pepper in high tunnel screenhouses and greenhouses . A study was carried out during three consecutive seasons 20152016 20162017 and 20172018 in two high tunnels . One was covered by a plastic sheet and the other by a porous screen . Other than the covers the structures were identical . In both houses microclimate variables were measured simultaneously above the canopy . Evapotranspiration was estimated using six different variations of the PenmanMonteith model . Plant transpiration was measured by the heat pulse technique . Measured transpiration was compared with model estimates of ET to identify the model in best agreement with measurements . Linear regressions between internal and external climatic conditions resulted in R

@highlight Pepper transpiration and microclimate were measured in high tunnels.
@highlight Various models estimated ET in a greenhouse and a screenhouse.
@highlight Screenhouse microclimate interacted with the outside more than the greenhouse did.
@highlight Models using internal conditions were better than those using external climate.
