 The matching of the control parameters of clutch hydraulic systems was studied in order to improve the shift quality of the tractors fitted with hydrostatic power split continuously variable transmission during starting . Firstly mathematical models of the clutch hydraulic system CVT and tractor were constructed and the models of the key components were tested and validated . Secondly an evaluation indicator of the shift quality was determined and 6 parameters which may affect shift quality were defined including instruction time and the instruction voltage for clutch pressure control . Thirdly through single factor simulation the influence mechanism of parameters on tractor shift quality was determined . Finally a solutions map was proposed and a matching law of the control parameters was obtained accordingly . The results showed that the tractor shift quality improves with increasing of the initial instruction voltage at the first voltage rise and increasing instruction time consumed at the second voltage rise but decreases with the increasing of the terminal instruction voltage . If the interaction among various parameters is considered the terminal instruction voltage should be taken as a low value the pressure relief time of brake relative to shift start node should not be too long .

@highlight A hydrostatic power split CVT with single planetary gear for tractors is investigated.
@highlight The influence mechanism of control parameters on shift quality is revealed.
@highlight A high dimensional visualisation method called solutions map is proposed.
@highlight Terminal pressure and separation time of clutch significantly affect shift quality.
