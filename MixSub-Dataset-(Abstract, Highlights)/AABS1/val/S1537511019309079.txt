 The interface behaviour between the steel surfaces of a silo and the grains wheat stored within plays a decisive role in the design of the structure of the silo . A series of strain controlled direct shear tests including monotonic loading cyclic loading and post cyclic loading were used to study the behaviour of the wheat steel interface behaviour . The influence of cycle numbers shear displacement amplitude normal stress and initial void ratio on the behaviour of the interface behaviour are examined in detail . It was observed that the cyclic loading results in an increasing peak strength internal friction angle and apparent cohesion whereas decreasing interface contraction deformation occurs . The results show that the values of peak stress increase with increasing displacement amplitude and cycles and they change slightly after 10 cycles . The interface exhibits overall contraction while the contraction is suppressed by an alternating small dilation during cyclic loading . The ultimate peak shear strength increases with increasing normal stress and decreasing initial void ratio . During the tests the interfaces displayed larger contraction at higher normal stresses and initial void ratios . These findings provide useful information for the analysis of the wheat steel interface behaviour during both static and cyclic loading conditions .
