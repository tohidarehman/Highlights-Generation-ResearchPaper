 Site specific application of herbicides is highly desirable for optimising its usage and reducing environmental damages . Thus developing techniques for identification and mapping of weeds is necessary for a proper precision agriculture adoption . Such weed identification for site specific management is difficult when the main crop is already established in the field . This study shows the possibility of differentiating sugarcane plants from weeds by the spectral behaviour of the leaves . The performance of two modelling methods SIMCA and the RF algorithm was compared . The simplification of the Vis NIR spectrum into only four bands of interest was verified by demonstrating they had the same differentiation ability as the full visible near infra red spectrum . Thus it was shown that performing the proper band selection and local calibration using a spectral classification approach may allow weed mapping and facilitate localised herbicide application .

@highlight Crop differentiation from weeds using Vis NIR spectroscopy is feasible.
@highlight Few spectral bands allow proper plant differentiation.
@highlight A few band sensor can be developed to assist in site specific weed management.
