 Crop height and density estimation ahead of the combine harvester have been investigated over the last 30 years but they remain a challenge . LiDAR technology is increasingly being investigated for phenotyping and monitoring of cereals . However so far little has been published about the influence of laser mounting position and robust online measurement of height and density from a single LiDAR scan . Therefore the influence of the angle and height of the LiDAR mounting on crop height and density estimation in wheat and barley was investigated in this study . Tests were conducted in different crop heights densities moisture levels and varieties . The crop height was estimated with a root mean squared error of 0.082mat an angle of 90 between the LiDAR scanning plane and the horizontal . Two methods were compared for crop density estimation . The inter percentile and the transversal variance method both successfully predicted the crop density but the variance based method performed better with a coefficient of determination R

@highlight LiDAR allows to estimate crop height and density in small grain crop.
@highlight Crop height cannot be estimated properly at angles to the horizontal below 70.
@highlight Variance based crop density estimation is robust against small viewing angle variations.
@highlight LiDAR data correlate better to ears dry mass than to number of tillers.
