 A Zebra Chip disease detection system was developed based on hyperspectral imaging to minimise economic losses in the New Zealand potato chip industry . Current detection methods for other than heavily diseased tubers require peeling or cutting of potato tubers . A rapid and non destructive grading method would be ideal to remove ZC diseased potatoes at line before processing . The spectral signatures from a large population of commercially sourced potatoes were collected using HSI in the spectral range of 550nm1700nm . Spectral signatures of each potato were extracted by segmentation and morphological operations . A calibration dataset with and without pre processing was used for modelling using the partial least squares discriminant analysis . The model performance shows 92 accuracy for ZC potato identification on validation data . Waveband optimisation by variable importance in projection method revealed 34 wavebands sensitive to ZC diseased potatoes . This optimum set of wavebands allowed ZC identification with 89 accuracy . The experiments demonstrate the potential of HSI for identification of ZC infected potatoes in whole tuber before processing . Efficient removal of diseased tubers would reduce processing losses and provide a potential opportunity to access export markets for intact tubers .
