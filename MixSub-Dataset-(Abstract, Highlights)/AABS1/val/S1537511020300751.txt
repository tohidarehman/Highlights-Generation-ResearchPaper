 This research was aimed at determining the effect of optical variables for a single integrating sphere system coupled with the inverse adding doubling method on estimating the reduced scattering coefficient

@highlight A single integrating sphere SIS system was constructed.
@highlight Accuracy reproducibility and sensitivity of SIS system was assessed.
@highlight Effects of optical variables on estimating reduced scattering coefficient 
@highlight  investigated.
@highlight The
@highlight of apple skin and flesh samples were estimated separately.
