 A study was conducted to investigate the effect of velocity ratio on the performance of an active passive combined offset disc harrow . This implement unites the benefits of powered discs and combination tillage to reduce draft requirements wheel slip and gross fuel consumption . The test parameters consisted of forward velocities 3.46 4.55 and 6.82kmh

@highlight Velocity ratio influenced energy requirement and tillage effectiveness parameters.
@highlight An increase in velocity ratio helped to reduce the draft and torque requirement.
@highlight Specific energy requirement was found to be minimum at velocity ratio of 2.91.
@highlight Both soil inversion and pulverization increased with increase in velocity ratio.
@highlight Optimum velocity ratio exists for an active passive combination tillage implement.
