 Oil based emulsions are commonly formulations in agricultural spraying but their spray break up behaviour and droplet characteristics differ from those when water is sprayed . In this paper the effect of spray structure on the droplet characteristics droplet size distribution and droplet velocity were investigated using the high speed photomicrography and image processing . Formation of the typical spray structure and the effect of emulsion concentration and spray pressure on the spray structure and droplets characteristics were analysed . Results show that the use of oil based emulsion decreases the liquid sheet area and the flapping form of break up when compared to water sprays and it is this change that is responsible for the increase of droplet size . Thus oil based emulsion sprays have a narrower droplet size distribution due to the limited amount of liquid sheet flapping and the subsequent changes break up structure . The decrease of flapping increases the velocity of the droplets in oil based emulsion spray by 43 compared with the water spray . Emulsion sprays typically have both flapping and perforating break up mechanisms when the emulsion concentration is low and the spray pressure is high . The results in this paper indicate that the perforating break up mechanism can dominate the flapping mechanism when spray pressure is 0.3MPa and the emulsion concentration 0.1 .

@highlight Quantitative information of liquid sheet is obtained via image processing methods.
