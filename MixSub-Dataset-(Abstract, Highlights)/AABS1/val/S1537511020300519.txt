 Vegetable crop productivity is susceptible to damage from weed competition with early season weeds a control priority to prevent significant yield loss . There is an urgent need for a reliable robotic sensing system that can work well in a variety of crops to achieve universal weed crop differentiation which would facilitate further development in robotic technologies for farming and bring economic benefits to vegetable production . The aim of this study was to develop a novel technique to create a machine readable crop plant using a systemic crop signalling compound applied to seeds or transplants . The protocols for the crop signalling method and its detection are described . Rhodamine B was selected as the signalling compound in this study because it could be used as a fluorescent tracer had a unique optical appearance in plants and had the necessary properties to allow systemic behaviour in vegetable seedlings . The RhB tracer was applied to snap bean and the systemic behaviour analysed with a fluorescent macroscope . The uptake of RhB varied among treatment methods . The RhB uptake through the seed coat of snap beans was found mainly in the seedling hypocotyls . The results for root uptake showed that RhB could be more readily transported to the whole plant through the root system as compared to the application to seeds . The midvein and secondary veins of bean leaves showed stronger RhB fluorescence than other regions of the leaf . Higher concentrations of RhB resulted in greater absorption by the plant . Although the crop signalling compound could follow both seed and root pathways for plant uptake the uptake based on the root pathway had greater capacity than that of the seed pathway . The use of RhB provided a systemic crop signalling compound was discussed on further research and field tested to have application to enhance weed crop differentiation by automated weeders in vegetable crops . The systemic crop signalling system successfully created a machine readable signal on vegetable crops and appeared to be non destructive cost effective efficient and accurate for performing automatic plant care tasks .
