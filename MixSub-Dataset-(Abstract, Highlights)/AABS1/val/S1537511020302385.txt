 Agricultural machinery is crucial to agriculture because it enables field activities and production in large scale . Through mechanisation agriculture requires inputs such as fuel and indirectly demands materials . Its impact can be assessed through energy water and carbon footprints . Some studies have updated indices for agricultural machinery showing different results from those of the 1970s and 1980s . This study presents environmental indices based on energy carbon and water footprints for the life cycle of six types of agricultural machinery . The machines studied were tractors sugarcane harvesters coffee harvesters sprayers planters and combiners . Inputs used directly and for the maintenance phase have been taken into account . The total energy carbon and water footprints were by multiplying the material flows by their respective energy embodiments consumed water and carbon footprints indices . Carbon steel accounted for the highest share of energy demand 4579 of carbon footprint and 1959 of water footprint . However the coffee harvester was an exception since it used nylon making it the machinery with the largest water footprint . Repair and maintenance accounted for a smaller share of all footprints except for the sugarcane harvester . The water footprint was from 21 to 55m for tractors and between 35 and 391m
