 The early non destructive detection of chilling injury in aubergine fruit was investigated using spectroscopy . CI is a physiological disorder that occurs when the fruit is subjected to temperatures lower than 12C . Reference measurements of CI were acquired by visual appearance analysis measuring electrolyte leakage mass loss and firmness evaluations which demonstrated that even before three days of storage at 2C the CI process was initiated . An ANOVA simultaneous component analysis was used to investigate the effect of temperature and storage time on the Fourier transform near infra red spectral fingerprints . The ASCA model demonstrated that temperature duration of storage and their interaction had a significant effect on the spectra . In addition it was possible to highlight the main variations in the experimental results with reference to the effects of the main factors and with respect to storage time to discover any major monotonic trends with time . Partial least squares discriminant analysis was used as a supervised classification method to discriminate between fruit based on chilling and safe temperatures . In this case only significant spectral wavebands which were significantly influenced by the effect of temperature based on ASCA were utilised . PLS DA prediction accuracy was 87.42.7 as estimated by a repeated double cross validation procedure and the significance of the observed discrimination was verified by means of permutation tests . The outcomes of this study indicate a promising potential for near infra red spectroscopy to provide non invasive rapid and reliable detection of CI in aubergine fruit .

@highlight ASCA method was applied to aubergine fruit stored at safe and chilling temperature.
@highlight All main factors and their interaction had a significant effect on FT NIR spectra.
@highlight The most affected spectra introduced by ASCA were assigned as PLS DA input.
@highlight PLS DA successfully classified aubergine based on their storage temperature.
