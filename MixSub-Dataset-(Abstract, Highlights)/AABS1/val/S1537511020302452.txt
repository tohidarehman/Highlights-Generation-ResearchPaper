 The prediction of soil sinkage under wheels and tracks is of significant importance for determining the off road vehicle performance and level of compaction of agricultural soils . Bekker s theory for pressure and sinkage relationship has been widely applied to estimate the vehicle mobility performance for designing off road vehicles for deformable terrains . However the Bekker s constants which reflect the soil sinkage and behaviour of soil under load vary significantly among soils . There is a paucity of studies on paddy soils in the plastic state . Furthermore the determination of soil stiffness constants via pressuresinkage tests is usually time consuming . In this study the impact of three soil physical properties including soil water content clay content and density on the soil stiffness constants for sinkage behaviour in paddy soils was assessed based on experimental results . Subsequently numerical models were established to quantify the Bekker s stiffness constants measured from soil bin tests using soil physical properties . Three quadratic polynomial regression models were established and evaluated to quantify the three constants using soil water content clay content and density . The P values from goodness of fit tests suggested significant fit and insignificant unfit between the simulated and experimental results . The established models were further validated using the soil samples with different physical properties . The comparisons between soil stiffness constants predicted using the model with laboratory measured values indicated satisfactory model performances R
