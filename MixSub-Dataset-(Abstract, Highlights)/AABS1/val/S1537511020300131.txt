 When a silo is being filled with the granular material containing a range of particle sizes larger particles tend to flow towards the silo wall while the smaller particles accumulate near the centre of the silo . Shelled corn was used in this study . This work encompasses the first part where the distribution of broken corn and foreign material was investigated in a small scale silo filled from a central filling point . Factors that were varied included initial BCFM volume flow rate of material and fill pipe diameter . A new approach was developed to ensure accurate sampling in the radial and vertical direction in the silo . The results indicated that the distribution of fine material became more uniform at lower grain depths and for increasing initial BCFM volume flow rate and fill pipe diameter . The accumulation of fine material at the centre of the silo increased with increase in the distance from the bottom of the silo . In addition a nonlinear model was developed to predict BCFM distribution in CFP method . Based on statistical parameters namely coefficient of determination

@highlight Central filling point CFP method was studied in a small scale silo.
@highlight BCFM was affected by initial BCFM volume flow rate and fill pipe diameter.
@highlight BCFM Broken corn and foreign material distribution was modelled.
