 The performance of maize picking mechanisms directly affects harvesting quality and working efficiency . Numerous field experiments have been carried out to improving picking performance but they have been restricted by factors such as high cost the varieties of maize used and variable harvesting periods . Virtual simulation analysis was proposed as a replacement for field experiments to provide an accurate reference for optimising the picking mechanism . A finite element model of a maize plant and picking mechanism was established based on the experimental results and related data from the research literature . Its accuracy and reasonableness was verified by comparing the simulation results to the data obtained by an experiment using a high speed camera . The coupling effect of the three main factors were investigated using simulations . The results revealed that the medium rotational speed for the picking roller reduced the damage incurred by maize during the picking process while ensuring good harvesting efficiency and picking board edge angles in the range 1315 were optimal . Although reducing the feed in speed could reduce damage to the maize this was not the most prominent factor . Besides the appropriate rotational speed of the picking roller to guarantee optimal working efficiency was investigated using power consumption experiments . The results of this study should be useful as a reference for the design development and optimisation of the maize picking mechanism .
