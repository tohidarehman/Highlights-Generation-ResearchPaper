 In precision livestock farming individual identification and analysis of feeding behaviour have a great impact on optimising the productivity and improving health monitoring . The sensors usually used to measure several parameters from an individual dairy cow are invasive uncomfortable and stressful for animals . To overcome these limits we have developed a non invasive system based entirely on image analysis . The top of the dairy cow s head image captured in a dairy cow farm was used as a Region of Interest and different classifiers based on Convolutional Neural Network model are used to monitor the feeding behaviour and perform individual identification of seventeen Holstein dairy cows . We use one CNN to detect the dairy cow presence in the feeder zone . A second CNN is used to determine the dairy cow position in front of the feeder standing or feeding . A third CNN is used to check the availability of food in the feeder and if so recognise the food category . The last CNN is devoted to individual identification of the dairy cow . Furthermore we also explore the contribution of a CNN coupled to Support Vector Machine and the combination of multiple CNNs in the individual identification process . For the evaluation step we have used a dataset composed of 7265 images of 17 Holstein dairy cows during feeding periods on a commercial farm . Results show that our method yields high scores in each step of our algorithm .

@highlight Top head image is used as Region of Interest for dairy cow individual identification.
@highlight Dairy cows are classified in the feeder zone as standing or feeding.
@highlight Cow is Feeding if in the feeder zone head is downward and food is available in feeder.
@highlight Monitoring includes new parameters such as food availability and type
@highlight Accuracy 97 for individual identification on 4875 images of 17 cows using multi CNN.
