 A portable visible and near infrared device could evaluate and monitor internal qualities of fruit on tree as well as during storage conditions after harvest . A portable Vis NIR device which consisted of a commercial spectrometer in the spectral range of 4001000nm an interactance fibre optic probe a novel switch system and a microcontroller was developed and its ability for apple soluble solids content prediction was evaluated . A switch system was designed for spectra collection resulting in the acquisition of three spectra for each measurement of apple fruit namely the white reference dark reference and sample spectrum which can be used to correct the spectrum of apple fruit dynamically . The results showed that the dynamic correction was more promising than the static correction in which the reference spectra were obtained only once . A model for SSC was built using partial least square with the coefficient of determination of prediction

@highlight A prototype of portable Vis NIR device for apple SSC detection was developed.
@highlight The spectrum of apple fruit was corrected dynamically for each measurement.
@highlight The device showed potential to predict SSC of apples in the lab and in the field.
