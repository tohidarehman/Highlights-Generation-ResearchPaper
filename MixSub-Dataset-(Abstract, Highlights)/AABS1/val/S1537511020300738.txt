 Greenhouse models are important tools for the analysis and design of greenhouse systems and for offering decision support to growers . While many models are available relatively few include the influence of supplementary lighting on the greenhouse climate and crop . This study presents GreenLight a model for greenhouses with supplemental lighting . GreenLight extends state of the art models by describing the qualitative difference between the common lighting system of high pressure sodium lamps and the newest technology for horticultural lighting the light emitting diodes . LEDs differ from HPS lamps in that they operate at lower temperatures emit mostly convective heat and relatively little radiative heat and can be more efficient in converting electricity to photosynthetically active radiation . These differences can have major implications on the greenhouse climate and operation and on the amount of heat that must be supplied from the greenhouse heating system . Model predictions have been evaluated against data collected in greenhouse compartments equipped with HPS and LED lamps . The model predicted the greenhouse s heating needs with an error of 851Wm

@highlight Model for lighting in greenhouses including HPS and LED lamps was developed.
@highlight Model was evaluated using data from a greenhouse with HPS and LED top lights.
@highlight Model evaluates energy requirements of the greenhouse with an accuracy of 112 .
@highlight Model predicts indoor temperature and humidity with an RRMSE of 611 .
@highlight Model is publicly available in free open source format.
