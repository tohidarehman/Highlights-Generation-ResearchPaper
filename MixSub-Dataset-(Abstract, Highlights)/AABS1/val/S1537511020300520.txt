 Greenhouses shelter the crop from unfavourable environmental conditions and the covering largely contributes to creating beneficial growing conditions inside . There is no perfect greenhouse cover for all combinations of crop and climatic regions . Usually a greenhouse cover has permanent optical properties determining the amount of solar radiation entering the greenhouse . Consequently during crop growth the amount and quality of the solar radiation is not ideal for the crop . Growers try to compensate for this by using different additional techniques such as temporary coatings screens and heating or cooling . New materials are currently being developed whose optical properties can be instantaneously changed . This will allow growers to gain real time control on the quantity and quality of the light entering the greenhouse to match crop requirement . The present study uses advanced simulation models to predict the potential of covers with switchable properties to improve tomato yield and use of resources in different climatic regions and with different greenhouse types . Results indicate that covers with switchable properties have advantages over permanent properties for most combinations of filter type location . Only in very extreme tropical climates will covering materials with permanent filter properties have advantages . Furthermore simulations models can play a major role in optimising the switchable filter design .

@highlight No single type of greenhouse cover has optimum performance in every climate location.
@highlight Switching radiometric properties looks promising for high light demand crops.
@highlight Switchable materials have no advantage over permanent filters in tropical climates.
@highlight Simulation could be a powerful tool to determine optimum radiometric properties.
@highlight Simulation should include specific combination of crop greenhouse location type.
