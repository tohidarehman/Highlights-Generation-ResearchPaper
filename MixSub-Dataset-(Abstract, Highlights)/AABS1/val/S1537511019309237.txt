 An algorithm is presented to identify model parameters in grey box models . The solver is convex so the global optimum is guaranteed . The method is applied to estimate bulk transfer coefficients in greenhouses from easily monitored data . This model covers the most important processes such as conduction losses to the environment heat exchange with neighbouring compartments heating from the sun and lighting installations and ventilation losses . Screen positions are also included in the model . Each process is parameterised so that the specific situation of each greenhouse can be identified . Greenhouse experiments are often repeated in the same greenhouse or performed in parallel . If some model parameters are assumed to remain identical in these experiments this can be incorporated in the optimiser making it more robust . The estimator is exemplified using measurements from two compartments in a greenhouse one equipped with LED lighting the other equipped with HPS lighting . It showed that effective conduction parameters for the greenhouse and screens were similar to values found in literature 5.8 and 5Wm

@highlight A convex parameter estimator is proposed to identify model parameters and states. It avoids problems with local minima.
@highlight Identical processes in different experiments are characterized by the same parameters by a consensus algorithm.
@highlight Thermodynamic model of a greenhouse including most obvious heat flows screens and ventilation losses.
@highlight LED and HPS heat the air similarly at the height of the plants notwithstanding that HPS consumes 45 more power.
