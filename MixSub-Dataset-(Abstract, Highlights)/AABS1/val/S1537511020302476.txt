 The differences between temperatures in the animal occupied zone and temperatures measured by control system sensors are rarely explored . This experimental study quantifies the dry bulb air temperature distribution inside a finisher pig building that combines natural ventilation through automatically controlled openings with a mechanical ventilation system . Year long temperature data from 28 sensors located at 3 different heights in the building was analysed to help understand the temperature distributions and indicate the temperatures below or above an assumed optimal temperature range defined as between 14C and 24C . Relatively large variations in the spatial temperature distribution were found and they were higher in the vertical direction than in the longitudinal direction . The temperatures measured in the AOZ at 0.25m height were on average 7C warmer than that at 1.5m height . The AOZ temperature correlated better with temperatures measured at 0.7m or 1.5m height in the same pen than with temperatures measured in the AOZ at other pens . The analyses show that a proportionalintegral based control system effectively counteracts the effects of outdoor wind conditions and the control system is capable of maintaining the defined optimal temperature at the measurement height . However the optimum temperatures at the measurement heights above AOZ do not correspond to the measured temperatures in the AOZ .

@highlight Temperature gradients exist in both vertical and horizontal direction.
@highlight Average temperatures at 0.25m were 7C warmer than at 1.5m for 50 of time.
@highlight Temperature gradients were worst during the winter and periods with no wind.
@highlight Maintaining optimal temperature at control sensors alone is not sufficient for pigs.
@highlight Temperatures experienced by pigs are not reflected by control temperatures.
