 As the grain cleaning process in a combine harvester relies on pneumatic separation of the grain and chaff the aerodynamic forces created by the airflow have a large impact on the cleaning performance . Therefore to optimise a multi duct cleaning device in a rice combine harvester First the equivalent resistances for the different fan ducts were quantified with a resistance model of fluidised grain and an airflow resistance model for the cleaning sieve . Perforated plates with different opening ratios were designed to simulate working loads . A computational fluid dynamics model was validated by comparing simulation results with hot wire anemometer measurements . The effects of working loads on airflow velocity and volume distribution at the ducts and total pressure distribution inside the fan were studied in simulation and experiments . After integration of the designed multi duct fan into the cleaning system airflow measurements inside the cleaning shoe were made and cleaning performance tests were carried out on a test bench . The ideal airflow velocity within the cleaning shoe was investigated by correlating airflow velocities at different measuring points and analysing the cleaning performance . An evaluation of this multi duct cleaning system in the field showed large improvements in terms of the grain sieve losses ratio and grain impurity ratio compared to a combine harvester with the single duct cleaning system . The corresponding grain sieve loss decreased from 2.46 to 0.08 while the grain impurity ratio decreased from 4.78 to 0.511 .
