 Mechanical size reduction due to its significant effect on transport phenomena and biodegradability is the crucial initial step in the production of advanced biofuels . As is generally known particle size reduction is high energy demand operation . Energy requirements were experimentally studied and mathematically modelled for the processing of wheat straw with 4.6 moisture content wet basis that was reduced in size using a knife mill . The characteristic particle sizes for wheat straw before and after milling were analysed using the Rosin Rammler Sperling Bennet model of particle size distribution . Energy demand 0.721.2kWh t

@highlight RRSB model is suitable to describe the particle size distribution of straws.
@highlight Wheat straw with 5 wt. in moisture evinces brittle behaviour.
@highlight Energy demand is 0.721.2kWh t
@highlight for 1.133.86 size reduction ratios of D
@highlight Specific energy demand is reliably modelled by Ritttinger theory.
@highlight Rittinger constant value of 19.9kWhmmt
@highlight can be used to model energy demand.
