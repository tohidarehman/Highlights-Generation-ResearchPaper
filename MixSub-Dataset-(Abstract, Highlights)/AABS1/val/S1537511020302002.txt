 Apples in modern orchards with vertical fruiting wall trees are comparatively easier to harvest and specifically suitable for robotic picking where accurate apple detection and obstacle free access are fundamentally important . However field images have complex backgrounds because of the presence of nontarget trees and fruit in adjacent rows . An outdoor machine vision system was developed with a low cost Kinect V2 sensor to improve the accuracy of apple detection by filtering the background objects using depth features . A total of 800 set images were acquired in a commercial fruiting wall Scifresh apple orchard with dense foliage canopy . Images were collected in both daytime and nighttime with artificial light . The sensor was kept at 0.5m to the tree canopies . A depth threshold of 1.2m was used to remove background . Two Faster RCNN based architectures ZFNet and VGG16 were employed to detect the Original RGB and the Foreground RGB images . Results showed that the highest average precision

@highlight An RGB D sensor Kinect v2 was applied to filter background using depth features.
@highlight Apples in dense foliage fruiting wall tree were detected by ZFNet and VGG16.
@highlight The highest average precision of 0.893 achieved on depth filtered images with VGG16.
@highlight Using depth filter to remove background improved fruit detection accuracy by 2.5 .
