 To meet the high efficiency and low damage harvesting requirements for white asparagus two novel types of end effectors were designed to selectively harvest white asparagus . One is the transverse cut end effector while the other is the clip cut end effector . To select the best harvesting scheme and achieve a suitable range in driving forces we propose a discrete element method based model of the end effectors soil and white asparagus for the comparative analysis of a harvesting process using two end effectors . The biomechanical properties of white asparagus were measured to determine the constraints of non damaging harvesting after which we derived the theoretical driving forces of the two end effectors . Combined with an analysis of DEM simulation the driving forces of end effectors are quantitatively described in this paper . A test bench was built to carry out field harvesting tests . Finally after considering the comprehensive results of the simulations and field tests we determined TCEE to be the final harvesting component . The validated experiment showed that the relative errors between the field test and the simulation given the driving forces of penetration shearing and clamping were 6 11.9 and 18.2 respectively . This proves that the DEM model is capable of simulating the biomechanical properties of white asparagus and can be used to simulate the harvesting process . The optimum combination of driving force parameters for TCEE is penetration force 200N shearing force 4.2N and clamping force 11N . Under this scheme the harvesting process met the requirements for high efficiency and low damage which demonstrates the effectiveness of the white asparagus robotic harvester .
