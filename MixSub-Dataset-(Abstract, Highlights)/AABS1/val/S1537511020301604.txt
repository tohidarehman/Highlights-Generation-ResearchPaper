 Application of straw as bedding increases welfare of pigs but requires a slurry system that can handle slurry with a straw content . A new slurry system has been developed for slurry with straw content where U shaped slurry trays were scraped mechanically or flushed . The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the slurry system on the emission of ammonia and odorants in pig houses for growing finishing pigs . Experimental pig houses with two pens of 15 pigs each and with flooring that was 2 3 slatted and 1 3 solid were used . Ammonia was measured during the whole production period and odorants were measured over nine days in the middle of the period . The results showed that during the first 2 3 of the production period the ammonia emission from the pig houses with U shaped slurry trays with scraping or flushing was ca . 50 lower than that from the control pig houses . During the last 1 3 of the production period the effect on ammonia emission was less . The overall effect of U shaped slurry trays with scraping or flushing was ammonia reduction of ca . 3540 . The odour emission from pig houses with U shaped trays with scraping or flushing was ca . 40 lower than that for the control pig houses . In conclusion U shaped slurry trays with flushing or scraping can handle slurry with a high amount of straw and their use can reduce the emissions of ammonia and odour from pig houses .

@highlight Development of a slurry system to handle slurry with straw.
@highlight The system contained U shaped slurry pits that were either scraped or flushed.
@highlight The ammonia reduction was on average ca. 3540 .
@highlight The odour reduction was on average ca. 40 .
