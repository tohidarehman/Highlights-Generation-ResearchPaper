 Hyperspectral remote sensing data have great potential for plant classification monitoring and mapping due to their considerable spectral information . A spectral library can be used for the automatic interpretation of remote sensing data which is an efficient tool for the classification of plant species . Given that similar spectral signatures are usually found among different plant species it is critical to identify plant sensitive spectral features when constructing a robust plant spectral library . This study proposed an approach to the establishment and application of a plant spectral library based on spectral data from ground objects . It included a spectral feature screening method for plant spectral response and a feature robustness analysis method suitable for monitoring while unmanned aerial vehicle hyperspectral imaging data was used to validate mapping results . This study was divided into an urban scenario and an agricultural scenario based on plant composition and a set of spectral feature sensitivity methods based on Iterative Self Organizing Data Analysis and JeffriesMatusita distance was proposed . At the same time a robust spectral analysis method was developed based on illumination and noise disturbance . The performance of K nearest neighbour algorithm Random Forest and Support Vector Machine coupled with a Genetic Algorithm for plant classification modelling were compared . Results showed that the spectral indices obtained by sensitivity and robustness screening were effective for plant classification and the GA SVM model had the highest accuracy with overall accuracy 0.98 Kappa 0.98 in the urban scenario and OAA 0.97 Kappa 0.97 in the agricultural scenario . In addition pixel based crop classification validation based on UAV hyperspectral imaging also had high accuracy and the plot level classification results were in good agreement with field survey results . Therefore it is feasible to use a plant spectral library to assist in monitoring and mapping of plant species using hyperspectral remote sensing images at large scales . The effects of plant growth status growth stage and other changes on classification should be further studied .
