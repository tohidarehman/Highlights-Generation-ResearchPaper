 Design parameters of a pellet mill die for pellet production are essential for running optimal pellet production in terms of energy consumption and quality of the pellets . In this study the effects of the countersink angle and depth are investigated through experimental tests and Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations . Inlet die designs with angles 0

@highlight Visualisation and qualitative analysis of layer profiles of pellets.
@highlight New die design parameter AR used to correlate die performance.
@highlight CFD model used for simulation of feedstock flow in die designs.
@highlight Correlation between kurtosis of layer profiles AR and the pellet durability.
@highlight Lowest energy 60 countersink inlet highest pellet durability with AR of 0.6 0.8.
