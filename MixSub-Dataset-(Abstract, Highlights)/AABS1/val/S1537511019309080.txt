 Airflow patterns and turbulence characteristics inside a naturally ventilated screenhouse with tomato plants were experimentally investigated using 3D sonic anemometers simultaneously measuring air velocities at six horizontal positions in the space between the screened roof and the top of the canopy . The screenhouse had a flat roof and was ventilated through the roof only . Testing was carried out during about 3 weeks of crop development under variable external conditions . The mean horizontal air velocity component above the canopy was generally lower than 0.20 U

@highlight Flow characteristics above the canopy in an insect proof screenhouse were studied.
@highlight Mean horizontal airflow was generally in a direction opposite to external wind.
@highlight Inflow and outflow were on leeward and windward screenhouse sides respectively.
@highlight Velocity components RMS and TKE gradually increased until noon and then decreased.
@highlight Slopes of spectral energy density were about 5 3. At low wind speed slopes increased.
