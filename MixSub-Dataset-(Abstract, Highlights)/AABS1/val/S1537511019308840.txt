 Power transmission is a critical component of agricultural tractor designs and more demanding requirements have been placed on transmissions due to the complexities of their operational environments . However economic performance is usually sacrificed in favour of using high powered engines to satisfy the dynamic performance requirements related to power . In this study a new power cycle hydro mechanical continuously variable transmission device is proposed for use in agricultural tractors . The effects of various structural parameters on the system performance is analysed and an evaluation index for the performance of the PCHMCVT performance is proposed . A comprehensive examination of speed regulation performance economic performance and dynamic performance are performed . A multi objective optimisation design numerical model is established which utilises the NSGA multi objective genetic algorithm to optimise the transmission . Finally the feasibility of the optimisation results is verified by comparing and analysing the speed ratios torque ratios and efficiency characteristics of the transmission before and after optimisation . This study provides an optimised design method for the selection of the structural parameters of the PCHMCVT to ensure competent overall performance .
