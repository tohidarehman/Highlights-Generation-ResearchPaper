 The relationship between seed physical characteristics and seed quality is widely investigated by using X ray based imaging techniques . Recently the use of X ray micro tomography is increasingly used for more accurate characterisation of the internal seed morphology . In this work a germination test was carried out along with the morphometric characterisation of tomato seed internal structure by means of X ray micro CT and 3D image analysis . The aim was to accurately evaluate the predictive potential of internal seed 3D morphology for germination outcomes . The visual assessment allowed the relationship between specific internal seed abnormalities and the different germination outcomes to be demonstrated experimentally . Univariate analysis of morphometric seed traits allowed 3D free space and Sauter diameter among the most discriminant parameters to be identified as the most effective for the prediction of germination outcomes . Discriminant Analysis of 3D morphometric dataset correctly classified 96.3 of normal seedlings 83.3 of ungerminated seeds and 63.6 of abnormal seedlings providing a high overall prediction potential of 91.9 . The above analyses have also been performed referring to the germination at 5 days after sowing . As a side effect of the applied technique an increase of abnormal seedlings was observed at increasing X ray exposure level .

@highlight X ray microCT allows accurate investigation of tomato seed internal 3D morphology.
@highlight 3D free space is singularly the most effective parameter to predict germination outcomes.
@highlight Defects in whole embryo endosperm and cotyledons in order resulted the most critical.
@highlight LDA of 3D morphometric dataset correctly classifies germination outcomes of 91.9 seeds.
@highlight X ray exposure increases abnormal seedlings but not dead and ungerminated seeds.
