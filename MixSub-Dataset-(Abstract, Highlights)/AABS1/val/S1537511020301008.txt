 Kicking is a natural behaviour of horses but it can become problematic if stall components are hit and do not withstand the impact load . Injuries may occur due to material failure or hoof entrapment . In Germany while the Animal Protection Law is intended to prevent such incidents neither the law nor the corresponding interpretation aid indicates how this requirement should be fulfilled . This paper gives an overview of the methods of determining horse kick energy and presents results of own kick energy measurements . The outcome of a re evaluation of literature data is presented and two attempts to roughly estimate the expected kick load are introduced . The developed measuring device consists of a steel made framework mechanical energy sensors and an impact panel . Its verification was carried out by loading with impacts of defined energy applied by a pendulum impact machine . The measurement of kick energy was taken at a stud farm in the context of heat detection by observing the response of a mare to the presence of a stallion whereby the kicks of the stallion were measured . With regard to the kick resistance and entrapment safety calculation a representative value of 71J was calculated and using a safety factor of 1.5 this gives a design value of 106J . The presented results and the theoretical background of kick energy measurements described should in the future form the basis for the dimensioning of kick resistant and entrapment secure stall planks .
