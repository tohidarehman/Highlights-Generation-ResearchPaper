 Ammonia and carbon dioxide are the most relevant among the harmful gases present in broiler houses and their effects on animal health depend on concentration and exposure time . Inside these houses increasing ventilation is the most common strategy adopted to control the concentration of these gases . This strategy is effective but increases electrical energy consumption and thermal energy consumption .

@highlight A broiler house case study exceeded gas concentration limits for 60 of the time.
@highlight Increased ventilation to control gas concentration entails extra energy consumption.
@highlight Electrical energy consumption increases by 10 and thermal energy by 14 .
@highlight The extra cost for increasing the ventilation is estimated to be around 14 .
