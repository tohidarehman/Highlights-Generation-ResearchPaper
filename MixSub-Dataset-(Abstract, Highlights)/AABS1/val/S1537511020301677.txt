 High accuracy on line estimation for fruit internal quality is still a challenge due to varying geometric structures and orientations . In this study multiple full transmittance spectra were collected using short integration time mode for each apple . The signal to noise ratio of each collected spectrum changed with the measurement position of the fruit due to the heterogeneity of internal composition . To explore the distribution character of transmittance spectra across the apple structure to guide the development of an on line fruit quality determination system a methodology which we called zone combination modelling was proposed for selecting the most effective spectra for SSC prediction . The orientation of stemcalyx axis vertical was selected as the preferred orientation for quality prediction of Fuji apple based on the analysis of the variation and quality of full transmittance spectra . The most ineffective and most effective zone combinations for SSC prediction were determined by investigating the effect of transmittance spectra within different zone combinations on SSC prediction ability . Ten effective wavelengths selected from the most efficient zone combination were used to develop an optimal prediction model . Results showed that the contribution of different spectral measurement zones to SSC prediction capability varied and that in particular those collected from the apple core zone should be removed when building SSC prediction models . The coefficient of determination and root mean square errors of prediction and validation sets of SSC respectively were 0.733 and 0.61 0.721 and 0.71 for the optimal model indicating that zone combinations model was promising for SSC prediction of apple .
