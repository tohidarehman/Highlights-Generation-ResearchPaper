 Compaction induced soil degradation is of growing importance as field machinery continues to increase in power and mass . Approaches to managing the impacts of soil compaction include minimisation remediation and confinement . Integrated swarms of low mass autonomous machinery have recently been suggested as a means of reducing compaction and an alternative to controlled traffic . In this study combine and potato harvester machinery relationships were used to predict the specifications of potential low mass harvesters for use in soil compaction modelling . Results suggested that combine harvester gross vehicle mass must be less than 6Mg to keep the modelled soil bulk density below 1.4Mgm

@highlight Small autonomous machines have been proposed for reducing soil compaction.
@highlight Addressing soil compaction and productivity with small machines will be challenging.
@highlight Autonomous medium scale machinery operated in CTF would offer many benefits.
