 Tractor overturning is a leading cause of fatalities for farmers . In Japan small tractors are used for farming on harsh terrain such as slippery fields and steep passage slopes . On such potentially dangerous terrain steering instability induced by bouncing and sliding can cause tractor overturning accidents . Steering instability can also deteriorate the precision of trajectory tracking in autonomous driving tractors . The present study numerically investigated tractor steering instability due to bouncing and sliding . A bouncing model and bicycle model were coupled based on Coulomb s classical theory of friction and numerical experiments were conducted using the developed model . In the simulations the tractor s travel velocity the static friction coefficient the bump length and the turning radius were considered as control parameters . A turning test was conducted to investigate the basic steering performance of the developed model . The numerical results revealed that the bouncing and sliding caused by the disturbance exciter reduced the cornering force to zero which led to a deviation of the turning trajectory from the desired trajectory . The tractor was then operated on a steep passage slope similar to those reported in accidents in Japan . In the simulation bouncing and sliding occurred because of the steep slope . The results obtained in this study strongly suggest that bouncing and sliding occurring on specific terrain result in steering instability and are a major cause of overturning accidents .
