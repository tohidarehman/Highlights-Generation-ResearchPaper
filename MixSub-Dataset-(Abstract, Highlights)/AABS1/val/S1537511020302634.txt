 Slightly sprouted wheat kernels are difficult to distinguish with the naked eye and the mixing of sprouted kernels into sound wheat kernels will seriously reduce the quality of wheat products . This study explored the use of near infrared hyperspectral imaging technology to identify sound wheat kernels and slightly sprouted wheat kernels and obtained hyperspectral images on both sides of each wheat kernel . A variety of common spectral preprocessing methods and two characteristic extraction algorithms and successive projections algorithm were used to combine two traditional machine learning models and support vector machine and a special deep learning model to establish classification models . After analysis it was found that the modelling effect of using the reverse side spectral data was slightly better than the ventral side spectral data and the SavitzkyGolay smoothing CARS DF model was the optimal model combination . Finally combined with actual needs the modelling effect of the characteristic wavelengths extracted from the reverse side spectral data in the mixed spectral data sets containing different ratios of reverse side spectral data was analysed and the results were also satisfactory . The results showed that it was better to calibrate the model with the hyperspectral data on the reverse side of wheat kernels as this would be more helpful for identifying sound and slightly sprouted wheat kernels .
