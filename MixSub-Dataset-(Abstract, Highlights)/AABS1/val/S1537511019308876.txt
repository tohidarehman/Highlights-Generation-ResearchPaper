 Consumer and trade organisations demand year round healthy diets including fresh high quality vegetables from local producers . However greenhouse gas emissions of heating high tech greenhouses in northern countries are higher than transporting vegetables produced in southern Europe in unheated tunnels . The aim of this work was to assess GHG emissions when renewable energy sources were used for heating and cooling a solar collector greenhouse in comparison with a conventional greenhouse . Thermal energy generated in the SCG from solar energy was stored in an insulated water tank and different strategies were examined no reused energy reused energy reused energy and excess energy transfer . Based on the semi closed climate control strategy set in SCG and associated higher CO

@highlight Energy needs were evaluated in a solar collector greenhouse with hydroponic tomato.
@highlight GHG emissions were quantified when solar energy was reused for heating and cooling.
@highlight Reused energy covered 50 of heating needs and reduced GHG emissions by 53.6 .
@highlight Excess thermal energy treated as export energy led to negative CF of 0.7 CO

@highlight Use of RES in heated greenhouses can promote regional and sustainable production.
