 Designing tillage tools to promote only the necessary amount of soil fragmentation with minimum power input have great potential to reduce production costs concomitantly with environmental impacts . Thus it was developed a model using discrete element method of a bulk soil that accounts for the mechanical behaviour of soil aggregates and implemented an aggregate size classifier algorithm to quantify aggregate size distribution and the location of particle bond breaks promoted by tillage in different positions of the soil bin . Using this numerical approach simulations of tillage activities were carried out for two furrow openers for sugar cane planting a conventional one and a new tool concept with distinct soil fragmentation principle . The calibrated DEM model was able to reproduce the empirical measurements of soil friability and power demand of tillage . Through the model it was possible to quantify the level of soil structural fragmentation caused by tillage revealing specific details of aggregate breakage promoted by the evaluated tools . The new tool concept showed potential to decrease the power demand by 28.5 at the same time it increases the fractal fragmentation by 10 in comparison to the conventional tool . From these simulations it was estimated that the implementation of the new tool in the Brazilian sugarcane production may reduce fuel consumption by up to 16 .
