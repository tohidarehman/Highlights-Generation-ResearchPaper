 This research supports the cross modal correspondence between the shape of the bottle and consumers perception of sweetness and price using physical measures of beverage bottles . Images that add visual weight to the lower section of a package increase the perception of attributes associated with sweetness . In terms of price the shape of the bottle is informative about its volume which is the cue predictor of price . Through a within subject experiment we evaluated consumers perceptions of sweetness and price for a sample of 15 soft drink bottle silhouettes . These perceptions were correlated with the psychophysical characteristics of the silhouettes . Results reveal that sweetness has a negative correlation with height and the visual weight towards the bottom of the bottle . Instead the price has a positive correlation with the area width height lid and variance of the bottle shape . Practical implications support having a package design that is consistent with product positioning and attributes .

@highlight Soft drinks package shapes can communicate product characteristics like its taste and cost.
@highlight The perceived sweetness of a soft drink can increase by lowering the height of the shape and increasing the area in the lower portion of a bottle.
@highlight The perceived price of a soft drink can increase by expanding the observed area increasing the variance curves of the shape and having a higher lid.
