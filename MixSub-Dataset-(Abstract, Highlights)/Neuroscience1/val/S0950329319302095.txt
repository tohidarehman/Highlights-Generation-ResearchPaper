 Retailers aim to supply consumers exclusively with food products that are flawless and therefore impose strict standards that foods have to comply with before deemed qualified for retail . This practice results in large amounts of foods suitable for human consumption to be discarded due to deviation from these standards . In an effort to battle food waste retailers have begun to offer suboptimal food products on price promotion . However consumers reactions to price promotions are not uniform and depend on the significance individuals assign to these promotions based on their own price involvement . An online questionnaire administered to a total sample of 3 114 consumers divided across representative samples of Dutch German Swedish Norwegian and Danish consumers aimed to investigate the effect of five price involvement dimensions Perceived budget constraints and current use of suboptimal foods on consumers intention to purchase these products in the near future . Results indicate that consumers intention to purchase suboptimal foods is influenced by different price involvement dimensions within and across countries . These findings offer evidence that a more nuanced approach to price promotions can increase consumers intentions to purchase suboptimal foods and thus prove an efficient marketing tool that can be used to help reduce food waste . Retailers could benefit from applying price promotions that tap into the price involvement dimensions that increase consumers intentions to purchase suboptimal foods in contrast to the current practice of applying uniform price reductions .
