 In light of low and stagnating market shares of organic wine there is an ongoing debate about growth potential for organic wine . A recent study revealed that even consumers of organic food did not necessarily purchase organic wine regularly . The aim of this contribution was to analyse the wine preferences of organic food consumers and identify promising new target groups for organic wine . We conducted choice experiments in Germany and analysed the data with mixed logit models and latent class models revealing interesting differences between the results of the two approaches . While the mixed logit models suggested organic was the most important wine attribute the latent class models challenged this proposition . While three of four consumer segments had a strong preference for organic only one segment in the red wine model gave organic highest priority . Just like non organic consumers many organic food consumers seem to use price or country of origin as the most important quality cue for wine . The comparison between the results of the choice experiments and the participants stated normal purchase behaviour suggested there is growth potential for organic wine . Apparently consumers of organic food would buy more organic wine if their preferred type and variety of conventional wine would be available in organic quality at similar price levels .

@highlight Different segments have partly opposite preference structures for price and origin.
