 Environmental cues such as the colour of food and dishware have been shown to influence food and drink consumption in adult populations . This proof of concept study investigated whether plate colour could be utilised as a strategy to reduce intake of high energy density snacks and increase intake of low energy density snacks in pre school children . In a between and within subjects design children were randomly assigned to either a control group or intervention group and were provided a snack at nursery on three occasions on differently coloured plates for each snack type . Snack intake colour preference colour association and anthropometrics were recorded for each child . The results showed that there was no effect of group on HED and LED intake . No effect of plate colour on HED or LED snack intake was evident . Combining red and green plates for a chromatic versus achromatic comparison showed that there was no significant effect of chromatic plate on HED and LED intakes . Despite receiving a brief learning intervention the use of plate colour was found in the present study to be an ineffective strategy to control snack food intake in pre school aged children . Rather we suggest that food intake in young children may best be predicted by portion size energy density and eating behaviour traits .

@highlight Plate colour did not influence snack intake in this group of pre school children.
@highlight No significant effect of chromatic vs white plate colour on snack intake was found.
@highlight Colour association or preferences did not impact intakes from different coloured plates.
@highlight Pre schoolers may be too young or require repeated exposure for colour associated learning in the context of food consumption.
@highlight Portion size and eating traits are predictors of snack intake in 35yr olds.
