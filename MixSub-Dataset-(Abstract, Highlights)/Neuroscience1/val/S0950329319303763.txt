 Healthy eating strategies can be based on approach or avoidance . The current research examines whether weight status moderates the effectiveness of approach and avoidance strategies in goal pursuit . Across three studies using an ideal weight goal context I show that approach strategies motivate goal consistent behaviors among people with poor weight status by increasing the perceived attainability of the goal . Avoidance strategies are more motivating among people with good weight status because they decrease the perceived progress toward the goal which increases the perceived need for additional effort in the form of goal consistent behaviors to ensure timely attainment .
