 Pea protein isolates are promising ingredients to use when designing new plant based foods have interesting functional properties and can serve as alternatives to animal proteins . However their sensory properties must be considered if their use is to be optimized . Indeed pea proteins are often perceived as having a highly persistent bitter astringent or beany flavor which can strongly impact sensory assessments during sample evaluations . Here we proposed an explorative study for the use of an adapted sensory evaluation protocol that could be used by trained panelists to effectively evaluate pea protein based foods . In short we adapted a classical protocol we incorporated relative to reference evaluation and panelists assessed attributes in blocks rather than all at once . We conducted an experiment in which both classical and block protocols were used to evaluate pea protein solutions made with one set of isolates . Similar results were obtained with classical versus block protocol although panelist performance was better with block protocol . Sensitivity to bitterness was also investigated for this limited number of panelists and it was found that high and medium PROP tasters could better discriminate among pea protein solutions .

@highlight We developed a new sensory profiling protocol for evaluating pea protein based foods.
@highlight In this protocol food attributes are evaluated in blocks.
@highlight Block protocol led to better discrimination among pea protein solutions.
@highlight Low PROP tasters were less able to discriminate among pea protein solutions.
