 This review critically evaluates the literature documenting the impact of training on peoples perception of beer . In certain circumstances training has been shown to improve peoples ability to match and identify beers and to discriminate between beers and between the distinctive attributes of beer . However a reasonably consistent finding is that the benefits of beer training do not seem to generalise to novel beers . As such training would appear to improve the capacity to label perception and or peoples recognition memory for beers rather than necessarily influencing perception itself . Given how much beer is consumed annually it is surprising that there has not been more published research into the role that training plays in this particular beverage category . Part of the reason for this may relate to the limited role of experts in this field the fact that training is an expensive and time consuming process and it is wrongly assumed that the effects of training are similar across different beverage categories . We suggest that further efforts are therefore required before it will be possible to confidently conclude that training lowers the perceptual thresholds and enhances the perceptual discrimination abilities of beer experts above those of novices .

@highlight The influence of perceptual training on peoples abilities to identify and describe beer is reviewed.
@highlight The consequences of training on the multisensory flavour perception of beer are discussed.
@highlight There are consistent findings in relation to the influence of training on peoples use of descriptive terms.
@highlight The findings relating to perceptual abilities are inconsistent.
