 The understanding of what the consumer considers as craftsmanship is a sensitive question in the food sector . Despite food label regulations on this issue having undergone partial harmonisation revealing what the consumer perceives as a craft food is a feat that has yet to be achieved . Drawing upon a review of literature in the field of consumer research this investigation addresses this knowledge gap . In the light of the Alphabet Theory framework the review offers a systematic overview of the motives affecting individuals perception of food product craftsmanship as well as of the key factors affecting consumer behaviour towards craft foods . The findings provide useful insight to add to the body of extant literature and to discuss the possible directions of research . Moreover the results can also have relevant importance to support legislators in designing appropriate regulations on craft foods .
