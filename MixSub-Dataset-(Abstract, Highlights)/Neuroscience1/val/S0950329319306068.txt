 Food neophobia has been extensively explored especially in children . However very few studies have compared this food behavior in children from different countries . Considering the clear diversity between European countries in feeding practices and food consumption it is important to deepen the understanding of cross national differences in child FN . The aim of this study was to explore and compare FN in five European countries using a food neophobia scale specifically designed for children . Five hundred and twenty nine children aged 912years were recruited from schools in each country and were asked to complete the Italian Child Food Neophobia Scale which was translated into each respective language . Parents completed a food consumption frequency questionnaire for their child and provided background information . Reliability of the tool was assessed through internal consistency and temporal stability . Total internal consistency was 0.76 . When calculated by country internal consistency was satisfactory for all countries . FN was negatively associated to fruit and vegetable consumption liking of wholegrain biscuits and timing of introduction of semi solid food . There were small but significant cross national differences in FN with British and Swedish children being the most neophobic and significantly higher in FN than Finnish children who were the most neophilic . Results indicate that the tool can be successfully used in all the tested countries with children in the age range of 912years . The tool can be useful to measure the effects of interventions aiming at changing food behaviors such as reducing FN among children .

@highlight We compared food neophobia FN across Europe using a child friendly tool.
@highlight The ICFNS is a robust and efficient tool to measure FN in European young consumers.
@highlight The tool was able to detect cross national differences in FN.
@highlight FN is linked to lower consumption of fresh fruits vegetables seeds and nuts and wholegrain products.
@highlight The tool can be useful in interventions aiming to change FN related behaviors among children.
