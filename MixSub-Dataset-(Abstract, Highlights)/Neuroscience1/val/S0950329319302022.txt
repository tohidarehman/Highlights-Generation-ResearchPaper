 Including insect ingredients into familiar food products could be a step in enabling a higher acceptance of insects in Western countries . This study investigates the potential of bakery products containing black soldier fly larvae fat as an ingredient . Sensory and emotional profiling WTP liking and product preference were examined for cakes cookies and waffles by a total of 344 respondents . Each bakery product was formulated with 0 25 and 50 BSF LF as butter substitute . Results showed that BSF LF can replace 25 of butter in these bakery products without changing the overall food experience and liking . In waffles the substitution might even be up to 50 without influencing consumers acceptance . The attributes related to texture and color were hardly affected indicating that this insect fat provides a similar structure and functionality to bakery products as compared with butter . Future research should explore the use of refined BSF LF to reduce off flavors perceived in formulations containing a higher percentage of insect fat .
