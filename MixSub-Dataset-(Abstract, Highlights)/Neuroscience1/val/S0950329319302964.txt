Both gamifications and serious games can enhance childrens fruit and vegetable intake and promote healthy eating behaviour by improving their nutritional knowledge and attitudes . They may also encourage childrens food exploration to increase novel food acceptance and reduce picky eating behaviour . However playing snack promoting games significantly increases childrens subsequent snack intake and profound effects were found for unhealthy snacks . As game elements rewards were repeatedly used across studies to incentivise behaviour change . The combination of narrative context feedback progress and challenge was frequently used to motivate and engage children to establish healthy eating behaviour .
