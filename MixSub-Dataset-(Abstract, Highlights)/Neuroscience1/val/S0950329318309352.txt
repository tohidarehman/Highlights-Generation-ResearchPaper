 Product texture and mouthfeel contribute significantly to product appreciation . For medical nutrition products the textural properties also contribute to both swallowing efficiency and safety therefore impacting the nutrition and fluid intake of individuals in need of adapted textures . The need for an international terminology in a medical context has been expressed through several initiatives . The main reason was the inconsistency in mouthfeel terminology usage per country and care provider . A consistent terminology is important when selecting and preparing a safe and acceptable MNP . Current terminology is not specific to MNP making it challenging to develop optimal MNP and communicating about them . The objective of the current study was to develop a hierarchically structured mouthfeel terminology suited to MNP . This terminology was developed with expert sensory panelists describing the mouthfeel terminology of 32 products resulting in 9 umbrella terms and 51 individual attributes . To categorize the terminology appropriately and to make it accessible to a wide range of users Taxonomic Free Sorting was used to develop a hierarchical structure which is represented as a wheel . This structured terminology should assist sensory expert panels Health Care Professionals carers individuals in need of adapted textures chefs food technologists and sensory scientists in their interpretation and use of terminology related to mouthfeel of MNP . Ultimately the mouthfeel wheel was developed as a communication tool to support product improvement and selection of MNP by HCP with an optimized mouthfeel for individuals in need of adapted textures .
