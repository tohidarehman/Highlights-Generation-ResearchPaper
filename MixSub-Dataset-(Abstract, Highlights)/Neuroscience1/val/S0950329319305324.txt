 Lowering dietary intake of sodium is currently an important public health goal and a major driver of food product development . Reducing the salt content of food while maintaining the same structure and sensory quality is however no easy feat . While several strategies for reformulation exist the available literature indicates that their effectiveness is highly product dependent . The present research focused on different salt reduction strategies for potato chips drawing on two studies focusing on young consumers .
