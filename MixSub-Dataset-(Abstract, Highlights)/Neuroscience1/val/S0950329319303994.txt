 Several studies have investigated the associations between personality traits and consumer behavior but little attention has been paid to the role of personality traits in the acceptance of genetically modified food products or knowledge concerning the application of GM technologies . We used a large Norwegian survey to investigate the associations between personality traits knowledge about GM use in agriculture attitudes and willingness to pay to avoid GM foods . Using a random effect interval regression model we found premiums between 19 and 23 to avoid GM soybean oil GM fed salmon and GM salmon . Neuroticism was associated with increased acceptance of GM soybean oil . Conscientiousness was associated with increased acceptance of GM fed and GM salmon and agreeableness was associated with increased aversion against these products . Conscientiousness and agreeableness were also associated with knowledge . Agreeable respondents were less likely to think that genetic modification was applied in Norwegian agriculture and conscientious respondents were more likely to wrongly think so . Attitudes towards naturalness of foods were strongly correlated with increased WTP to avoid GM foods . Current policy restrictions concerning the use of GM technologies are likely to affect the perceived safety of GM foods . Information and more liberal regulations may change attitudes towards GM foods and reduce the resistance against GM technologies over time .
