 This study aimed to perform Temporal Dominance of Sensations by modality combined with a multi intake approach to investigate texture and flavor perception in semi solid products . Trained panelists evaluated fat free strawberry yogurts enriched with functional proteins involving texture modifications . As yogurt is a semi solid product its in mouth residence time is short . A multi intake approach was therefore expected to give more reliable information about the sensory properties perceived by panelists . The two modalities of texture and flavor were analyzed separately to characterize the effect of added proteins . Trials were made according to an experimental design with two factors and three levels each . Different statistical treatments taking or not the temporality of attributes into account were performed on standardized and non standardized data . The implementation of M TDS was essential to highlight differences of flavor perception in addition to the more evident texture modifications . The study of sensory trajectories evidenced that texture modifications induced by the use of different whey proteins slightly modified the perception of flavor and sweetness . The global flavor perception of the samples varied with the number of spoons which particularly impacted the taste attributes . This study highlighted the importance of using M TDS when studying texture and flavor in semi solid products and the relevance of the multi intake approach to characterize flavor perception . This methodology enabled panelists to evidence both marked texture differences and subtler flavor modifications and these useful data were emphasized by combining different statistical treatments .

@highlight MTDS combined with multi intake approach allows discrimination of semi solid products.
@highlight MTDS evidenced texture differences and highlight subtler flavor differences.
@highlight The multi intake approach had an impact on taste attributes.
@highlight Sensory trajectories and dominance duration gave complementary results.
@highlight The modification of the protein content led to an increased sweetness perception.
