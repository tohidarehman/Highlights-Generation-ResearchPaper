Our study found high income mothers were not influenced by food type but low income mothers were . Lower income mothers were more willing to purchase utilitarian foods than hedonic foods . High healthism mothers did not favor hedonic foods regardless of household income while low healthism high income mothers favored hedonic foods more than low healthism low income mothers . In contrast low healthism mothers did not favor utilitarian foods regardless of their household income while high healthism low income mothers favored utilitarian foods more than high healthism high income mothers . The results of our study may assist the government and marketers to understand how healthism and household income affect food choice behavioral intent .
