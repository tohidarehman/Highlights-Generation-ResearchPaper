 The Food Disgust Picture Scale is a newly developed picture tool that can be used to conduct cross cultural assessments of food disgust sensitivity . It consists of eight food related pictures which participants rate according to the level of disgust they evoke . Due to the undeniable influence of culture on what individuals consider as disgusting the FDPSs validity across different food cultures is an interesting topic for research . The aim of the present study was to conduct a cross national comparison of the FDPS in Switzerland and China . In total 576 participants were recruited in China and 538 were recruited in Switzerland . The usability and construct validity of the FDPS were compared between the two countries using confirmatory factor analyses . In the current study we present two main findings . First dropping one of the meat related items and thereby reducing the eight item FDPS to seven items improved the model fit in the Chinese and Swiss samples . Furthermore it showed that the scale is a valid tool for the assessment of food disgust sensitivity in China . Second using nested model comparisons the present study has provided support for the models invariance across the two countries .

@highlight The FDPS was compared cross nationally between Switzerland and China.
@highlight The FDPS is a valid tool to be used in Chinese samples.
@highlight Correlations between the FDPS and the FNS were similar in Switzerland and China.
