 The main objective of the present study was to determine the effect of the concentration range of sweetener on the accuracy of sweetness potency defined as the ratio of target sweetener and sucrose concentrations at equivalent sweetness intensity level measurement . Attempts were made to measure the sweetness potencies of two bulk sweeteners and three intense sweeteners using a sucrose sweetener combined method . Three sets of sample combination were evaluated in three independent descriptive analysis testing sessions . One set of sweetener samples had a sucrose equivalent concentration range of 215 wide range condition . The other two sample sets had narrower SEC ranges of 19 for the narrow range low concentration condition and 816 for the narrow range high concentration condition . All samples were evaluated by 10 trained panelists . Reference standards for sweetness intensities were provided during the testing sessions . Overall the predicted sweetness potency measured over the wide concentration range was less accurate than that measured over the narrower range . Additionally the results showed that the sweetness potencies were little affected by the concentration for bulk sweeteners while the sweetness potencies changed dramatically for intense sweeteners . The SSC method was previously proposed for reducing the contextual bias caused by a range frequency effect during sweetness intensity measurement . However the present study has revealed that this method is not completely free from psychological biases and that the accuracy of measuring sweetness potency can be affected by the concentration range over which the panelist is evaluating . Thus the concentration range of sample sets that are evaluated together should be determined carefully to ensure accurate measurement of sweetness .

@highlight Sweetness potencies of sweeteners at sucrose equivalent 1 16 were measured.
@highlight Sweetness potencies of intense sweeteners but not bulk sweeteners changed markedly.
@highlight Sweetness potency measured over a narrow range was more accurate than wider range.
