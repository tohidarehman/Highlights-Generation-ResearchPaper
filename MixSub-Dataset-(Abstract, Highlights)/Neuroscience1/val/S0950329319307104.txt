 In this paper we test whether the evaluation of food healthiness is affected by tactile surface qualities that are seen but not touched . Furthermore we explored if visually based tactile surface cues influence perception more or less depending on whether they are explicitly or implicitly presented . Participants were shown 3 implicitly and 3 explicitly textured biscuits that were identical apart from the surface texture . The surfaces were either smooth medium or rough and were rated on perceived healthiness . Additionally the biscuits were rated on tastiness likelihood of purchase crunchiness and chewiness aspects that can affect consumer choice outcomes . A pattern emerged whereby implicit surface textures affected perception more than explicit textured surfaces . Specifically perceived product healthiness was greater for medium textured implicit surfaces . Thus it seems that food healthiness is influenced by cross sensory cues . Implicitly rough textures were found to be perceived as crunchier . Determining food properties usually relies on exposing receptors within the mouth to the components of ingested food . However we demonstrate here that properties such as crunchiness also can be dependent on surface texture . The findings can be used to encourage consumers to purchase healthier food products .
