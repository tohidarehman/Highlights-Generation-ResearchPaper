 Cultural and genetic differences in consumer populations across the world are important determinants for food preferences . The present study investigated differences in preferred oral processing behaviors between Chinese Asian and Danish Caucasian consumers and the possible relationship to lingual tactile acuity and the two most well researched phenotypic markers of taste sensitivity such as 6 n propylthiouracil responsiveness and Fungiform Papillae Density .

@highlight Asian Chinese and Caucasian Danish populations differed in oral food processing behavior.
@highlight Asians were characterized by larger numbers of Soft processing likers.
@highlight Asians and Caucasians were equally sensitive to punctate lingual touch stimulation.
@highlight Asians had both greater responsiveness to PROP and Fungiform Papillae Density.
