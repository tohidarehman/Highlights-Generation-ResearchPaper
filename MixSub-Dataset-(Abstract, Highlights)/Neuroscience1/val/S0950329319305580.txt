 This paper examines how certain speech sounds within a brand name can alter expectations about the products taste . Across two studies we demonstrate that the presence of voiced vs. voiceless obstruents in a chocolates brand name can alter its expected taste as bitter vs. sweet . We propose this is because voiced obstruents are typically of low frequency contain harsh acoustic qualities and evoke negativity . In a third study we extend these findings to show using the Brand Personality Scale that the presence of voiced obstruents makes brand names sound more masculine rugged and tough and less honest charming glamorous wholesome cheerful and sentimental . Research linking consonant sound symbolism and product attributes is sparse . Most research in this field links vowels withproduct attributes sounds with shapes and music with taste attributes . We contribute by extending these findings to voicing and the sweet bitter continuum of the expected taste .
