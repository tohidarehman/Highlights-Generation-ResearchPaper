 Well structured stimuli presentation is essential in eye tracking research to test predefined hypotheses reliably and to conduct relevant gazing behavior studies . Several bottom up factors associated with stimuli presentation can influence gazing behavior . However only a small number of scientific papers address these factors in a sensory and consumer science context and thus provide guidance to practitioners . The two presented eye tracking studies on food images aimed at evaluating the effect of the bottom up factors

@highlight Product types affected the majority of the eye movement variables.
@highlight Orientation of stimuli influenced time to first fixation and first fixation duration.
@highlight Stimulus size influenced fixation and dwell count.
@highlight Decision time increased over 5 and 6 alternatives.
