 Many ambient variables appear to impact amount and duration of food intake as well as taste perception . Two studies were conducted to determine whether changing light intensity has an impact on meal duration and volume as well as sensory and qualitative aspects of tomato soup in an experimental setting . Using a randomized crossover design in study 1 66 participants were served tomato soup twice under dimmed and bright light . In study 2 159 participants were assigned to one of four randomization groups . A 22 design as a group setting was chosen adding a tablecloth as another ambient component . In both studies participants assessed the soups appearance sensory attributes and the overall taste quality and consistency on 100mm visual analog scales . Meal duration and amount were also assessed . In study 1 there were no significant differences in amount duration and sensory attributes between lighting conditions except for the saltiness of the soup which was perceived as saltier under the low light condition . In study 2 participants ate more longer and rated sensory attributes and quality higher when seated with tablecloth . The longest duration highest amount and quality were observed in the dimmed light condition with tablecloth . The tablecloth seemed to have a higher impact on food amount meal duration and overall taste perception than lighting condition . The results suggest that single ambience factors such as lighting might only play a role in food intake and perception in combination with other ambient factors such as decorative aspects .

@highlight The influence of lighting on soup intake and taste perception was examined.
@highlight Study 1 showed no differences in intake and taste in dim vs. bright light.
@highlight Participants in study 2 ate more and rated the soup as better in dim light with a tablecloth.
@highlight Ambient environmental factors can influence food intake and taste perception.
