 Nutritional warnings are rapidly gaining relevance particularly in the region of the Americas as a front of package nutrition labelling scheme that facilitate the identification of products with high content of nutrients associated with non communicable diseases . Several graphic designs are being developed as countries discuss the implementation of nutritional warnings which makes it necessary to develop research to evaluate their efficacy . In this context the aim of the present work was to compare the efficacy of a series of nutritional warnings that are being considered by Brazilian national authorities for the country with two of the most studied schemes the guidelines daily amounts and the traffic light system . Two studies were conducted . In the first one visual search was conducted with 62 participants to evaluate the time needed by them to identify the schemes on food labels and to identify whether a product had high nutrient content . In the second study an online survey with 1932 participants was used to evaluate their ability to use FOP nutrition labelling schemes to correctly identify the most healthful product in a set as well as high nutrient content in a product . In addition the influence of FOP nutrition labelling schemes on perceived healthfulness was evaluated . Finally consumers perception of the schemes was gathered using an open ended question . Results confirmed the advantages of nutritional warnings compared to the GDA and the traffic light system to facilitate the identification of products with high content of nutrients associated with NCDs . In addition the use of familiar signs frequently used to convey a warning message outperformed other unfamiliar signs in terms of their ability to facilitate the interpretation of nutrition information . Regarding colour black signs tended to required significantly less time to be detected when included on colour food labels compared to red signs .

@highlight Warning signs were compared with the GDA and traffic light systems.
@highlight GDA showed the worst performance in terms of interpretation of nutritional information.
@highlight Warnings were the most effective at facilitating the identification of high nutrient content.
@highlight The use of familiar warning signs improved the efficacy of nutritional warnings.
