 Many people struggle with the classical choice of eating a mouth watering snack versus a healthier product . One of the reasons behind this is that unhealthier products are appealing for their direct gratification they deliver pleasure . The present research investigates the effect of mental simulation as a relatively new strategy to possibly shift the balance between direct gratification and the consideration of longer term benefits necessary to make healthier choices . Specifically we distinguish between imagining the consumption process versus the outcome of eating a specific product hereafter referred to as mental simulations . In two studies we show that participants under process simulation i.e . imagining the process of eating had a higher desire for the imagined product compared to a control condition but in a choice task between a healthy and an unhealthier product more people chose the

@highlight Mental simulation is explored as a strategy to modify desire for food and choice.
@highlight Process simulation increases desire for the imagined food and leads to unhealthy choice.
@highlight Outcome simulation increases desire for the imagined food and leads to healthy choice.
@highlight Valence of the imagined experience is a mechanism of desire for the imagined food.
@highlight Imagining a food consumption event versus a post consumption event matters.
