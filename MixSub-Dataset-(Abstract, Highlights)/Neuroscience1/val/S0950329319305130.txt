 While the demand for non alcoholic beer has increased consumers often complain about its inferior sensory characteristics . As expectations mediate the effect of extrinsic product cues on sensory perception we could utilise these cues to improve consumers experience of such products . The current study comprising four repeated measures experiments investigated the role of extrinsic cues in generating sensory and hedonic expectations of beer . A hundred and sixty six beer drinkers viewed realistic beer labels which varied in their colour design labelled alcohol content and sensory descriptor in response to which they rated their expectations of bitterness smoothness sweetness refreshment beer colour body and liking . In summary across these four experiments label colour labelled alcohol content and sensory descriptor all had significant and replicable effects on consumer expectations . However the size of these effects depended on how explicit or implicit the information of a cue was relative to the presence and specificity of other cues on the label . For example red and brown labels increased expected bitterness 16.58

@highlight Label colour sensory descriptor and alcohol content alter sensory expectations.
@highlight Labelled alcohol content did not affect expected liking.
@highlight Implicit cues are less effective than explicit cues in eliciting specific expectation.
