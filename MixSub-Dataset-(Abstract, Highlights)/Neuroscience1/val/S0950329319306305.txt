 To understand consumers acceptance and preference in relation to Nutrition and Health Claims on food products and the reasons for their acceptance in an Eastern European country with a weak tradition in NHC and an enormous increase in the number of foods with NHCs in recent years this study aimed to fill a research gap by applying a multi methodological approach combining a survey and conjoint analysis and a focus group . The survey demonstrated that Slovenian consumers in general are moderately doubtful of NHCs . Conjoint analysis showed that when Slovenians choose their breakfast cereals NHCs are more important than whether visual images are present . Visual images convince only the youngest consumers . The study revealed the importance of social perception and trust in the social system for accepting foods with NHCs images . Consumers who did not trust the political and economic system also did not accept foods with NHCs images .
