 Packaging plays an important role on attracting the consumers attention and creating hedonic and sensory expectations which may affect actual product experience . The present study aimed at investigating whether the colour and or shape of design elements of packaging labels would influence sensory and hedonic judgments of specialty coffee by amateur consumers . Participants first evaluated their expectations of coffee acidity and sweetness by looking at the coffee package and subsequently their experience of the same attributes when tasting a cup of coffee in addition to rating their liking and purchase intent . The experiment followed a 22 between subject design for label type and the same coffee was served to all participants . Multivariate analysis of variance was conducted in order to assess main effects of colour and shape of the design elements of the packaging labels as well as interactions on sensory and hedonic ratings . Both colour and shape significantly affected consumers sensory expectations regarding the specialty coffee but they had no significant effect on post tasting sensory ratings . Interactions between colourshape were found to affect the hedonic measures . The coffee associated with the congruent labels received higher liking and purchase intent ratings than the one associated with the incongruent labels . The implications of these results for the design of coffee packaging that convey some functional benefit as well as possible directions for future research are discussed .

@highlight The effect of label design colour shape on specialty coffee attributes was assessed.
@highlight Pre tasting ratings of sweetness and acidity are affected by label design.
@highlight Label design influences hedonic judgements in congruent and incongruent pairings.
@highlight It is important to consider labelling that conveys sensory or hedonic benefits.
