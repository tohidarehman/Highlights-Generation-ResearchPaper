 With the use of virtual reality this study investigates the potential for popularity cues to stimulate consumers to choose healthier products within product categories in a supermarket context . Popularity may increase perceived product quality and perceived certainty about that quality . Healthier alternatives within a category often have a taste disadvantage compared to regular counterparts as a result of their trimmed down nutrient profiles . Because consumers are more uncertain about the taste of these light products a popularity cue may have a larger effect on product choice for these options than on the choice for regular products . This hypothesis is tested in an experiment using virtual reality to realistically display a supermarket context . In the main experiment a sample of 300 consumers was asked to shop for specific groceries using existing brands and products . The results demonstrate that consumers are more likely to choose light products when these are combined with a popularity cue . In contrast the popularity cue did not affect choice for the regular alternatives . These results have important implications for research and for public policy makers and food retailers that aim to stimulate healthful consumption .
