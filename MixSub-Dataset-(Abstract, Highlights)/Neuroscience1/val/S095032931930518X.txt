 Aromatic characterization is a key element of enhancing ones knowledge of wine . While several studies have investigated the importance of wine expertise in the ability to perform odor related sensory tasks little attention has been paid to the influence of expertise on the semantic categorization of wine odors . To bridge this gap this study aimed to explore the influence of a subjects expertise on the semantic representation of wine odors by means of a free sorting task . For this purpose 156 subjects were recruited . Their level of expertise was measured using a questionnaire and the data analysis revealed four clusters of subjects with a gradual level of expertise . Subjects also performed a sorting task on 96 odor terms . From the number and the size of odor groups formed as well as the additive tree representation and the consensus partition between the terms for each expertise level we observed that all subjects regardless of their experience had largely the same semantic categorization of wine odor attributes which was mainly shaped by the sources of the odorants . It appeared that level of wine expertise played a minor role in creating the semantic representation of wine odors affecting mainly the knowledge of specialized terms .

@highlight Ninety six terms of odors used in wine characterization were selected from the literature.
@highlight A free sorting task was conducted with 156 subjects on the 96 terms.
@highlight Each subjects expertise was analyzed using a questionnaire.
@highlight Subjects were clustered by expertise and their sorting patterns were compared using consensus partitions and additive trees.
