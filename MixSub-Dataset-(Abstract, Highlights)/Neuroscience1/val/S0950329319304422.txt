 The aim of the present study was to determine the implicit and explicit responses of consumers when evaluating two apple ciders of the same brand being one of the samples a protected designation of origin product . Samples were tested in blind conditions to determine if liking was different and was driven by the sensory properties . Then brand images were also evaluated by consumers . Finally the products were tested providing consumers with information about the specific cider that they were testing showing the brand images during the test . The first phase of the study was designed to determine the implicit reaction of 52 consumers recorded using biosensors capable of measuring skin conductance variations . For this phase approximately 50 of consumers were familiar with the PDO logo while the other 50 was not aware of the logo significance and was clarified before the test . During the second phase of the study the response of the consumers who were related with the logo significance was further investigated . A total of 65 consumers who were familiar with the PDO significance were recruited and the same samples than in phase I were assessed . Liking as well as emotions using the EsSense25 lexicon were documented . Significant differences were detected in arousal and also in impact between consumers groups . On the contrary when studying the explicit response liking and emotions were not significantly different for both cider samples . Implicit reaction might have indicated additional information which was lost when a rationalized response was provided .

@highlight Both implicit and explicit measures were needed to understand consumers response.
@highlight The extrinsic properties were the drivers of the consumers response.
@highlight PDO logo familiarity was related with a low emotional activation.
