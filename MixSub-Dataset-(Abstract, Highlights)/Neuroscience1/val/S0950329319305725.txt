 Product names can be developed to effectively convey specific sensory attributes to the consumer . Most of the previous research on crossmodal correspondences has shown that people selectively associate words with taste attributes . To provide practical insights for naming new products in the food industry it is important to obtain a more nuanced understanding concerning those properties of speech sounds influencing peoples taste expectations . In this study we investigated taste speech sound correspondences by systematically manipulating the vowels and consonants comprising fictitious brand names . Based on the literature on crossmodal correspondences and sound symbolism we investigated which vowels consonants contribute more to the association between speech sounds and tastes . Across three experiments we systematically varied vowels back and affricate consonants stop as well as voiced voiceless consonants voiceless . Japanese participants were presented with brand names and had to evaluate the taste that they expected the product to have . The results revealed that front vowels increased expected sweetness fricative consonants increased expected sweetness voiceless consonants increased expected sweetness sourness . Moreover consonants which were pronounced first in the brand names exerted a greater influence on expected taste than did the vowels . Taken together these findings help advance theoretical foundations in sound taste correspondences research as well as provide practical contributions to the food practitioners to develop predictive product names .

@highlight Crossmodal associations between speech sounds and tastes were studied.
@highlight Front back vowels increased expected sweetness bitterness .
@highlight Fricative stop consonants increased expected sweetness saltiness bitterness .
@highlight Voiceless voiced consonants increased expected sweetness sourness saltiness bitterness .
@highlight Consonants had a greater influence on taste expectations than did vowels.
