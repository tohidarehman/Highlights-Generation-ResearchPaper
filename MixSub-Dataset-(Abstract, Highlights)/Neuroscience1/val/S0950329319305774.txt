 Previous research has consistently demonstrated that organic food is typically seen as healthier . The aim of the present study is to investigate how these health inferences influence taste perceptions of organic food . In Study 1 we show that a neutral food product with an organic label is perceived as more healthy than the same product without such a label . This higher level of perceived healthiness is paired with an improved perceived taste . In Study 2 and 3 we obtain evidence in Dutch and US samples that an organic label increases perceived taste and attractiveness of healthy food . Whereas previous studies have shown general health halo effects of organic labels this perspective can not explain the specific pattern of our results which speaks towards an organic healthy tasty intuition .
