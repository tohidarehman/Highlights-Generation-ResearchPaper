 The performance of the recently developed rapid sensory descriptive method Pivot Profile was assessed with a set of 17 Shiraz Syrah red wines using a group of 49 sommeliers and 11 winemakers . The PP results were compared to results from descriptive analysis performed by a trained panel . The PP from the two groups of experts gave similar sample configurations although the terms used differed with one notable difference being less detailed information on wine colour provided by the sommeliers . The data showed that the PP results from the two panels were also closely equivalent to that obtained from descriptive analysis with similar sample space configurations relatively high RV coefficient values and comparable attributes discriminating the samples . PP allowed interpretation of complex terms used by the two groups of experts and gave insight into the major sensory differences discriminating the wines . DA provided better information regarding attributes that differed more subtly among the sample set including bitterness . This study demonstrated for the first time that PP and DA provide similar insights into the sensory properties of products and confirmed that PP with expert panellists allows a rapid understanding of the main sensory differences among samples with some advantages over DA in obtaining a more holistic overview of each sample .

@highlight Pivot Profile results remain stable when using judges with different backgrounds.
@highlight Pivot Profile gives similar but less detailed results than Descriptive Analysis.
@highlight The Pivot Profile sensory characterization method is efficient and reliable.
