 Sensory and consumer research often focuses more on bottom up than top down influences on consumers perception and acceptance of foods . Yet cognitive processes create and transform incoming sensory information originating from separate senses including olfaction gustation and somatosensation into the perception of flavour . The present paper discusses five cognitive processes that affect human chemosensory perception and responses to food flavours Attention language memory learning and metacognition . It is argued that each of these processes are important in shaping interactions with food via the chemical senses . Attention moderates perception through its distribution across the environment fine tuning it for particular stimuli . Interactions among smells tastes and textures are acquired through learning as are hedonic properties . Language affects food acceptability and preference as does the memory of prior experiences with a food even when they are not at a conscious level of processing . Metacognitive knowledge of personal capabilities indirectly influences the results of sensory evaluations . Future sensory and consumer research should take into account the significant role that these cognitive factors play in processing incoming chemosensory information .

@highlight Attentional resources moderate the stimuli that are perceived in the environment.
@highlight Learning underlies the associations among stimuli necessary for flavor.
@highlight Both memory and language affect food acceptability and preference.
@highlight Metacognition influences research through the inclusion of dysosmic participants.
@highlight Future work should consider cognitive processes that transform flavor information.
