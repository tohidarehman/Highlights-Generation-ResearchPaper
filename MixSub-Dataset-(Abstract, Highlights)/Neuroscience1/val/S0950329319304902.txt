 People with an increased motivation for rewarding substances show increased automatic selective attention towards cues that are related to that specific substance . The aim of this study was to explore if overweight and hungry children have an attentional bias for food cues in food advertising . A randomized between subject design was used with 95 children who played an advergame that promoted either energy dense snacks or non food products . Overweight children had a higher gaze duration for the food cues compared to normal weight children . No effects were found of overweight on the attentional bias measurements for the non food cues . Furthermore hungrier children had a higher gaze duration a higher number of fixations and a faster latency of initial fixation on the food cues than less hungry children while we found the opposite results for the non food cues . The findings largely confirm our expectations adding important knowledge about individual susceptibility to food advertisements . Overweight and hungrier children seem to be stronger affected by food advertising than normal weight and less hungry children . This study is the first that examined attentional bias in a food advertisement that is highly comparable to advertisements that are used by food companies thereby increasing the external validity of the findings . The second strength is that the development of an attentional bias for food cues is developing at a young age and it was examined in a real life situation .
