 Food scientists and technologists are interested in how sensitive judges and consumers are to changes in product formulations . Numerous approaches to measuring sensitivity have developed at a rapid rate in the last 25years however the evaluation and assessment of sensory tasks is still ongoing . The current study compared the efficiency of four difference tests across three concentrations of orange essence . To determine which of the four tasks had the lowest variance in

@highlight Compared variation in replicated performance across four difference tests.
@highlight Employed A Not A 2 AFC and their reminder versions A Not AR and 2 AFCR .
@highlight A Not A had higher variability than the other tasks.
@highlight 2 AFC and 2 AFCR had lower performance that the other tasks.
@highlight 2 AFC and 2 AFCR had the lowest variation in replicated performance.
