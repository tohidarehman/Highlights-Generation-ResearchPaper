 Food technologies provide numerous benefits to society and are extensively vetted for safety . However many technological innovations still face high levels of skepticism from consumers . To promote development and use of food technologies it is critical to understand the psychological and neurobiological processes associated with consumer acceptability concerns . The current study uses a neuroscience based approach to understand consumer attitudes and perceptions of risk associated with food technologies and investigate how such attitudes impact consumers processing of information related to food technologies . We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activation while participants processed infographics related to food technology topics . For technology topics perceived as riskier activation was higher in areas of the lateral prefrontal cortex that are associated with decisional uncertainty . In contrast technology topics that were viewed more favorably tended to activate the ventromedial prefrontal cortex a region that processes positive affect and subjective value . Moreover for information about hormones the lateral PFC activation was associated with individual differences in resistance to change in risk perception . These results reveal how attitudes and risk perception relate to how the brain processes information about food technologies and how people respond to information about such technologies .

@highlight People view foods made with technologies as riskier and less positive.
@highlight Lateral prefrontal cortex tracks perceptions of risk for food technology topics.
@highlight Medial prefrontal cortex tracks positive attitudes for food technology topics.
@highlight Brain activation predicts risk perception and attitude change for hormones and GMOs.
