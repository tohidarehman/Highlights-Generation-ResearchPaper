 Coffee is one of the worlds most popular beverages with an estimated four hundred billion cups being consumed each and every year . In this review we investigate just what effect the multisensory atmosphere context has on peoples perception of not to mention their choices concerning coffee . We demonstrate how many different aspects of the environment influence peoples choice of what beverage to drink as well as what they think about the experience . Specifically the visual auditory olfactory and tactile aspects of the environment have all been shown to impact the experience of tasting and drinking coffee . This extensive body of empirical research complements the emerging findings demonstrating the influence of the receptacle in which coffee is consumed . Looking to the future and acknowledging the profound influence of multisensory atmospherics on the experience of beverages it would seem likely that there will be growing interest in optimizing and or personalizing the environment for the kind of multisensory tasting experience that the coffee consumer wishes to have .
