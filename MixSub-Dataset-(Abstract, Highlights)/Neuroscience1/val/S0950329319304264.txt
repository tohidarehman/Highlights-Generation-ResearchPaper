 Front of package labels are recommended to reduce consumer intake of ultra processed food products . The multiple traffic light label is one example of FOPL that indicates the content of target nutrients in products by displaying red amber and or green color coding . The red code may implicitly enhance sweetness perception and approach dispositions toward sweet UPP via cross modal visual taste interactions . We conducted two experiments to examine the possibility of contradictory influence of explicitly learned and implicit cross modal associations on the emotional responses evoked by UPP pictures . In both experiments we first explicitly associated the color codes with health related meanings . In Experiment I a psychometric tool estimated the emotional responses evoked by UPP pictures when preceded by red amber or green color codes . In Experiment II we recorded participants electrocortical brain activity to assess the early posterior negativity component as an index of the emotional responses to UPP . The reported pleasantness and the EPN amplitude were greater for sweet UPP relative to salty UPP when primed with red codes but not when primed with green or amber . A red code increased positive emotions toward sweet UPP despite its explicit association with increased health risks . Thus the use of multiple traffic lights might lead to an unintended implicit approach behavior toward sweet UPP . Designers researchers and policy makers may consider color taste cross modal associations when designing testing and applying FOPL .

@highlight A red prime increased pleasantness ratings for sweet ultra processed foods UPP .
@highlight A red prime increased brains motivational processing toward sweet UPP.
@highlight Visual taste cross modal associations may trigger approach dispositions toward UPP.
@highlight Efficacy of red coded front of pack labels might be lower than expected.
