 Research has made steps towards the understanding of the main drivers and barriers related to Western consumers acceptance of food with ingredients derived from insects . Nevertheless research has been hampered by the absence of a comprehensive specific and validated instrument for measuring consumer attitudes towards entomophagy . The current study presents a new self report instrument for addressing this issue . The instrument was built upon three conceptual cores which are reflected in the three factors emerged and tested through factor analyses performed on a representative sample of the Danish population and a convenience Italian sample . The first factor represents the negative evaluation of direct entomophagy and is closely connected to disgust . The second factor represents the positive evaluation of direct entomophagy and is closely linked to individuals interest to try novel experiences and to eat novel foods . The third factor addresses indirect entomophagy that is the attitude towards using insects for feeding other animals that are reared for human consumption . Compared to existing measures of disgust and neophobia the new instrument performs better in predicting intention in relation to both direct and indirect entomophagy .

@highlight A new measure of attitudes toward entomophagy has been presented.
@highlight The new self report instrument has been validated on a representative Danish sample.
@highlight The three factor structure of the instrument shows an excellent fit to the data.
@highlight A cross validation on an Italian convenience sample fully supports the model.
@highlight The new scale predicts intention to eat insects better than existing measures.
