 The free sorting task is increasingly popular as a rapid sensory method to give a global picture of the similarities among samples . Sorting does not require training analysts allows for the easy simultaneous presentation of up to 20 samples and provides stable results with 2530 subjects . However wide use of free sorting is hindered by the current analyses for free sortingfor example DISTATIS and Correspondence Analysiswhich require statistical expertise to conduct and interpret . In this paper a novel alternative analysis is proposed called Sorting Backbone Analysis which is based on tools from network analysis . The similarity data produced from free sorting can represent a weighted network and so a set of network analysis tools can be used to identify groups of products which are significantly similar and to visualize these results clearly and powerfully . SBA is simple and can be implemented with open source software provides interpretations that agree with current methods and produces clear powerful visualizations called graphs which may offer new interpretable insights to sensory scientists . This paper describes the mathematical and statistical background for SBA and applies SBA to four previously published sorting datasets with comparisons to DISTATIS . In each case SBA produces visual results that highlight all of the same features as the standard approach while being easier to interpret and in many cases produces new insights . Therefore SBA specifically and network analysis in general are suggested as new approaches for use in the analysis of sensory similarity data as produced through free sorting and related methods .

@highlight Sorting Backbone Analysis SBA is a new method for free sorting task data.
@highlight SBA applies theories and methods from network analysis to sorting data.
@highlight Because networks are non spatial metric SBA improves interpretation and visualization.
@highlight Six existing datasets are analyzed by SBA and results are compared to DISTATIS.
@highlight Overall SBA behaves comparably to DISTATIS with improved clarity and ease of use.
