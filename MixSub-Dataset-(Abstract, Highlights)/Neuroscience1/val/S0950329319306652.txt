 It has been demonstrated previously that the surface textures of product packaging and servingware can impact the perceived taste and mouthfeel of various different foods and beverages . The present study was designed to investigate whether coffee cups with different surface textures would influence the judgment of taste and mouthfeel attributes in specialty coffee by experts and amateur consumers alike . A total of 231 participants were tested in one of the three studies . A preliminary test conducted at a specialty coffee event in Russia indicated that rubbing a swatch of sandpaper whilst drinking coffee influenced perceived body and aftertaste qualities . In the two main studies the participants evaluated a sample of specialty coffee served in either a smooth or a rough ceramic cup . The coffee was rated by the Q graders as tasting significantly more acidic when sampled from the rough cup as opposed to the smooth whereas the amateurs perceived the coffee as being significantly sweeter when tasted from the smooth cup rather than from the rough cup instead . Both Q graders and amateurs judged the aftertaste as significantly dryer when tasted from the rough rather than from the smooth cup . The perception of body was not significantly affected in any of the experiments . These results demonstrate that haptic cues influence the judgment of basic tastes as well as mouthfeel attributes in specialty coffee for both experts and amateur consumers . Such results should be considered by the industry when designing innovative coatings for coffee cups . In addition to innovation though it is important to create cups that convey some functional and or perceptual benefit for the coffee drinking experience .

@highlight The effect of cup surface texture on specialty coffee flavour attributes was assessed.
@highlight Experts and amateurs rated the same coffee from rough or smooth surface cups.
@highlight Ratings of sweetness acidity and aftertaste were affected by cup texture.
@highlight It is important to consider designing receptacles to optimize the drinking experience.
