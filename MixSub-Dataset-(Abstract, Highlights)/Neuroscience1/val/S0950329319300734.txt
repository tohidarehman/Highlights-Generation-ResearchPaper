 This study examines the moderating effects of perceived communication satisfaction and trust on the intention behaviour gap and the perceived behavioural control behaviour gap in the theory of planned behaviour model using a quantitative research method . A nationwide panel only online survey was conducted resulting in 1011 usable responses from organic food consumers in Australia . Data were analysed statistically using SPSS v.25 and SmartPLS 3 software and the hypotheses were tested using the partial least squares based structural equation modelling technique . The findings confirm that perceived communication satisfaction and trust positively and significantly enhance purchase behaviour and lessen gaps in the intention behaviour and PBC behaviour relationships in the TPB model . This study also validates the TPB model and finds statistically significant results in support of all of its 14 hypotheses . It is the first such study to examine the intervention efficacy or moderating effects of perceived communication satisfaction and trust on the intention behaviour and PBC behaviour gaps in the TPB model . Examining the mediational effect of behavioural intention in the TPB model and including the Australian context are among its other contributions . Organic food producers and marketers aiming for sustained positive changes in consumer behaviour are encouraged to consider the findings and implications of this study .

@highlight The intention behaviour and PBC behaviour gaps of the TBP model were addressed.
@highlight As moderators communication satisfaction and trust increased reported behaviour.
@highlight Behavioural intention was a significant mediator in the TPB model.
