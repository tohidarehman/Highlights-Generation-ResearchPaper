 The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 is known to induce neuroprotective and anti inflammatory effects and is considered to be an excellent molecular target for drugs related to neurodegenerative disease therapy . Nrf2 activators previously tested in clinical trials were electrophilic causing adverse effects due to non selective and covalent modification of cellular thiols . In order to circumvent this issue we constructed and screened a chemical library consisting of 241 pyrazolo 3 4

@highlight KKC080106 was selected from a pyrazolo 3 4 
@highlight  pyrimidine library we constructed.
@highlight It binds to Keap1 activates Nrf2 and elevates Nrf2 target gene expression.
@highlight It suppresses the inflammatory signaling and production of the inflammatory markers.
@highlight It prevents MPTP induced neurodegeneration microglial activation and motor deficits.
@highlight It exhibits good safety and pharmacokinetic profiles as a CNS drug.
