 The processes involved in neurodevelopment and aging have not yet been fully discovered . This is especially challenging in premorbid or borderline situations of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s or glaucoma . The retina as part of the central nervous system can be considered the easiest and most accessible neural structure that can be analyzed using non invasive methods . Animal studies of neuroretinal tissue in situations of health and under controlled conditions allow the earliest sex and aging induced changes to be analyzed so as to differentiate them from the first signs occurring in manifested disease . This study evaluates differences by age and sex based on intraocular pressure and neuroretinal function and structure in healthy young and adult rats before decline due to senescence . For this purpose eighty five healthy LongEvans rats were analyzed in this 6 month longitudinal study running from childhood to adulthood . IOP was measured by tonometer neuroretinal function was recorded by flash scotopic and light adapted photopic negative response electroretinography at 4 16 and 28 weeks of age and structure was evaluated by

@highlight Studies in healthy animals are essential to differentiate from premorbid situations.
@highlight This study first demonstrates sex and age related influence in healthy rat retina.
@highlight Different patterns of neuronal development and degeneration by sex.
@highlight Neuroretinal degeneration by sex is detected from adulthood in Long Evans rat.
@highlight Male show early neurodegeneration so estrogens might have retinal protective role.
