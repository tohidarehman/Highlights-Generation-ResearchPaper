 Past history of stroke has been associated with an increased risk of a new ischemic stroke . Several studies have indicated increased prevalence of strokes among coronavirus patients . However the role of past history of stroke in COVID19 patients is still unclear . The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate and summarize the level of evidence on past history of stroke in COVID19 patients . A systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines was performed in PubMed Embase EBSCO Host Scopus Science Direct Medline and LILACS . Eligibility criteria We evaluated studies including patients with diagnosis of COVID 19 and a past history of stroke . Risk of bias was evaluated with the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and experimental studies were evaluated using the ROBINS I scale . Seven articles out of the total 213 articles were evaluated and included involving 3244 patients with SARS VOC 2 Disease of which 198 had a history of cerebrovascular disease . Meta analysis of the data was performed observing an increase in mortality in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease compared to those with different comorbidities or those without underlying pathology p 0.007 I The history of cerebrovascular disease was associated with a 2.78 fold increased risk of mortality compared to patients with other comorbidities or without underlying pathologies .

@highlight Cerebrovascular disease as a risk factor for COVID 19 mortality.
@highlight Future studies will allow the development of risk scales in patients with COD19 and a history of stroke.
@highlight More clinical trials are need to explore the effect of history of stroke and COVID19.
