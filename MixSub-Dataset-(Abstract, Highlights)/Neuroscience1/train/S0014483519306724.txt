 Quantitative analysis of aqueous humor was performed to investigate glucose metabolism in patients with central retinal vein occlusion and to explore metabolic changes after anti vascular endothelial growth factor treatment . AH samples were collected from 35 patients . Participants diagnosed with CRVO were compared to participants who underwent cataract surgery . Thirteen of the participants with CRVO received second round anti VEGF treatments . Ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify metabolites of the AH . Central macular thickness and retinal ganglion cell layer thickness were measured using spectral domain optical coherence tomography . Thirteen metabolites involved in glucose metabolism were identified . Among these metabolites succinate glutamate and glutamine were significantly decreased for the CRVO group . The

@highlight Succinate glutamate and glutamine were significantly low in patients with CRVO.
@highlight The ketoglutarate citrate ratio was positively correlation with glutamine levels.
@highlight Lactate levels increased significantly after intravitreal anti VEGF administration.
@highlight The change in CMT was negatively correlated with lactate increase.
@highlight RGC thickness was negatively correlated with increased glucose and glutamine levels.
