 The morphology and projections of ventral horn interneurones in the segment above an ipsilateral thoracic lateral spinal cord lesion were studied in the cat by intracellular injections of Neurobiotin at 6 to 18weeks post lesion and compared with previously published control data from uninjured spinal cords . The cell axons ascended descended or both mostly contralaterally and mostly spared by the lesion . Unusual morphological dendritic features were seen in the lesion group mostly growth related including complex dendritic appendages twisted or multiple branched terminal dendrites commissural dendrites apparently swollen proximal dendrites and rostrocaudal asymmetries . Significant quantitative differences included more dendritic spines in the lesion group and smaller soma areas in the lesion group . Immunoreactivity to microtubule associated protein 2a b was detected in the proximal but not distal dendrites of cells in the lesion group corresponding to an overall decrease in immunoreactivity in the ventral horns on the lesion side compared to the other . For axon collaterals significant increases for the lesion group were seen in the number of collaterals in the first 4mm of axon and in the area of ventral intermediate horn occupied by terminals including increased innervation of some regions among which were the intermediolateral columns . This dendritic and axonal plasticity makes the interneuones candidates for a role in detour circuits but also for a maladaptive role in autonomic hyperreflexia .

@highlight Thoracic interneurones above a spinal cord injury were intracellularly labelled.
@highlight This uncovered significant dendritic plasticity on interneurones.
@highlight Interneurones had more axon collateral branches and larger termination areas.
@highlight The axon collateral branches also terminated in new areas.
@highlight These changes may have involved detour circuits but also may have been maladaptive.
