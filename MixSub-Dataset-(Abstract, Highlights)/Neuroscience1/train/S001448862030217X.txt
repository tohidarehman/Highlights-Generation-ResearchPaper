 Intracerebral hemorrhage is the common brain diseases in middle aged and elderly people with high disability and or mortality rate and is a serious public health concern . Both WNK3 kinase and the WNK3 SPAK NKCC1 signaling pathway play an integral role in maintaining normal cell homeostasis . However their role and underlying mechanisms in ICH induced secondary brain injury have yet to be elucidated . We established an ICH model using male Sprague Dawley rats by injecting autologous arterial blood into the unilateral basal ganglia . To establish ICH model Our data showed that WNK3 expression in brain tissue were upregulated after ICH induction . In addition silencing of WNK3 reduced neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory responses in rats that underwent ICH . Inhibition of WNK3 expression reduced the damaged blood brain barrier alleviated the impaired degree of cerebral edema and improved disruptive neurobehavioral cognition caused by ICH . Moreover overexpression of WNK3 had the opposite effects . Finally WNK3 SPAK NKCC1 signaling pathway may be involved in the above mentioned processes . In conclusion our findings showed that WNK3 and WNK3 SPAK NKCC1 signaling pathway play a vital biological function in ICH induced SBI . Depletion of WNK3 attenuated brain injury after ICH both

@highlight Protein levels of WNK3 increased significantly in brain tissues after ICH.
@highlight Decreasing of WNK3 played neuroprotective effects in rats after ICH.
@highlight Inhibition of WNK3 decreased OxyHb induced neuronal apoptosis
@highlight WNK3 participated in ICH induced secondary brain injury.
