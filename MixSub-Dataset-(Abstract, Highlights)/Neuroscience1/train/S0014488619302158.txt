 Ischemic stroke is the most common type of cerebrovascular event and is responsible for approximately 85 of all strokes in Taiwan . Neurons contain high concentrations of polyamines which are prone to various pathological states in the brain and are perturbed after cerebral ischemia . Acrolein an unsaturated aldehyde has been suggested as the primary culprit of neuronal damage in stroke patients . However the mechanism by which acrolein induces neuronal damage during ischemic stroke is not clear . Urinary 3 hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid an acrolein glutathione metabolite plasma acrolein protein conjugates and plasma GSH levels were analyzed to correlate disease severity and prognosis of stroke patients compared with control subjects . A deregulated acrolein metabolism including significantly increased plasma Acr PC levels decreased urinary 3 HPMA levels and decreased plasma GSH levels was found in stroke patients compared to control subjects . We further observed that acrolein was produced during ischemia resulting in brain damage in Overall our current results demonstrate that acrolein is a culprit of neuronal damage through GSH depletion in stroke patients . The mechanism underlying the role of acrolein in stroke related neuronal damage occurs through SSAT induced polyamine oxidation by NF kB pathway activation . These results provide a novel mechanism of neurotoxicity in stroke patients aid in the development of neutralizing or preventive measures and further our understanding of neural protection .
