 The intraepithelial corneal nerves that innervate the corneal epithelium are maintained through interactions with corneal epithelial cells and the extracellular matrix they produce . One to several axons bundle together within the basal cell layer and extend parallel to the ocular surface or branch and extend apically . Here we use 3 dimentional ultrastructural reconstructions of control and trephine injured mouse corneal epithelium and stroma produced using Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope to determine whether corneal epithelial or immune cells resident in the epithelium remove axonal debris and degrade it in their lysosomes after trephine injury to the cornea . We demonstrate that axonal fragments are internalized in the corneal epithelium and accumulate within electron dense structures consistent with lysosomes 3h after trephine injury in both epithelial and immune cells located among the basal cells of the trephine injured cornea . Confocal imaging showed fewer CD45
