 Neurogenic differentiation 1 is mainlyexpressed in developing neurons where it plays critical roles in neuronal maturation and neurite elongation . The potential role and mechanism of NeuroD1 in adult axonal regeneration is not clear . The present study used synapsin Cre and AAV9 Flex vectors to conditionally overexpress NeuroD1 in adult spinal neurons and found that NeuroD1 overexpression significantly accelerated axonal regeneration and functional recovery after sciatic nerve injury . Further
