 The goal of this study was to compare clinical characteristics of neuropathic pain associated with total brachial plexus injury before and after surgeries and to correlate possible contributing factors concerning to the pain prognosis . Thirty patients with both total brachial plexus injury and neuropathic pain were included . Neuropathic pain was evaluated in terms of pain intensities symptoms and regions . Pain intensities were evaluated by a visual analogue scale . The Neuropathic Pain Symptoms Inventory questionnaire and body maps were used to compare the pain symptoms and regions . Demographic data injury and repair information were evaluated to analyze the possible factors influencing the prognosis . The average pain score of all participants was 7.132.46 preoperatively and 5.402.08 postoperatively . All patients were divided into Pain Relief Group and Pain Aggravation Group . Older age machine traction injury and nerve transplantation seemed to be related with pain aggravation . Paroxysmal pain was aggravated after surgical repairs while paresthesia dysesthesia improved after surgery . The permanent component of the pain did not show any significant change . Pain in C5 and C6 dermatomes got relieved after surgery . This study revealed the neuropathic pain of most patients with total brachial plexus injury was alleviated after neurosurgery and the pain prognosis of different symptoms and regions varied after the nerve repair .

@highlight Neuropathic pain of most patients with TBPI was alleviated after neurosurgery.
@highlight Age injury cause and surgery type correlated with pain prognosis.
@highlight Paroxysmal pain was aggravated while paresthesia dysesthesia improved after surgery.
@highlight Pain transfer occurred after neurosurgery of TBPI.
