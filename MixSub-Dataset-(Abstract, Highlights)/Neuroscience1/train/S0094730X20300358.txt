 Based on previous evidence that lexical selection may operate differently in adults who stutter versus typically fluent adults and that atypical attentional processing may be a contributing factor the purpose of this study was to investigate inhibitory control of lexical selection in AWS . 12 AWS and 12 TFA completed two tasks . One was a picture naming task featuring High and Low Agreement object naming . Naming accuracy and reaction times and event related potentials time locked to picture onset were recorded . Second was a flanker task featuring Congruent and Incongruent arrow arrays . Push button accuracy and RTs and ERPs time locked to arrow array onset were recorded . Low Agreement pictures were named less accurately and slower than High Agreement pictures in both Groups . The magnitude of the Agreement effect on naming RTs was larger in AWS versus TFA . Delta plot analysis revealed that the Agreement effect was positively correlated with individual differences in inhibition in TFA but not in AWS . Moreover Low Agreement pictures elicited negative going ERP activity relative to High Agreement pictures in both Groups . However the scalp topography of this effect was markedly reduced in AWS versus TFA . For the Flanker task Congruency affected push button accuracy and RTs and N2 amplitudes similarly between groups . Results point to a selective deficit in inhibitory control of lexical selection in AWS . Potential pathways between diminished inhibitory control of lexical selection speech motor control and stuttering are discussed .

@highlight Inhibitory control of lexical selection was diminished in adults who stutter.
@highlight This effect did not extend from diminished domain general inhibitory control.
@highlight Diminished inhibitory control of lexical selection may influence speech production.
