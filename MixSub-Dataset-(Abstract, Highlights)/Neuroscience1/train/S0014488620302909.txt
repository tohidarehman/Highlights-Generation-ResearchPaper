 Ketamine has been reported to exert a prophylactic effect against stress induced depressive like behavior by modulating the guanosine based purinergic system . However the molecular pathways underlying its prophylactic effect and whether guanosine also elicits a similar effect remain to be determined . Here we investigated the prophylactic effect of ketamine and guanosine against corticosterone induced depressive like behavior in mice . Furthermore we characterized if the prophylactic response may be associated with mTORC1 driven signaling in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex . A single administration of ketamine but not guanosine given 1week before the pharmacological stress prevented CORT induced depressive like behavior in the tail suspension test and splash test . Fluoxetine treatment for 3weeks did not prevent CORT induced behavioral effects . A single administration of subthreshold doses of ketamine plus guanosine partially prevented the CORT induced depressive like behavior in the SPT . Additionally CORT reduced Akt Ser

@highlight CORT induces depressive like behavior and hippocampal synaptogenic markers deficits.
@highlight Ketamine prevents CORT induced behavioral and hippocampal synaptogenic alterations.
@highlight Guanosine or fluoxetine are unable to prevent the alterations induced by CORT.
@highlight Ketamine plus guanosine partially prevent CORT induced reduced self care behavior.
