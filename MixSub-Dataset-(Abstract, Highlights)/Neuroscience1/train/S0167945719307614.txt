 Flat feet in children negatively affect lower limb alignment and cause adverse health related problems . The long term application of foot orthoses may have the potential to improve lower limb coordination and its variability . To evaluate the effects of long term use of arch support FOs on inter joint coordination and coordination variability in children with flexible flat feet . Thirty boys with flexible flat feet were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups . The EG used medial arch support FOs during daily activities over a four month period while the control group received a flat 2 mm thick insole for the same time period . Lower limb coordination and variability during the 3 sub stance phases were quantified using a vector coding technique . Frontal plane ankle hip coordination in EG during mid stance changed to an anti phase pattern 156.9 The long term use of arch support FOs proved to be effective to alter lower limb coordination and coordination variability during walking in children with flexible flat feet . This new insight into coordinative function may be useful for improving corrective exercise strategies planned for children with flat feet .
