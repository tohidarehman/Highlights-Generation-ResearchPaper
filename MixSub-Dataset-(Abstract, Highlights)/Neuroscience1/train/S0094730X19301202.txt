 The aim of this systematic review is to examine the early interactions between bilingualism and stuttering to synthesize knowledge that could inform diagnosis and treatment for bilingual children who stutter . Scopus Science Direct PubMed ERIC Ebsco and Google Scholar were searched with no limits placed on the year of publication . Search terms consisted of OR stutter AND OR children AND OR bilingualism . Inclusion criteria were children who stutter bilinguals who stutter empirical research articles and published in peer review journals . Exclusion criteria were studies that reported on only adults only monolinguals or were not published in English . A total of 50 articles met the criteria . There was convergence with monolingual studies reporting sexually dimorphic and familial trends in the prevalence of stuttering and rates of recovery . Findings surrounding language proficiency cross linguistic stuttering severity and development were ambivalent . Results point to the difficulty in identifying stuttering in bilingual children and the need for culturally competent research and interpretations . Current findings offer a fragmented view of bilingual development and echoes a recurring theme i.e . the current understanding of bilingualism and stuttering is limited and more research is warranted .

@highlight The definition of bilingual is not consistent across studies.
@highlight There is no clear evidence for an increased risk of stuttering in bilinguals.
@highlight Reports of prevalence stuttering onset age and recovery rates across studies are inconsistent.
@highlight Findings for the effects of language proficiency and cross linguistic severity are ambiguous.
@highlight Similar to monolinguals more bilingual boys than girls stutter and are less likely to recover.
