 Interoception reflects the ability to observe ones innermost bodily states . Here we assessed whether interoceptive accuracy is related to the empathic ability to discriminate others emotions . Participants completed a heartbeat tracking task as well as an emotional go no go task with fearful and disgusted faces . Empathic facial mimicry during the go no go task was measured using electromyography of the

@highlight We tested whether interoceptive accuracy IA predicts ability to discriminate others emotions.
@highlight Higher IA was associated with higher perceptual sensitivity for emotional faces.
@highlight IA was unrelated to response bias.
@highlight Higher IA individuals had stronger coupling between facial EMG and task performance.
@highlight Facial mimicry might support more efficient emotion discrimination in higher IA individuals.
