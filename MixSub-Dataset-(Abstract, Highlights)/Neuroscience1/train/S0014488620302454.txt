 MicroRNAs are powerful regulators of CNS development and diseases . Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid miRs have recently been implicated as potential new sources for biomarker development . Previously we showed that miR 124 3p an essential miR for neuronal identity is highly abundant in neuronal exosomes and its expression decreases in spinal cord of ALS model SOD1G93A mice . In the current study we found a disease associated reduction of miR 124 3p levels specifically in spinal neurons using

@highlight miR 124 3p expression levels are decreased in mid staged SOD1G93A spinal motor neurons.
@highlight Increased extracellular localization of miR 124 3p in lumbar cord in diseased SOD1G93A mice.
@highlight Increased association between miR 124 3p and neuron derived exosomes in SOD1G93A mice.
@highlight Positive correlation of CSF miR 124 3p abundance and disease severity in male ALS patients.
