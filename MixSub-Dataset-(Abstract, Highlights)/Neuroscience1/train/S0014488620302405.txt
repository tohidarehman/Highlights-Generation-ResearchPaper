 Closed head traumatic brain injury is a worldwide concern with increasing prevalence and cost to society . Rotational acceleration is a primary mechanism in TBI that results from tissue strains that give rise to diffuse axonal injury . The Closed Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration was recently introduced as a method for the study of impact acceleration effects in pre clinical TBI research . This review provides a survey of the published literature implementing the CHIMERA device and describes pathological imaging neurophysiological and behavioral findings . Findings show CHIMERA inflicts damage in white matter tracts as a key area of injury . Behaviorally repeated studies have shown motor deficits and more chronic cognitive effects after CHIMERA injury . Good progress with model application has been accomplished by investigators attending to what is required for model validation . However the majority of CHIMERA studies only utilize adult male mice . To further establish this model more work with female animals and various age groups need to be performed as well as studies to further establish and standardize methodologies for validation of the models for clinical relevance . Common data elements to standardize the reporting methodology for the CHIMERA literature are suggested .

@highlight CHIMERA provides a clinically important rotational acceleration model for brain injuries in mice and and ferrets.
@highlight There have been 19 published papers primarily using adult male mice with two 0.5 Joule impacts separated by 24 h.
@highlight CHIMERA studies report robust changes including motor and cognitive deficits and diffuse axonal injury.
@highlight Further analyses that include females and different aged animals are needed.
@highlight We outline parameters to standardize the model including common data elements for reporting results.
