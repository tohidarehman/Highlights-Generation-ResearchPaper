 Emotions involve response synchronization across experiential physiological and behavioral systems referred to as concordance or coherence . Women are thought to be more emotionally aware and expressive than men and may therefore display stronger response concordance however research on this topic is scant . Using a random order film average design we assessed concordance among experiential autonomic respiratory and behavioral responses to 15 two minute films varying in valence and arousal . We then calculated for each participant and pair of measures a within subject correlation index using averages from the 15 films . Pronounced individual concordance of up to 0.9 was observed . Arousal physiology and valence behavior concordances were particularly pronounced . Women displayed higher concordance than men for almost all pairs of measures . Findings indicate stronger psychophysiological response coupling in women than men and provide novel insights into affective differences between the sexes .
