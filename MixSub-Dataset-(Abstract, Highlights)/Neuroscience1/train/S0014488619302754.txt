 MicroRNA 592 has been reported to play a significant role in mediating neuronal activity but its possible link with Alzheimer s disease remains unclear . We aimed to explore the mechanism of miR 592 in oxidative stress injury of astrocytes from AD rat models induced by D galactose or A

@highlight A rat model is used to explore roles of miR 592 and KIAA0319 on AD.
@highlight miR 592 is overexpressed in AST of AD rats.
@highlight miR 592 inhibits Keap1 Nrf2 ARE signaling pathway by down regulating KIAA0319.
@highlight Activation of Keap1 Nrf2 ARE signaling pathway promotes antioxidant enzyme activities.
@highlight The study provides theoretical basis for the treatment of AD.
