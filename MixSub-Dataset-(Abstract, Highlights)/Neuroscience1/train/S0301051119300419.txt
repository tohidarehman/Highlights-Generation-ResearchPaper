 Positive or negative feedback is usually used to maintain or shift a sorting rule in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test . Previous studies have demonstrated that negative feedback evokes a larger P3 than positive feedback . However it is unclear whether the neural response is different for negative feedback appearing at different stages of the WCST . We compared ERPs evoked by the negative feedback appearing at the rule switching stage
