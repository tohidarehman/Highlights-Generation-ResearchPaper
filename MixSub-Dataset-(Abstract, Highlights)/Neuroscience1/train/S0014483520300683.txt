 This study aimed to assess the cytotoxic effect of low molecular weight components and conventional silicone oils 1000cSt with different degree of purification using in vitro cytotoxicity tests . Direct contact cytotoxicity tests were performed in BALB 3T3 and human retinal pigment epithelial cells using quantitative and qualitative evaluation according to the ISO 10993 5 standards . Conventional SOs 1000cSt in form of raw intermediate and purified SO and a concentrate of LMWC were directly applied to 100 of cell layer area for 24h . Cell viability was quantified using 3 2 528 diphenyltetrazolium bromide and neutral red uptake assays in ARPE 19 and BALB3T3 respectively . All tested samples including the concentrate of LMWC resulted to be not cytotoxic according to ISO 10993 5 in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations . However the cellular viability was significantly higher in the intermediate and purified SO compared with the raw SO in ARPE 19cells . No reduction in cell viability was detected by LMWC .

@highlight Silicone oils with various purification degree were not cytotoxicity on BALB3T3 and ARPE 19cells.
@highlight Low molecular weight components were not cytotoxicity on BALB3T3 and ARPE 19cells.
@highlight Acute direct cytotoxicity is not likely to influence the biocompatibility of purified SO 1000cSt.
