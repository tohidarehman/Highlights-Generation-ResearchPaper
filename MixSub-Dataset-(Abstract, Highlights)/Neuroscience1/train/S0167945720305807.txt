 Psychomotor studies have identified a key role for attention in skill performance and acquisition . However the neural mechanisms that underpin attention s role in motor control are not well understood . The current study investigated the differential effects of focus of attention upon short latency afferent inhibition . SAI was chosen as it is positively correlated with the amount of sensory afference reaching the cortex . SAI is also sensitive to cholinergic influence the same neurotransmitter involved in regulating attention and is known to interact with other intracortical networks in the motor cortex . SAI in the first dorsal interosseous muscle was assessed while two separate groups produced the same physical sequential skill represented as a series of response key colors or response fingers . SAI was assessed at rest immediately preceding one element before or two elements before an index finger response . Compared to rest both attention focus groups demonstrated a reduction in first dorsal interosseous SAI across the three sequence elements . However the relative magnitude of SAI was greater under an internal focus of attention as an index finger response approached . This pattern indicates an attentional enhancement of somatosensory afference when attention is directed to a bodily dimension that counters the typical movement related suppression of SAI . The current results support contemporary theories of attention s role in motor control where an external focus of attention promotes a cortical state that maximizes effector coordination to maximize motor outcome .

@highlight Somatosensory afference is suppressed during sequential motor skills.
@highlight An internal focus mitigates somatosensory suppression during skill performance.
@highlight An external focus promotes somatosensory suppression during skill performance.
@highlight Results support the theory that attention determines motor control strategy.
