 The aim of this study was to test the effect of fatigue of the knee extensors muscles on bilateral force control accuracy variability and coordination in the presence and absence of visual feedback . Twenty two young physically active subjects were divided into two groups and performed 210 submaximal sustained bilateral isometric contractions of knee extensors muscles with and without visual feedback . One group performed a symmetrical taskboth legs were set at identical positions while the other group performed an asymmetrical task . We used the framework of the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis to quantify two variance components one of them did not change total force V

@highlight Bilateral isometric force control and coordination of knee extensors was investigated.
@highlight Presence of force asymmetry and visual feedback influenced structure of bilateral force control of knee extensors.
@highlight Muscle fatigue had no effect on bilateral isometric force coordination of knee extensors.
