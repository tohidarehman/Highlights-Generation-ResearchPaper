 Living in the past the present or the future can affect stress and health . Our group has shown that acute stress is modulated by time perspectives the ways we psychologically relate to time . Here we expand this research with a comprehensive measure of multi systemic chronic stress . Among 204 healthy adults we examined whether time perspectives modulate allostatic load measured with 23 neuroendocrine immune metabolic and cardiovascular biomarkers . Five time perspective categories were measured . Multiple regressions controlling for sex age and depressive symptoms were used . Increased present fatalistic time perspective was positively correlated with allostatic load while future time perspective was negatively correlated with allostatic load . Our preliminary findings link time perspective to multisystemic chronic stress and are discussed in the context of potential clinical implications .

@highlight Negatively living in the past present or future can be distressing and unhealthy.
@highlight Time perspectives and allostatic load indexing 23 biomarkers were assessed.
@highlight Present fatalistic tendencies were positively associated with allostatic load.
@highlight Positive future oriented tendencies were negatively associated with allostatic load.
@highlight Findings link subjective time perspectives to objective physiological dysregulation.
