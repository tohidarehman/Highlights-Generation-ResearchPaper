 Interoceptive accuracy is frequently assessed using the Heartbeat Counting Task requiring participants to count the number of times their heart beats . The HCT validity has been questioned as participants may perform the task by estimating rather than counting their felt heartbeats . Participants could estimate the time or use their knowledge of their heart rate . Some research ruled out the contribution of time estimation in HCT performance . However we believe these studies relied on a problematic analytic rationale . We revisited this question by relying on new analytic strategies and by examining the role of estimation in HCT performance while varying task instructions . The findings support the role of time and knowledge based estimations under original instructions . They also highlight the critical impact of instructions on HCT validity . Given the many limitations of the HCT we urge researchers to test the robustness of published effects and to reconsider the interpretation of replicable results .

@highlight The Heartbeat Counting Task HCT is contaminated by time estimation and knowledge about heart rate under original task instructions.
@highlight Adapted instructions reduce the influence of estimation strategies on HCT performance.
@highlight Adapted instructions should be favored complemented by statistical control of confounding variables.
