 The effects of intranasal oxytocin on amygdala activity during emotional perception are often mixed . Given that the brain is organized into networks of interconnected areas functional connectivity might provide an effective way to further understand the oxytocin effect . The aim of the present study was to investigate whether oxytocin administration affects amygdala activity and its functional connectivity during dynamic facial expression perception . Using a between group double blind placebo controlled design 55 participants were randomly assigned to groups receiving a single dose of 24 IU oxytocin or a placebo via intranasal administration . An implicit emotional task was employed to investigate the effect of oxytocin on neural responses to dynamic angry neutral and happy facial expressions with fMRI . Participants were instructed to respond only when the inverted dynamic faces were presented . The results indicated that oxytocin attenuated activation of insula and emotional processing related regions during the viewing of dynamic angry faces . However functional connectivity between the regions involved in the perception of dynamic angry faces was not changed following oxytocin administration . The present findings may contribute to our understanding of the anxiolytic effects of oxytocin and eventually facilitate human clinical applications .

@highlight The present study is the first to examine the modulation effect of IN OT on neural responses to dynamic facial expressions.
