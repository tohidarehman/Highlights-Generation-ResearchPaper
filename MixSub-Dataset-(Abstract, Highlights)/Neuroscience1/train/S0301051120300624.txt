 Wrongful conviction cases indicate that not all confessors are guilty . However there is currently no validated method to assess the veracity of confessions . In this preregistered study we evaluate whether a new application of the Concealed Information Test is a potentially valid method to make a distinction between true and false admissions of guilt . Eighty three participants completed problem solving tasks individually and in pairs . Unbeknownst to the participants their team member was a confederate tempting the participant to break the experimental rules by assisting during an individual assignment . Irrespective of actual rule breaking behavior all participants were accused of cheating and interrogated . True confessors but not false confessors showed recognition of answers obtained by cheating in the individual task as evidenced by larger physiological responses to the correct than to plausible but incorrect answers . These findings encourage further investigation on the use of memory detection to discriminate true from false confessions .

@highlight Many of the US wrongful convictions overturned by DNA involved a false confession.
@highlight Guilty and innocent participants signed admissions of guilt after interrogation.
@highlight Physiological responding significantly differed between true and false confessors.
@highlight True but not false confessors display recognition of concealed information.
@highlight Communication of details to innocent suspects contamination remains a pitfall.
