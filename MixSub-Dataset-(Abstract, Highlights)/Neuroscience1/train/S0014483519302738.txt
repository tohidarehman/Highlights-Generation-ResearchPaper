 Astigmatism is a refractive error due to meridional differences in refractive powers of lens or cornea . The resulting failure to focus image points in a single plane causes blurred vision at all distances . In this study using an animal model of lens induced astigmatism we tested the hypothesis that induced astigmatism is due to processing of astigmatic retinal image information by the brain which causes distorted growth in the anterior segment via centrifugal neural projections . To induce astigmatism 4.00DS 8.00DC crossed cylinder lens goggles were affixed over the right eyes of 7 day old chicks with the 8.00DC axis oriented vertically or horizontally the left eyes were without goggles . For all experiments refractive errors of both eyes were measured by streak retinoscopy before and after 1 week of lens wear . To test whether neuronal pathways between retina and brain are required axonal conduction within the eye was blocked by intravitreal injections of tetrodotoxin . TTX effectively blocked nerve conduction within the eye for 48h after injection . Goggled eyes developed astigmatism after treatment with TTX or PBS but not after excitotoxins . Our hypothesis was rejected . In this model the compensatory astigmatism induced by crossed cylinder lenses is intrinsic to the eye and mediated by visual processing in the retina .

@highlight Crossed cylinder lenses induced compensatory refractive astigmatism in chicks.
@highlight This effect was prevented by excitotoxins which disrupt retinal image processing.
@highlight This effect was not prevented by tetrodotoxin block of nerve conduction in the eye.
@highlight Lens induced astigmatism in chicks is mediated by local signaling within the retina.
