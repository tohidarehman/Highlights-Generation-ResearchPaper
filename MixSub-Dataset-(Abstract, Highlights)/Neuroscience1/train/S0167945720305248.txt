 Running promotes better cardiovascular health and has positive effects on the musculoskeletal system in older adults . However older adults have lower ankle plantarflexor torques and positive powers during running and exhibit changes in plantarflexor morphology than young adults . Since older runners who run as much as younger runners exhibit youthful ankle mechanical outputs running exposure may preserve the locomotor factors that mediate running speed . The purpose of this study was to compare ankle mechanical output during running and plantarflexor morphological characteristics between older runners who have low or high lifetime running exposure . Ten older runners with low lifetime running exposure and nine older runners with high lifetime running exposure performed over ground running trials at 3.0m s while kinematic and ground reaction force data were collected and used to compute joint angular kinetics . Right medial gastrocnemius morphological characteristics were assessed using ultrasonography at rest and during isometric contractions . Ankle torques powers and plantarflexor morphology were compared between groups . Older runners with different lifetime running exposures ran with similar ankle mechanical output

@highlight Older runners with different lifetime running exposures ran with similar ankle mechanical output.
@highlight Older runners with different lifetime running exposures exhibited similar medial gastrocnemius morphology.
@highlight Lifetime running exposure does not appear to influence ankle mechanical output or plantarflexor morphology in older runners.
