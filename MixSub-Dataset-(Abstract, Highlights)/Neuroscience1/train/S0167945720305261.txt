 Recent research suggests that graphic motor programs acquired through writing are part of letter representations and contribute to their recognition . Indeed learning new letter like shapes through handwriting gave rise to better recognition than learning through methods suppressing the graphomotor activity . The present study aimed at further assessing the role of the graphic motor programs in letter like shape recognition by disturbing the graphomotor activity during learning . We compared recognition performance following normal handwriting to recognition performance following hampered handwriting . Adult participants learned sets of symbols by copying them either with a standard pen or with a hampering writing tool . Recognition tests were administered immediately after the learning phase and again one week later . The results revealed lower recognition accuracy following hampered handwriting than following normal handwriting suggesting a contribution of graphomotor skills in the construction of letter representation .

@highlight We compare learning letter like shapes through normal and hampered handwriting.
@highlight Hampered handwriting allows to assess the role of fine motor skills and motor plans.
@highlight Normal handwriting led to higher recognition rates than hampered handwriting.
@highlight We conclude that fine motor skills contribute to letter like shape learning.
