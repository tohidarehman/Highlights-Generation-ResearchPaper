 Elevated level of interleukin 17 predominantly produced by T helper 17cells has been implicated in diabetic retinopathy but it remains unclear whether IL 17 is involved in the pathogenesis of DR. Ins2

@highlight Akita GKO mice were established by crossbreeding Ins2
@highlight mice with IFN deficient mice.
@highlight Th17 cell differentiation is promoted in Akita GKO mice more than GKO mice.
@highlight VEGF production and leukostasis to the retinal vessels are increased in Akita GKO mice compared with Akita mice.
@highlight Retinal morphological and functional changes are observed in Akita GKO mice at 9 week old.
