 Distraction is a widely used form of emotion regulation . Most studies have focused on the influence of distraction on the processing of aversive stimuli during distraction regulation however few studies investigated the impact on responses to aversive stimuli when they are re presented later . This study examined whether processing of unpleasant pictures could be modulated by previous distraction and whether this modulation was associated with the intervals between regulation and re exposure . Participants were presented with unpleasant images and asked to attend to or distract themselves from the images . After a 5 or 30 minute interval the participants were re exposed to the same images in an oddball task . Event related potential measurements revealed that compared with the previous attention condition the P3 amplitudes were significantly larger in the 30 min interval group but not in the 5 min interval group under the previous distraction condition and that the late positive potential amplitudes were significantly larger in the 30 min interval group but tended to be smaller in the 5 min interval group . These findings suggest that the effects of distraction were diminished or disappeared after a 5 min interval and reversed after a 30 min interval . This pattern suggests that caution should be exercised in the use of distraction strategies to reduce negative emotions particularly in cases in which unpleasant images may reappear in everyday life .
