 Retinopathy of prematurity is a potentially blinding condition caused by disruption of retinal vascularization and metabolism . This study aims to identify altered metabolites from plasma in patients with treatment requiring ROP compared with controls . An untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed to reveal the metabolomic profiles of the plasma between TR ROP patients

@highlight A metabolomics analysis was performed in plasma of treatment requiring ROP.
@highlight Altered plasma metabolites could be considered as potential biomarkers of treatment requiring ROP patients.
@highlight Protein digestion and absorption and aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis were the most enriched pathways.
