 Adverse childhood experience is a major risk factor for the onset of depression in adulthood . Neuroinflammation characterized by microglial activation and cytokine secretion is involved in susceptibility to depression induced by early life stress . Jumonji domain containing protein 3 a trimethylated lysine 27 in histone 3 demethylase can be activated by nuclear factor kappa B further regulating the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines and resulting in neuroinflammation . However its involvement in susceptibility to early life stress related depression is unknown . In the current study maternal separation was utilized as a model of early life stress and systemic lipopolysaccharide administration in adulthood was used as a later life challenge . Depressive and anxiety like behaviors and memory impairment were detected by behavioral tests . Microglial activation pro inflammatory cytokine expression and NF B Jmjd3 and H3K27me3 expression were detected in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in both infant and adult rats . Meanwhile the Jmjd3 inhibitor GSK J4 was used as an intervention

@highlight MS induced short and long term depressive like behaviors and neuroinflammation.
@highlight Infant and adult MS rats had higher levels of Jmjd3 in the PFC and HIP.
@highlight MS rats treated with LPS in adulthood displayed serious behavioral dysfunction and neuroinflammation.
@highlight Jmjd3 is involved in MS induced susceptibility to depressive disorders.
