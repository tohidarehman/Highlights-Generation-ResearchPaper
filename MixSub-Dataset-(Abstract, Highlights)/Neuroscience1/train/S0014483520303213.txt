 The study of corneal stromal keratocytes is motivated by its strong association with corneal health and visual function . They play a dominant role in the maintenance of corneal homeostasis and transparency through the production of collagens proteoglycans and corneal crystallins . Trauma induced apoptosis of keratocytes and replacement by fibroblasts and myofibroblasts disrupt the stromal matrix organization resulting in corneal haze formation and vision loss . It is therefore important to understand the biology and behaviours of keratocytes and the associated stromal cell types in wound healing corneal pathologies as well as different ophthalmic situations . The recent development of
