 Designing studies with maximal efficiency is of critical importance in almost all applications . In addition to the required number of panelists a common question is whether replications are adding any value to obtain more robust results or whether their contribution is too limited to justify the effort as addressed in two recent papers . We argue that the conclusions drawn namely that replications are usually not needed are unduly generalized . Two situations that are very similar when replications are employed can be quite different without replications . To determine the power of a study we need to consider not only the total variability of the data but more specifically both the within panelist and between panelists components individually . In contrast comparisons of observed significances can not offer profound guidance on whether replications are needed . Instead the concept of statistical power provides much better guidance .

@highlight Judging reliability and power of a design must not be on statistical significance.
@highlight The well known concept of statistical power provides more robust guidance.
@highlight General recommendations on the usefulness of replications in sensory profiling are impossible.
