 Despite the shift in the demographics of traumatic spinal cord injury with increased proportion of injuries in the elderly little is known on the potential effects of old age on the pathobiology of SCI . Since there is an assumption that age adversely affects neural response to SCI this study examines the clinically relevant question on whether age is a key determinant of inflammatory response oligodendroglial apoptosis and axonal survival after traumatic SCI . This unique study includes post mortem spinal cord tissue from 64 cases of SCI and 38 control cases without CNS injury . Each group was subdivided into subgroups of younger and elderly individuals . The results of this study indicate that age at the SCI onset does not adversely affect the cellular inflammatory response to oligodendroglial apoptosis and axonal survival after SCI . These results support the conclusion that elderly individuals have similar neurobiological responses to SCI as younger people and hence treatment decisions should be based on an assessment of the individual patient and not an arbitrary assumption that advanced age should exclude patients with an acute SCI from access to advanced care and translational therapies .

@highlight This study examined the potential effects of age on pathobiology of SCI using a unique collection of post mortem spinal cord tissue.
@highlight Our results indicate that age at the time of injury does not adversely affect the cellular inflammatory response to SCI.
@highlight Our results also suggest that age at the SCI onset does not influence oligodendroglial apoptosis and axonal survival after SCI.
@highlight Those results support the conclusion that elderly individuals have similar neurobiological responses to SCI as younger people.
