 Falls contribute to injuries and reduced level of physical activity in older adults . During falls the abrupt sensation of moving downward triggers a startle like reaction that may interfere with protective response movements necessary to maintain balance . Startle reaction could be dampened by sensory pre stimulation delivered immediately before a startling stimulus . This study investigated the neuromodulatory effects of pre stimulation on postural startle responses to drop perturbations of the standing support surface in relation to age .

@highlight Startle reaction may interfere with protective balance movements in older adults.
@highlight Pre stimulus inhibition dampened startle and postural reaction during perturbation.
@highlight Older adults retained the ability to modulate startle and postural responses.
@highlight Response rate to pre stimulus inhibition was reduced in old compared to young.
