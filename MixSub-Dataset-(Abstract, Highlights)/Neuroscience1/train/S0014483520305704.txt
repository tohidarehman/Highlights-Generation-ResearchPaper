 In piglets we tested the applicability of digital video microscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for non invasive assessments of limbal and bulbar conjunctival microcirculation .

@highlight Digital microscopy and spectroscopy can record microvascular data from conjunctiva.
@highlight Analyzed results quantify oxygen delivery from capillaries.
@highlight Capacity for capillary oxygen delivery is higher in limbus compared with bulbus.
