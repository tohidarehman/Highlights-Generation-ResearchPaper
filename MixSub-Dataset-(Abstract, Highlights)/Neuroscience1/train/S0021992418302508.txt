 Two studies assessed implicit and explicit attitudes toward stuttering and those who stutter among speech language pathologists . In Study 1 15 SLPs completed the Stuttering Implicit Association Test a measure of implicit attitudes toward stuttered speech . In Study 2 40 SLPs provided explicit attitudes about individuals who stutter assessed via self report ratings of an adult who stutters and one who does not . Participants also completed measures of experience with stuttering . As a group clinicians displayed negative implicit attitudes toward stuttering . Explicit attitudes toward a person who stutters were positive albeit less positive than attitudes toward a person who does not stutter . Amount of prior exposure to stuttering among these experienced SLPs was not significantly associated with either implicit or explicit attitudes . These findings highlight the importance of evaluating both implicit and explicit attitudes toward stuttering . The finding of positive explicit attitudes but negative implicit attitudes among similar samples of SLPs underscores the need to study implicit attitudes toward stuttering . Considering only explicit attitudes could lead to incomplete conclusions about the complex nature of attitudes toward stuttering .

@highlight Findings highlight the importance of evaluating both implicit and explicit attitudes toward stuttering.
@highlight Positive explicit attitudes toward those who stutter were found among a sample of SLPs.
@highlight Negative implicit attitudes were found among a similar sample of SLPs.
@highlight Differences between explicit and implicit attitudes underscore the need to study both types of attitudes to stuttering.
