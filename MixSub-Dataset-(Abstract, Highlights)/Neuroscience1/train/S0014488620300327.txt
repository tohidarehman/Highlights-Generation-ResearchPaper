 This study of medial gastrocnemius muscle and motor units after spinal cord hemisection and deafferentation in adult cats asked 1 whether the absence of muscle atrophy and unaltered contractile speed demonstrated previously in HSDA paralyzed peroneus longus muscles was apparent in the unloaded HSDA paralyzed MG muscle and 2 how ankle unloading impacts MG muscle and MUs after dorsal root sparing with foot placement during standing and locomotion . Chronic isometric contractile forces and speeds were maintained for up to 12months in all conditions but fatigability increased exponentially . MU recordings at 811months corroborated the unchanged muscle force and speed with significantly increased fatigability normal weights of MG muscle confirmed the lack of disuse atrophy . Fast MUs transitioned from fatigue resistant and intermediate to fatigable accompanied by corresponding fiber type conversion to fast oxidative and fast glycolytic accompanied by increased GAPDH enzyme activity in absolute terms and relative to oxidative citrate synthase enzyme activity . Myosin heavy chain composition however was unaffected . MG muscle behaved like the PerL muscle after HSDA with maintained muscle and MU contractile force and speed but with a dramatic increase in fatigability irrespective of whether all the dorsal roots were transected . We conclude that reduced neuromuscular activity accounts for increased fatigability but is not in of itself sufficient to promote atrophy and slow to fast conversion . Position and relative movements of hindlimb muscles are likely contributors to sustained MG muscle and MU contractile force and speed after HSDA and HSDA SP surgeries .

@highlight Cat hindlimb muscles were unloaded and their neuromuscular activity reduced by spinal cord hemisection and deafferentation
@highlight The unloaded fast twitch medial gastrocnemius MG muscle did not atrophy
@highlight The fatigability of the MG muscle and motor units increased whilst their contractile speeds and isometric forces were unchanged
@highlight Transition from fatigue resistant to fatigable fast motor units and fiber types is due to reduced neuromuscular activity
@highlight Hindlimb muscle position and relative movements are likely contributors to their maintained contractile force and speed
