 Acute whole body vibration is known to enhance neuromuscular activation . Especially mechanisms which act presynaptically are discussed to be involved in this modulation but evidence is still limited . Therefore this study aimed to investigate if 2min of WBV might impact the premotoneuronal mechanism of post activation depression .

@highlight PAD was reduced after 2min of 10Hz vibration
@highlight The PAD reduction sustains for a few minutes following vibration
@highlight It is unlikely that PAD explains post vibratory inhibition of spinal excitability
