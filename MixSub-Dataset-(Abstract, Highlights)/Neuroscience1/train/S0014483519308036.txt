 Homo sapiens MIR7 3 host gene a long non coding RNA has been reported to be connected with the progression of several tumors and could be served as a prognostic marker . Our study intends to explore the biological function and potential molecular mechanism of MIR7 3HG in Retinoblastoma progression . Two Rb cell lines Y79 and WERI Rb 1 were applied to perform functional assays . Expression of MIR7 3HG in Rb tissues and cells were determined with the support of GEO database and qRT PCR experiment . The effects of MIR7 3HG on cell activity and apoptosis were assessed through cell counting kit 8 and flow cytometry assays respectively . Targeted connections between MIR7 3HG and miR 27a 3p as well as miR 27a 3p and PEG10 were speculated by bioinformatics prediction software and verified by performing dual luciferase assays . Further interrelationships among MIR7 3HG miR 27a 3p and PEG10 were explored through rescue assays . MIR7 3HG overexpression was detected in Rb tissues and cell lines . Depletion of MIR7 3HG reduced the activity of Rb cells and increased the apoptosis of Rb cells and vice versa . In addition further exploration perceived that MIR7 3HG miR 27a 3p and PEG10 generated a competing endogenous RNA mechanism to regulate Rb cells activity and apoptosis . Our results indicated that MIR7 3HG functioned as a ceRNA to up regulate PEG10 expression via sponging miR 27a 3p to promote the proliferation of Rb cells and suppress the apoptosis of Rb cells exhibiting a group of potential target molecules for Rb treatment in the future .

@highlight High expression of MIR7 3HG was presented in Rb tissues and cells.
