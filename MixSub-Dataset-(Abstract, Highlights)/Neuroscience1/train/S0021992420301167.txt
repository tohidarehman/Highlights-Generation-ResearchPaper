 Treatments for anomia have demonstrated short and long term efficacy . However individual outcomes can be variable and evidence for treatment generalization is limited . We investigated whether treatment related measures of access to and learning of language namely a responsiveness to cues and b during treatment improvements in naming are good predictors of treatment outcomes . In addition we investigated mechanisms underlying treatment generalization . Ten adults with chronic post stroke aphasia received a phonological treatment for anomia three times a week for five weeks . Naming accuracy of treated and untreated words was assessed pre and post treatment and at four and eight week follow ups . Generalization to an untrained naming task which involved analyses of naming accuracy and speech errors was also assessed speech errors were analyzed according to the Interactive Activation model of word retrieval . Group analyses indicate significant improvements in naming treated compared to untreated words at all timepoints after therapy . Additional analyses showed significant long term improvements in naming untreated words . Initial responsiveness to cueing and early improvement emerged as significant predictors of overall pre to post treatment improvements in naming

@highlight PCA is an efficacious therapy approach but individual outcomes are variable.
@highlight Generalization may be mediated by a strengthening of lexical phonological connections.
@highlight Initial cue responsiveness predicts gains in naming treated words after therapy.
@highlight Early during therapy gains predict outcomes for both treated and untreated words.
