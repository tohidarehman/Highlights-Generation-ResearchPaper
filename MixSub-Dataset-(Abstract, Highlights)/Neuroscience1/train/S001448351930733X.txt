 Various severe ocular diseases are associated with an elevated intravitreal expression of VEGF A which increases the permeability of retinal endothelial cells or retinal pigment epithelial cells

@highlight Blocking VEGFR2 efficiently reverts VEGF induced dysfunction of cells of the BRB.
@highlight Additional blocking of other non tyrosine kinase receptors is not superior.
@highlight Inhibiting VEGFR2 does not alter vitality of REC or RPE cells.
@highlight Long term cultivated ARPE 19cells respond differently to VEGF A than short term cultivated ones.
