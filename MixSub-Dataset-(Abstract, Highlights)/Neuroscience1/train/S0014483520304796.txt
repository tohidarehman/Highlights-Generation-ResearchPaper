 The causes of vitreous humor liquefaction remain unclear . Diabetes accelerates this process and other ocular diseases . The weakening of the blood retina barrier observed with diabetes could enhance the rate of transfer of relatively small molecules such as glucose and phospholipids from the retina to the VH . Glucose and PLs have been detected previously in VH but their regional distributions are not known . The mapping of Glu and PLs in VHs from subjects with and without diabetes could reveal the roles of these molecules in VH liquefaction . Diabetic and non diabetic human eyes were acquired from the Kentucky Lions Eye Bank and frozen immediately . Each VH was removed and halved along the sagittal plane . One half was stamped on a matrix assisted laser desorption ionization plate . Either

@highlight The levels of glucose and phospholipids were significantly higher in vitreous humor from diabetics compared to non diabetics.
@highlight The migration of phospholipids from the lens into the vitreous humor is significant lower relative to that from the retina.
@highlight Wepropose that the higher abundance species in the posterior VH causes the breakage of the strong H bonding network.
