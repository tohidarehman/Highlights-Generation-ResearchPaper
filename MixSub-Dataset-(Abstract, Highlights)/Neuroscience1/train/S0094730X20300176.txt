 The purpose of the study was to determine whether differences exist between young English and Korean speaking children who stutter in the loci of stuttering . Participants were 10 Korean speaking and 11 English speaking CWS between the ages of 3 and 7 years . Participants produced narratives while viewing various picture scenes and a wordless picture book . Findings indicated that Korean speaking CWS stuttered more on content than function words whereas English speaking CWS stuttered more on function than content words . Furthermore both Korean and English speaking CWS tended to stutter more on utterance initial words . These findings appear to be related to the differences in linguistic syntactic structures between Korean and English . Specifically in the Korean speaking CWSs narratives most utterance initial words were content words whereas in the English speaking CWSs narratives most utterance initial words were function words . These preliminary findings although in need of replication with a larger sample size seem to suggest that the word class contributions to stuttering loci are more language specific whereas the word position contributions to stuttering loci are more language nonspecific . Given that the true characteristics of stuttering may be rather language nonspecific than language specific further research may need to focus more on stuttering loci related to word position than word class .

@highlight Korean speaking CWS stuttered more on content words whereas English speaking CWS stuttered more on function words.
@highlight Both Korean speaking CWS and English speaking CWS tended to stutter more on utterance initial words.
@highlight In the Korean language most utterance initial words were content words whereas in English most utterance initial words were function words.
@highlight Findings suggest that the loci of stuttering related to word class may be language specific.
