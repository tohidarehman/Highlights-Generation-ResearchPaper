 The aim of this review was to examine what is presently known about the nature of motor coordination and control problems in children with developmental coordination disorder during ball catching and to provide directions for future research . A systematic literature search was conducted using four electronic databases which identified 15 eligible studies . The results of the included studies were discussed structured around the target population characteristics the task used to measure motor coordination and control aspects and the type of outcome . Children with DCD experience difficulties with both motor coordination and control during ball catching . They have been suggested to apply four compensation strategies to overcome these difficulties a later initiation of the reaching phase an earlier initiation of the grasping phase a higher degree of coupling of the joints both intra and inter limb and fixating the joints . However despite these compensation strategies children with DCD still caught fewer balls than typically developing children in all studies . This was especially due to a higher amount of grasping errors which indicates a problem with the timing of the grasping phase . Directions for future research and practical implications were discussed .

@highlight Children with DCD have problems with both spatial and temporal aspects of catching.
@highlight Children with DCD catch fewer balls and make more grasping errors.
@highlight This review revealed four compensation strategies used by children with DCD.
