 Follistatin like 1 also named transforming growth factor 1inducible gene is a secreted extracellular glycoprotein expressing widely in nervous system . Several recent studies have revealed that FSTL1 plays an essential role in neurological diseases including neuropathic pain and ischemic stroke . It proves that FSTL1 suppresses synaptic transmission by activating Na K ATPase in DRG neurons and inhibits neuronal apoptosis by phosphorylation AKT signaling . However it is not clear whether FSTL1 can play a role in other type of neuron or neurodegenerative diseases . In this study we found that the mice with

@highlight mice exhibit memory deficits and synaptic plasticity impairments.
@highlight mice exhibit abnormal neural oscillations in the hippocampus.
@highlight mice exhibit 55 up regulated and 184 down regulated genes in hippocampus.
@highlight Fstl1 may be a novel target for the neurological diseases with cognitive impairment.
