 Glaucoma is an age related neurodegenerative disease that is commonly associated with sensitivity to intraocular pressure . The disease selectively targets retinal ganglion cells and constituent axons . RGC axons are rich in voltage gated sodium channels which are essential for action potential initiation and regeneration . Here we identified voltage dependent sodium channel NaV1.2 in the retina examined how this channel contributes to RGC light responses and monitored NaV1.2 mRNA and protein expression in the retina during progression of modeled glaucoma . We found NaV1.2 is predominately localized in ganglion cell intraretinal axons with dispersed expression in the outer and inner plexiform layers . We showed Phrixotoxin 3 a potent NaV1.2 channel blocker significantly decreased RGC electrical activity in a dose dependent manner with an I

@highlight Voltage gated sodium NaV channel 1.2 is localized predominately in ganglion cell intraretinal axons.
@highlight Retinal ganglion cell light responses are modulated by the NaV1.2 channel specific blocker Phrixotoxin 3.
@highlight Elevating intraocular pressure for four weeks decreases NaV1.2 protein expression in the retina.
