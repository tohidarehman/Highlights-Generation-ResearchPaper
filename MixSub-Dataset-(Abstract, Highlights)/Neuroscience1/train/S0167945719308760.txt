 Age induced decline in the ability to perform daily activities is associated with a deterioration of physical parameters . Changes occur in neuromuscular system with age however the relationship between these changes and physical parameters has not been fully elucidated . Therefore in this study we aimed to determine the relationship between neuromuscular system evaluated using a coherence analysis of the

@highlight EMGEMG coherence of the leg muscles was investigated in standing tasks.
@highlight  band coherence from two gastrocnemius was larger in unipedal than bipedal stance.
@highlight The increase in band coherence was associated with less leg muscle mass.
@highlight The increase may be compensation for the muscle mass loss.
@highlight Alternatively it may be a change in the nervous system causing muscle mass loss.
