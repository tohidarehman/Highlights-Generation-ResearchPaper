 Spinal interneurons which discharge in phase with the respiratory cycle have been repeatedly described over the last 50years . These spinal respiratory interneurons are part of a complex propriospinal network that is synaptically coupled with respiratory motoneurons . This article summarizes current knowledge regarding spinal respiratory interneurons and emphasizes chemical electrical and physiological methods for activating spinal respiratory neural circuits . Collectively the work reviewed here shows that activating spinal interneurons can have a powerful impact on spinal respiratory motor output and can even drive rhythmic bursting in respiratory motoneuron pools under certain conditions . We propose that the primary functions of spinal respiratory neurons include 1 shaping the respiratory pattern into the final efferent motor output from the spinal respiratory nerves 2 coordinating respiratory muscle activation across the spinal neuraxis 3 coordinating postural locomotor and respiratory movements and 4 enabling plasticity of respiratory motor output in health and disease .
