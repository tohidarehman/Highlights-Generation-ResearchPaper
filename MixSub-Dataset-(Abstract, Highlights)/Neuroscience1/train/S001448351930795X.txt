 To observe the morphologic and histopathologic changes of femtosecond laser assisted small incision allogenic intrastromal lenticule implantation in monkey corneas . 6 healthy adult monkeys were included . One eye of two monkeys and both eyes of one monkey received femtosecond lenticule extraction with a 4.0 diopter correction . Each extracted refractive donor lenticule was immediately allogeneically transplanted into a corneal stromal pocket created by a femtosecond laser in another monkey s eye . A postoperative two year follow up was performed with slit lamp microscopy corneal topography anterior segment optical coherence tomography and in vivo confocal microscopy . All eyes were enucleated for Hematoxylin Eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy observation . No complications were observed in the follow up period . At postoperative 2 years the corneas remained clear and the lenticules were integrated with the surrounding tissue under slit lamp microscopy . Nerve fiber regeneration was detected in the lenticule layer as observed through confocal microscopy . Corneal power was increased by 1.831.36 D after 2 years which was less than at 6 months . Disordered fibers and decreased keratocytes in the implanted lenticules could be detected under light microscopy and TEM with a clear boundary between the lenticules and the surrounding tissue . Small incision AILI is feasible and safe for reshaping the cornea . Corneal healing remained stable while refraction showed a moderate regression within postoperative 2 years .

@highlight Small incision allogenic intrastromal lenticule implantation is feasible and safe for reshaping the cornea.
@highlight Corneal healing remained stable while refraction showed a moderate regression within postoperative 2 years.
@highlight The mechanism of histopathologic change require further investigation.
