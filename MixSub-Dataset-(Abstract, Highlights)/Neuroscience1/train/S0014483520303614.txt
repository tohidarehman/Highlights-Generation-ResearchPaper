 Primary blast injury to the retina and optic nerve causes progressive visual loss and neurodegeneration . Military personnel are exposed to multiple low overpressure blast waves which may be in quick succession such as during breacher training or in combat . We investigated the necroptotic cell death pathway in the retina in a mouse repeated primary ocular blast injury model using immunohistochemistry . We further evaluated whether intravitreal injections of a potent necroptosis inhibitor Necrostatin 1s protects the retina and ON axons by retinal ganglion cells counts ON axonal counting and optical coherence tomography analysis of vitreous haze . Receptor interacting protein kinase 3 increased in the inner plexiform layer 2 days post injury and persisted until 14 dpi whilst RIPK1 protein expression did not change after injury . The number of degenerating ON axons was increased at 28 dpi but there was no evidence of a reduction in the number of intact ON axons or RNA binding protein with multiple splicing

@highlight The retina and optic nerve can be injured after repeated primary blast injury rPBI .
@highlight Retinal necroptosis protein RIPK3 increased after rPBI.
@highlight Intravitreal injections and rPBI can cause additive injury with increased cell death and inflammation.
@highlight Treatment with pharmacological necroptosis inhibitor Necrostatin 1s may provide some retinal ganglion cell neuroprotection.
