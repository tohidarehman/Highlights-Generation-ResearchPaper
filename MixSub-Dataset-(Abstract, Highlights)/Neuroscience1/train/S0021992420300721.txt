 This study examined the effects of a vocabulary intervention for bilingual children that was conducted in childrens first language Spanish and included explicit instruction on cognates . We measured effects in terms of change from pre to post intervention in Spanish as well as associations with the non target language English . Participants were 12 Spanish English bilingual children aged 68 years with and without Developmental Language Disorder . Children completed the intervention in pairs for 70 minute sessions 3 days a week for four weeks . Intervention targeted 32 words using four storybooks and interactive activities that highlighted similarities across languages . Pre and post intervention measures in Spanish and English included tasks of word definition and cognate facilitation . As a group children showed improvement in definition quality and cognate naming in Spanish . There was a positive correlation between definition quality and cognate naming for the typically developing children but not for the children with DLD . All children showed positive cross language correlations on post intervention measures . Bilingual children with and without DLD have the capacity to improve in their awareness and use of cognates . Explicit teaching of cognates can be an effective tool for building vocabulary skills . Children with DLD may need additional time and support to apply their knowledge of cognates to vocabulary learning .

@highlight First language intervention improves vocabulary knowledge in bilingual children.
@highlight Bilinguals with Developmental Language Disorder name more cognates v. noncognates.
@highlight Explicit cognate teaching shows potential for supporting vocabulary acquisition.
