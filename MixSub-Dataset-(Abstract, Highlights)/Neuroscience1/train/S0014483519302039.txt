 Retinal ganglion cell degeneration leading to irreversible blindness in chronic optic neuropathies commonly begins with dendritic shrinkage followed by axon degeneration . Although limited axon regeneration in the optic nerve is possible with a genetic deletion of PTEN SOCS3 after optic nerve injury the roles of PTEN SOCS3 on dendritic preservation and regeneration remain unclear . This study investigated the effect of PTEN SOCS3 genetic deletion on the structural integrity of RGC dendrites and axons in the retina following optic nerve crush . Using time lapse

@highlight PTEN but not SOCS3 deletion ameliorates RGC dendritic shrinkage after ON crush.
@highlight Rate of dendritic shrinkage in SOCS3 deleted RGCs are no different from control.
@highlight SOCS3 deletion enhances axon regeneration in the optic nerve but not the retina.
@highlight Intrinsic RGC axon and dendritic preservation mechanisms are molecularly distinct.
@highlight PTEN deletion shows aberrant axon regeneration in retina 6 months after ON crush.
