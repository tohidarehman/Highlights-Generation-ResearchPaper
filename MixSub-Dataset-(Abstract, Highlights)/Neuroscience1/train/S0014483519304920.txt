 Administration of RC28 E a VEGF bFGF dual decoy receptor have shown relative therapeutic value in ocular in vivo models including laser induced choroidal neovascularization in monkeys and streptozotocin induced diabetic retinopathy in rats . In the present study we have elucidated the pharmacokinetics profiles of RC28 E at the systemic vitreous and aqueous humor after administration in a primate model

@highlight Drug could rapidly distribute into focus of eye after intravitreal administration.
@highlight Exposure in choroid and retina could reach efficacy dose.
@highlight Approximately one quarter drug enters blood circulation system through the blood ocular barrier.
