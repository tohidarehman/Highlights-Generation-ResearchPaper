 The aim of this study was to examine the expression of the cytokines and chemokines receptor 3 molecule in endothelial cells and vascular structures in a murine model of corneal neovascularization and in samples of neovascularized human corneas . An immunofluorescence assay using the murine model showed a greater proportion and intensity of CCR3 in the epithelium and corneal subepithelial regions in corneas with neovascularization . In the absence of vascularization no CCR3 was found . Of the 32 studied tissues eight were vascularized and 24 were avascular . In the human corneas vascularized corneas showed positive labeling for CD31 in all the analzedtissues as well as positive labeling for CCR3 . Therefore all vascularized tissues showed positive coexpression of CCR3 and CD31 whereas none of the avascular corneas showed immunolabeling for either of these receptors . These results suggest that CCR3 could be a possible marker for corneal neovascularization with potential to be a therapeutic target .

@highlight CCR3 receptor is present in vascularized corneal tissue.
@highlight There is a CCR3 CD31 colocalization in corneal neovessels.
@highlight There is discrete expression of eotaxin3 in neovascularized corneas.
