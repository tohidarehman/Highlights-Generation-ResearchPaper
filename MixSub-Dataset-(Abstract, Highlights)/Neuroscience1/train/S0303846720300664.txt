 Superficial siderosis is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by persistent or intermittent bleeding into the subarachnoid space . It leads to characteristic clinical and radiographic findings . Dural pathology is believed to be the most common identifiable etiology of SS . It has been suggested that dural tear may be the common pathology of both SS and intracranial hypotension syndrome . We present a patient with SS caused by posttraumatic duropathy that was associated with cerebrospinal fluid hypotension headache . Patient was treated surgically with stabilization of neurological deficit and orthostatic headache improvement . It supports the speculated link between both entities and may confirm surgery being a reasonable approach in patients with SS .

@highlight Meningeal laceration can be the joint cause of superficial siderosis and intracranial hypotension syndrome.
@highlight Brachial plexus avulsion injury is a very rare cause of both entities.
@highlight Surgical management may potentially halt progression of superficial siderosis and cure intracranial hypotension syndrome.
