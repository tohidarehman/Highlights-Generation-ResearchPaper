 Chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans are inhibitors to axon regeneration and plasticity . A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 4 is a human enzyme that catalyses the proteolysis of CSPG protein cores . Infusion of ADAMTS4 into the damaged spinal cord was previously shown to improve functional recovery SCI however this therapy is limited in its enzyme form . Adeno associated viral vector gene therapy has emerged as the vector of choice for safe robust and long term transgene expression in the central nervous system . Here an AAV expression cassette containing ADAMTS4 under the control of the astrocytic GfaABC

@highlight ADAMTS4 is a mammalian endogenous CSPG degrading enzyme.
@highlight An astrocyte selective AAV ADAMTS4 vector effectively expresses ADAMTS4
@highlight and
@highlight AAV ADAMTS4 decreased lesion size and increased fiber sprouting following SCI.
@highlight The combination of hindlimb specific exercise rehabilitation improved functional recovery.
