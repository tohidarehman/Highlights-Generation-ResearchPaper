 Neuroinflammation is one of the most common etiology in various neurological disorders and responsible for multi array neurotoxic manifestations such as neurodegeneration neurotransmitters alteration and cognitive dysfunction . NR is a natural bioactive molecule which possesses significant antioxidant and anti inflammatory potential but suffers from glitches of low solubility low bioavailability and fast hepatic metabolism . In the current study we fabricated nano engineered lipid carrier of nerolidol for its effective delivery into the brain and explored its effect on neuroinflammation neurotransmitters level and on dysfunctional behavioral attributes induced by CYC . The binding affinity of nerolidol with NLRP3 and TLR 4 was performed which showed stong interaction between them . NR NLC was prepared by the ultrasonication methods and particle size was determined by Zeta sizer . Swiss Albino mice were divided into 5 groups

@highlight Cyclophosphamide 200mg kg i.p. induced significant neurotoxicity. in hippocampus and cortex of Swiss Albino mice
@highlight Nerolidol nanoformulation NR NLC 200 and nerolidol suspension NR 200 at the dose of 200mg kg p.o. were evaluated for neuroprotective effect.
@highlight Molecular docking study revealed potential interaction profile of nerolidol in the binding pockets of NLRP3 and TLR 4
@highlight NR NLC 200 was found effective in reversing CP induced neurotoxic manifestations in these mice.
