 We recorded event related potentials while anxious and avoidant participants performed an emotional face recognition task featuring happy and angry faces . The avoidant attachment individuals were more accurate on angry trials whereas anxious attachment individuals were more accurate on happy trials . FN400 amplitude was larger in the anxious attachment group than in the avoidant attachment group . Both groups produced larger N170 amplitudes in response to angry faces . However happy faces evoked shorter N170 latencies in the anxious attachment group while angry faces evoked shorter N170 latencies in the avoidant group . Our results demonstrate that the processing of emotional stimuli differs between individuals with anxious and avoidant attachment styles . These differences start at early stages of stimulus processing and yield perceptual biases in the two attachment orientations . This appears to underlie differences in the later stage of recognition of emotional stimuli .

@highlight We compared anxious and avoidant adult individuals during emotional face recognition.
@highlight There was an effect of attachment style on FN400 amplitude and an interaction effect between attachment style and emotion type on amplitudes and latencies of N170.
@highlight Processing of emotional stimuli differs between individuals with anxious and avoidant attachment at both early and late stages of information processing.
@highlight Avoidant individuals use a vigilant rather than a defensive recognition strategy.
@highlight FN400 and N170 peaks were affected by attachment orientation.
