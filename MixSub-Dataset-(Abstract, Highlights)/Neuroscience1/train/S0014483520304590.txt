 Mesenchymal stromal cells with progenitor cell and immunological properties have been cultivated from numerous vascularized tissues including bone marrow adipose tissue and the corneal limbus of the eye . After observing mesenchymal cells as contaminants in primary cultures of vascular endothelial cells derived from the choroidal tunic of the human eye we investigated whether the choroid might also provide a source of cultured MSC . Moreover we examined the effect of the choroidal stromal cells on the proliferation of freshly isolated choroidal vascular endothelial cells

@highlight There is a resident population of mesenchymal stromal cells in the human choroid.
@highlight Cultures established from the human choroidal stroma displayed a phenotype consistent with the accepted definition for MSC including the capacity for mesenchymal differentiation.
@highlight Growth arrested choroidal MSC inhibit the proliferation of choroidal derived vascular endothelial cells in primary culture.
