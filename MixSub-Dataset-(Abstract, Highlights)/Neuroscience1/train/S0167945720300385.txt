 Upper limb reaching and grasping movements are performed more efficiently during binocular viewing however the distinct contribution of stereopsis fusional vergence and accommodation has not been examined in typically developing children . This study examined binocular visual function in a cohort of 57 typically developing children 8 to 14years old . Hand kinematics were recorded using a motion capture camera while children performed a prehension task involving threading a bead onto a needle . Results showed that different aspects of binocular vision contribute to the control of distinct phases of upper limb movements . Specifically fusional vergence was associated with higher peak reach velocity stereoacuity was associated with shorter grasp execution and accommodation was associated with shorter placement duration . These findings suggest that different aspects of binocular vision play an important role in optimizing the control of distinct phases of prehension movements during development .

@highlight Binocular viewing is associated with more efficient prehension performance in typically developing children and adolescents.
@highlight Better fusional vergence is associated with higher peak velocity of the reaching movement.
@highlight Lower stereoacuity threshold is associated with shorter grasp duration.
@highlight Optimal development of upper limb reaching and grasping movements relies on normal binocular vision.
