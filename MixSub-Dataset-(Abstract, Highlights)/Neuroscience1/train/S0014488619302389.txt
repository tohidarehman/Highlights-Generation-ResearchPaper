 Neurotrophic factors as candidates for ALS therapeutics have previously been studied in the context of attempts to slow disease progression . For a variety of reasons clinical trials of neurotrophic factors have failed to show efficacy in ALS patients . Previous studies in Parkinson s Disease models have shown promise with the use of recombinant adeno associated virus serotype 2 neurturin providing neuroprotection and behavioral improvements in preclinical models which subsequently resulted in several clinical studies in patients with PD . Given that this neurotrophic compound has not been studied in the context of ALS we conducted a study of AAV2 NRTN to assess the preclinical safety tolerability biodistribution and efficacy of this compound in an ALS mouse model .

@highlight AAV2 NRTN injected into spinal cords of ALS mice provides long term expression of NRTN in motor neurons.
@highlight AAV2 NRTN delivery results in a dose dependent neuroprotection of motor neurons and neuromuscular junctions.
@highlight The neuroprotective effects correlate with a slowing of grip strength decline in this ALS model.
@highlight The history of AAV2 NRTN in previous clinical trials suggests this approach could be an ALS treatment strategy.
