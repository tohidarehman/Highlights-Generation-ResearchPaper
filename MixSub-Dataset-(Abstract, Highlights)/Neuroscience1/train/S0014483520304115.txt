 Photoreceptor cells undergo changes with aging . It is unknown if their microtubules are stable or not with aging . This study examined photoreceptor cell ultrastructure from 18 human donor retinas and quantified the photoreceptors with altered microtubules over six to ninth decades in four defined retinal regions . In addition immunoreactivity to microtubule associated protein 2 tau and hyperphophorylated tau was performed in retinal sections from companion eyes . In young donor retinas below 75 years of age microtubules appeared straight in photoreceptor inner segments and axons . With age they appeared bent or misaligned in macular and mid peripheral photoreceptors . In addition dense granular materials were present in photoreceptor axons and synaptic terminals in advanced ages . In all decades rod microtubules were affected more than their cone counterparts . Both rods and cones were significantly affected in mid peripheral retina in eighth decade compared to other decades or retinal regions examined . IR showed a steady expression of MAP 2 in inner segments and tau in inner segments to axons below 75 years of age but was absent for both markers in scattered macular and mid peripheral photoreceptors in advanced ages . IR to hyperphosphorylated tau was present mainly in inner retina and increased with aging . Markers of oxidative stress e.g . lipid peroxidation and nitrosative stress were immunopositive in aged photoreceptors . The sporadic loss of MAP 2 and tau IR in photoreceptors may be due to microtubule changes all these changes may affect intracellular transport and be partly responsible for photoreceptor death in aged human retina .

@highlight Human photoreceptor microtubules alter with aging.
@highlight Rod microtubules alter significantly more than cone counterparts.
@highlight There is sporadic loss of MAP 2 and tau from macular photoreceptors.
@highlight Hyperphosphorylated tau is expressed widely in aged human retina.
