 In long jumping athletes need to hit a take off board with both high precision and high run up velocity to leap as far as possible . It is commonly agreed that visual regulation plays a crucial role in long jumping . To identify visual regulation researchers have typically relied on analyses of variability in step parameters . The aim of the current study was to examine whether gait based visual regulation coincides with measures of actual gaze control referred to as gaze based visual regulation . Therefore 15 participants performed long jumps and run throughs while wearing a mobile eye tracker . To compare gait based with gaze based visual regulation a digital camera recorded all trials for subsequent frame by frame analyses of step parameters . Results revealed that gait based visual regulation coincided with the step of the longest gaze on the take off board but not with the step of initial gaze on take off board . This finding supports the notion of visuomotor control of motor variability by means of longer gazing periods at the take off board . In addition our results provide initial insights to coaches and athletes on the particular requirements of visual regulation and the relationship between gait and gaze in the long jump approach .

@highlight Visual regulation in long jumping is typically assessed by step variability measures.
@highlight Here we examined whether step variability and gaze measures coincide.
@highlight Participants performed long jumps while wearing a portable eye tracker.
@highlight Typical step variability parameters coincided with longest gaze but not initial gaze on take off board.
