 Error processing in complex decision tasks should be more difficult compared to a simple and commonly used two choice task . We developed an eight alternative response task which allowed us to investigate different aspects of error detection . We analysed event related potentials ERP

@highlight Error detection in complex response selection was investigated.
@highlight In the 8 alternative response task different error types could be identified.
@highlight Response speed had an impact on the neural correlates of error processing.
@highlight Response force findings indicated early error correction processes.
