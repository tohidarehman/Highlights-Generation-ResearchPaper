 Although previous research indicated that resting state theta beta ratio is related to unspecified emotion regulation the ER strategies associated with TBR remain unclear . We examined whether representative ER strategiesdistraction and reappraisalare related to resting state TBR . Data from sixty one healthy Japanese university students were recorded in an eyes closed resting state with an electroencephalogram . Their self reported tendencies of distraction and reappraisal were assessed . Rank correlation analyses revealed that lower frontal and parietal TBR were associated with high distraction tendency . However frontal and parietal TBR were not correlated with reappraisal . Given that TBR is linked to attention control distraction may be associated with TBR . Consequently TBR can be used to identify persons with ER difficulties based on the results of this study .

@highlight The links between resting state EEG and emotion regulation strategies were examined.
@highlight Frontal and parietal theta beta ratio was correlated with distraction tendency.
@highlight Frontal and parietal theta beta ratio was not associated with reappraisal.
