 Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common complications in diabetic patients . Though the exact mechanism for DPN is unknown it clearly involves metabolic dysfunction and energy failure in multiple cells within the peripheral nervous system . Lactate is an alternate source of metabolic energy that is increasingly recognized for its role in supporting neurons . The primary transporter for lactate in the nervous system monocarboxylate transporter 1 has been shown to be critical for peripheral nerve regeneration and metabolic support to neurons axons . In this study MCT1 was reduced in both sciatic nerve and dorsal root ganglia in wild type mice treated with streptozotocin a common model of type 1 diabetes . Heterozygous MCT1 null mice that developed hyperglycemia following STZ treatment developed a more severe DPN compared to wild type mice as measured by greater axonal demyelination decreased peripheral nerve function and increased numbness to innocuous low threshold mechanical stimulation . Given that MCT1 inhibitors are being developed as both immunosuppressive and chemotherapeutic medications our results suggest that clinical development in patients with diabetes should proceed with caution . Collectively our findings uncover an important role for MCT1 in DPN and provide a potential lead toward developing novel treatments for this currently untreatable disease .

@highlight MCT1 is reduced in sciatic nerve and DRG of streptozotocin induced diabetic mice.
@highlight Reducing MCT1 worsens experimental diabetic neuropathy in mice.
@highlight Reducing MCT1 led to greater nerve demyelination after induction of diabetes.
