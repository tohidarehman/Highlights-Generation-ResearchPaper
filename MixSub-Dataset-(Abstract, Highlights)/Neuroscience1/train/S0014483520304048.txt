 To examine the protective effects of Isoliquiritigenin in angiotensin II induced inflammation and fibrosis on Human Tenon s capsule Fibroblasts and Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages . This study also investigated the potential mechanism of action of ISL . Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay was used to test ISL toxicity . An ELISA and an RT qPCR assay detected the inflammatory cytokines . A Western blot investigated the expression levels of inflammation related signals Pre treatment with ISL dose dependently decreased the mRNA levels of TNF IL 6 ICAM 1 and COX 2 induced by ANG II in both MPMs and HTFs . ANG II remarkably increased the amount of P65 in the nuclei and decreased the amount of P65 in the cytoplasm . Additionally ANG II reduced PPAR expression levels in a time dependent manner . Furthermore these effects which were induced by ISL were remarkably neutralized by ISL pre treatment . Finally ANG II markedly elevated the expression of fibronectin and SMA . ISL could alleviate ANG II induced fibrogenesis by inhibiting the NF B PPAR inflammatory pathway . In addition ISL may be a potential agent for the treatment of conjunctival fibrosis . Most importantly the NF B PPAR signaling pathway could be an effective therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of conjunctival fibrosis after glaucoma surgery .
