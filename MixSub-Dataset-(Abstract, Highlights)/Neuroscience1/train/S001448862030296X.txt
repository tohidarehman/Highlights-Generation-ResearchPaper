 Activation of amino 3 hydroxy 5 methyl 4 isoxazolepropionic acid receptors increases phrenic motor output . Ampakines are a class of drugs that are positive allosteric modulators of AMPA receptors . We hypothesized that 1 ampakines can stimulate phrenic activity after incomplete cervical spinal cord injury and 2 pairing ampakines with brief hypoxia could enable sustained facilitation of phrenic bursting . Phrenic activity was recorded ipsilateral and contralateral to C2 spinal cord hemisection in anesthetized adult rats . Two weeks after C2Hx ampakine CX717 increased IL and CL burst amplitude in 8 of 8 rats . After 90min IL and CL bursting remained above baseline in 7 of 8 rats . Pairing ampakine with a single bout of acute hypoxia 5 min arterial partial pressure of O

@highlight Cervical spinal cord injury cSCI impairs phrenic motor output PMO .
@highlight Ampakines are positive allosteric modulators of AMPA receptors.
@highlight Ampakine CX717 increased bilateral PMO at 2 and 8weeks post cSCI.
@highlight Ampakines may help restore respiratory muscle activation after cSCI.
