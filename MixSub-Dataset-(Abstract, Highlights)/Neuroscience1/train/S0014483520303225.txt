 Limbal epithelial stem cells are required for the maintenance and repair of the corneal epithelial surface . The difficulty in obtaining human corneal tissue for research purposes means that animal models for studying the corneal and limbal epithelium are extremely useful . Porcine corneal tissue represents an attractive experimental model however functional analysis of the limbal epithelial cell population is needed to validate the use of this tissue . Single cell clonal analysis revealed that holoclone generating cells were enriched in the limbus as compared with the central cornea and that label retaining cells were also enriched in the limbus and compared with the central cornea . Furthermore it was demonstrated that in a 3D printed organ culture system porcine tissue was capable of maintaining and healing the corneal epithelium . Ki67 staining of corneal sections revealed that in response to central epithelial wounding a greater proportion of progenitors in the basal limbal epithelium enter an actively dividing state . The authors present a comprehensively validated model system for studying the interactions between limbal niche factors and limbal epithelial stem cell fate .

@highlight Stem cells are enriched in the porcine limbus and this represents a suitable model for studying the human limbus.
@highlight Organ cultured porcine corneas with an intact limbus are capable of maintaining the corneal epitehlium.
@highlight The proliferative response of limbal epitehlial progenitors to wounding can be visualised
