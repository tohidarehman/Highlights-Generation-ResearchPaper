 Harsh parenting is a significant predictor of youth aggression and delinquency . However not every child exposed to adverse parenting develops such problem behaviors . Recent developmental evolutionary models suggest that variability in stress response reactivity to parenting reflected by autonomic nervous system functioning may affect the impact of adverse parenting on youth behavioral adjustment . The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the parasympathetic and sympathetic branches of the ANS moderate the association between parenting and aggressive and delinquent behaviors . The study sample included low income ethnically diverse preadolescents M 10.28 years old
