 Limbal function is a key determinant of corneal epithelial integrity . Lineage tracing studies in mice have highlighted that the centripetal movement of epithelial progenitors from the limbus drives both the steady state maintenance of the corneal epithelium and its regeneration following injury . It is well established that this is facilitated by a population of limbal epithelial stem cells within the limbus . It is becoming increasingly apparent that the behaviour of these stem cells and their ability to respond to the needs of the tissue are closely linked to their immediate microenvironment the stem cell niche . Increasing understanding of the structural features of this niche and the signalling networks that they coordinate is required to enhance the therapeutic application of these cells in the treatment of limbal stem cell deficiency . Importantly an improved characterisation of the hierarchy of limbal epithelial progenitors using both new and old putative markers will enable a greater appreciation for the effects of many of these limbal niche factors on stem cell fate .

@highlight Corneal epithelial cells are primarily derived from cells originating in the limbal epithelium.
@highlight Niche integrity is required for repopulation of the limbus with progenitors following selective removal of limbal epithelium.
@highlight The canonical Wnt catenin signalling pathway is a key regulator of stem cell characteristics of the LESCs
@highlight The relatively reduced stiffness of limbal tissue represents a novel niche factor in the regulation of LESC fate.
@highlight Rather than representing a single population of cells LESCs may exist in separate but cooperative subpopulations.
