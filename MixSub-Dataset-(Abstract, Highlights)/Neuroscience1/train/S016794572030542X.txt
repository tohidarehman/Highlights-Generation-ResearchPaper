 The purpose of this study was to use polynomial regression analyses to examine the torque and power velocity relationships and calculate and compare the vertices of these nonlinear models and how they relate to measurements of muscle size and maximal strength between male and female children and adolescents during maximal isokinetic leg extension muscle actions . Sixteen children

@highlight Quadratic models best characterize the torque and power velocity relationships.
@highlight Adolescents produce greater torque and power at high velocities than children.
@highlight Isokinetic torque and power may depend more on maximal strength than muscle size.
