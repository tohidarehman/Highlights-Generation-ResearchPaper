 Attentional bias to threat has been implicated in both internalizing and externalizing disorders . This study utilizes event related potentials to examine early stages of perceptual attention to threatening versus neutral faces among a sample of 200 children ages 68 years from a low income urban community . Although both internalizing and externalizing symptoms were associated with processing biases the nature of the bias differed between these two symptom domains . Internalizing symptoms were associated with heightened early attentional selection and later perceptual processing of fearful faces . In contrast externalizing symptoms were associated with reduced early attentional selection of fearful faces and enhanced perceptual processing of neutral faces possibly indicative of a hostile interpretation bias for ambiguous social cues . These results provide insight into the distinct cognitive affective processes that may contribute to the etiology and maintenance of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology .

@highlight Internalizing symptoms correlate with greater P1 P2 amplitudes to fearful faces.
@highlight Externalizing symptoms correlate with reduced P1 amplitudes to fearful faces.
@highlight Externalizing symptoms correlate with greater P2 amplitudes to neutral faces.
@highlight Symptom associations are evident within the first 100ms of face processing.
@highlight These associations emerge virtually as soon as faces are registered in the cortex.
