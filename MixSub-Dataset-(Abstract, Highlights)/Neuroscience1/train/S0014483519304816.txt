 Age related macular degeneration is a complex disease with multiple genetic and environmental risk factors . In the age of molecular genetics many investigators have established a link between genes and development or progression of the disease . This later evolved to determine whether phenotypic features of AMD have distinct genetic profiles . Molecular genetics have subsequently been introduced as factors in risk assessment models increasing the predictive value of these tools . Models seek to predict either development or progression of disease and different AMD related genes aid our understanding of these respective features . Several investigators have attempted to link molecular genetics with treatment response but results and their clinical significance vary . Ocular and systemic biomarkers may interact with established genes promising future routes of ongoing clinical assessment . Our understanding of AMD molecular genetics is not yet sufficient to recommend routine testing despite its utility in the research setting . Clinicians must be wary of misusing population based risk models from genetic and biomarker associations as they are not necessarily relevant for individual counseling . This review addresses the known uses of predictive genetics and suggests future directions .

@highlight We continue to explore the genetic architecture that underlies the development of age related macular degeneration AMD .
@highlight Genetics based risk models for the onset of AMD differ from those that predict the risk of AMD progression.
@highlight Genetic profiling of individuals who may benefit from nutritional supplements has been shown to be unwarranted at this time.
@highlight Molecular genetic variants in the future may have value in guiding current therapies with anti VEGF medications.
@highlight This brief review addresses these issues and the current limitations of molecular genetics for the precision care of AMD.
