 The emergence of cultural differences in face scanning is thought to be shaped by social experience . However previous studies mainly investigated eye movements of adults and little is known about early development . The current study recorded eye movements of British and Japanese infants and adults who were presented with static and dynamic faces on screen . Cultural differences were observed across all age groups with British participants exhibiting more mouth scanning and Japanese individuals showing increased central face scanning for dynamic stimuli . Age related influences independent of culture were also revealed with a shift from eye to mouth scanning between 10 and 16 months while adults distributed their gaze more flexibly . Against our prediction no age related increases in cultural differences were observed suggesting the possibility that cultural differences are largely manifest by 10 months of age . Overall the findings suggest that individuals adopt visual strategies in line with their cultural background from early in infancy pointing to the development of a highly adaptive face processing system that is shaped by early sociocultural experience .

@highlight We compare face scanning patterns in British and Japanese infants and adults.
@highlight We investigate whether cultural differences become more distinct with age.
@highlight Age and culture independently modulated scanning of static and dynamic faces.
@highlight Cultural differences in face scanning emerge within the first year of life.
@highlight Scanning strategies are in line with cultural background and stage in development.
