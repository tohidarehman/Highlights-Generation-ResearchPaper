 To describe the location and morphometric characteristics of the human limbal lymphatic vasculature and its relation to the marginal corneal vascular arcades . confocal microscopic imaging and immunofluorescence double staining for CD 31 and D2 40 of histological en face sections using 12 preserved human cadaveric corneoscleral discs were performed followed by a semi automated morphometric analysis of the two dimensional vascular network architecture . CM confirmed the presence of 2 distinct vascular networks . The haematic limbal vascular complex extended further into the cornea forming typical MCAs . The lymphatic limbal vascular complex was peripheral from the termination of Bowman s layer and was also found to be peripheral to and deeper than the HLVC . LLVC and HLVC were significantly different with respect to vessel diameter segment length and wall thickness . The lymphatic vasculature of the human corneoscleral limbal region displays specific morphometric features that allow its differentiation from haematic vessels using CM .

@highlight Confocal microscopy lacks validation to image the limbal lymphvasculature.
@highlight Correlating confocal and immunofluorescence microscopy validates lymphatic imaging.
@highlight We describe en face morphological parameters to reliably identify limbal lymphatic vessels using confocal microscopy.
