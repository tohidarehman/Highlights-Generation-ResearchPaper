 Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability in the US . Neural stem progenitor cells persist in the adult brain and represent a potential cell source for tissue regeneration and wound healing after injury . The Notch signaling pathway is critical for embryonic development and adult brain injury response . However the specific role of Notch signaling in the injured brain is not well characterized . Our previous study has established a Notch1CR2 GFP reporter mouse line in which the Notch1CR2 enhancer directs GFP expression in NSPCs and their progeny . In this study we performed closed head injury in the Notch1CR2 GFP mice to study the response of injury activated NSPCs . We show that CHI induces neuroinflammation cell death and the expression of typical TBI markers validating the animal model . In addition CHI induces cell proliferation in GFP cells expressing NSPC markers e.g . Notch1 and Nestin . A significant higher percentage of GFP astrocytes and GABAergic neurons was observed in the injured brain with no significant change in oligodendrocyte lineage between the CHI and sham animal groups . Since injury is known to activate astrogliosis our results suggest that injury induced GFP NSPCs preferentially differentiate into GABAergic neurons . Our study establishes that Notch1CR2 GFP transgenic mouse is a useful tool for the study of NSPC behavior in vivo after TBI . Unveiling the potential of NSPCs response to TBI will identify new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of brain trauma .
