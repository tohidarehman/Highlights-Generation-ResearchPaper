 Transient potential receptor vanilloid 4 is an ion channel responsible for sensing osmotic and mechanical signals which in turn regulates calcium signaling across cell membranes . TRPV4 is widely expressed throughout the body and plays an important role in normal physiological function as well as different pathologies however its role in the eye is not well known . In the eye TRPV4 is expressed in various tissues such as the retina corneal epithelium ciliary body and the lens . In this review we provide an overview on TRPV4 structure activation mutations and summarize the current knowledge of TRPV4 function and signaling mechanisms in various locations throughout the eye as well as its role in ocular diseases such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy . Based on the available data we highlight the therapeutic potential of TRPV4 as well as the shortcomings of current research . Finally we provide future perspectives on the implications of targeting TRPV4 to treat various ocular pathologies .

@highlight TRPV4 is expressed in various cells and tissues of the eye.
@highlight TRPV4 is mechanosensor and regulates ion and water homeostasis in the eye.
@highlight TRPV4 modulates intraocular pressure and involved in glaucoma.
@highlight TRPV4 is implicated in ischemia induced neovascularization and diabetic retinopathy.
