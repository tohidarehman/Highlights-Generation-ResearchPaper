 The cornea is an avascular transparent ocular tissue that serves as a refractive and protective structure for the eye . Over 90 of the cornea is composed of a collagenous rich extracellular matrix within the stroma with the other 10 composed by the corneal epithelium and endothelium layers and their corresponding supporting collagen layers at the anterior and posterior cornea respectively . Due to its prominent role in corneal structure tissue engineering approaches to model the human cornea

@highlight 3 dimensional corneal tissue models more closely re capitulate the human cornea.
@highlight Co culture approaches can be applied to develop a full thickness cornea
@highlight Advances in bioprinting have allowed the development of a printed human cornea.
@highlight Vitamin C promotes significant collagen deposition by corneal fibroblasts
@highlight Self assembled stromal models generate a 65m thick matrix over 11 weeks.
