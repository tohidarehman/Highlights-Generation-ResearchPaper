 To determine whether the CD27 CD70 pathway plays a significant role in corneal allograft rejection by investigating the effect of blocking the CD27 CD70 pathway by anti CD70 antibody on corneal allograft survival . Orthotopic penetrating keratoplasty was performed using C57BL 6 donor grafts and BALB c recipients . Expression of CD27 and CD70 on rejected cornea was examined by immunohistochemistry . Corneal transplant recipients received intraperitoneal injection of anti CD70 antibody or control rat IgG . Alloreactivity was measured by mixed lymphoid reaction in recipients administered control rat IgG and those administered anti CD70 antibody . Corneal expression of IFN and IL 12 was also examined in both groups . Graft opacity was assessed over an 8 week period and graft survival was evaluated using Kaplan Meier survival curves . Proportion of CD4 CD4 The CD27 CD70 pathway plays a significant role in corneal allograft rejection by initiating alloreactive Th1 cells and preserving memory T cells . Anti CD70 antibody administration prolongs corneal allograft survival indicating the potential therapeutic effect of CD27 CD70 pathway blockade on corneal allograft rejection .

@highlight CD27 and CD70 were expressed in the rejected cornea.
@highlight Anti CD70 antibody reduced allogeneic T cell reaction and prolonged corneal allograft survival.
