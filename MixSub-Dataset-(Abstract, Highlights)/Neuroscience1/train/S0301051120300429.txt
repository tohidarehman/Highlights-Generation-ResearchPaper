 High uric acid is associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease both of which occur disproportionately among African Americans . High UA also predicts greater blood pressure reactivity responses to acute social stress . However whether UA itself shows reactivity in response to stress is unknown . We evaluated salivary uric acid and blood pressure reactivity in response to acute social stress . Healthy African Americans

@highlight Salivary uric acid shows reactivity in response to acute social stress.
@highlight Salivary uric acid predicts blood pressure reactivity to acute social stress.
@highlight Uric acid reactivity may be critical to understanding hypertension.
