 Medial forebrain bundle deep brain stimulation has anti depressant effects clinically and in depression models . Currently therapeutic mechanisms of MFB DBS or how stimulation parameters acutely impact neurotransmitter release particularly dopamine are unknown . Experimentally MFB DBS has been shown to evoke dopamine response in healthy controls but not yet in a rodent model of depression . The study investigated the impact of clinically used stimulation parameters on the dopamine induced response in a validated rodent depression model and in healthy controls . The stimulation induced dopamine response in Flinders Sensitive Line FSL Linear mixed model analysis showed significant impact in both models following MFB DBS both at 130 and 60Hz with 100s pulse width in inducing dopamine response . Furthermore at 130Hz the evoked dopamine responses were different across the groups at the different pulse widths . The differential impact of MFB DBS on the induced dopamine response including different response patterns at given pulse widths is suggestive of physiological and anatomical divergence in the MFB in the pathological and healthy state . Studying how varying stimulation parameters affect the physiological outcome will promote a better understanding of the biological substrate of the disease and the possible anti depressant mechanisms at play in clinical MFB DBS .

@highlight MFB DBS evoked dopamine release in the Nucleus Accumbens.
@highlight Evoked release profiles were different across the depression model and controls.
@highlight Diverging release profile likely due to physiological anatomical differences in the MFB.
