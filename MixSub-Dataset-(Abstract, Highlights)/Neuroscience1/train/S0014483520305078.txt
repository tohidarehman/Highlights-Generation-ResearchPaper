 It is reported that Ischemia and reperfusion damage can lead to retinal ganglion cell death and neurodegeneration which in turn can lead to irreversible vision loss . In this study we sought to understand the neuroprotective effect of resveratrol the important activator of sirtuin1 on RGC survival in I R damage model and the molecular mechanism that mediate this effect . Our results show that resveratrol could reverse axonal swelling holes and the chaos of the nucleus in axons of RGCs caused by I R. At the same time resveratrol could also reverse the activation of retinal astrocytes and the loss of RGCs caused by I R. Resveratrol increased the expression of SIRT1 while decreasing the phosphorylation of N terminal kinase . SP600125 decreased the phosphorylation of JNK while increasing the expression of SIRT1 indicating that SIRT1 and JNK can interact with each other . Simultaneous administration of resveratrol and sirtinol neither increased the expression of SIRT1 nor decreased the phosphorylation of JNK indicating that resveratrol affects the phosphorylation of JNK by SIRT1 . In total our research shows that resveratrol treatment significantly reduces apoptosis and axonal degeneration of RGCs and this protection is partly mediated through the SIRT1 JNK pathway .

@highlight Retinal I R injury causes damage to both RGCs and their axons.
@highlight SIRT1 and JNK protein can interact with each other.
@highlight Resveratrol protected rat RGC axons damage by inhibiting phosphorylation of JNK proteins through SIRT1.
