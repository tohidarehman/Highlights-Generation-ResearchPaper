 Whilst modern awake intraoperative mapping has been widely accepted and implemented in the last decades in neuro oncology sparse reports have been published on the safety and efficiency of this approach in epilepsy surgery . This article reports four cases with different locations of epileptogenic zones as examples of possible safe and efficient resections . The results of the resections on seizure control were Engel 1 in all cases and no patient experienced significant neurological deficits . The discussion focuses on aspects of the future of epilepsy surgery in a hodotopical paradigm .

@highlight Awake craniotomy is an alternative when the epilepsy focus is adjacent to eloquent cortex.
