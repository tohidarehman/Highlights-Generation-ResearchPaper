 Traumatic brain injury is one of the most common causes of death and disability worldwide . We investigated whether inhibition of p53 using pifithrin or PFT provides neuroprotective effects via p53 transcriptional dependent or independent mechanisms respectively . Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to controlled cortical impact TBI followed by the administration of PFT or PFT at 5h after TBI . Brain contusion volume as well as sensory and motor functions were evaluated at 24h after TBI . TBI induced impairments were mitigated by both PFT and PFT . Fluoro Jade C staining was used to label degenerating neurons within the TBI induced cortical contusion region that together with Annexin V positive neurons were reduced by PFT . Double immunofluorescence staining similarly demonstrated that PFT significantly increased HO 1 positive neurons and mRNA expression in the cortical contusion region as well as decreased numbers of 4 hydroxynonenal positive cells . Levels of mRNA encoding for p53 autophagy mitophagy anti oxidant anti inflammatory related genes and proteins were measured by RT qPCR and immunohistochemical staining respectively . PFT but not PFT significantly lowered p53 mRNA expression . Both PFT and PFT lowered TBI induced pro inflammatory cytokines mRNA levels as well as TBI induced autophagic marker localization . Finally treatment with PFT mitigated TBI induced declines in mRNA levels of PINK 1 and SOD2 . Our data suggest that both PFT and PFT provide neuroprotective actions through regulation of oxidative stress neuroinflammation autophagy and mitophagy mechanisms and that PFT in particular holds promise as a TBI treatment strategy .

@highlight Neuronal apoptosis in TBI engages separate transcriptional and mitochondrial p53 pathways.
@highlight Inactivation of either pathway mitigates neuronal loss neuroinflammation behavior deficits.
@highlight Inactivation of the p53 direct mitochondrial pathway provides greater benefits.
