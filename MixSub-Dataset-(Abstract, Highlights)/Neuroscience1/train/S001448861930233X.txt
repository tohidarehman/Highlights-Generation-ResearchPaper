 Muscular dystrophies are a group of genetic muscle disorders that cause progressive muscle weakness and degeneration . Within this group Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common and one of the most severe . DMD is an X chromosome linked disease that occurs to 1 in 3500 to 1 in 5000 boys . The cause of DMD is a mutation in the dystrophin gene whose encoded protein provides both structural support and cell signaling capabilities . So far there are very limited therapeutic options available and there is no cure for this disease . In this review we discuss the existing cell therapy research especially stem cell based which utilize myoblasts satellite cells bone marrow cells mesoangioblasts and CD133 cells . Finally we focus on human pluripotent stem cells which hold great potential in treating DMD . hPSCs can be used for autologous transplantation after being specified to a myogenic lineage . Over the last few years there has been a rapid development of isolation as well as differentiation techniques in order to achieve effective transplantation results of myogenic cells specified from hPSCs . In this review we summarize the current methods of hPSCs myogenic commitment differentiation and describe the current status of hPSC derived myogenic cell transplantation .

@highlight Myogenic progenitor cells could provide a source for cell therapy for DMD to regenerate and replace the diseased tissue
@highlight An orchestration of signaling molecules directing the lineage determination sets the basis for PSC differentiation
@highlight There is a need to develop more cell therapy options e.g iPSC for DMD due to limited success of current ones
@highlight The review describes the most recent studies of hiPSC muscle lineage specification and the potential of their application
