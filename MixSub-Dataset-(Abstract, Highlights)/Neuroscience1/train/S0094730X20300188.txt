 Developmental stuttering is a frequent neurodevelopmental disorder with a complex neurobiological basis . Robust neural markers of stuttering include imbalanced activity of speech and motor related brain regions and their impaired structural connectivity . The dynamic interaction of cortical regions is regulated by the cortico basal ganglia thalamo cortical system with the supplementary motor area constituting a crucial cortical site . The SMA integrates information from different neural circuits and manages information about motor programs such as self initiated movements motor sequences and motor learning . Abnormal functioning of SMA is increasingly reported in stuttering and has been recently indicated as an additional

@highlight Abnormal SMA functioning is evident in DS it may be a neural marker of stuttering.
@highlight The role of SMA in stuttering has not been fully clarified.
@highlight The available evidence highlights the role of the SMA in DS.
