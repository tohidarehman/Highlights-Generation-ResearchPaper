 Myofibroblast transformation of human Tenon s fibroblasts severely challenges the outcome of glaucoma filtration surgery . epigallocatechin 3 gallate is considered as a potential reagent to overcome this issue for its anti fibrosis effect on various human diseases but it is unclear on the fibrosis of Tenon s fibroblasts . This study was conducted to investigate the effect of EGCG on TGF 1 induced myofibroblast transformation of human Tenon s fibroblasts . The human Tenon s fibroblasts were incubated in the medium containing 10ng mL TGF 1 and subsequently treated with EGCG or mitomycin C . The cell proliferation and migration were analyzed . The expression of alpha smooth muscle actin type I collagen and p Smad2 3 were also evaluated . It showed that EGCG and MMC strongly inhibited the elevation in cell number in tissue explants compared to the tissues treated with TGF 1 alone . Scratch Wound assay showed that 48h after TGF 1 induction only 10 of the wound width remained . But cells treated with EGCG still showed over 93 wound width . Further EGCG effectively inhibited TGF 1 induced expression of SMA and Col I as well as phosphorylation of Smad2 3 in Tenon s fibroblasts . Altogether we concluded that EGCG suppressed the myofibroblast transformation in Tenon s fibroblasts through inactivating TGF 1 Smad signaling . These findings demonstrate that EGCG can be considered as one of the possible antifibrotic reagents for preventing postoperative scarring in glaucoma filtration surgery .

@highlight EGCG markedly attenuates the proliferation and migration of Tenon s fibroblasts.
@highlight EGCG inhibits TGF 1 induced myofibroblast transition in Tenon s fibroblasts.
@highlight EGCG is a potential reagent against postoperative scarring in glaucoma surgery.
