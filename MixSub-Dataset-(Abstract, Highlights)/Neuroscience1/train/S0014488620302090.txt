 Soldiers are often exposed to more than one traumatic brain injury over the course of their service . In recent years more attention has been drawn to the increased risk of neurological deficits caused by the blast plus polytrauma which typically is a blast trauma combined with other forms of TBI . In this study we investigated the behavioral and neuronal deficits resulting from a blast plus injury involving a mild moderate blast followed by a mild blunt trauma using the fluid percussion injury model . We identified that the blast injury predisposed the brain to increased cognitive deficits chronic ventricular enlargement increased neurodegeneration at acute time points and chronic neuronal loss . Interestingly a single blast and single blunt injury differed in their onset and manifestation of cognitive and regional neuronal loss . We also identified the presence of cleaved RIP1 from caspase 8 mediated apoptosis in the blunt injury while the blast injury did not activate immediate apoptosis but led to decreased hilar neuronal survival over time .

@highlight Blast exposure predisposed the brain to increased neurological deficits on a subsequent blunt traumatic brain injury TBI .
@highlight Blast and blunt TBI differed in the development of neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits.
@highlight Blast TBI resulted in chronic hilar neuronal loss numbers similar to blunt TBI.
