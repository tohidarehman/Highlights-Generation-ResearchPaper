 Language decline has been associated with healthy aging and with various neurodegenerative conditions making it challenging to differentiate among these conditions . This study examined the utility of linguistic measures derived from a short narrative language sample for 1 identifying language characteristics and cut off scores to differentiate between healthy aging Primary Progressive Aphasia Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimers dementia and 2 differentiating among PPA variants in which language is the primary impairment . Participants were 25 neurologically healthy English speakers 20 individuals with MCI 20 with AD and 26 with PPA . Narrative language samples of the Cookie Theft Picture of persons with healthy aging MCI and AD were retrospectively obtained from the DementiaBank database word retrieval and sentence grammaticality . PPA and AD groups did not differ on language measures . Agrammatic PPA participants scored lower than logopenic and semantic PPA groups on several measures while logopenic and semantic PPA did not differ on any measures . Measures derived from brief language samples and analyzed using mostly automated methods are clinically useful in differentiating PPA from healthy aging and MCI and agrammatic PPA from other variants . The sensitivity and specificity of these measures is modest and can be improved when coupled with clinical presentation .

@highlight PPA scores are lower than healthy adults and MCI on fluency word retrieval and grammaticality.
@highlight PPA and AD groups did not differ on language measures.
@highlight Agrammatic PPA scores are lower than logopenic and semantic PPA on rate mean length and verbs utterance.
