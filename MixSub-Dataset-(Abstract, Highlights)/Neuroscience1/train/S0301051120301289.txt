 Previous work has shown that autonomic responses to choice feedback can predict subsequent decision making . In this study we tested whether skin conductance responses and heart rate decelerations following the presentation of choice outcomes predict Iowa Gambling Task performance in nonclinical participants

@highlight Skin conductance responses SCRs to outcomes predicted advantageous decision making.
@highlight Heart rate deceleration was sensitive to outcomes but did not predict performance.
@highlight SCRs were linked to loss aversion and learning rate parameters in a learning model.
