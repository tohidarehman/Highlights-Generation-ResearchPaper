 Chronic stress during childhood negatively impacts cognition and physical and mental health . Exposure to stressors over time can cause hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis dysregulation leading to abnormal stress hormone levels which can be reflected in hair cortisol concentration and hair dehydroepiandrosterone concentration . Although the use of HCC and DHEA to measure chronic stress in children is increasing their effects on cognition remain unexplored . Accordingly we aimed to investigate the associations of HCC DHEA and their ratio with measures of executive function in a sample of kindergarten children

@highlight Hair concentrations of DHEA positively predicted cognitive flexibility scores.
@highlight The negative linear relationship between HCC and WM approached significance.
@highlight No evidence for a curvilinear association between HCC and measures of EF.
