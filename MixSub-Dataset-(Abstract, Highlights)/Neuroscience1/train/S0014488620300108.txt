 Physical exercise can reduce the cognitive decline associated with traumatic brain injury yet little is known about the optimal administration schedules . Here different protocols of voluntary wheel running were evaluated for their effects on object recognition memory neuroprotection NeuN

@highlight Early and delayed voluntary wheel running reduce memory deficits after TBI in rats.
@highlight Early exercise attenuates hippocampal microglial reactivity and neuron loss.
@highlight Restored neurogenesis mediates memory recovery by close to training exercise.
@highlight Moderate amounts of daily exercise lead to the highest neurogenesis levels.
