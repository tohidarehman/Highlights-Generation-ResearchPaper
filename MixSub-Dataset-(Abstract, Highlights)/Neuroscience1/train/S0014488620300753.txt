 A variety of barriers ensures the protection of the peripheral nervous system from noxious blood borne or surrounding stimuli . In this review anatomy and functioning of the blood nerve barrier and the blood DRG barrier will be presented and key tight junction proteins described ZO 1 claudin 1 3 5 11 12 19 occludin and tricellulin . Different diseases can lead to or be accompanied by nerve barrier disruption impairment of nerve barriers in turn worsens pathology . Peripheral nerve injury diabetic neuropathy and inflammatory polyneuropathy cause an increased permeability of BNB and BDB . Knowledge and understanding of these mechanisms might ultimately lead to the invention of drugs to control barrier function and help ameliorating neurological diseases .

@highlight Both blood nerve barrier BNB and blood DRG barrier BDB are crucial in maintaining homeostasis of the peripheral nerve.
@highlight Tight junction proteins have distinct localization and functions in these barriers.
@highlight Neuropathies of different etiologies involve breakdown of BNB and or BDB.
