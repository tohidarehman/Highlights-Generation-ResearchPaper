 Alzheimer s disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus have a common pathology . Both diseases are characterized by local deposition of amyloid proteins in the brain or islet organ but their phenotypes and clinical manifestation vary widely . Although the sources of islet amyloid polypeptide and amyloid beta are independent their fibrillar sequences are highly homologous . The prevalence of AD in T2DM populations is considerably higher than that in the normal population but a mechanistic linkage remains elusive . Therefore the present study aimed to explore the effects of A42 deposition in the brain on the persistently expression of human IAPP . Additionally cognitive ability synaptic plasticity the state of neural stem cells and mitochondrial function were evaluated at 2 or 6months after stereotaxically injected the oligomer A

@highlight hIAPP generated from pancreatic islet deposits in hippocampus of hIAPP transgenic mice.
@highlight Exogenous A
@highlight interacted with hIAPP in hippocampus and aggravated the amyloid deposition with aging in hIAPP transgenic mice.
@highlight Interaction of A
@highlight and hIAPP reduced synapse and adult stem cells in hippocampus.
@highlight Interaction of A
@highlight and hIAPP caused dysfunction of mitochondrial in vivo and in vitro.
