 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the optic nerve head lamina cribrosa retina and choroid in school age children using spectral domain optical coherence tomography and to assess these structural parameters in relation to age axial length and refractive error . Healthy children ages 11.152.62 years underwent cycloplegic autorefraction biometry and SD OCT imaging in both eyes . Images were analyzed using custom written programs in MATLAB after adjustment for lateral magnification . Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness retinal and choroidal thicknesses Bruch s membrane opening area minimum rim width and anterior lamina cribrosa surface depth were determined and analyzed with age axial length and refraction . Results show that axial length increased and refractive error became more myopic with increasing age R

@highlight Bruch s membrane opening area is larger in myopic children compared to non myopic children.
@highlight Minimum rim width and anterior lamina cribrosa surface depth are not associated with age axial length or refraction.
@highlight Foveal retinal thickness is significantly associated with age.
@highlight Once corrected for lateral magnification rNFL thickness does not demonstrate thinning with increasing axial length.
@highlight Findings provide evidence that ocular structures undergo remodeling with normal eye growth and during myopia development.
