 Following injury sensory axons locally translate mRNAs that encode proteins needed for the response to injury locally and through retrograde signaling and for regeneration . In this study we addressed the mechanism and role of axotomy induced intra axonal translation of the ER chaperone Calreticulin . In vivo peripheral nerve injury increased Calreticulin levels in sensory axons . Using an in vitro model system of sensory neurons amenable to mechanistic dissection we provide evidence that axotomy induces local translation of Calreticulin through PERK mediated phosphorylation of eIF2 by a mechanism that requires both 5 and 3UTRs elements in Calreticulin mRNA . ShRNA mediated depletion of Calreticulin or inhibition of PERK signaling increased axon retraction following axotomy . In contrast expression of axonally targeted but not somatically restricted Calreticulin mRNA decreased retraction and promoted axon regeneration following axotomy in vitro . Collectively these data indicate that the intra axonal translation of Calreticulin in response to axotomy serves to minimize the ensuing retraction and overexpression of axonally targeted Calreticulin mRNA promotes axon regeneration .
