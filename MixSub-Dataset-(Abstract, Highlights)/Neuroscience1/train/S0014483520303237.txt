 This work sought to compare aqueous angiographic segmental patterns with bead based methods which directly visualize segmental trabecular meshwork tracer trapping . Additionally segmental protein expression differences between aqueous angiographic derived low and high outflow human TM regions were evaluated . Post mortem human eyes were perfused with fluorescent tracers indocyanine green and or fluorescent microspheres . After angiographic imaging peri limbal low and high angiographic flow regions were marked . Aqueous angiographic segmental outflow patterns were similar to fluorescent microsphere TM trapping segmental patterns . TM was dissected from low and high flow areas and processed for immunofluorescence or Western blot and compared . Versican expression was relatively elevated in low flow regions while MMP3 and collagen VI were relatively elevated in high flow regions . TGF 2 thrombospondin 1 TGF receptor1 and TGF downstream proteins such as smooth muscle actin were relatively elevated in low flow regions . Additionally fibronectin levels were unchanged but the EDA isoform that is associated with fibrosis was relatively elevated in low flow regions . These results show that segmental aqueous angiographic patterns are reflective of underlying TM molecular characteristics and demonstrate increased pro fibrotic activation in low flow regions . Thus we provide evidence that aqueous angiography outflow visualization the only tracer outflow imaging method available to clinicians is in part representative of TM biology .

@highlight Aqueous Angiography AA is capable of visualizing segmental aqueous humor outflow AHO in living human eyes.
@highlight AA segmental AHO patterns matched that of bead based methods which trapper tracers in the trabecular meshwork TM .
@highlight AA determined high and low flow TM regions showed segmental changes in pro fibrotic markers.
