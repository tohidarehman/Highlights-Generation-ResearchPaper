 Successful performance of balance related activities requires the effective integration of sensory cognitive and motor processes that can be affected by age related changes . Of these age related sensory changes the effects of declines in hearing on balance have not been well studied despite the fact that hearing loss has now been acknowledged as a significant risk factor for falls . The goal of this study was to evaluate age related differences in a standing while listening task within increasingly challenging conditions resembling those that are often encountered in realistic everyday situations .

@highlight Age related declines in hearing make listening more demanding particularly in noisy conditions.
@highlight High listening demands may be detrimental to other concurrent tasks such as balance.
@highlight Here listening while balancing was performed under realistic and increasingly challenging conditions.
@highlight Results indicate that dual task costs to posture were higher with greater listening loads.
