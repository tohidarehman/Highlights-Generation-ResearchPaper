 Retinal signaling under dark adapted conditions is perturbed during early diabetes . Additionally dopamine the main neuromodulator of retinal light adaptation is diminished in diabetic retinas . However it is not known if this dopamine deficiency changes how the retina responds to increased light or dopamine . Here we determine whether light adaptation is impaired in the diabetic retina and investigate potential mechanism of impairment . Diabetes was induced in C57BL 6J male mice via 3 intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin and confirmed by blood glucose levels more than 200mg dL . After 6 weeks whole cell recordings of light evoked and spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents or excitatory postsynaptic currents were made from rod bipolar cells and ON sustained ganglion cells respectively . Light responses were recorded before and after D1 receptor activation or light adaptation background of 950 photonsm

@highlight Early diabetes causes retinal deficits in neuronal signaling.
@highlight These deficits include decreased bipolar cell inhibition and dopamine release.
@highlight Diabetes deficits increase dark and light adapted retinal ganglion cell excitation.
@highlight Neuronal signaling changes are not a result of loss of neurons.
@highlight These changes could lead to overexcitation and damage of retinal ganglion cells.
