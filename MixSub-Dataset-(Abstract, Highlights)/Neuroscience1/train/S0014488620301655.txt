 The present review explores the concept of learning within the context of neurorehabilitation after spinal cord injury . The aim of physical therapy and neurorehabilitation is to bring about a lasting change in functionto encourage learning . Traditionally it was assumed that the adult spinal cord is hardwiredimmutable and incapable of learning . Research has shown that neurons within the lower spinal cord can support learning after communication with the brain has been disrupted by means of a thoracic transection . Noxious stimulation can sensitize nociceptive circuits within the spinal cord engaging signal pathways analogous to those implicated in brain dependent learning and memory . After a spinal contusion injury pain input can fuel hemorrhage increase the area of tissue loss and undermine long term recovery . Neurons within the spinal cord are sensitive to environmental relations . This learning has a metaplastic effect that counters neural over excitation and promotes adaptive learning through an up regulation of brain derived neurotrophic factor . Exposure to rhythmic stimulation treadmill training and cycling also enhances the expression of BDNF and counters the development of nociceptive sensitization . SCI appears to enable plastic potential within the spinal cord by down regulating the Cl
