 Aerobic exercise has been shown to play a crucial role in preventing neurological diseases and improving cognitive function . In the present study we investigated the effect of treadmill training on retinal ganglion cells following optic nerve transection in adult rats . We exercised the rats on a treadmill for 5d week or placed control rats on static treadmills . After 3 weeks of exercise the left optic nerve of each rat was transected . After the surgery the rat was exercised for another week . The percentages of surviving RGCs in the axotomized eyes of inactive rats were 67 and 39 at 5 and 7 days postaxotomy respectively . However exercised rats had significant more RGCs at 5 and 7 days after axotomy . Moreover retinal brain derived neurotrophic factor protein levels were significantly upregulated in response to exercise compared with those in the axotomized eyes of inactive rats . Blocking BNDF signaling during exercise by intraperitoneal injections of ANA 12 a BDNF tropomyosin receptor kinase receptor antagonist reduced the number of RGCs in exercised rats to the level of RGCs in the inactive rats effectively abolishing the protection of RGCs afforded by exercise . The results suggest that treadmill training effectively rescues RGCs from neurodegeneration following optic nerve transection by upregulating the expression of BDNF .

@highlight Treadmill exercise increases ganglion cell GC survival at 7 days postaxotomy.
