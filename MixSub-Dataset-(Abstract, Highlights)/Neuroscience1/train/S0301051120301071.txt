 The study investigated auditory temporal processing on a tens of milliseconds scale that is the interval when two consecutive stimuli are processed either together or as distinct events . Distinctiveness is defined by ones ability to make correct order judgments of the presented sounds and is measured via the spatial temporal order judgement task .

@highlight Two latency windows emerged being sensitive to ISI change 150170 and 210230 ms .
@highlight TOJ thresholds correlated with amplitude change 210230 ms post stimulus.
@highlight The high threshold low performance group showed pronounced amplitude change.
