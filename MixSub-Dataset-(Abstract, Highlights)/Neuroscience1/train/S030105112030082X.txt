 Post traumatic stress disorder is characterised by alterations in the function of the autonomic nervous system . However it is unclear if this dysfunction is threat related or related to arousing stimuli in general . Pupillometry offers a simple non invasive measure of ANS activity that can separate parasympathetic and sympathetic arousal . Participants viewed images with emotional or neutral content 20 met diagnostic criteria for PTSD 28 were trauma exposed and 17 were controls . Initial pupil constriction was reduced for the PTSD group while dilation due to the emotional content of the image was greater in the PTSD group . Individuals with PTSD demonstrated enhanced physiological arousal to both threat related and positive images . The results suggest reduced parasympathetic arousal and increased sympathetic arousal in the autonomic nervous system which has been linked to a range of adverse health outcomes in PTSD .

@highlight The processing of emotive but trauma unrelated stimuli has not been studied in individuals with PTSD.
@highlight Changes in the size of the pupil while viewing emotive images were used to index autonomic nervous system responses.
@highlight Individuals with PTSD showed reduced pupil constriction to stimulus onset suggesting reduced parasympathetic arousal.
@highlight Individuals with PTSD showed greater pupil dilation to both threat related and happy images than controls.
@highlight Results suggest generalised hyperarousal and sensitivity to emotional stimuli in individuals with PTSD.
