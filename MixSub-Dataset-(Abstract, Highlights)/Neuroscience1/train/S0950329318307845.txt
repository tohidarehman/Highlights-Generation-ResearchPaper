 This study investigates consumer preference for sustainable food products and finds the classic phenomenon of preference reversal . Using contingent ranking and contingent valuation methods we investigate whether individuals rankings of a product are consistent with their willingness to pay . Results show that preference reversal exists for the evaluation of sustainable food products . Locally produced fresh produce receives the highest preference ranking while organic products receive the highest price premium . The incidence of preference reversal is not uniformly distributed among different groups of respondents . In general preference reversal is less frequent among respondents who are older and have a higher educational attainment . The results imply that preference reversal not only exists for subjects with explicit risks such as the lottery as indicated in the previous literature but also could occur for food products that consumers purchase on a regular basis in daily grocery shopping .
