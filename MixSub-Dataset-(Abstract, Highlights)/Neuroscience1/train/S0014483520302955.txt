 Our study aimed to investigate the differentially expressed circRNAs and their potential roles in orbital adipose connective tissue from patients with thyroid associated ophthalmopathy . The orbital adipose connective tissue samples from three TAO patients and three control individuals were collected for RNA sequencing after depletion of ribosomal RNA . Differentially expressed mRNAs and up regulated circRNAs were used for co expression analysis . Functional and pathway enrichment analysis were conducted for the up and down regulated mRNAs in the circRNA mRNA co expression network . Meanwhile circRNA miRNA interaction network was established by miRanda software . The expression levels of mRNAs and circRNAs in control and TAO samples were determined by qRT PCR . Among all the 16 329 circRNAs predicted from RNA sequencing data 163 circRNAs were differentially expressed in TAO samples . Besides 607 differentially expressed mRNAs were identified . The co expression analysis showed circRNA 14940 was correlated with CCND1 and TNXB while circRNA 10135 was correlated with PTGFR and circRNA 14936 was correlated with TNFRSF19 . The up regulated CCND1 participated in Wnt signaling pathway . The down regulated TNXB was involved in the ECM receptor interaction focal adhesion and PI3K Akt signaling pathway . PTGFR participated in neuroactive ligand receptor interaction and calcium signaling pathway . TNFRSF19 was involved in cytokine cytokine receptor interaction . In the interaction network circRNA 14936 could interact with hsa miR 103923p and circRNA 12367 could interact with hsa miR 12283p . Moreover the expression changes of MMP2 TNXB PTGFR CCND1 and TNFRSF19 as well as circRNA 14936 circRNA 14940 and circRNA 12367 were validated by qRT PCR . In conclusion the differentially expressed circRNAs might participate in pathogenesis of TAO and we speculated that circRNA 14940 CCND1 Wnt signaling pathway might be an important regulatory axis .
