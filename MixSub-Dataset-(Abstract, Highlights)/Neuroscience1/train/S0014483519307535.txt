 Corneal neovascularization can cause abnormal blood vessels to grow in the normally transparent and translucent cornea leading to various sight threatening eye diseases . microRNAs and circular RNAs are known to play essential roles in the regulation of numerous biological functions . It is urgently needed to understand the molecular mechanism of miRNAs and circular RNAs in the corneal neovascularization . We aimed to elucidate the role of a specific a circular RNA cZNF609 in the corneal neovascularization . cZNF609 and miR 184 levels were determined by RT qPCR . Luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay were conducted to verify the target of cZNF609 . The biological function of cZNF609 and miR 184 were assessed via cell proliferation migration and tube formation assays in vitro as well as the corneal suture model in vivo . The up regulation of cZNF609 and down regulation of miR 184 were observed during corneal neovascularization . cZNF609 acted as a miR 184 sponge to block miR 184 activity . Overexpression of miR 184 suppressed HCEKs cell proliferation migration in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo . The miR 184 mediated inhibition effect can be rescued through the re introduction of cZNF609 . Mechanically cZNF609 miR 184 interaction regulated the downstream Akt and VEGF signaling pathway . Intervention of cZNF609 and miR 184 may serve as a potential strategy for pathological corneal neovascularization treatment .
