 To investigate the optical transmittance and ultrastructure of small incision lenticule extraction derived lenticules preserved via three different methods . A total of 90 lenticules obtained from myopic patients undergoing SMILE surgery were divided into control and experimental groups . Fresh lenticules served as the control . The preserved lenticules of the experimental group were randomly divided into three subgroups according to different storage conditions anhydrous glycerol silicone oil and allochroic silica gel groups . Optical transmittance was evaluated histological changes were analysed by haematoxylin eosin staining and collagen fibril densities and necrotic response were assessed via transmission electron microscopy at 48h 14 days and 4 weeks . After storage for 4 weeks the mean percentage transmittance values in glycerol and silicone oil groups significantly decreased but the lenticules preserved in silica gel remained unchanged when compared with the control lenticules . In all the groups HE staining results showed a regular arrangement of collagen fibers with a few keratocytes and several cavitation bubbles . TEM revealed that the fibril densities in the glycerol group 273.7031.42 m All the three agents namely glycerol silicone oil and silica gel could be used for lenticule preservation . Silica gel facilitates better maintenance of optical transmittance than the other two agents .

@highlight This study compared optical transmittance and ultrastructure of SMILE derived lenticules subjected to three different preservative methods.
@highlight Glycerol silicone oil and silica gel could be used for lenticule preservation.
@highlight Silica gel facilitates better maintenance of optical transmittance.
