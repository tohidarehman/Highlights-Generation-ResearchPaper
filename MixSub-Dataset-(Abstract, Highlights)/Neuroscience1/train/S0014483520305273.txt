 Antibiotic resistance is increasing even in ocular pathogens therefore the interest towards antiseptics in Ophthalmology is growing . The aim of this study was to analyze the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy and the in vitro effects of an ophthalmic formulation containing hexamidine diisethionate 0.05 polyhexamethylene biguanide 0.0001 disodium edetate 0.01 dexpanthenol 5 and polyvinyl alcohol 1.25 on cultured human corneal and conjunctival cells . The in vitro antimicrobial activity was tested on

@highlight Topical antibiotic overuse increases microbial resistance.
@highlight Therefore the interest towards antiseptics is growing.
@highlight Keratosept ophthalmic solution showed a good antimicrobial activity in vitro.
@highlight Keratosept showed low toxicity on corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells.
