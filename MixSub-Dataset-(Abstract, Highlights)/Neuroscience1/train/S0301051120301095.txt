 Interoception concerns the perception of the bodys internal state . Despite the importance of this ability for health and aspects of higher order cognition its measurement remains problematic . Most studies of interoception employ one of two tasks the heartbeat counting or heartbeat discrimination task . These tasks are thought to index common abilities an assertion often used to justify the use of a single measure of cardiac interoception . However mixed findings regarding the relationship between performance on these tasks raises the question of whether they can be used interchangeably to assess interoceptive accuracy confidence and awareness . The present study employed a meta analytical approach to assess the association between these tasks . Pooled findings from 22 studies revealed a small relationship between accuracy scores on the measures . Additional analyses demonstrated a moderate relationship between confidence ratings but no association between measures of interoceptive awareness . These findings question the interchangeable use of the two tasks .

@highlight The relationship between heartbeat counting and discrimination remains unclear.
@highlight We took a meta analytical approach to assess the relationship between these tasks.
@highlight A small but significant relationship was observed between accuracy scores.
@highlight Confidence was moderately correlated but no relation was observed for awareness.
@highlight These results question the interchangeable use of the two tasks.
