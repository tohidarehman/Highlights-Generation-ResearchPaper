 Because environmental elements modify chronic pain development and endogenous mechanisms of pain control are still a great therapeutic source we investigated the effects of an early exposure to environmental enrichment in a translational model of neuropathic pain . Young male rats born and bred in an enriched environment which did not count on running wheel underwent chronic constriction injury of sciatic nerve . EE abolished neuropathic pain behavior 14days after CCI . Opioid receptors antagonism reversed EE analgesic effect . endorphin and met enkephalin serum levels were increased only in EE CCI group . Blockade of glucocorticoid receptors did not alter EE analgesic effect although corticosterone circulating levels were increased in EE animals . In the spinal cord EE controlled CCI induced serotonin increase . In DRG EE blunted the expression of ATF 3 after CCI . Surprisingly EE CCI group showed a remarkable preservation of sciatic nerve fibers compared to NE CCI group . This work demonstrated global effects induced by an EE protocol that explain in part the protective role of EE upon chronic noxious stimulation reinforcing the importance of endogenous mechanisms in the prevention of chronic pain development .

@highlight Early environmental enrichment EE attenuates nerve injury outcomes.
@highlight EE induces endorphin and met enkephalin systemic release after CCI.
@highlight EE controls spinal CCI induced serotonin increase.
@highlight Neuropathic markers are differentially expressed in enriched animals after CCI.
@highlight EE reduces CCI induced Wallerian degeneration.
