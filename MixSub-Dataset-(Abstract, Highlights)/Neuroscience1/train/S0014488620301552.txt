 Neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy remains the most important neurological problem of the newborn . Delays in diagnosing perinatal brain injuries are common preventing access to acute therapies . Therefore there is a critical need for therapeutic strategies that are beneficial when delivered beyond 24h after birth . Here we show that Leukemia Inhibitory Factor functions as an essential injury induced neurotrophic cytokine in the CNS and that non invasively administering LIF as late as 3days after a hypoxic ischemic insult improves neurological function . Using a mouse model of late preterm brain injury we show that astroglial and microglial macrophage reactivity to hypoxia ischemia was diminished at 3days of recovery but then exacerbated at 2weeks of recovery in LIF haplodeficient mice . There also were significantly more CD68 Iba 1 cells in the ipsilateral striatum in LIF Het mice compared to WT mice at 2weeks of recovery . This desynchronized glial response was accompanied by increased neuronal cell death in the striatum and neocortex hypomyelination increased extent of brain damage and diminished neurological function on sensorimotor tests . To our surprise injured LIF Het mice had 7 fold higher IGF 1 levels than injured WT mice at 3days after H

@highlight Brain damage is exacerbated after perinatal hypoxia ischemia in LIF Haplodeficient mice.
@highlight 1st demonstration of therapeutic efficacy of intranasally delivered LIF for a neurological disorder.
@highlight Intranasal LIF penetrates deep into the brain to activate survival promoting Stat 3 signaling.
@highlight Administering LIF intranaslally as late as 3days after injury prevents tertiary neurodegeneration.
@highlight Delayed intranasal LIF improves sensorimotor recovery.
