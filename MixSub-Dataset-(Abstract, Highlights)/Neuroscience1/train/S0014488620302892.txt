 Chemotherapy induced peripheral neurotoxicity represents one of the most relevant dose limiting side effects that can affect cancer patients treated with the common antineoplastic agents . Since the severity of neurotoxicity often leads to dose reduction or early cessation of chemotherapy the investigation of molecular mechanisms underlying chemotherapy induced peripheral neurotoxicity is an urgent clinical need in order to better understand its physiopathology and find effective strategies for neuroprotection . Several in vivo preclinical models of chemotherapy induced peripheral neurotoxicity have been developed but a great variability in mouse strain dose route of administration of the drug treatment schedule and assessment of neurotoxicity is observed between the different published studies making difficult the comparison and interpretation of their results . In many of these studies only behavioural tests are used as outcome measures while possible neurophysiological and neuropathological changes are not evaluated .

@highlight Different mouse models of oxaliplatin induced peripheral neurotoxicity are described.
@highlight Great variability exists among different mouse models.
@highlight Evaluation of the results are often limited to behavioural tests.
@highlight Multimodal assessment increases the reliability of animal models.
@highlight Animal models and investigation methods should be standardized between workgroups.
