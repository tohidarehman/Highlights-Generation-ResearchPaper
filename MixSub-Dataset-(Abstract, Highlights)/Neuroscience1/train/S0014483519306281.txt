 Multiple retinal cells harbor a circadian oscillator including retinal pigment epithelial cells . However little is known about the functions that are regulated by the RPE clock . The aim of this study was to investigate whether the circadian clock in the RPE regulates the transport of glucose and its glycolytic metabolic by product lactate . To that end we first characterized the mRNA expression profile of glucose and monocarboxylate transporters in ARPE 19cells . We found that

@highlight The
@highlight and
@highlight transporter genes are highly expressed in ARPE 19cells.
@highlight RPE monolayer organization is necessary for rhythmic transporter expression
@highlight POS incubation affects transporter expression in a time dependent manner.
@highlight RPE mediated transport is rhythmic for lactate but not for glucose.
