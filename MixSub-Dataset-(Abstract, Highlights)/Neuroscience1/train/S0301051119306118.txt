 Voice attractiveness plays a significant role in social interaction and mate choice . However how listeners perceive attractive voices and whether this process is mandatory is poorly understood . The current study explores this question using event related brain potentials . Participants listened to syllables spoken by male and female voices with high or low attractiveness while completing an implicit tone detection task or explicitly judging voice attractiveness . In both tasks attractive male voices elicited a larger N1 than unattractive voices . However an effect of voice attractiveness on the late positive complex was only seen in the explicit task but it was present to both same and opposite sex voices . Taken together voice attractiveness processing during early stages appears to be rapid and mandatory and related to mate selection whereas during later elaborated processing voice attractiveness is strategic and aesthetics based requiring attentional resources .

@highlight We shed light on the dynamics of brain activation reflecting vocal attractiveness processing.
@highlight Early ERPs suggest the detection of attractiveness relevant cues in voices is rapid.
@highlight Late ERPs show in depth evaluation of vocal attractiveness needs voluntary attention.
