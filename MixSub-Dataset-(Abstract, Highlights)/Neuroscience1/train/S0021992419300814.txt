 Well documented benefits of noise reduction technologies in laboratories do not always yield a significant difference in real world acoustic environments . Many possible reasons were proposed and studied to address this discrepancy . The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of different noise reduction strategies for cochlear implants in real world acoustic environments . Sixteen listeners were fit with hearing aid preprocessors with electrical outputs and cochlear implant speech processors receiving the electrical inputs . The preprocessors were programmed to 1 no noise reduction omnidirectional microphone 2 moderate noise reduction a combination of omnidirectional and adaptive directional microphone modes with modulation based noise reduction and 3 maximum noise reduction adaptive directional microphone in all frequency channels with NR . Listeners listened to sentences in a noisy caf a noisy restaurant and a quiet hotel lobby . They were instructed to rate the overall sound quality preference ease of listening speech intelligibility and listening comfort of sentences using a paired comparison categorical rating paradigm . Results indicate cochlear implant listeners had no microphone preference in quiet but they preferred adaptive directional microphones in noisy environments . The paired comparison categorical rating paradigm is a viable means to evaluate the benefits of signal processing strategies in real world acoustic environments .

@highlight CI listeners perceived better sound quality with adaptive directional microphone in noisy real world environments.
@highlight CI listeners preferred more aggressive form of directional mode in noisy environments.
@highlight The paired comparison categorical rating paradigm was a viable tool to assess directional benefits in real world environments.
@highlight It is beneficial to evaluate signal processing algorithms in multiple sound quality dimensions.
