 Bowman s layer lies immediately posterior to the epithelial basement membrane and anterior to the stroma proper in humans chickens quail zebra fish deer giraffe antelope California sea lions guinea pig and several other species . It is not found in dog wolf cat tiger lions rabbit pigs cows goats or horses . Developmental anomalies of Bowman s layer are rare but acquired damage to Bowman s layer or even complete destruction is frequently seen in advanced bullous keratopathy or Fuchs endothelial dystrophy . No detrimental effects of removal of Bowman s layer over the central 67mm of central cornea have been noted in millions of patients who ve had photorefractive keratectomy . Recent studies have suggested the randomly oriented collagen fibrils that make up Bowman s layer do not have a significant barrier function in modulating the passage of moderate to large sized proteins . It is hypothesized that Bowman s layer develops in the corneas of those species that have one because of cytokine mediated interactions occurring between corneal epithelial cells and underlying keratocytes including negative chemotactic and apoptotic effects on the keratocytes by low levels of cytokines such as interleukin 1 that are gradually released as epithelial cells die and slough during their normal development . A Bowman s like layer can generate around stromal epithelial plugs after radial keratotomy and possibly beneath the central corneal epithelial basement membrane many years after PRK .

@highlight Bowman s layer is present in some species and absent in others.
@highlight Bowman s layer is not a barrier to passage of large molecules.
@highlight A Bowman s like layer may regenerate after corneal surgery.
@highlight Bowman s layer likely maintained by ongoing epithelial stromal interactions.
