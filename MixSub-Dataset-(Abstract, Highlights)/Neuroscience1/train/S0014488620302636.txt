 mutations cause Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and lead to mechanistic target of rapamycin hyperactivation evidenced by hyperphosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein and 4 elongation factor binding protein 1 . Amino acid levels modulate mTOR dependent S6 and 4E BP1 phosphorylation in non neural cells but this has not been comprehensively investigated in neurons . The effects of AA levels on mTOR signaling and S6 and 4E BP1 phosphorylation were analyzed in
