 To characterize microRNAs and their possible roles in high myopia by using next generation sequencing . Aqueous humor samples were obtained from 25 highly myopic eyes and 25 cataract eyes at the onset of surgery . miRNA next generation sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were performed using RNA extracted from 30 samples . The remaining 20 samples were used for quantitative polymerase chain reaction validation of sequencing results . A total of 341 microRNAs were detected in the aqueous humor samples of highly myopic eyes 201 miRNAs were detected in the aqueous humor samples of cataractous control eyes . A total of 249 mature miRNAs and 17 novel miRNAs were differentially expressed during myopia . Possible pathways regulated by these aberrantly expressed miRNAs included the TNF MAPK PI3K Akt and HIF 1 signaling pathways . The relative expression patterns of hsa let 7i 5p hsa miR 1273p and hsa miR 985p were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction . The current study provided an overall view of miRNA profiling in the aqueous humor of highly myopic eyes . These profiles may be associated with myopia pathogenesis and are potential biomarkers .

@highlight microRNA profiles in human eyes have not been reported.
@highlight MiR 886 miR 369 miR 370 etc. were higher expressed in high myopia miR 10b miR 143 and miR 145 were suppressed.
@highlight Aberrantly expressed miRNAs are crucial for precise diagnosis prognosis and response predictions of myopia.
