 This study aimed to examine self body recognition in women with high and low weight and shape concerns . Thus the detection rate the reaction time and the perceptual threshold for recognizing ones own body in a morphed body were measured in n 25 women with HWSC and n 26 women with LWSC . Furthermore by using steady state visual evoked potentials neuronal correlates of body recognition were recorded . The perceptual threshold for recognizing ones own body was higher for women with HWSC in the case of a morph with a thinner body . No group differences emerged for morphs with obese or average weight bodies . The SSVEP amplitudes did not differentiate between ones own and another body in either group . The results suggest that for women with HWSC their negative body schemata might hamper recognition of their own body in a thinner morph . Otherwise self body recognition is similar in women with LWSC and HWSC .

@highlight Self body recognition was examined by morphs of ones own body and other bodies.
@highlight Women with high body concerns had a higher perceptual threshold for a thin morph.
@highlight Body recognition of women with high body concerns might be influenced by body image.
@highlight Otherwise body recognition was similar in women with high and low body concerns.
