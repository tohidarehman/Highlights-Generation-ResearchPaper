 Physico chemical properties of three cataract associated missense mutants of B crystallin were analyzed . The oligomers formed by the R11H mutant were smaller whereas the oligomers of the P20S and R56W mutants were larger than those of the wild type protein . The P20S mutant possessed lower thermal stability than the wild type HspB5 or two other HspB5 mutants . All HspB5 mutants were able to form heterooligomeric complexes with A crystallin a genuine component of eye lens . However the P20S and R56W mutants were less effective in the formation of these complexes and properties of heterooligomeric complexes formed by these mutants and HspB4 and analyzed by ion exchange chromatography were different from those formed by the wild type HspB5 and HspB4 . All HspB5 variants also heterooligomerized with another partner protein HspB6 . Specifically for the P20S mutant forming two distinct sizes of homooligomers only the smaller homooligomer population was able to interact with HspB6 . P20S and R56W mutants possessed lower chaperone like activity than the wild type HspB5 when UV irradiated

@highlight Cataract associated R11H P20S R56W mutants of B crystallin HspB5 were analyzed.
@highlight Mutation R11H decreases while P20S and R56W increase the size of HspB5 oligomers.
@highlight All mutations affect the interaction of HspB5 with its genuine partner HspB4.
@highlight P20S mutant has lower chaperone like activity in vitro than the wild type protein.
@highlight Effect of mutations correlates with their putative location in helical regions.
