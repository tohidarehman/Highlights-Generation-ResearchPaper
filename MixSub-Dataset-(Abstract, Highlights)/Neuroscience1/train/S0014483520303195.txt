 Leucine rich 2 glycoprotein 1 is involved in several pathophysiological processes including angiogenesis cutaneous wound repair and cancer metastasis . In this study we investigated the potential role and mechanism of LRG1 in corneal re epithelialisation and nerve regeneration in streptozotocin induced diabetic mice . We found decreased levels of LRG1 in the corneal epithelium after wounding in diabetic mice compared to normal controls . Hyperglycaemia downregulated the LRG1 expression in the corneal epithelium in vivo

@highlight Hyperglycemia downregulated the expression of Leucine rich 2 glycoprotein 1 LRG1 in corneal epithelial cells.
@highlight LRG1 accelerated corneal epithelial wound healing and nerve regeneration both in normal and diabetic mice.
@highlight LRG1 accelerated corneal re epithelialisation and nerve regeneration via upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase MMP 3 and MMP13.
@highlight LRG1 interacted with MMP3 and MMP13.
