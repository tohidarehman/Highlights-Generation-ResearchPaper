 The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is essential in basal ganglia motor circuits and has long been thought to contribute to cell death and degeneration in Parkinson s disease . While previous research has shown a significant role of NMDA and AMPA receptors in both excitotoxicity and PD the third class of ionotropic glutamate receptors kainate receptors have been less well studied . Given the expression of kainate receptor subunits GluK1 GluK3 in key PD related brain regions it has been suggested that GluK1 GluK3 may contribute to excitotoxic cell loss . Therefore the neuroprotective potential of the kainate receptor antagonist UBP310 in animal models of PD was investigated in this study . Stereological quantification revealed administration of UBP310 significantly increased survival of dopaminergic and total neuron populations in the substantia nigra pars compacta in the acute MPTP mouse model of PD . In contrast UBP310 was unable to rescue MPTP induced loss of dopamine levels or dopamine transporter expression in the striatum . Furthermore deletion of GluK1 GluK2 or GluK3 had no effect on MPTP or UBP310 mediated effects across all measures . Interestingly UBP310 did not attenuate cell loss in the midbrain induced by intrastriatal 6 OHDA toxicity . These results indicate UBP310 provides neuroprotection in the midbrain against MPTP neurotoxicity that is not dependent on specific kainate receptor subunits .

@highlight UBP310 protects dopaminergic neurons from MPTP neurotoxicity.
@highlight Single deletion of GluK1 GluK2 or GluK3 does not protect DA neurons from MPTP.
@highlight Single deletion of GluK1 GluK2 or GluK3 does not alter the effects of UBP310.
@highlight Suggests UBP310 does not mediate its effect via these receptor subunits alone.
