 The type of threat shown in an image influences the emotional salience of unpleasant images . Seventy four participants rated high threat moderate threat and neutral images featuring reptiles firearms or humans as electroencephalographic activity was recorded . The magnitude of P3b amplitudes coincided with the threat level of firearm and human images whereas scenes of attacking snakes and aimed handguns evoked more positive late positive component activity than non attacking or neutral versions of these same stimuli . The lateralised early posterior negativity in temporal occipital regions was most negative for firearms followed by reptiles and then humans while the midline EPN in occipital regions was most negative for reptiles followed by firearms and then humans . These findings imply late event related potential positivity is influenced by social relevance or the level of aggression displayed by the stimulus whereas stimulus type may be indexed by EPN modulation .

@highlight Different modulation observed for lateralised and midline EPN.
@highlight Human injury images evoked larger EPN N2 and LPC activity than non injured humans.
@highlight P3b modulation corresponded to threat level of firearm and human images.
@highlight LPC more positive for attacking snakes compared to severe injury or aimed handguns.
@highlight Attack forms of handguns and snakes greater LPC than passive snakes.
