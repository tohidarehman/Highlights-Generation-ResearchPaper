 Diabetic retinopathy is a microvascular complication of diabetes and one of the most common causes of blindness in active stage . This study is performed to explore the effects of microRNA 21 on retinal vascular endothelial cell viability and angiogenesis in rats with DR via the phosphatidylinositiol 3 kinase protein kinase B vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway by binding to phosphatase and tensin homolog

@highlight Roles of miR 21 in EC viability and angiogenesis of DR were studied.
@highlight MiR 21 targeted
@highlight and repressed its expression.
@highlight Increased miR 21 and reduced
@highlight expression were observed in rats with DR.
@highlight Increased angiogenesis was observed in retina of rats with DR.
@highlight Activated PI3K Akt VEGF axis induced VEGF mRNA transcription and expression.
