 The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of exosomes derived from platelet rich plasma in the regulation of the fibrogenic activity of Mller cells and the underlying mechanism . We studied the effects of PRP Exos on the fibrogenic activity of human retinal Mller cells in vitro . PRP Exos were isolated from the plasma of diabetic rats and normal control rats and then observed by transmission electron microscopy . After treatment with DM PRP Exos or Nor PRP Exos the proliferation and migration of hMCs were measured in vitro . Western blotting was conducted to assess the levels of fibrogenic molecules and activation of Yes associated protein and the PI3K Akt signalling pathway . In cultured hMCs DM PRP Exos but not Nor PRP Exos effectively increased the proliferative and migratory activities and improved connective tissue growth factor and fibronectin expression . Genetic and pharmacological suppression of YAP could reduce the proliferative and migratory activities of hMCs induced by DM PRP Exo . Additionally YAP knockdown inhibited the DM PRP Exo induced up regulation of CTGF and fibronectin . Furthermore DM PRP Exo induced PI3K Akt signalling mediated YAP activation and the expression of CTGF and fibronectin . In summary DM PRP Exos through YAP activation enhance both the proliferation and fibrogenic activity of Mller cells via the PI3K Akt pathway .

@highlight We firstly studied the role of PRP Exos in the regulation of fibrogenic activity of Mller cells and its mechanism.
@highlight PRP Exos from diabetic rats could effectively increase proliferative and migratory activities of Mller cells.
@highlight PRP Exos may contribute to the activation of YAP and promote the fibrogenic activity via the PI3K Akt pathway.
