 Blood brain barrier hyperpermeability and brain edema contribute to increased seizure susceptibility and brain injury in status epilepticus . The endothelial glycocalyx is the coating on luminal side of the endothelium and can be considered as the first barrier of BBB . Currently little is known about the effects of endothelial glycocalyx in SE . We hypothesized glycocalyx degradation could be considered as a first step in the pathophysiology of SE . The study aimed to investigate the impacts of glycocalyx integrity loss on brain damage in a C57BL 6 mouse model of SE induced by lithium pilocarpine and whether heparin a competitive antagonist against heparinase improves survival and neurological outcome . Compared to controls glycocalyx was significantly degraded after SE which was mitigated by heparin . The glycocalyx disruption was associated with higher BBB permeability and aggravated brain edema at 72h after SE as well as lower survival rate and poorer neurologic outcome . Conversely preservation of glycocalyx by heparin could reduce SE induced activation of glia cells BBB leakage brain edema decrease the expressions of inflammatory factors and improve neurologic outcome . The study highlights the importance of glycocalyx degradation in cerebral edema and SE outcome and indicates heparin treatment may be a new strategy for brain protection in SE .
