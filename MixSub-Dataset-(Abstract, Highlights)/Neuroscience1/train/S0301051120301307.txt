 Prior evidence suggests that external threat motivates people to monitor norm violations . However the effect of threat may be attenuated for those high in interdependent self construal because this SC affords a sense of protection against the threat . Here we tested this possibility by priming or not priming young American adults with a pathogen threat . We then had participants read norm violating or normal behaviors while assessing two electrocortical markers N400 and suppression of upper band power . In the threat priming condition interdependent SC predicted decreased responsiveness to norm violations . In the control priming condition however interdependent SC predicted increased responsiveness . Our work suggests that interdependent SC may provide a sense of security under threat .

@highlight Under conditions of threat norm violations often induce strong neural responses.
@highlight Neural responses to norm violations entail the N400 and upper alpha suppression.
@highlight Interdependent self construal is associated with buffering of the effect of threat.
@highlight The two neural responses show similar patterns for threat and interdependent SC.
