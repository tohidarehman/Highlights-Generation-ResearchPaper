 Motor unit firing rates of the vastus lateralis in children and adults were examined . Seven healthy adult males and six healthy male children volunteered . Surface electromyography signals were recorded from 20 and 60 maximal voluntary contractions . Surface EMG signals were decomposed into firing events of individual MUs and slopes and y intercepts were calculated for the mean firing rate at steady torque vs. recruitment thresholds relationships for each subject . Muscle cross sectional area was measured via ultrasonography with specific torque calculated . Adults possessed greater mCSA

@highlight Adults possessed larger muscle cross sectional area and greater specific torque than children.
@highlight Muscle cross sectional area alone does not explain torque differences.
@highlight Adults maintained greater firing rates than children during submaximal contractions.
@highlight Excitation and motor unit recruitment may increase with age.
