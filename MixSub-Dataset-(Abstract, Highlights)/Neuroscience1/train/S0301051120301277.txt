 Past research has found that P300 is smaller in depressed adults . Research examining P300 in relation to adolescent depression is more inconsistent most studies fail to find P300 differences between currently depressed adolescents and controls . Previous studies have not examined the potential predictive utility of P300 in regard to adolescent depression . Therefore the current study investigated the relationship between P300 amplitude and depression symptoms at baseline and two years later in a sample of 199 female adolescents . At baseline participants completed measures of depression followed by a speeded response task while EEG was recorded . Two years later participants completed the same depression measures . Reduced baseline P300 predicted increases in depression at two year follow up . Baseline P300 related particularly to two year anhedonia and negative self esteem symptoms . Our study suggest that reduced P300 amplitude can be utilized as a potential risk marker for adolescents at risk for developing increases in depressive symptoms .

@highlight Past research has demonstrated reduced P300 amplitude in depressed adults.
@highlight Few studies have investigated the prospective utility of the P300 on depression.
@highlight Reduced P300 amplitude predicts increase in adolescent depression 2 years later.
@highlight This finding is specific to predicting negative self esteem and anhedonic symptoms.
