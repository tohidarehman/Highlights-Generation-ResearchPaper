 The aim of this study is to analyze the concentrations of cytokines in tear of hospitalized COVID 19 patients compared to healthy controls . Tear samples were obtained from 41 healthy controls and 62 COVID 19 patients . Twenty seven cytokines were assessed interleukin 1b IL 1RA IL 2 IL 4 IL 5 IL 6 IL 7 IL 8 IL9 IL 10 IL 12 IL 13 IL 15 IL 17 eotaxin fibroblast growth factor basic granulocyte colony stimulating factor granulocyte monocyte colony stimulating factor interferon interferon gamma induced protein monocyte chemo attractant protein 1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1a MIP 1b platelet derived growth factor regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted tumor necrosis factor and vascular endothelial growth factor .In tear samples of COVID 19 patients an increase in IL 9 IL 15 G CSF GM CSF IFN PDGF and VEGF was observed along with a decrease in eotaxin compared to the control group . A poor correlation between IL 6 levels in tear and blood was found . IL 1RA and GM CSF were significantly lower in severe patients and those who needed treatment targeting the immune system . Tear cytokine levels corroborate the inflammatory nature of SARS CoV 2 .

@highlight Hyperinduction of proinflammatory cytokine plays an important role in the disease progression of patients infected with SARS CoV 2.
@highlight Tear levels of cytokines are increased in COVID 19 patients.
