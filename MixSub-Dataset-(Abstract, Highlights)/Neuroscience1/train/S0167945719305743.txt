 Optimizing Performance Through Intrinsic Motivation and Attention for Learning Theory proposes that choices of any kind support an individual s need for autonomy motivating them to learn and perform motor skills more effectively . Notably the authors suggest asking learners to choose when to receive feedback in order to increase autonomy . Conversely the guidance hypothesis predicts an impact of feedback schedule independent of motivational influences . The purpose of this experiment was to compare the relative and combined effects of autonomy and feedback schedule for the acquisition of a golf putting task without vision of results . Autonomy support and knowledge of results schedule were combined in a 22 factorial design . Participants

@highlight Participants learned to putt to a target without vision of the result
@highlight Autonomy support and KR frequency were combined factorially
@highlight Neither independent variable had a significant effect on learning or performance
@highlight Effect size estimates were trivially small
