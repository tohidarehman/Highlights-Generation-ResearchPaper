 Over the past century corneal transplantation has become the most commonly performed allogeneic solid tissue transplantation . Although more than 80 of the corneal transplantations have favorable outcomes immune mediated rejection continues to be the major cause of failure in well over 50 of graft recipients that have inflamed and vascularized host beds . Over the past two decades the progress in our understanding of the immunological pathways that mediate graft rejection has aided in the development of novel therapeutic strategies . In order to successfully test the efficacy of these interventions it is essential to model the immunological processes occurring as a consequence of corneal transplantation . Herein we have comprehensively reviewed the established animal models used for replicating the immunopathological processes causing graft rejection in high risk corneal transplantation settings . We have also discussed the practical and technical differences as well as biological and immunological variations in different animal models .

@highlight These animal models are essential tools to elucidate the fundamental immunological mechanisms that govern corneal allograft rejection.
@highlight These animal models are critical for the development of efficacious therapeutic modalities to improve long term graft survival.
@highlight These models also deeply increase our understanding of the basis of ocular immunity with myriad applications beyond corneal transplantation.
