 Cerebral small vessel disease is a common condition linked to dementia and stroke . As an age dependent brain pathology cerebral SVD may share molecular processes with core neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s and Parkinson s disease . Many neurodegenerative diseases feature abnormal protein accumulation and aberrant protein folding resulting in multimerization of specific proteins . We investigated if a small NOTCH3 N terminal fragment that co registers with pathologically affected cells in the inherited SVD CADASIL is capable of multimerization . We also characterized endogenous small molecule vascular enhancers and inhibitors of multimerization . NTF multimerizes spontaneously and also forms conjugates with vascular catecholamines including dopamine and norepinephrine which avidly promote multimerization of the protein . Inhibition of catecholamine dependent multimerization by vitamin C and reversal by reducing agents implicate an essential role of oxidation in NTF multimerization . Antibodies that react with degenerating arteries in CADASIL tissue preferentially bind to multimerized forms of NTF . These studies suggest that multimerization of proteins in the aging brain is not restricted to neuronal molecules and may participate in age dependent vascular pathology .
