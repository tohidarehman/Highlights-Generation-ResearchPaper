 It has been proposed that Amyloid Precursor Protein might act as a rheostat controlling neuronal excitability but mechanisms have remained untested . APP and its catabolite A are known to impact upon synapse function and dysfunction via their interaction with the prion protein PrP

@highlight Zebrafish lacking amyloid precursor protein APP are susceptible to seizures.
@highlight Zebrafish lacking prion protein are sensitized to acute loss of APP.
@highlight Mammalian prion protein can replace its zebrafish homolog during APP interaction.
@highlight Seizure susceptibility of APP mutants requires intact prion protein.
@highlight Seizure susceptibility of prion mutant fish involves mGluR5 channels and APP.
