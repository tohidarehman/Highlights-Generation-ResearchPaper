 Germinal peptide is being developed to treat corneal injuries . The purpose of this study was to investigate its effect on corneal epithelial cells

@highlight We studied the effect of germinal peptide GP on healing of alkali eye damage.
@highlight Twenty and 40g ml GP significantly alleviated corneal opacity and edema.
@highlight At 21d corneal neovascularization epithelial layers and inflammation were lower.
@highlight GP increased rabbit corneal epithelial cell migration
@highlight GP may provide a novel topical approach to corneal wound healing in the clinic.
