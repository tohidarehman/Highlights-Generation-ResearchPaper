 GABAergic neurons in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus receive major input from the lateral habenula which conveys negative reward and motivation related information and project intensively to midbrain dopamine neurons including those in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta . The RMTg VTA circuit has been shown to be linked to the affective behavior but the role of the RMTg SNc circuit in aversion and depression has not been well understood . This study demonstrated that exciting or inhibiting Vgat

@highlight The activation of the RMTg SNc pathway caused aversive and despair behavior.
@highlight Activating the pathway inhibited firing rates of SNc putative dopamine neurons.
@highlight Inhibiting the circuit reversed behavior despair in CRS depression model.
