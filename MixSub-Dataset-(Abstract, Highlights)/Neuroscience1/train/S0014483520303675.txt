 Although anti VEGF therapies have radically changed clinical practice there is still an urgent demand for novel integrative approaches for sight threatening retinal vascular diseases . As we hypothesize that protein tyrosine kinases are key signaling mediators in retinal vascular disease we performed a comprehensive activity based tyrosine kinome profiling on retinal tissue of 12 week old Akimba mice a translational model displaying hallmarks of early and advanced diabetic retinopathy . Western blotting was used to confirm retinal tyrosine kinase activity in Akimba mice . HUVEC tube formation and murine organotypic choroidal sprouting assays were applied to compare tyrosine kinase inhibitors with different specificity profiles . HUVEC toxicity and proliferation were evaluated using the CellTox Green Cytotoxicity and PrestoBlue Assays . Our results indicate a shift of the Akimba retinal tyrosine kinome towards a hyperactive state . Functional network analysis of significantly hyperphosphorylated peptides and upstream kinase prediction revealed a central role for Src FAK family kinases . Western blotting confirmed hyperactivity of this signaling node in the retina of Akimba mice . We demonstrated that not only Src but also FAK family kinase inhibitors with different selectivity profiles were able to suppress angiogenesis
