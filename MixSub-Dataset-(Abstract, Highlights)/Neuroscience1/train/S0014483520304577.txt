 Ultraviolet A light based photoactivation of riboflavin to induce corneal crosslinking and mechanical stiffening is now a well known treatment for corneal ectasia and Keratoconus that is being used in a topographically guided photorefractive intrastromal CXL procedure to treat low degrees of refractive errors . Alternative approaches for non invasive treatment of refractive errors have also been proposed that use femtosecond lasers that provide much faster more precise and safer results than UVA CXL . One such treatment nonlinear optical crosslinking has been able to replicate the effects of UVA CXL while producing a smaller area of cellular damage and requiring a shorter procedure time . Unlike UVA CXL the treatment volume of NLO CXL only occurs within the focal volume of the laser which can be placed at any depth and scanned into any pattern for true topographically guided refractive correction . This review presents our experience with using FS lasers to photoactivate Rf and perform highly controlled corneal CXL that leads to mechanical stiffening and changes in corneal shape .

@highlight NLO CXL produces a detectable increase in mechanical stiffness in collagen hydrogels.
@highlight Rapid NLO CXL using an enlarged focal volume produced increased mechanical stiffness and CAF intensity in ex vivo rabbit eyes.
@highlight A custom built NLO CXL device was able to deliver an adjustable focal volume and produce crosslinking comparable to UVA CXL.
@highlight Amplified pulses are capable of producing NLO CXL with zero pulse overlap while staying within the ANSI power limits.
@highlight Epithelial microchannels enable higher riboflavin penetration with less damage than BAK for transepithelial crosslinking.
