 Numerous genes and alterations in their expression have been identified as risk factors for developing levodopa induced dyskinesia . However our understanding of the complexities of molecular changes remains insufficient for development of

@highlight Identical dyskinesia severity during first ever vs chronic levodopa induces differential gene expression.
@highlight Divergent responses of F344 and Lewis rats offer a novel model for understanding genetic modulators of dyskinesias.
@highlight The currently accepted genotype to phenotype relationships of
@highlight is brought into question.
@highlight Striatal Nurr1 may represent a novel anti dyskinesia target.
