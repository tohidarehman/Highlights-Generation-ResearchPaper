 Heart rate variability associated with parasympathetic activity is reduced in posttraumatic stress disorder but possible confounding effects of respiration have not been studied sufficiently . Further reduced parasympathetic inhibition might contribute to elevated heart rate in PTSD . Finally reduced HRV in PTSD might extend to intimate partners given their chronic stress exposure . In 65 couples elevated PTSD symptomatology was documented by structured interview and self reports . Baseline HR high frequency HRV cardiac pre ejection period and respiration rate and depth were measured via impedance cardiography . Veterans with PTSD symptoms displayed reduced lnHF HRV even when adjusting for respiration but their partners did not . In mediational analyses elevated resting HR in PTSD was accounted for by lnHF HRV but not PEP . Results strengthen evidence regarding HF HRV and elevated HR in PTSD .

@highlight Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is associated with low resting heart rate variability HRV .
@highlight However the role of respiration in this association has not been determined in prior research.
@highlight In 65 U.S. Veterans clinically diagnosed PTSD was associated with lower high frequency HRV.
@highlight This association held while controlling respiration but was not seen in Veterans spouses.
@highlight In mediational analyses low HRV accounted for elevated resting heart rate in PTSD.
