 The trichothiodystrophy group A protein functions in nucleotide excision repair and basal transcription . TTDA plays a role in cancers and serves as a prognostic and predictive factor in high grade serous ovarian cancer however its role in human glioma remains unknown . Here we found that TTDA was overexpressed in glioma tissues . In vitro experiments revealed that TTDA overexpression inhibited apoptosis of glioma cells and promoted cell growth whereas knockdown of TTDA had the opposite effect . Increased TTDA expression significantly decreased the Bax Bcl2 ratio and the level of cleaved caspase3 . TTDA interacted with the p53 gene at the 1959bp and 1530bp region and regulated its transcription leading to inhibition of the p53 Bax Bcl2 mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in glioma cells . These results indicate that TTDA is an upstream regulator of p53 mediated apoptosis and acts as an oncogene suggesting its value as a potential molecular target for the diagnosis and treatment of glioma .

@highlight TTDA was up regulated in glioma tissues and acted as an oncogene.
@highlight TTDA promoted cell proliferation and inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis in glioma cells.
@highlight TTDA inhibited glioma cell apoptosis through the p53 Bax Bcl2 mitochondrial pathway.
@highlight TTDA was an upstream regulator of p53 mediated apoptosis and bound with the p53 gene to inhibit the transcription of p53.
