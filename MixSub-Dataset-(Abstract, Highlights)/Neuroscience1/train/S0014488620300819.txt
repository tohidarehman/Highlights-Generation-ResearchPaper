 The locus coeruleus is a pontine nucleus important for respiratory control and central chemoreception . It is affected in Alzheimer s disease and alteration of LC cell function may account for respiratory problems observed in AD patients . In the current study we tested the electrophysiological properties and CO

@highlight The majority of Alzheimers disease AD patients suffer from disturbed respiratory function.
@highlight Chemosensitive Locus coeruleus neurons in adult rats are mainly inhibited by increased CO
@highlight The streptozotocin induced model of AD STZ AD had a significantly greater sensitivity to CO
@highlight CO
@highlight hyperpolarized resting membrane potential depolarized spike threshold and reduced A type K
@highlight current in STZ AD.
