 This study investigated the neuropsychological underpinnings of reactive aggression toward innocent people in a student population with different levels of psychopathic traits . While recording event related potentials participants traits groups competed against two fictitious opponents in a modified Taylor Aggression Paradigm . We found that the HP group compared to the LP group selected more often high intensity punishment for the second innocent opponent after being provoked by the first opponent . Further a more negative N2 and a smaller P3 was found in the HP group while punishing the innocentsreflecting a tendency on antisocial aggressive behavior . Finally both groups showed a more negative FRN for losing than winning trials when seeing the outcome of the game . Our results suggest that high psychopathic traits increase the risk of transferring provoked aggression to innocent peopleoffering a psychophysiological perspective for explaining and predicting aggression against the innocents in social interactions .

@highlight Participants with different levels of psychopathic traits completed a modified TAP.
@highlight Psychopathic traits enhanced aggressive behavior to the innocents.
@highlight A more negative N2 and a smaller P3 reflected more aggression to the innocents.
