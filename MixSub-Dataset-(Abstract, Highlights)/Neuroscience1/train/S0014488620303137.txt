 Wnt5b a member of Wnt family plays multiple roles in tumor progression and metastasis . However whether Wnt5b contributes to the sensitization of dorsal root ganglia neurons and pathogenesis of bone cancer pain still remains unclear . Here we found that the protein expression of Wnt5b and its atypical tyrosine protein kinase receptor Ryk was upregulated in ipsilateral DRGs in tumor bearing mice . Application of Wnt5b evoked an increased discharge frequency in isolated DRG neurons and pain hypersensitivity in nave mice which were almost completely prevented by anti Ryk antibody . Moreover intrathecal injection of anti Ryk antibody to tumor bearing mice significantly inhibited bone cancer induced mechanic allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia . Subsequently we also demonstrated that application of Wnt5b to cultured DRG neurons could enhance membrane P2X3 receptors and meATP induced currents . Intrathecal injection of calmodulin dependent protein kinase II inhibitor KN93 or P2X3 receptors antagonist A317491 almost completely abolished Wnt5b induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in mice . Meanwhile pretreatment with anti Ryk antibody or CaMKII inhibitor KN93 can attenuate bone cancer induced the upregulation of P2X3 membrane protein as well as pain hypersensitivity . These findings suggested that Wnt5b Ryk promoted the trafficking of P2X3 receptors to the membrane via the activation of CaMKII in primary sensory neurons resulting in peripheral sensitization and bone cancer induced pain . Our results may offer a potential therapeutic strategy for bone cancer pain .
