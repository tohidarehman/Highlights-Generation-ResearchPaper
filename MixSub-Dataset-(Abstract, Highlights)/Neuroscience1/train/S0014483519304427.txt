 Death of retinal photoreceptors is the basis of prevalent blinding diseases . Since steroids might have a therapeutic role in retinal degenerations we compared the protective effects of dexamethasone and progesterone on photoreceptor death induced by mifepristone and light exposure .

@highlight Dexamethasone progesterone protect 89 photoreceptors in mifepristone light injured retinas.
@highlight Photoreceptor protection correlated with steroid specific changes in cell death regulators.
@highlight Steroid dependent protection might also be associated to changes in rhodopsin and GR.
