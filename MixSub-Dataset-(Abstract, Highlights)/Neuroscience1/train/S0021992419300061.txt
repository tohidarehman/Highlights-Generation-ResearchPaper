 Speech Language Pathologists working with students from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds are encouraged to be familiar with nondiscriminatory testing and dynamic assessment procedures . Little is known however about the extent to which SLPs implement these methods into their clinical practice . The current study explores the assessment and intervention practices used by SLPs in two states in the US for students who speak African American English including the types and frequency of clinical practices . 247 SLPs completed an online survey regarding clinical practices for students who speak AAE as well as a questionnaire regarding their knowledge of the linguistic features of AAE . Half of SLPs reported using modified or alternative assessment practices the majority of the time or some of the time for students who speak AAE however SLPs reported using modified or alternative treatment practices less often . Modified scoring of standardized assessments and selecting different intervention strategies were the most commonly reported clinical practices . Knowledge of linguistic features of AAE was a significant predictor of the frequency with which SLPs report implementing modified or alternative assessment and intervention practices and SLPs with the highest levels of knowledge of AAE utilize different clinical practices than those with lower levels of knowledge of AAE . Additional information is needed about the most effective clinical practices for students who speak AAE and the barriers SLPs face to implementing nondiscriminatory clinical practices .

@highlight 50 of SLPs use modified alternative assessments for students who speak AAE.
@highlight Modified scoring was the most common assessment practice.
@highlight Modified alternative practices were more common for assessments than interventions.
@highlight SLPs who modify often have higher knowledge of AAE than SLPs who modify less often.
