 Previously calcitriol has been demonstrated as a potential therapeutic agent for dry eye whilst its role on corneal epithelium death remains unclear . This study aims to investigate the relationship between apoptosis and autophagy on dry eye related scenario as well as the effect of calcitriol and its potential mechanism .

@highlight Autophagy is highly activated in dry eye model
@highlight and
@highlight Autophagy plays a protective role in corneal epithelial cells against dry eye related apoptosis.
@highlight Autophagy flux augmented by calcitriol further protects cornea epithelial cells from apoptosis.
@highlight Vitamin D Receptor pathway correlates to the therapeutic effect of calcitriol.
