 Glaucoma is still a poorly understood disease with a clear need for new biomarkers to help in diagnosis and potentially offer new therapeutic targets . We aimed to determine if the metabolic profile of aqueous humor as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy allows the distinction between primary open angle glaucoma patients and control subjects and to distinguish between high tension and normal tension glaucoma . We analysed the AH of patients with POAG NTG and control subjects .

@highlight Aqueous humor metabolomics achieved AUC 0.93 between glaucoma patients and controls.
@highlight Aqueous humor shows neural protection and damage happen simultaneously in glaucoma.
@highlight Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy distinguishes glaucoma patients and controls.
