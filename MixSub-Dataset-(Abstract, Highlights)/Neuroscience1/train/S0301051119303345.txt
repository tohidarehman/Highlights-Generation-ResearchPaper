 Heightened delta beta correlation has been conceptualized as reflecting exaggerated neural regulation and has been implicated in anxiety . Behavioral inhibition is a temperament characterized by wariness to novelty and is a robust predictor of anxiety but delta beta correlation has not been investigated in relation to childhood BI . We examined the relation between BI and between subjects and within subjects measures of baseline EEG delta beta correlation in 118 children . Using a between subjects measure children scoring high on BI had higher delta beta correlation relative to low BI children at frontal and central and marginally higher in parietal brain regions . Using a within subjects measure continuous BI scores were positively correlated with central and parietal delta beta correlation . Delta beta correlation may be a neural correlate of BI in childhood that displays differences in region specificity correlation strength and variability of correlation values when comparing between and within subjects measures .

@highlight We examined the relation between BI and between subjects and within subjects measures of delta beta correlation in children.
@highlight High BI children had a higher between subjects delta beta correlation relative to low BI children at frontal and central brain regions.
@highlight Continuous scores of BI were positively correlated with central and parietal within subjects delta beta correlation.
@highlight Delta beta correlation may be a neural correlate of BI in childhood.
