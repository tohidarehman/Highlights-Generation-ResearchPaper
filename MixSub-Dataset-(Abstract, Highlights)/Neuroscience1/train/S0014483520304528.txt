 A sight threatening pterygium is a common ocular surface disorders identified by fibrovascular growth of the cornea and induced by variety of stress factors like ultraviolet exposure . However the genes involved in the etiopathogenesis of this disease is not well studied . Herein we identified the gene expression pattern of pterygium and examined the expression of pterygium related genes in UV B induced human primary cultured corneal epithelial cells telomerase immortalized human corneal epithelial primary conjunctival fibroblast and primary pterygium fibroblast cells . A careful analysis revealed that the expression of 10 genes was significantly modulated . Keratin 24

@highlight Expressions of KRT24 and MMP 9 are related to the pterygium progression.
@highlight Extracellular matrix cell migration and angiogenesis induce the pterygium.
@highlight UVB irradiation induced the upregulation of
@highlight and
@highlight 9 mRNAs.
@highlight KRT24 was not expressed in human fibroblast cells.
