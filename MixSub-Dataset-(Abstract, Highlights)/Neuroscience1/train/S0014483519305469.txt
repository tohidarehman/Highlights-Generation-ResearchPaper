 The accumulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in the glial scar following acute damage to the central nervous system limits the regeneration of injured axons . Given the rich diversity of CSPG core proteins and patterns of GAG sulfation identifying the composition of these CSPGs is essential for understanding their roles in injury and repair . Differential expression of core proteins and sulfation patterns have been characterized in the brain and spinal cord of mice and rats but a comprehensive study of these changes following optic nerve injury has not yet been performed . Here we show that the composition of CSPGs in the optic nerve and retina following optic nerve crush in mice and rats exhibits an increase in aggrecan brevican phosphacan neurocan and versican similar to changes following spinal cord injury . We also observe an increase in inhibitory 4 sulfated GAG chains which suggests that the persistence of CSPGs in the glial scar opposes the growth of CNS axons thereby contributing to the failure of regeneration and recovery of function .

@highlight Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in the optic nerve are upregulated following a crush injury.
@highlight Proteoglycan expression is associated with astrogliosis.
@highlight Different proteoglycan core proteins are localized differentially in the optic nerve.
@highlight There is a major increase in 4 sulfated glycosaminoglycans.
@highlight Optic nerve crush stimulates an increase in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in the retina.
