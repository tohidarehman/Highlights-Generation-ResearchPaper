 Toe joint articulation has been shown to affect gait mechanics as evidenced by walking simulations biped robots and foot prostheses . However it is not known how parameters such as toe length foot arch length or toe joint axis angle affect human walking . We utilized a previously developed adjustable ankle toe prosthesis to systematically examine these three foot parameters . We tested ten able bodied persons walking on a force instrumented treadmill while wearing a pair of adjustable prostheses attached bilaterally below simulator boots . We collected motion and ground reaction force data to compute lower limb kinematics and kinetics as well as COM power and work . We observed that increasing the foot arch length by 60mm increased COM Push off work by 5J due to increased energy storage and return by the ankle spring . Increasing the toe length by 40mm and changing the toe joint axis by 9 from a neutral angle resulted in negligible effects on COM mechanics and lower limb kinetics . This study provides further insights regarding toe joint function knowledge which may benefit the design integration of toe joints into prostheses exoskeletons and legged robots .

@highlight First walking study of its kind to examine toe foot arch length toe joint axis.
@highlight Increasing foot arch length by 35 increased prosthetic Push off work by 95 .
@highlight Altering toe length toe joint axis had little effect on lower limb biomechanics
@highlight Findings demonstrate importance of foot properties for assistive robotic devices.
