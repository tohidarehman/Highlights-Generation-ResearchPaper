 Elevated inflammatory cytokines contribute to the pathogenesis of various retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy retinal vasculitis and retinitis . However the underlying mechanism of retinal inflammation remains largely unknown . Recent studies demonstrated that acetylcholinesterase is an inflammatory indicator in central neural system . This study was aimed to dissect the role of ACHE in retinal inflammation and its mechanism of action . Retinal inflammation was induced by intravitreal injection of tumor necrosis factor in heterozygous ACHE knockdown mice ACHE

@highlight A novel function of ACHE in regulating retinal inflammation via NF B signaling.
@highlight ACHE inhibition attenuating TNF induced retinal inflammation and vascular leakage likely through suppression of NF B signaling activation.
@highlight Donepezil as a promising therapeutic agent for retinal inflammatory diseases.
