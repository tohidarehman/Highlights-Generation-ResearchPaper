 We investigated the ability of agmatine to potentiate the antidepressant like and synaptic effects of ketamine in mice . Agmatine and ketamine produced an antidepressant like effect in the tail suspension test . The combination of agmatine and ketamine at subthreshold doses produced an antidepressant like effect 1h 24h and 7d after treatment . Western blot analysis from prefrontal cortex tissue showed that the combined treatment after 1h increased p70S6K and GluA1 and reduced synapsin 1 phosphorylation . Additionally after 24h Akt p70S6K GluA1 and synapsin 1 phosphorylation and PSD95 immunocontent increased . Dendritic architecture analysis of the prefrontal cortex revealed that the combined treatment improved dendritic arbor complexity and increased spine density . Morphometric analysis revealed a filopodia shaped dendrite spine upregulation after 1h . A predominance of stubby mushroom branched and filopodia and a reduction in thin protrusions were observed after 24h . Finally mushroom shaped dendritic spines predominance increased after 7d . Agmatine potentiated ketamine s antidepressant and dendritic arbors and spines remodeling effects in a time dependent manner . Our data indicate Akt p70S6K signaling as a likely target for these effects .
