 Although human motor learning has been intensively studied for many decades it remains unknown whether group differences are present in expert cohorts that must routinely cope with and learn new visuomotor mappings such as expert minimally invasive surgeons . We found that expert surgeons compensate for a visuomotor perturbation more rapidly than naive controls . Modelling indicates that these differences in expert behavioural performance reflects greater trial to trial retention as opposed to greater trial to trial learning rate . We also found that surgeons generalize to novel reach directions more broadly than controls a result which was subsequently confirmed by our modelling . In general our findings show that minimally invasive surgeons exhibit enhanced visuomotor learning and spatial generalization .

@highlight Expert surgeons compensate more rapidly and generalize more broadly than nave controls in a visuomotor adaptation task.
@highlight Novel evidence for the existence of visuomotor learning differences in an expert cohort.
@highlight Surgeons may derive performance benefits from the use of explicit strategies.
