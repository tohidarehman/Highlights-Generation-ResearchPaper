 Compound or awkward spine postures have been suggested as a biomechanical risk factor for low back injury . This experiment investigates the influence of head and gaze orientation on three dimensional neck and spine range of motion during forward flexion movements . To emulate previous experimental protocols and replicate real world scenarios a sample of ten young healthy males completed forward flexion movements with a constrained and unconstrained pelvis respectively . Surface kinematics were gathered from the head and spine C

@highlight Redirecting head and gaze orientation can influence 3D spine range of motion
@highlight Leftward head orientations impact superior thoracic twisting range of motion
@highlight Neck twisting does not predispose additional thoracolumbar or lumbar twisting
@highlight Up downward head and gaze orientations impact thoracolumbar flexion range of motion
@highlight The largest changes to 3D neck posture elicited the largest effects along the spine
