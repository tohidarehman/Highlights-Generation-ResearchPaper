 Research suggests that womens sexual psychology and behavior change across the ovulatory cycle but very little is known about how fluctuations in estradiol and progesterone two hormones that systematically vary across the ovulatory cycle affect romantic relationship dynamics . We present the first dyadic study to assess daily hormonal fluctuations and personal and relationship well being from both partners perspectives . Specifically we recruited women who were not using hormonal contraception and their partners for a 15 day diary study . Participants collected daily urine samples to assess estradiol progesterone and testosterone and they responded to daily questions about their relationship . Results revealed that increases in estradiol negatively affected womens relationship evaluations . Men perceived these changes which in turn affected mens well being . The present findings highlight the importance of womens hormonal fluctuations in shaping relationship dynamics and provide for the first time information about how such fluctuations affect male partners .
