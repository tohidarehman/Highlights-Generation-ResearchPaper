 Retina one of the highest oxygen demanding tissues is vulnerable to vascular insufficiencies and various ocular vascular disorders can cause chronic retinal ischemia . To investigate the pathophysiology rodent models developed by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion have been utilized . However mice lack posterior communicating arteries in the circle of Willis and can not endure the brain ischemia induced by the bilateral occlusion . A mouse model to better reflect the localized ischemic stress in the retina without affecting the brain is still needed . Here we established a mouse model of ischemic injury by permanent unilateral common carotid artery occlusion . Adult male mice were subjected to UCCAO and changes in the ipsilateral retina were examined in comparison with the contralateral retina . Delayed perfusion was observed in the ipsilateral retina right after the occlusion and was not recovered later on . Common features of retinal ischemia were observed hypoxia inducible factor stabilization upregulation of hypoxia responsive genes altered levels of cytokines and chemokines . Activation of astrocytes and Mller cells in the inner retina was detected at day 2 and thinning of the inner retinal layer became significant at week 10 . Together our model can simulate retinal ischemia with morphological and molecular changes . It can be utilized to investigate pathophysiology of ischemic retinopathies .
