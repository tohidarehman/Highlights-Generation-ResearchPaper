 Here we examine whether systolic blood pressure mediates the relationship between body mass index and inhibitory control in children . Twenty children with high blood pressure were approximately matched with twenty children with low blood pressure by fitness BMI somatic maturation sex and age . Inhibitory control was measured by a cognitive Go Nogo task where number of commission errors during Nogo trials and reaction time during Go trials were used as performance . We compared performance between the two groups and conducted a mediation analysis using SBP as mediator of the relationship between BMI and commission errors . Results revealed that HBP children presented higher number of commission errors compared to LBP children . Moreover SBP mediated the relation between BMI and number of errors . Thus early exposure to high levels of SBP can negatively impact inhibitory control and SBP acts as a mediator between BMI and inhibitory functioning in children .

@highlight Children with high blood pressure have poorer inhibitory control.
@highlight BMI is associated with inhibitory control.
