 Previous studies have associated developmental stuttering with difficulty learning new motor skills . We investigated non speech motor sequence learning in children with persistent developmental stuttering children who have recovered from developmental stuttering and typically developing controls . Over the course of two days participants completed the Multi Finger Sequencing Task consisting of repeated trials of a10 element sequence interspersed with trials of random sequences of the same length . We evaluated motor sequence learning using accuracy and response synchrony a timing measure for evaluation of sequencing timing . We examined error types as well as recognition and recall of the repeated sequences . CWS demonstrated lower performance accuracy than CON and CRS on the first day of the finger tapping experiment but improved to the performance level of CON and CRS on the second day . Response synchrony showed no overall difference among CWS CRS and CON . Our study examined non speech sequence learning across CWS CRS and CON . Our preliminary findings support the idea that developmental stuttering is not associated with sequence learning per se but rather with general fine motor performance difficulties .

@highlight Motor sequence learning was evaluated using performance recognition and recall metrics in children with persistent developmental stuttering children who had recovered from developmental stuttering and typically developing controls.
@highlight Early in practice children with persistent developmental stuttering performed the motor sequence task with the lowest accuracy.
@highlight Late in practice children with persistent developmental stuttering reached performance levels similar to those of children who had recovered and control children.
@highlight Developmental stuttering is associated with subtle fine motor performance limitations but motor sequence learning may be intact.
