 Elevated intraocular levels of angiogenic cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor have been implicated the development of diabetic retinopathy . Over a decade of clinical evidence shows intravitreal injection of anti VEGF agents is associated with decreased disease progression and preservation of vision . However the treatment burden associated with monthly injections limits the effectiveness of existing anti VEGF therapies . Current research has focused on sustained treatment paradigms such as longer acting drugs drug delivery implants and gene therapy . In this study we tested a novel approach by dialyzing proteins from the vitreous using bioceramic implant composed of hydroxyapatite . Preliminary in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate a high affinity and capacity for VEGF absorption . After three months implantation in New Zealand White Cross rabbits the hydroxyapatite demonstrated good biocompatibility with no inflammation and normal retinal physiology and histology . These studies demonstrate that prolonged VEGF suppression intraocularly may be accomplished with a bioceramic implant .

@highlight Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor VEGF plays a crucial role in retinal disease.
@highlight Anti VEGF drugs are the mainstay of treatment for retinal vascular disease.
@highlight The short half life of drugs in the eye requires frequent dosing.
@highlight A solid porous substrate of hydroxyapatite HAp has a strong binding affinity for VEGF.
@highlight Hydroxyapatite is biocompatible intraocularly.
