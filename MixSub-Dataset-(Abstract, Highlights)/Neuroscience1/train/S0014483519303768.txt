 Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is the most common type of RD the separation of neurosensory retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium . The RRD patients can be benefited from appropriate treatment if detected early especially for the people predicted at high risk . In this study we aimed to investigate the genetic association and clinical correlation of collagen type II alpha 1

@highlight rs1793958 variant is significantly associated with reduced risk of RRD in southern Chinese population.
@highlight RRD patients carrying rs1793958G allele have milder RD severity compared to those carrying the wildtype AA genotype.
@highlight RRD patients have poorer visual acuity and lower intraocular pressure in their surgical eyes compared to the fellow eyes.
