 The lamina cribrosa in glaucoma is with augmented production of extracellular matrix proteins and connective tissue fibrosis . Fundamental pathological mechanisms for this fibrosis comprise fibrotic growth factors and oxidative stress . Transient receptor potential canonical channels channels play a key role in ECM fibrosis . Here we study TRPC expression in glaucomatous LC cells and investigate the role of TRPC in oxidative stress induced profibrotic ECM gene transcription and cell proliferation in normal LC cells . Age matched human LC cells were used . Hydrogen peroxide H
