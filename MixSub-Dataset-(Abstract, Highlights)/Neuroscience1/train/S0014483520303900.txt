 To quantify short term microvascular changes after pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling in patients with idiopathic macular hole using optical coherence tomography angiography . Cohort Study . This study included patients with IMH . Affected eyes were compared with fellow eyes . 66mm OCTA images of the study eye and fellow eye were acquired one day before surgery 4 weeks and 12 weeks after surgery . Microvascular alterations in the superficial and deep capillary plexus were assessed by measuring vessel density and the shortest distance to the surrounding vessels of all intercapillary pixels . Only vessels enclosed by an ETDRS Grid centered on the fovea were analyzed . Change of vessel density and vessel distance to baseline . OCTA images of the 15 study and 15 fellow eyes of 15 included patients were analyzed and revealed a significant increase in vessel density and decrease in vessel distance of the deep capillary plexus in study eyes 4 weeks after surgery compared to baseline . Our superficial capillary plexus findings were the inverse namely a significant decrease in vessel density and increase in vessel distance . Postoperative microvascular changes proved to be closely associated with the extent of retinal thickness reduction in the perifoveal deep capillary plexus . IMH closure after PPV and ILM peeling caused a significantly improved microvasculature in the deep capillary plexus which may represent reorganized perifoveal microvasculature due to the regression of cystoid spaces .

@highlight Microvascular changes do appear after macular hole closure.
@highlight The deep vascular plexus showed improved microvasculature after surgery.
@highlight Regression of intraretinal cystoid spaces could explain those changes.
