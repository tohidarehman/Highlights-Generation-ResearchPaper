 We report an analysis of the aqueous humor metabolome of primary open angle glaucoma in comparison to normal controls . The AH samples were obtained from human donors POAG . The AH samples were subjected to one dimensional

@highlight We report the metabolites of control versus primary open angle glaucoma POAG aqueous humor AH .
@highlight We used
@highlight H nuclear magnetic resonance NMR and isotopic ratio outlier analysis IROA using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer.
@highlight There were significant metabolite changes found in the POAG AH.
