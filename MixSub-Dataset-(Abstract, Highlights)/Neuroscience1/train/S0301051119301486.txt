 Using event related potential recordings the present study investigated the cross modal neural activities underlying the audiovisual bounce inducing effect via a novel experimental design wherein the audiovisual bouncing trials were induced solely by the ABE . The within subject analysis showed that early cross modal interactions within 100200ms after sound onset over fronto central and occipital regions were associated with the occurrence of the ABE but the cross modal interaction at a later latency over fronto central region did not differ between ABE trials and non ABE trials . The between subject analysis indicated that the cross modal interaction revealed by ND250 was larger for subjects who perceived the ABE more frequently . These findings suggest that the ABE is generated as a consequence of the rapid interplay between the variations of early cross modal interactions and the general multisensory binding predisposition at an individual level .

@highlight The unconfounded ABE trials were extracted via a novel experimental setup.
@highlight Cross modal neural activities within 100200ms underlie the occurrence of ABE.
@highlight A later cross modal negativity underlies the individual difference in ABE magnitude.
