 Keratocytes synthesize stromal proteins and participate in wound healing through successive differentiation into corneal fibroblasts and myofibroblasts . Cultured keratocytes or corneal fibroblasts are also known as non professional phagocytes and innate immune cells . However whether the corneal fibroblasts phagocytize their dead cells and whether the associated innate immunity is enhanced remains unknown . We initially characterized immortalized corneal fibroblast cells with the expression of specific genes . The corneal fibroblasts strongly expressed extracellular matrix molecules

@highlight Corneal fibroblast cells are macrophage like fibroblasts.
@highlight Corneal fibroblasts can engulf dead bacteria processed cellular debris and entire dead cells.
@highlight Dying and dead cells stimulate corneal fibroblasts to further induce inflammatory factors.
