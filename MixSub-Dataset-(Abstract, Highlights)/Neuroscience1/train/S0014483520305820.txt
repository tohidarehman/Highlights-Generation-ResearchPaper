 Although the triggers causing angiogenesis in the context of neovascular age related macular degeneration are not fully understood oxidative stress is likely involved . Oxidative stress in the eye can occur through exposure of macular tissues to sunlight and local or systemic exposure to oxidative stressors associated with environmental or lifestyle factors . Because trace elements have been implicated as regulators of oxidative stress and cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms we hypothesized that they may play a role as a risk factor modifying the progression toward nAMD .
