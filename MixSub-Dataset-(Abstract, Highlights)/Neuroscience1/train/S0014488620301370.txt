 Reduction of conditioned fear expression by extinction underlies cue exposure therapies that treat anxiety disorders . Extinction is context specific . Renewal for example is the relapse of extinguished fear when subjects are tested in a different context to extinction . This context specificity is developmentally regulated and sex dependent with renewal being observed in postnatal day 18 female but not in male rats . Given the hippocampus is critical for context specific extinction in adult rodents we investigated dorsal or ventral hippocampus involvement in context specific extinction in P18 male and female rats . We microinfused muscimol GABA

@highlight Inactivation of dorsal hippocampus accelerated extinction in juvenile rats.
@highlight Inactivation of ventral hippocampus impaired extinction recall in juvenile rats.
@highlight Renewal of extinguished fear was observed in juvenile females but not males.
@highlight Hippocampus inactivation did not affect sex differences in renewal.
