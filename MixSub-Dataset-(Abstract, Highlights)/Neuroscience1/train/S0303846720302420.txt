 Chronic subdural hematoma is a condition that is frequently seen in the neurological and neurosurgical practice . Surgical treatment is overall preferred however conservative treatment is also an option . Both surgical and conservative treatment of CSDH vary across neurosurgeons . The aim of the present study was to evaluate different treatment strategies for CSDH among neurosurgeons in different countries . We designed a survey that was sent to neurosurgeons affiliated with the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.The questions were related to the conservative and surgical treatment methods of CSDH . Furthermore we also included questions related to post operative care . 443 neurosurgeons completed the survey . 46.2 of the respondents sometimes use dexamethasone as monotherapy . Overall 26.2 estimated dexamethasone to have a high efficacy on CSDH . The majority of the neurosurgeons worldwide remains reluctant in the use of conservative treatment methods in the management of CSDH . Further research is needed to assess the effectivity and side effects of these conservative methods .

@highlight Surgical treatment is overall preferred in the treatment of CSDH however conservative treatment is also applied.
@highlight A survey regarding nonsurgical and surgical treatment of CSDH was completed by 443 neurosurgeons employed worldwide.

@highlight Double burr hole is the preferred surgical technique by majority of the surgeons.
