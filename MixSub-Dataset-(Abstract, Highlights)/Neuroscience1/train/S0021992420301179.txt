 There is a growing pressure to teach foreign languages as early as possible and children with Developmental Language Disorder are not immune from these pressures . However current scholarship lacks crucial insights into how children with DLD respond to L2 learning with minimal exposure . In this paper we report the results of a longitudinal study tracing the development of L1 Russian and English as a Foreign Language skills in a group of learners with DLD . The performance of the DLD group was compared to that of typically developing controls matched for classroom EFL exposure . Proficiency in English and Russian was measured three times . At Time 1 there were no significant differences between groups on the EFL measures but the performance of the typically developing children significantly improved with time and that of the DLD group did not . In the DLD group age of EFL onset was positively related to English receptive vocabulary size . The relation between L1 and L2 proficiency in the DLD group was weaker than in the comparison group . This pattern is probably due to the floor performance of the DLD group in the grammatical domain but may also indicate that the disorder affects cross language transfer in the vulnerable domains .

@highlight Primary school learners with DLD develop foreign language skills very slowly.
@highlight Children with DLD learn vocabulary faster if they start EFL lessons at an older age.
@highlight L1 vocabulary predicts EFL vocabulary size in children with TLD and DLD.
@highlight Children with DLD have less informal exposure to English outside of classroom.
