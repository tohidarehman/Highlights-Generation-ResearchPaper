 Fluoxetine is one of the most promising drugs for improving clinical outcome in patients with ischemic stroke . This in vivo study investigated the hypothesis that fluoxetine may affect HIF 1 Netrin VEGF cascade angiogenesis and neuroprotection using a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion . The rats were given fluoxetine or saline after tMCAO for 4weeks . Then protein expression of HIF 1 Netrin VEGF cascade was examined at 1 2 4weeks after tMCAO . In vivo synchrotron radiation were performed to observe microangiography of ischemic brain after 4weeks of tMCAO . The infarct size and neurobehavioral test were carried out 1 to 4weeks after tMCAO . Results revealed that HIF 1 expression was upregulated in fluoxetine treated group . Similarly fluoxetine increased protein expression of Netrin and its receptor DCC VEGF and its receptor VEGFR . Synchrotron radiation angiography revealed more branches in fluoxetine treated rats . We found no difference of infarct volume between fluoxetine and saline treated rats after 1week of tMCAO and ischemia induced brain atrophy volume in fluoxetine treated group was attenuated after 4weeks of tMCAO . Neurological deficits were improved in fluoxetine treated rats at 3 and 4weeks after tMCAO . Our results indicated that fluoxetine could upregulate protein expression of HIF 1 Netrin VEGF cascade promote angiogenesis and improve long term functional recovery after ischemic stroke .
