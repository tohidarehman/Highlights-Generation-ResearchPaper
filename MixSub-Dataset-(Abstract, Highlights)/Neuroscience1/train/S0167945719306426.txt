 The mechanisms and underlying causes of bilateral asymmetry among healthy runners of different levels remain unclear . This cross sectional laboratory study aimed to investigate the effects of running speed and running experience or competitive level on bilateral symmetry during running . Eleven competitive runners 9 recreational runners and 11 novice runners were recruited in this study . They ran on an instrumented treadmill for 3min at each of 5 fixed speeds in a randomized order . Bilateral asymmetry was evaluated and quantified using symmetry index of temporal and kinetic parameters . Overall SI ranged between 0.8 for stride time and 21.4 for vertical average loading rate . Significant speed effects were observed on SI of flight time

@highlight Competitive runners reduce asymmetry with speed increasing from 8 to 12km h
@highlight Recreational runners gain the most symmetric gait at around their preferred speeds
@highlight Novice runners hardly maintain consistent asymmetric pattern with speed increasing
