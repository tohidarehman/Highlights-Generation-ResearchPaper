 Keratoconus is a controversial ophthalmological disease often considered both multifactorial and multigenic with poor or not entirely understood etiopathogenesis . Corneal collagen crosslinking procedure is the most common surgical therapy for KC which both slows corneal thinning and halts disease progression . While extensive studies provide consistent evidence on systemic oxidative stress in KC patients and animal models little is known on the tear fluid oxidative stress markers such as antioxidant enzymes activity or lipid peroxidation markers . Also little is known considering the oxidative status dynamics following CXL . In this way we aimed to evaluate three oxidative stress markers in the tears of KC patients before and after CXL procedure .

@highlight Oxidative stress is an important component of keratoconus pathological development.
@highlight Corneal collagen crosslinking procedure is the most efficient treatment for keratoconus.
@highlight Oxidative status changes can be observed in the tears of patients with keratoconus in a direct correlation to Amsler Krumeich stages.
@highlight Oxidative status changes can be observed as further as 3 months following corneal collagen crosslinking procedure in the tears of keratoconus patients.
@highlight Corneal collagen crosslinking induced oxidative stress could show a dependency with keratoconus severity.
