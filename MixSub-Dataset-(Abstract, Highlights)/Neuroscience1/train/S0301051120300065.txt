 The cardiac defense response to intense auditory stimulation is characterized by two acceleration deceleration heart rate components . This study investigated contributions of sympathetic cardiac control to habituation and recovery of the CDR . Fifty six healthy subjects were presented with noise stimuli eliciting the CDR . Three stimuli were presented with short and long inter trial intervals . The pre ejection period was recorded as an index of sympathetic cardiac control in addition to HR . Repeated stimulation at short ITI was associated with marked habituation of the HR and sympathetic responses both responses exhibited a degree of recovery with long ITI . Regarding the time course the first acceleration deceleration was accompanied by a decline and subsequent increase in sympathetic cardiac control . During the second acceleration deceleration the parameters exhibited parallel courses . These results suggest that the sympathetic contribution to the habituation and recovery is limited to the second HR component .

@highlight Habituation and recovery of the cardiac defense response were investigated.
@highlight The sympathetic nervous system is involved in habituation and recovery.
@highlight The sympathetic contribution is limited to the second response component.
@highlight Different autonomic mechanisms mediate specific stages of the cardiac defense.
