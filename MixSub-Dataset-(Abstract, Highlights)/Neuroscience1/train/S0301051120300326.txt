 The error related negativity is an event related potential occurring in the electroencephalogram within 100ms after the commission of an error . The ERN is thought to partially reflect emotionally aversive aspects of error commission however it has thus far not been related to the neural processing of other aversive events such as brief aversive bodily sensations . Therefore the present study investigated the links between the ERN and the N1 amplitudes of respiratory related evoked potentials and somatosensory evoked potentials . During the acquisition of high density EEG 41 healthy participants performed a Flanker task to evoke the ERN while RREP and SEP were separately elicited using inspiratory occlusions and electrocutaneous stimulation of the wrist . Significant positive correlations were observed between the amplitudes of the ERN and the N1 of RREP and SEP suggesting relationships between the neural processing of different emotionally aversive events namely errors and bodily sensations .

@highlight The error related negativity ERN appears to reflect the nature of an error as an aversive threat signaling event.
@highlight The ERN has thus far not been related to the neural signatures of other such events e.g. aversive bodily sensations.
@highlight We report significant positive relationship of the ERN and the N1 amplitude of Respiratory related evoked potentials RREP .
@highlight We report significant positive relationship of the ERN and the N1 amplitude of Somatosensory evoked potentials SEP .
@highlight The finding indicates functional connections in the processing of different aversive events in the first 130ms post event.
