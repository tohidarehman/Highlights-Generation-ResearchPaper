 Previous studies have shown that simvastatin has neuroprotective effects in a neonatal model of hypoxia ischemia induced brain injury when administered before but not after HI pointing to the preconditioning like effects of the statin . The present study aimed to gain more insight into the PC like effect of Sim by studying the role of autophagy and its modulation by mTOR and SIRT1 in neuroprotection . Sim potentiated the autophagy response induced by neonatal HI as shown by the increased expression of both microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 and beclin 1 increased monodansylcadaverine labeling and reduced expression of p62 . The autophagy inhibitor 3 methyladenine completely blocked the neuroprotective effect of Sim . Two hours after HI there was a reduction in the activity of mTORC1 and a concomitant increase in that of mTORC2 . Sim preconditioning further decreased the activity of mTORC1 but did not affect that of mTORC2 . However 24h after injury mTORC2 activity was significantly preserved in Sim treated rats . Sim preconditioning also prevented the depletion of SIRT1 induced by HI an effect that was completely blocked by 3MA . These data show that Sim preconditioning may modulate autophagy and survival pathways by affecting mTORC1 mTORC2 and SIRT1 activities . This study provides further preclinical evidence of the PC like effect of statins in brain tissue supporting their beneficial effects in improving stroke outcome after prophylactic treatments .
