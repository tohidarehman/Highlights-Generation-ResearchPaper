 Our recent study investigated the role of collapsin response mediator protein 2 on dendritic spine morphology and memory function after traumatic brain injury . First we examined the density and morphology of dendritic spines in Thy1 GFP mice on the 1st day and 7th day after controlled cortical impact injury . The dendritic spine density in the hippocampus was decreased on P1D in which mainly mushroom type and thin type spines were lost . The density of dendritic spines was increased on P7D most of which were of the thin type . Next we explored the expression of CRMP2 on P1D and P7D . CRMP2 expression was decreased on P1D but the levels of the CRMP2 breakdown product were increased . On P7D the expression pattern was the opposite . Then we constructed CRMP2 overexpression and knockdown plasmids and transfected them into cultured neurons in vitro . CRMP2 increased the dendritic spine density of cultured neurons and the proportion of mushroom type spines while CRMP2 shRNA reduced the dendritic spine density and the proportion of mushroom type spines . To determine the role of CRMP2 in dendritic spines after TBI we stereotactically injected the CRMP2 overexpression and knockdown viruses into the hippocampus and found that CRMP2 increased the dendritic spine density and the proportion of mushroom type spines after TBI . Meanwhile as suggested by the morphological changes fear conditioning behavioral experiments confirmed that CRMP2 improved memory deficits after TBI .
