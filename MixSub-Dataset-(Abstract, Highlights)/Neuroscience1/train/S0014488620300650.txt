 Paraoxonase 2 regulates reactive oxygen species production in mitochondria . Stimulating its expression has therapeutic potential for diseases where oxidative stress plays a significant role in the pathology . Evidence suggests that the anti diabetic drug pioglitazone may provide neuroprotection in Parkinson s disease Alzheimer s disease brain trauma and ischemia but the biochemical pathway responsible has not been fully elucidated . Here we report that pioglitazone for 5days significantly increased paraoxonase 2 expression in mouse striatum . Thus this result highlights paraoxonase 2 as a target for neuroprotective strategies and identifies pioglitazone as a tool to study the role of paraoxonase 2 in brain .

@highlight Paraoxonase 2 enhances mitochondria function and mitigates oxidative stress OS .
@highlight OS contributes to a variety of disorders including Parkinson s Diseases and stroke.
@highlight Pioglitazone is neuroprotective in a variety of neurological disorders.
@highlight Pioglitazone stimulates PPAR and increases paraoxonase 2 expression.
