 Although oxytocin administration influences behavior its effects on peripheral oxytocin concentrations are mixed and derived from studies on healthy subjects . Additionally trauma attenuates the behavioral effects of oxytocin but it is unknown whether it also influences its effect on peripheral circulation . This study examined whether salivary oxytocin increased after oxytocin administration and whether trauma attenuated this effect . We conducted a randomized double blind placebo controlled within subjects study in 100 male adolescents living in residential youth care facilities . Participants self administered intranasally 24 IU of oxytocin and placebo and provided a saliva sample before and 15min after administration . Salivary oxytocin increased significantly after oxytocin administration but this effect might be inflated by exogenous oxytocin reaching the throat . Trauma did not moderate this effect . Our findings suggest that trauma did not attenuate the effect of oxytocin administration on salivary oxytocin but more robust methodologies are recommended to draw more solid conclusions .
