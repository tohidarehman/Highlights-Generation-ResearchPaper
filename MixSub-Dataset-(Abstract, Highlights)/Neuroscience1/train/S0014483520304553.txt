 Lowering intraocular pressure is the most effective treatment of glaucoma however most of the current available glaucoma drugs target a single molecule . MicroRNAs are noncoding RNAs that target a network of molecules . This study aims to investigate the role of miR 21 5p in regulating IOP and the mechanism of function . miR 21 5p mimics was topically applied to C57 BL6 mouse eyes which significantly increased miR 21 5p expression in the conventional outflow tissue and reduced IOP by a maximum of 17.77 at 24h after treatment . The conventional outflow facility measured by ex vivo moue eye perfusion of miR 21 5p was significantly increased by 60.14 . Moreover miR 21 5p overexpression significantly reduced the transendothelial electrical resistance in porcine angular aqueous plexus cells . Transcriptome analysis and further quantification by Western blot and PCR revealed that SMAD7 and FGF18 might be the downstream target of miR 21 5p in regulating aqueous humor outflow . The predicted functional pathways PTEN eNOS RhoB pMLC and TIMP3 MMP9 were significantly altered after miR 21 5p transfection . Dual luciferase assay verified the direct targets of miR 21 5p . In conclusion miR 21 5p seems to regulate IOP by modulating multiple genes that are associated with aqueous humor outflow including genes those regulating cell adhesion cytoskeletal dynamics and extracellular matrix turnover . Thus miR 21 5p represents a new therapeutic strategy for glaucoma and a viable alternative to existing multidrug regimens .
