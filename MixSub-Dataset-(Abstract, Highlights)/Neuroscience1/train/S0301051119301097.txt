 To understand the boundaries we set for ourselves in terms of environmental responsibility during competition we examined a neural index of outcome valence in relation to an early index of visual attention a later index of motivational significance and eventual behaviour . In Experiment 1

@highlight When participants experience different opponents unexploitable exploitable random behaviour can be generated against unexploitable opponents.
@highlight Previous exposure with negative outcome and previous engagement with a trial for which response selection was removed promote sub optimal performance.
@highlight Against unexploitable opponents N1 determines the extent to which negative and positive outcomes are perceived as distinct categories by FRN.
@highlight Against exploitable opponents FRN determines the extent to which P3 generates neural gain for future events.
@highlight Differential activation of the N1 FRN P3 processing chain provides a framework for understanding competitive decision making.
