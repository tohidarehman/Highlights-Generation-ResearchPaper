 Previous studies on the neural mechanisms of how priming influences subsequent recognition memory have mainly focused on repetition priming whereas the neural mechanisms of how conceptual priming affects subsequent recognition memory is still not clear . The present study investigated the electrophysiological correlates of how conceptual priming influences subsequent recognition memory . The behavioral results showed that conceptual priming only affected subsequent familiarity . The ERP results showed that conceptual priming was associated with reduced N400 and that the N400 conceptual priming effect predicted the behavioral effect of conceptual priming on subsequent familiarity . These results indicated that conceptual priming could influence subsequent familiarity by facilitating semantic processing in the encoding phase .

@highlight Conceptual priming influenced subsequent familiarity.
@highlight Conceptual priming had no significant effect on subsequent recollection.
@highlight The N400 effect predicted the effect of conceptual priming on subsequent familiarity.
