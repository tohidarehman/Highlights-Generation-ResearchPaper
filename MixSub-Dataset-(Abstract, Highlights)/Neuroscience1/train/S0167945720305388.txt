 The purpose of this study was to determine whether the type and direction of postural perturbation threat differentially affect anticipatory postural control . Healthy young adults stood on a force plate fixed to a translating platform and completed a series of rise to toes movements without and with the potential of receiving a postural perturbation to either their feet or torso . Each type of perturbation threat was presented along the anteroposterior or mediolateral axis . For each condition the A P center of pressure signal and tibialis anterior and soleus electromyographical recordings were used to quantify the anticipatory postural adjustment . Results indicated that across both threat types and directions postural threat induced a 40.2 greater TA activation

@highlight Individuals performed a rise to toes without or with postural threat.
@highlight Threat varied in type feet trunk perturbation and direction sagittal frontal .
@highlight Presence of postural threat led to larger anticipatory postural adjustments APAs .
@highlight No differential effects of type and direction of postural threat on APAs observed.
@highlight These factors do not explain previous differences of threat induced effects on APAs.
