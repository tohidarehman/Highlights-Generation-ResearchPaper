 Imaging techniques have revolutionised the assessment of retinal disease in humans and animal models . Here we describe a novel technique for the

@highlight Mouse models of RP that express GFP within rods allow spatiotemporal assessment of retinal degeneration
@highlight using cSLO.
@highlight Mean grey values derived from the resulting images represent global indices of overall photoreceptor survival.
@highlight This allows simple and objective mapping of focal photoreceptor loss or preservation following experimental intervention.
