 Status epilepticus is a clinical emergency that can lead to the development of temporal lobe epilepsy . The development and maintenance of spontaneous seizures in TLE are linked to calcium Ca

@highlight Ryanodine receptors are involved in neurodegeneration following status epilepticus.
@highlight Blockade of intracellular calcium channels increases synaptic proteins after seizures.
@highlight Neuroprotection preserves synaptic proteins levels after status epilepticus.
