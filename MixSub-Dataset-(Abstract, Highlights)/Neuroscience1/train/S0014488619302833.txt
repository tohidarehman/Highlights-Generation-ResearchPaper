 Low neuronal cAMP levels in adults and a further decline following traumatic central nervous system injury has been associated with the limited ability of neurons to regenerate . An approach to increase neuronal cAMP levels post injury is electrical stimulation . Stimulation as a tool to promote neuronal growth has largely been studied in the peripheral nervous system or in spared fibers of the CNS and this research suggests that a single session of electrical stimulation is sufficient to initiate a long lasting axonal growth program . Here we sought to promote plasticity and growth of the injured corticospinal tract with electrical cortical stimulation immediately after its spinal injury . Moreover given the importance of rehabilitative motor training in the clinical setting and in translating plasticity into functional recovery we applied training as a standard treatment to all rats . Our findings show that electrical cortical stimulation did improve recovery in forelimb function compared to the recovery in unstimulated animals . This recovery is likely linked to increased corticospinal tract plasticity as evidenced by a significant increase in sprouting of collaterals above the lesion site but not to increased regenerative growth through the lesion itself .

@highlight Adult rats were trained in a reaching task prior to unilateral cervical spinal lesion.
@highlight The injury was directly followed by 30min of cortical electrical stimulation.
@highlight Animals were assessed weekly in the reaching task for 5weeks post injury.
@highlight The stimulated group showed greater functional recovery in the trained task.
@highlight Stimulation induced increased corticospinal tract sprouting into grey matter.
