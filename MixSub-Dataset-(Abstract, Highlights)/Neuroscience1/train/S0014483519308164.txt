 Endothelin 1 a potent vasoconstrictor plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of ocular conditions like glaucoma . Glaucoma is characterized by apoptotic loss of retinal ganglion cells and loss of visual fields and is a leading cause of irreversible blindness . In glaucomatous eyes retinal ischemia causes release of pro inflammatory mediators such as interleukin 1 IL 6 and tumor necrosis factor and promotes activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa B and c Jun . Magnesium acetyltaurate has previously been shown to protect against ET 1 induced retinal and optic nerve damage . Current study investigated the mechanisms underlying these effects of MgAT which so far remain unknown .
