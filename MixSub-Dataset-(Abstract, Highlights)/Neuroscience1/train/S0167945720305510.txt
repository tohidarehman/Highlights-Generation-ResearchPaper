 The question whether children with DCD have motor learning deficits is difficult to answer based on the current body of knowledge . The aim of this study was to examine the impact of practice on motor skill acquisition retention and transfer in children with and without DCD using a variety of games in a virtual environment . Performance on a criterion task and MABC 2 balance subscore was compared between children with DCD The children with DCD demonstrated lower performance on the criterion task than the TD group Based on the criterion task results typically developing children seem more proficient in learning new skills compared to children with DCD . More research is needed to confirm that children with DCD have a problem to transfer skills to other contexts .

@highlight Skill acquisition and transfer are still understudied in children with DCD.
@highlight The DCD group showed limitations in learning a new skill transfer compared to typically developing children.
@highlight Previous experiences influence the learning of novel motor skills transfer differently in children with and without DCD.
@highlight Transfer of skills is crucial for generalizing the effects of interventions.
