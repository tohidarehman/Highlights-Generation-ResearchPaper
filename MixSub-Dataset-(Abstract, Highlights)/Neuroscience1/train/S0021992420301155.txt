 Several studies have investigated cognitive communication disorders affecting oral expression skills following TBI but very few have dealt with reading comprehension abilities . The current study aims to measure reading comprehension and speed of reading in adults with uncomplicated and complicated mild traumatic brain injury and to determine which demographic and TBI related variables are predictive of their performance . The performances of three groups of participants were compared on the Chapman Cook Speed of Reading Test . The CCSRT was administered in an acute care setting to 85 hospitalized participants with mild TBI showing traumatic cerebral lesions to 15 hospitalized participants with uncomplicated mild TBI and to 68 adults without TBI . Linear regression analyses were performed to determine which variables among sex age education TBI severity speed of processing skills and site of cerebral lesions significantly predicted CCSRT performances . The control group showed a lower percentage of errors than both TBI groups . On the total score of the CCSRT the uncomplicated and complicated TBI groups performed worse than the control group . Moreover as age and speed of processing skills increased and education decreased the odds of having a lower score on the CCSRT increased . These findings suggest that reading abilities are compromised after mild TBI . Furthermore the CCSRT may be a useful bedside tool for clinicians who work with individuals with mild TBI .

@highlight Mild traumatic brain injury has a significant impact on reading comprehension and speed of reading.
@highlight No significant difference was found between the complicated and uncomplicated mild TBI groups on acute reading abilities.
@highlight A younger age and higher level of schooling was associated with better performances on reading.
@highlight In acute care support should be provided to patients with mild traumatic brain injury when they are required to read.
