 Mller cells represent a key element for the metabolic and functional regulation of the vertebrate retina . The aim of the present study was to test the feasibility of a new method for the in vivo detection and quantification of extrafoveal MC in human retina . We developed a new approach to isolate and analyse extrafoveal MC in vivo starting from structural optical coherence tomography data . Our pilot investigation was based on the optical properties of MC which are known to not interfere with the light reaching the outer retinal structures . We reconstructed MC in the macular region of 18 healthy subjects and the quantitative analyses revealed 42 000 9mm

@highlight We developed a non invasive quantitative approach to detect and quantify extrafoveal Mller cells in vivo in human retina.
@highlight The Mller cells imaging morphology disclosed a good matching with histologic analysis.
@highlight The macular Mller cell density was of 42 000 9mm
