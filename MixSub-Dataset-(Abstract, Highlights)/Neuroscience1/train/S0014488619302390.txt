 Dramatic impairment of gastrointestinal function accompanies high thoracic spinal cord injury . The vagus nerve contains mechano and chemosensory fibers as well as the motor fibers necessary for the central nervous system control of GI reflexes . Cell bodies for the vagal afferent fibers are located within the nodose gangla and the majority of vagal afferent axons are unmyelinated C fibers that are sensitive to capsaicin through activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channels . Vagal afferent fibers also express receptors for GI hormones including cholecystokinin . Previously T3 SCI provokes a transient GI inflammatory response as well as a reduction of both gastric emptying and centrally mediated vagal responses to GI peptides including CCK . TRPV1 channels and CCK A receptors expressed in vagal afferents are upregulated in models of visceral inflammation . The present study investigated whether T3 SCI attenuates peripheral vagal afferent sensitivity through plasticity of TRPV1 and CCK receptors .

@highlight Upper thoracic SCI impairs mechanosensitivity of gastric vagal afferent fibers.
@highlight Vagal sensory cell soma show post injury CCK A receptor and TRPV1 channel plasticity.
@highlight Acute gastric vagal afferent sensitivity to CCK is diminished following SCI.
@highlight Gastric vagal afferents have elevated sensitivity to the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin.
@highlight Chronic SCI rats display a bimodal recovery of sensitivity to CCK.
