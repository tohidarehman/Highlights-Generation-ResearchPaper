 Corneal neovascularization is a common sight threatening pathology that can be induced by a variety of inflammatory and angiogenic stimuli . Current CNV treatments include anti inflammatory drugs and antibody based inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor . However these are not always effective and novel therapeutic approaches are needed . Previous work has indicated a role for nucleolin in VEGF mediated neoangiogenesis in a suture induced CNV model . The major goal for this current study is to test the effect of AS1411 a NCL binding DNA aptamer that has reached human clinical trials on neovascularization in a murine model of VEGF mediated CNV . Our results show that topical administration of AS1411 can significantly inhibit corneal neovascularization in this model . Mechanistic studies indicate that AS1411 reduces the VEGF stimulated proliferation migration and tube formation of primary cells obtained from human limbus stroma . AS1411 treatment also significantly reduced VEGF stimulated induction of miR 21 and miR 221 in HLSC suggesting a role for these pro angiogenic miRNAs in mediating the effects of AS1411 in this system . In sum this new research further supports a role for NCL in the molecular etiology of CNV and identifies AS1411 as a potential anti angiogenic CNV treatment that works by a novel mechanism of action .

@highlight Treatment with topical nucleolin binding aptamer AS1411 decreased corneal neovascularization.
@highlight AS1411 is able to reduce migration proliferation and tube formation of VEGF stimulated human limbal stromal cells HLSC .
@highlight miRNA 21 and 221 reduction by AS1411 on VEGF HLSC explains in part the effect of AS1411 on corneal neovascularization.
