 Myopia is a prevalent eye disorder especially among children and adolescents in eastern Asian countries . Multiple measures have already been taken to prevent and treat myopia including atropine and dopamine . However the serum metabolic picture of myopia has not yet been studied as a whole and remains largely unclear . In this paper a prospective and panoramic study was carried out to find out the whole serum metabolomic and lipidomic picture of myopia . With untargeted mass spectrometry myopia among 211 children and adolescents was studied . The MS features were first grouped across the samples . Then compound annotation was carried out based on these features . Finally the metabolite features were mapped to pathways whose biological functions in myopia were studied and discussed . A total of 275 metabolite features were derived from 92 aligned MS peak groups with significant fold changes and then mapped to 33 pathways . By a comprehensive consideration of significance fold change importance score and appearance in different omics 9 pathways were selected and their biological functions were further analyzed . Among these selected pathways 5 pathways were related with oxidative stress a validated phenomenon during myopia development while 5 pathways were related with dopamine receptor D2 whose molecular function in myopia treatment is not fully understood . A total of 177 metabolite features from 45 peak groups were related with the studied pathways . This prospective study shed light on the whole picture of metabolomic mechanism underlying myopia and provided guidance to further elucidation of compounds and pathways in this whole picture .
