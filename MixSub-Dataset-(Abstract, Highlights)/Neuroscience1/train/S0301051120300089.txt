 Both stream segregation and temporal integration are considered important for auditory scene analysis in the brain . Several previous studies have indicated that stream segregation may precede temporal integration when both processes are required . In the present study we utilized mismatch negativity which reflects automatic change detectionto systematically estimate the threshold of the frequency difference at which stream segregation occurs prior to temporal integration when these functions occur together during a state of inattention . Electroencephalography data were recorded from 22 healthy Japanese men presented with six blocks of alternating high pure tones and low pure tones . Only high tones were omitted with 5 probability in all blocks . Our results indicated that stream segregation should cancel temporal integration of close sounds as indicated by omission MMN elicitation when the frequency difference is 1000 Hz or larger .

@highlight We utilized mismatch negativity to investigate auditory scene analysis.
@highlight Stream segregation preceded temporal integration under certain conditions.
@highlight This result was only observed when the frequency difference was 1000 Hz.
