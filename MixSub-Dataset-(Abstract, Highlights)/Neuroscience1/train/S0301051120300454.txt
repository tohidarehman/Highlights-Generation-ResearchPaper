 Pupil diameter is dynamically modulated by a number of factors including emotion motor activity and attention . Here pupil modulation was examined as it varies with locus of control during aversive processing . Participants could control aversive exposure either by escape or avoidance or they had no control . Highly anxious moderately anxious and less anxious participants saw cues that signaled whether a fast button press would terminate prevent or not affect subsequent presentation of an aversive picture . Pupil diameter was measured throughout the cuing interval . Pupil diameter was larger when preparing to escape or avoid compared to anticipating uncontrollable exposure . All participants regardless of reported anxiety showed increased pupil diameter in coping relative to uncontrollable contexts . Results support hypotheses that pupil diameter reflects action preparation and that differences in trait anxiety do not modulate this aspect of coping behavior in healthy subjects .

@highlight The study measures pupil change when preparing to escape or avoid aversive stimuli.
@highlight Pupil size increased in active coping relative to uncontrollable aversive contexts.
@highlight Trait anxiety did not affect dilation during escape or avoidance preparation.
@highlight Pupil reflects action preparation that is consistently enhanced in coping contexts.
