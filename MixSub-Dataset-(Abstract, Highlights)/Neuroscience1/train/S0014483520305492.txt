 Retinitis pigmentosa is a collection of heterogenous genetic retinal disorders resulting in cumulative retinal deterioration involving progressive loss of photoreceptors and eventually in total blindness . Oxidative stress plays a central role in this photoreceptor loss . Gypenosides are the main functional component isolated from the climbing vine
