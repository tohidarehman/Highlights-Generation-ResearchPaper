 Charcot Marie Tooth type 2A peripheral neuropathy the most common axonal form of CMT is caused by dominantly inherited point mutations in the Mitofusin 2

@highlight CMT2A
@highlight mice show early onset of neuropathic pain and progressive motor performance defects
@highlight CMT2A
@highlight mice exhibit a progressive decrease of tubulin acetylation in distal sciatic nerves
@highlight Treatment of CMT2A
@highlight mice with an HDAC6 inhibitor SW 100 rescues distal sciatic nerves tubulin acetylation
@highlight SW 100 ameliorates CMT2A
@highlight mouse motor and sensory defects when given prior to or after the onset of symptoms
@highlight HDAC6 genetic deletion in CMT2A
@highlight mice prevents their development of motor performance defects and neuropathic pain
@highlight HDAC6 is a promising therapeutic target for CMT2A
