 Vogt Koyanagi Harada disease is a common type of uveitis in China but the diagnosis criteria of VKH disease is controversial . The aim of this study was to investigate potential diagnostic plasma biomarkers for VKH disease . A case control study including 55 VKH patients and 30 healthy controls in a tertiary referral center was performed . The metabolic phenotype of VKH patients showed a significant difference compared to healthy controls . Fifteen differentially expressed metabolites were identified between active VKH patients and healthy controls and nine DEMs were found between inactive VKH patients and healthy controls after controlling variable importance in the projection value 1 and false discovery rate 0.05 . D mannose stearic acid and L lysine were shown to be potential diagnostic biomarkers which can discriminate active VKH patients from healthy controls with a diagnostic performance with AUC 0.965 0.936 and 0.910 respectively in independent diagnosis and an AUC 0.999 when combined . Sarcosine was recognized as an independent potential biomarker which could distinguish inactive VKH patients from healthy controls . This study reveals a significant difference of plasma metabolic phenotype and identifies diagnostic biomarkers for VKH disease . Changes in the metabolic profile may provide clues towards the pathophysiology of VKH disease .

@highlight A plasma metabolomics study of VKH disease is presented.
@highlight A different plasma metabolic phenotype disease was found in VKH disease.
@highlight D mannose L lysine and stearic acid can be potential diagnostic biomarkers.
