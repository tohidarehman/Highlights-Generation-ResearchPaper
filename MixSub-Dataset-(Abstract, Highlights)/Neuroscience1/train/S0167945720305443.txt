 Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a complex deformity that often leads to loss of coordination and dynamic posture . However there is a lack of understanding on inter segmental coordination in AIS . The purpose of this study was to compare spinal range of motion as well as the relations to coupling angles in the spinal region during trunk rotation between AIS and control subjects . There were 14 subjects with right thoracic AIS and 18 control subjects who participated in the study . All subjects were asked to perform five repeated axial trunk rotations in standing while holding a bar . The outcome measures included ROM at the first thoracic spinous process the seventh thoracic spinous process the twelfth thoracic spinous process and the first sacrum spinous tubercle by the motion capture system . The CA in each spinal region were analyzed while considering age and body mass index . The Cobb angle demonstrated positive moderate relationships with ROM at T7 group were compared with the control subjects . The lumbar spine motion was dissociated with the thorax in the AIS group and was negatively correlated with body mass index . Clinicians need to consider thorax convexity and dissociated lumbar motion for compensatory and rehabilitation strategies .

@highlight Lumbar spine coordination was dissociated in the scoliosis group.
@highlight The Cobb angle demonstrated a moderate positive relationship with the thorax.
@highlight The convexity of the thorax was moderately correlated with rotation at T7.
@highlight Body mass index was negatively correlated with the coupling angle in the lumbar spine.
