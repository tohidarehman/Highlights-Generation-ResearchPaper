 Microglial cells are important contributors to the neuroinflammation and blood vessel damage that occurs in ischemic retinopathies . We hypothesized that key effectors of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system angiotensin II and aldosterone increase the density of microglia in the retina and stimulate their production of reactive oxygen species as well as pro angiogenic and pro inflammatory factors . Two animal models were studied that featured up regulation of Ang II or aldosterone and included transgenic Ren 2 rats which overexpress renin and Ang II in tissues including the retina and Sprague Dawley rats with ischemic retinopathy and infused with aldosterone . Complementary studies were performed in primary cultures of retinal microglia from neonatal Sprague Dawley rats exposed to hypoxia 0.5 O

@highlight Angiotensin II and aldosterone increased the density of microglia in the retina.
@highlight Blockade of the angiotensin type 1 receptor and aldosterone reduced reactive oxygen species and the expression of NADPH oxidase NOX isoforms in retinal microglia exposed to hypoxia.
@highlight Blockade of the angiotensin type 1 receptor and aldosterone reduced the protein levels of pro angiogenic and pro inflammatory factors produced by retinal microglia in response to hypoxia.
