 Proliferative vitreoretinopathy is a blinding fibrotic eye disease that develops in 810 of patients who undergo primary retinal detachment reparative surgery and in 4060 of patients with open globe injury . At present there is no pharmacological treatment for this devastating disease . Vitreal growth factors activate their respective receptors of cells in the vitreous trigger their downstream signaling transduction Akt and drive cellular responses intrinsic to the pathogenesis of PVR . PI3Ks play a central role in experimental PVR . However which isoform are involved in PVR pathogenesis remain unknown . Herein we show that p110 a catalytic subunit of receptor regulated PI3K isoform is highly expressed in epiretinal membranes from patients with PVR and that idelalisib a specific inhibitor of PI3K effectively inhibits vitreous induced Akt activation proliferation migration and contraction of retinal pigment epithelial cells derived from an epiretinal membrane of a PVR patient . Small molecules of kinase inhibitors have shown great promise as a class of therapeutics for a variety of human diseases . The data herein suggest that idelalisib is a promising PVR prophylactic .
