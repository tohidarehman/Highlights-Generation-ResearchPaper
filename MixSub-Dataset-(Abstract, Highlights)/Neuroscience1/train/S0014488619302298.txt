 Phosphatase and tensin homolog induced kinase 1 is involved in mitochondrial quality control which is essential for maintaining energy production and minimizing oxidative damage from dysfunctional depolarized mitochondria . Pink1 mutations are the second most common cause of autosomal recessive Parkinson s disease . In addition to characteristic motor impairments PD patients also commonly exhibit cognitive impairments . As the hippocampus plays a prominent role in cognition we tested if loss of Pink1 in mice influences learning and memory . While wild type mice were able to perform a contextual discrimination task age matched

@highlight Hippocampal mitochondrial length is not affected by loss of Pink1
@highlight mice have reduced hippocampal tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity
@highlight mice are impaired in hippocampus dependent tasks compared to matched WT mice
@highlight Cognition in
@highlight mice is improved by treatment with a dopamine D1 agonist
