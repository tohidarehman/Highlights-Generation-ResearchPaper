 Hyperosmolarity is pro inflammatory stress to the ocular surface epithelium associated with dry eye disease . Astaxanthin is a kind of carotene which exists in seafood and plays important roles in the amelioration of inflammatory diseases like arteriosclerosis inflammatory bowel disease sepsis rheumatoid arthritis gastric inflammation brain inflammatory diseases . The aim of this study was to characterize the protective effect and potential mechanism of AST on DED

@highlight Hyperosmolarity induced the expression of HMGB1 and inflammatory cytokine in dry eye model.
@highlight Astaxanthin decreased the expression of HMGB1 and inflammatory cytokines in dry eye model under hyperosmolarity.
@highlight PI3K Akt signaling pathway may participate in the expression of HMGB1 and the protection of astaxanthin in dry eye.
@highlight Astaxanthin might be a promising natural derivative for protecting ocular surfaces in dry eye.
