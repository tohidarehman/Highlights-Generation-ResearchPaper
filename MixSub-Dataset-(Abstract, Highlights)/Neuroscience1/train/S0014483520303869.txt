 Circular RNA Homeodomain Interacting Protein Kinase 3 was found to involve in the pathogenesis of age related cataract . Here we further disclosed the related target genes and molecular mechanism of circHIPK3 in the ARC progression . The expression of circHIPK3 microRNA 2213p was detected using the quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction . Human lens epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by 3 dimethylthiahiazo 3 5 di phenytetrazoliumromide assay and flow cytometry respectively . Western blot was used to detect the levels of apoptosis related proteins and phosphoinositide 3 kinase p protein kinase B pathway related proteins . Levels of malondialdehyde and glutathione peroxidase were measured by kits . The interaction between miR 2213p and circHIPK3 was confirmed by dual luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay . CircHIPK3 was down regulated while miR 2213p was up regulated in human lens epithelium samples of ARC patients . CircHIPK3 up regulation or miR 2213p down regulation mediated the promotion of proliferation inhibition of apoptosis decrease of MDA level as well as increase of GSH PX level in HLECs . MiR 2213p was a target of circHIPK3 and miR 2213p overexpression reversed the protective action of circHIPK in HLEC functions . In addition circHIPK3 activated PI3K AKT pathway via regulating miR 2213p and silencing miR 2213p protected HLECs from dysfunction by activating PI3K AKT pathway . We demonstrated that circHIPK3 protected HLECs from dysfunction by regulating miR 2213p PI3K AKT pathway indicating a new insight into the pathogenesis of ARC and providing a potential therapeutic target for ARC .
