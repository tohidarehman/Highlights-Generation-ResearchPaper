 The aims of the current study were to determine age related changes to the phonatory and articulatory subsystems and to investigate an exploratory model of intelligibility for healthy aging based on phonatory and articulatory measures . Fifteen healthy older adults and 15 younger adults participated in instrumental assessments of the phonatory and articulatory subsystems . Speech intelligibility was determined by five listeners during multi talker babble . Older adults displayed shorter maximum phonation time greater airflow during sentence reading and lower cepstral peak prominence and CPP Aging affects the phonatory and articulatory subsystems with implications for speech intelligibility . Phonatory cepstral spectral measures were associated with speech intelligibility changes suggesting that changes in voice quality may contribute to reduced intelligibility in older adults . Pertaining to articulation slower tongue movement speed likely contributed to reduced intelligibility in older individuals .

@highlight Phonatory age related changes included greater airflow and lower cepstral measures.
@highlight Aging induced slowing of tongue movements was observed for the articulatory system.
@highlight Cepstral spectral measures except CPP predicted age related intelligibility change.
@highlight Maximum speed was a significant contributor to age related intelligibility change.
