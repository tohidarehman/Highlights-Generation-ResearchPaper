 The development of the eye requires the co ordinated integration of optical and neural elements to create a system with requisite optics for the given animal . The eye lens has a lamellar structure with gradually varying protein concentrations that increase towards the centre creating a gradient refractive index or GRIN . This provides enhanced image quality compared to a homogeneous refractive index lens . The development of the GRIN during ocular embryogenesis has not been investigated previously . This study presents measurements using synchrotron X ray Talbot interferometry and scanning electron microscopy of chick eyes from embryonic day 10 midway through embryonic development to E18 a few days before hatching . The lens GRIN profile is evident from the youngest age measured and increases in magnitude of refractive index at all points as the lens grows . The profile is parabolic along the optic axis and has two distinct regions in the equatorial plane . We postulate that these may be fundamental for the independent central and peripheral processes that contribute to the optimisation of image quality and the development of an eye that is emmetropic . The spatial distributions of the distinct GRIN profile regions match with previous measurements on different fibre cell groups in chick lenses of similar developmental stages . Results suggest that tissue compaction may not be necessary for development of the GRIN in the chick eye lens .

@highlight Refractive index gradient in chick lens is evident in the embryonic lens at day 10.
@highlight The gradient is parabolic along the optic axis and biphasic in the equatorial plane.
@highlight Tissue compaction does not appear to pay a role in formation of the gradient.
