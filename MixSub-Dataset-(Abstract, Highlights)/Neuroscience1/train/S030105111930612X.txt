 Previous studies have shown that the high frequency component of heart rate variability is associated with empathic emotions negatively and quadraticallythere is an inverted U shaped relationship between tonic parasympathetic nervous system activity and empathy . However it is unclear whether the inverted U shape also applies to the relationship between phasic PNS activity and empathic emotions . Therefore the present study addressed this issue . Participants were asked to empathize with others negative states followed by evaluating their own emotions . We measured the participants cardiac activity during this task by electrocardiogram . Results revealed an inverted U shaped relationship between heart rate deceleration which reflects phasic PNS activity and subjective personal distress and empathic concern . These results suggest that moderate levels of phasic PNS activity are more strongly associated with personal distress and empathic concern than low or high levels of PNS activity .

@highlight We tested a quadratic relationship between heart rate and empathy.
@highlight Heart rate decreased during empathizing for others negative situations.
@highlight Heart rate deceleration related with empathy as an inverted U shapely.
