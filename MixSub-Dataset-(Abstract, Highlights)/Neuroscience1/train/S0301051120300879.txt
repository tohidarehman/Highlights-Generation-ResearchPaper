 Individuals differ in how they deal with their emotions after failure . While some stay in a negative mood for hours others recover quickly . The present study investigates whether prefrontal alpha asymmetry influences affective recovery and cognitive performance following failure . Forty seven participants completed two mental rotation tasks separated by a short break and received negative feedback on their performance . Electroencephalographic data was collected before the first task and affective and cognitive changes were tracked using visual analogue scales throughout the experiment . In participants that felt upset higher right hemispheric PFA was associated with a persistence of negative affect . These participants showed poor performance on the second task . The findings suggest that PFA is a vulnerability factor that prevents individuals from regaining their initial affective state and impairs their cognitive performance .

@highlight Persistence of negative affect was associated with frontal asymmetry.
@highlight Cognitive performance was impaired in upset individuals with right sided dominance.
@highlight Rumination negatively influenced cognitive performance.
@highlight Induced failure proved to be a reliable elicitor of negative affect.
