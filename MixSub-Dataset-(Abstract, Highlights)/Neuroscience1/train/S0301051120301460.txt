 Neurovisceral integration models emphasize the role of frontal lobes in cognitive behavioral and emotional regulation . Two candidate hubs for the regulation of cardio autonomic control anxiety and executive attention are the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and middle frontal gyrus .

@highlight Resting state connectivity of right DLPFC and MFG predicted by HF HRV.
@highlight Connectivity of right DLPFC and MFG predicted by lower trait anxiety.
@highlight Right DLPFC MFG connectivity predicted by greater control of executive attention.
@highlight Ipsilateral connectivity of right DLPFC and MFG may support neurovisceral integration.
