 The development and translation of cell therapies have been hindered by an inability to predict and evaluate their efficacy after transplantation . Using an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model of multiple sclerosis we studied attenuation of the diffuse injury characteristic of EAE and MS by transplanted glial restricted precursor cells . We assessed the potential of on resonance variable delay multiple pulse chemical exchange saturation transfer MRI to visualize this attenuation . Allogeneic GRPs transplanted in the motor cortex or lateral ventricles attenuated paralysis in EAE mice and attenuated differences compared to nave mice in onVDMP CEST signal 5days after transplantation near the transplantation site . Histological analysis revealed that transplanted GRPs co localized with attenuated astrogliosis . Hence diffuse injury sensitive onVDMP CEST MRI may complement conventional MRI to locate and monitor tissue regions responsive to GRP therapy .
