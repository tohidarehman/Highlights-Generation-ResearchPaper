 Vitreous liquefactive processes play an integral role in ocular health . Knowledge of the degree of liquefaction would allow better monitoring of ocular disease progression and enable more informed therapeutic dosing for an individual patient . Presently this process can not be monitored in a non invasive manner .

@highlight MRI protocol optimisation allows acquisition of homogenous T2 maps of artificial vitreous humour.
@highlight Artificial vitreous humour T2 can be correlated with viscoelastic properties of the gel.
@highlight An optimised MRI protocol can non invasively identify regional variations in T2 within porcine vitreous humour .
