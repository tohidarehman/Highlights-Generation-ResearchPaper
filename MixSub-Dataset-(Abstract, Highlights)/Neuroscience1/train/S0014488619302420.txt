 Currently molecular electrophysiological and structural studies delineate several neural subtypes in the hippocampus . However the precise developmental mechanisms that lead to this diversity are still unknown . Here we show that alterations in a concrete hippocampal neuronal subpopulation during development specifically affect hippocampal dependent spatial memory . We observed that the genetic deletion of the transcription factor Helios in mice which is specifically expressed in developing hippocampal calbindin positive CA1 pyramidal neurons induces adult alterations affecting spatial memory . In the same mice CA3 CA1 synaptic plasticity and spine density and morphology in adult CB CA1 PNs were severely compromised . RNAseq experiments in developing hippocampus identified an aberrant increase on the Visinin like protein 1 expression in the hippocampi devoid of Helios . This aberrant increase on VSNL1 levels was localized in the CB CA1 PNs . Normalization of VSNL1 levels in CB CA1 PNs devoid of Helios rescued their spine loss

@highlight Helios is a transcription factor that is specifically expressed in calbindin positive CA1 pyramidal neurons during development.
@highlight Adult mice devoid of Helios display a specific decrease in spine density in calbindin positive CA1 pyramidal neurons an impaired spatial learning and a decreased CA3 CA1 long term potentiation.
@highlight VSNL1 is finely regulated by Helios during development and we show
@highlight evidences suggesting that VSNL1 occluded expression could be the responsible for the spine loss observed in mice devoid of Helios.
