 Attention develops gradually from infancy to the preschool years and beyond . Exogenous attention consisting of automatic responses to salient stimuli develops in infancy whereas endogenous attention or voluntary attention begins to develop later in the preschool years . The purpose of this study was to examine exogenous and endogenous attention in young children who stutter and children who do not stutter through two conditions of a visual sustained selective attention task and visual short term memory between groups within the context of this task . 42 CWS and 42 CWNS ages 3 05 5 were pair matched in age gender and socioeconomic status . Children completed a visual tracking task than when stimuli were less so . Relative to peers preschool age CWS as a group display weaknesses in visual sustained selective attention and visual STM .

@highlight Children who stutter show reduced performance in visual tracking of shape stimuli.
@highlight Performance suggests reduced visual attention.
@highlight Children who stutter were less able to recall shapes after tracking them over time.
@highlight Performance suggests reduced visual memory relative to peers.
