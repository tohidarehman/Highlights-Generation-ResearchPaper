 Prion diseases are invariably fatal neurodegenerative disorders that have gained much publicity due to their transmissible nature . Sporadic Creutzfeldt Jakob disease is the most common human prion disorder with an incidence of 1 in a million . Inherited prion disorders are relatively rare and associated with mutations in the prion protein gene . More than 50 different point mutations deletions and insertions have been identified so far . Most are autosomal dominant and fully penetrant . Prion disorders also occur in animals and are of major concern because of the potential for spreading to humans . The principal pathogenic event underlying all prion disorders is a change in the conformation of prion protein PrP
