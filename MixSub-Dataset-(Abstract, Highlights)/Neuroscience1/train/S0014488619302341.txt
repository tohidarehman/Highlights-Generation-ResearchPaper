 Neonatal encephalopathy frequently results from hypoxia ischemia or inflammation in preterm or term neonates . Neuropathology depends on cerebral development at insult time but the poor correlation of neuromotor cognitive and behavioral disabilities in infancy with initial imaging and clinical records precludes early prognosis . The RiceVannucci HI procedure was applied to wild type and tissue plasminogen activator knockout mice as surrogates for human preterm mice or human term mice . Acute and delayed T2 magnetic resonance imaging signals and cognitive deficits in adulthood were investigated in the same animals . Early vascular tPA and matrix metalloproteinase 9 activities bloodbrain barrier permeability to water or IgG and microglial activation were assessed separately .

@highlight Neonatal mice aged 5 or 10days exposed to HI exhibit different T2 MRI profiles
@highlight White matter has specific MMP 9 dependent vascular vulnerability in 5 day old mice
@highlight 5 day old mice had white matter T2 MRI hypersignals and social interaction deficits
@highlight 10 day old mice had coincidental retrosplenial damage and spatial memory deficits
@highlight tPA KO prevents BBB leakage microglial activation depending on age and structures
