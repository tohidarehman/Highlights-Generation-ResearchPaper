 A recently described subtype of foveal hypoplasia with congenital nystagmus and optic nerve decussation defects was found to be associated with mutations in the Five Israeli families with congenital foveal hypoplasia were studied two of Karait Jewish origins and three of Indian Jewish origins . Subjects underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic examination including retinal photography and ocular coherence tomography . Molecular analysis including whole exome sequencing and screening of the Eight affected individuals were identified all had congenital nystagmus and all but one had hypoplastic foveal pits . Anterior segment dysgenesis was observed in only one patient one had evidence of developmental delay and another displayed early age related macular degeneration . Molecular analysis revealed a recently described homozygous mutation c.95T G p.Ile32Ser in two families of Jewish Indian descent and the same mutation in two families of Karaite Jewish descent . In a patient with only one pathogenic mutation a possible partial clinical expression of the disorder was seen . One patient of Jewish Indian descent was found to be compound heterozygous for c.95T G p.Ile32Ser and a novel mutation c.490 491delCT p.L164Vfs 41 . In five unrelated families with congenital nystagmus and foveal hypoplasia mutations in the

@highlight Foveal hypoplasia is a congenital disorder characterized by a lack of foveal depression in the foveal area.
@highlight This study describes five unrelated families with foveal hypoplasia and nystagmus associated with SLC38A8 gene mutations. Expression in both Indian and Karaite Jewish ethnicities could be suggestive for common ancestry. A novel mutation c.490 491delCT is identified in the SLC38A8 gene.
