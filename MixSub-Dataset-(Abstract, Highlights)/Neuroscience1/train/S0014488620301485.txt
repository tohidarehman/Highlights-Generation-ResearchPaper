 Neonatal hypoxia ischemia is the main cause of newborn mortality and morbidity . Preclinical studies have shown that the immature rat brain is more resilient to HI injury suggesting innate mechanisms of neuroprotection . During neonatal period brain metabolism experience changes that might greatly affect the outcome of HI injury . Therefore the aim of the present study was to investigate how changes in brain metabolism interfere with HI outcome in different stages of CNS development . For this purpose animals were divided into 6 groups HIP3 HIP7 and HIP11 and their respective shams .

@highlight HI injury has different prognosis depending on the age it is induced.
@highlight While P3 brain is more resilient the P11 brain is greatly affected.
@highlight Higher usage of BHB instead of glucose is a possible mechanism of P3 resiliency.
