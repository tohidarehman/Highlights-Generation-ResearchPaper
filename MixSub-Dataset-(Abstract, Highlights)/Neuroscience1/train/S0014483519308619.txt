 There is accumulating evidence that aging shifts the central nervous system milieu towards a proinflammatory state with increased reactivity of microglia in the aging eye and brain having been implicated in the development of age related neurodegenerative conditions . Indeed alterations to microglial morphology and function have been recognized as a part of normal aging . Here we sought to assess the effects of age on the retinal microglial and macrophage response to acute intraocular pressure elevation . Further we performed experiments whereby bone marrow from young or middle aged mice was used to reconstitute the bone marrow of whole body irradiated 12 month old mice . Bone marrow chimeric mice then underwent cannulation and IOP elevation 8 weeks after whole body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation in order to determine whether the age of bone marrow alters the macrophage response to retinal injury . Our data show retinal macrophage reactivity and microglial morphological changes were enhanced in older mice when compared to younger mice in response to injury . When IOP elevation was performed after whole body irradiation and bone marrow rescue we noted subretinal macrophage accumulation and glial reactivity was reduced compared to non irradiated mice that had also undergone IOP elevation . This effect was evident in both groups of chimeric mice that had received either young or middle aged bone marrow suggesting irradiation itself may alter the macrophage and glial response to injury rather than the age of bone marrow .

@highlight Retinal macrophage reactivity was enhanced in older mice following IOP elevation.
@highlight Retinal macrophage responses to injury were altered in chimeric mice.
@highlight Gliosis was attenuated following IOP elevation in chimeric mice.
@highlight Altered macrophage responses in chimeric mice was independent of bone marrow age.
@highlight Irradiation may alter macrophage and glial responses after injury.
