 Multi level modeling examined the association between cortisol awakening responses and different PTSD symptom clusters in a sample of 158 female participants presenting with intimate partner violence related PTSD . Results revealed that arousal over the past week and month respectively significantly moderated the trajectory of cortisol levels and emotional numbing symptom severity was found to be trending toward significance . In each case higher symptom severity was associated with flatter CAR slopes compared to those with lower symptom severity .

@highlight In 158 females with IPV related PTSD arousal symptom severity reported over the past week and month moderated the trajectory of CAR.
@highlight Females with higher arousal symptom severity had a flatter cortisol trajectory and less fluctuation in CAR compared to women with lower arousal.
@highlight Emotional numbing over the past week moderated cortisol levels in a similar manner to arousal but at the level of a trend.
@highlight Emotional numbing effortful avoidance and re experiencing symptoms were not significant moderators of CAR.
