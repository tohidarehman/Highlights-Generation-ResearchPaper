 Interleukin 33 is known to activate the regulatory T lymphocytes which are negatively correlated with brain damage after ischemic stroke . In this study we aimed to investigate the role of Tregs in IL 33 mediated neuroprotection and elucidate the underlying mechanisms . In vivo male C57BL 6N mice were subjected to 60min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by daily administration of vehicle or IL 33 immediately after injury . Tregs were depleted by intraperitoneal administration of anti CD25 antibody . Behavioral changes brain edema neuronal injury Treg percentages and cytokine expression levels were investigated in each group . In vitro experiments primary mouse neuronal cells were subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation for 3h . Vehicle or drug conditioned Tregs were applied to the neurons at the time of induction of hypoxia . Neuronal apoptosis and cytokine expression were measured in each group . The results indicate that intraperitoneal administration of anti CD25Ab reduced CD4 CD25 Foxp3 Tregs increased infarct volume enhanced stroke induced cell death and decreased sensorimotor functions . Notably IL 33 increased CD4 CD25 Foxp3 Tregs in the spleen and brain . However blockading ST2 attenuated these effects of IL 33 . The supernatant of the IL 33 treated Treg culture reduced neuronal apoptosis and elevated the production of the Treg cytokines IL 10 IL 35 and transforming growth factor TGF

@highlight Anti CD25Ab caused a sharp decrease in Tregs aggravates brain edema and increases lesion volume.
@highlight IL 33 exerts neuroprotective effects by increasing Tregs activation and infiltration after experimental ischemic stroke.
@highlight ST2 competitive inhibition blocked IL 33 induced cellular and functional effects post stroke.
