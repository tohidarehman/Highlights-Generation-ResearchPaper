 Secondary degeneration following an initial injury to the central nervous system results in increased tissue loss and is associated with increasing functional impairment . Unilateral partial dorsal transection of the adult rat optic nerve has proved to be a useful experimental model in which to study factors that contribute to secondary degenerative events . Using this injury model we here quantified the protective effects of intravitreally administered bi

@highlight AAV2 BDNF protects retinal ganglion cells after partial optic nerve injury.
@highlight AAV2 encoding phospho resistant CRMP2 protects RGCs after partial optic nerve injury.
@highlight Both vectors maintained important elements of myelin integrity in ventral optic nerve.
@highlight AAV2 BDNF restored the number of smooth pursuit phases of optokinetic nystagmus.
