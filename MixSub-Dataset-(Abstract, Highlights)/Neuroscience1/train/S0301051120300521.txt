 Low parasympathetic regulation of cardiac activity known as cardiac vagal control is robustly associated with poor health outcomes . However the etiological mechanism that undergirds this association remains largely unknown . One explanation is a causal relationship wherein health problems cause low CVC or vice versa . However an alternative explanation is that a common set of genetic factors contributes to both increased liability for poor health and low CVC . The present study uses polygenic risk scores for a number of health related phenotypes to test whether genetic liability for poor health has pleiotropic effects on CVC . We report evidence for shared genetic liability between low CVC and both poor physical health and risky health related behaviors . The present findings are consistent with shared genetic liability explaining at least in part the well documented correlation between CVC and health .

@highlight Cardiac vagal control CVC shows robust associations with health but the mechanisms are not fully understood.
@highlight We test whether CVC and poor health are in pleiotropy sharing common genetic liability.
@highlight Polygenic risk for high triglycerides and risky health behaviors predict low CVC in a representative sample of U.S. adults.
