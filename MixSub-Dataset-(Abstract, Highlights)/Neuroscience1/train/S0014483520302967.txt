 Artificial cornea is an effective treatment option for cases of severe corneal loss . In this study we prepared a core skirt designed artificial cornea with orthogonal microfiber grid scaffold . We fabricated PCL orthogonal microfiber grid scaffolds by a direct writing technique and then combined them with compressed collagen to obtain a sandwich like CC P . PHEMA hydrogel and the CC P served as the core and the skirt respectively with the P also serving as an intermediate between the two . The physical properties of the artificial cornea including the morphology the mechanical properties and the light transmittance were evaluated . SEM images showed an effective connection and a lack of phase separation at the interface between the core and the skirt and the skirt formed a highly porous scaffold that promoted tissue biointegration . In addition we used the skirt structure to construct a corneal tissue model containing two cells types corneal stromal stem cells and mouse hippocampal neurons . The results showed that the cells could grow and differentiate well and the orthogonal microfiber grid scaffold fibers were good guides for the structural growth of CSSCs and neuronal axons .
