 In this study we assessed the effects of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on inhibitory control and error processing as measures of cognitive control to better understand tDCS modulation of smoking behaviour . Smokers were allocated to six sessions of either active tDCS One day after the intervention no significant effect was found of active tDCS on behavioural and neurophysiological measures of cognitive control in tobacco smokers . However a significant improvement in reaction times and a decrease in No Go P3 amplitudes for smoking cues was found three months after active tDCS . Given the direction of the effect we speculate that tDCS has a long term modulatory learning effect on selective attention and motor inhibition .

@highlight tDCS had no effect on early inhibitory control and error processing in smokers.
@highlight Improved reaction times during Go NoGo task three months after repetitive tDCS.
@highlight Decreased No Go P3 amplitudes for smoking cues three months after active tDCS.
