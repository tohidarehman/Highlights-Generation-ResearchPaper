 A considerable amount of research has identified inhibition differences including slower inhibition of manual responses in people who stutter . Recent investigations have failed to link slowed motor inhibition with overt stuttering severity . This study investigated the potential relationship between slowed manual response inhibition and the negative impact of stuttering upon individual lives of adults who stutter . Thirty four adults matched by nonverbal IQ completed a manual stop signal task and provided a conversational speech sample . Motor inhibition latency for AWS and AWNS were compared . For AWS motor inhibition latency was compared to the four subsections of the Overall Assessment of the Speakers Experience with Stuttering . Similar to previous studies AWS were significantly slower to inhibit inaccurate manual responses than AWNS . Quality of Life subtest of the OASES was found to significantly predict inhibition latency . These data replicate findings that indicate that AWS exhibit slower manual inhibition latency and suggest that these inhibition differences may be associated with an individuals negative experience with stuttering rather than stuttering severity .

@highlight Adults who stutter had slower manual inhibition compared to non stuttering adults.
@highlight Negative experiences with stuttering predicted slower inhibition.
@highlight No relationship was found between stuttering severity and inhibition function.
@highlight Adverse impact of stuttering may share a bidirectional relationship with inhibition.
