 The prevalence of nonsense mutations as a class within genetic diseases such as inherited retinal disorders presents an opportunity to develop a singular common therapeutic agent for patients whose treatment options are otherwise limited . We propose a novel approach to addressing IRDs utilizing Eukaryotic Ribosome Selective Glycosides ELX 01 and ELX 06 delivered to the eye by intravitreal injection . We assessed read through activity
