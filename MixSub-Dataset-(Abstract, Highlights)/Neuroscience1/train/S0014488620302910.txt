 Selective elimination of respiratory motor neurons using intrapleural injections of cholera toxin B fragment conjugated to saporin mimics motor neuron death and respiratory deficits observed in rat models of neuromuscular diseases . This CTB SAP model allows us to study the impact of motor neuron death on the output of surviving phrenic motor neurons . After 7 days of CTB SAP phrenic long term facilitation is enhanced but returns towards control levels at 28d . However the mechanism responsible for this difference in magnitude of pLTF is unknown . In nave rats pLTF predominately requires 5 HT2 receptors the new synthesis of BDNF and MEK ERK signaling however pLTF can alternatively be induced via A

@highlight Phrenic motor neuron loss induces shifts in signaling mechanisms for pLTF.
@highlight pLTF observed in 7d CTB SAP treated rats requires the new synthesis of TrkB.
@highlight Both PI3K Akt and MEK ERK signaling contribute to pLTF in 7d CTB SAP rats.
@highlight pLTF is elicited through BDNF and MEK ERK signaling in 28d CTB SAP rats.
