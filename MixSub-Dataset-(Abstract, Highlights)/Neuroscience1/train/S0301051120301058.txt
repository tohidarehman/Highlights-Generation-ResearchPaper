 Previous studies on individual differences in pupil size of healthy individuals and their relation to performance have been inconclusive . Using a novel approach we tested the effect of general cognitive abilities and level of task performance on pretrial baseline and task evoked pupil sizes while we manipulated the level of task demands using a multiple object tracking task . Results did not reveal an effect of general cognitive abilities estimated by working memory capacity and

@highlight Tonic and phasic pupil responses were measured prior and during multiple object tracking MOT .
@highlight Individual differences in general cognitive abilities did not relate to either the tonic or phasic pupil sizes.
@highlight High MOT performers had larger phasic pupil responses than low performers only during the highest workload conditions.
@highlight Individual differences in task evoked pupil sizes are related to state specific factors and not to general cognitive abilities.
