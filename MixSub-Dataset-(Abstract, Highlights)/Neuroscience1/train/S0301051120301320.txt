 We investigated whether observation of hand movements of people with hemiplegia by healthy individuals from the first person perspective compared to that from the third person perspective enables better understanding of disability associated distress . We measured the neural activity of healthy individuals using functional magnetic resonance imaging while they observed hemiplegic movements from the FPP or TPP . Subjective assessment of the movements was determined with questionnaires . Compared to the TPP the FPP elicited stronger activation in the inferior parietal lobule right temporoparietal junction and anterior cingulate cortex which are associated with body representation mentalization and empathy respectively . Enhanced IPL activity correlated positively with personal empathic traits . Observing movements of hemiplegic individuals from the FPP provided precise subjective understanding of the physically distressing aspects of their movements . These findings suggest that observing hemiplegic individuals from the FPP effectively improved observers understanding of disability associated distress via body representation mentalization and empathy systems .

@highlight We tested the effect of first person perspective FPP on understanding disability.
@highlight Observers subjectively better understood feelings of disabled actions via the FPP.
@highlight The FPP activates various brain areas involved in body representation and empathy.
@highlight Observing people with disabilities from the FPP enhances empathy.
