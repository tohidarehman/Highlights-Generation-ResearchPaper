 The mechanisms by which exposure to adversity contributes to psychopathology development are poorly understood . Recent models link experiences of threat of harm and deprivation to psychopathology via disruptions in learning mechanisms underlying fear acquisition and extinction . We empirically tested dimensional elements of this model by examining whether exposure to images of community violence or neglect differentially influenced fear learning and extinction relative to exposure to neutral images . Participants were randomly allocated to one of three exposure conditions viewing images depicting neglect

@highlight Examined threat and neglect exposure prior to fear conditioning and extinction.
@highlight Threat exposure increased autonomic reactivity to the CS and impaired safety learning retention.
@highlight Neglect exposure attenuated autonomic reactivity to both CSs throughout the task.
@highlight There were no effects on subjective distress or CS evaluations.
@highlight Different patterns of fear learning and extinction might underlie different adverse experiences.
