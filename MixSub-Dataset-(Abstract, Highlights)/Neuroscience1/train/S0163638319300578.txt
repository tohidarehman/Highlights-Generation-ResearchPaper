 Preliminary evidence suggests that changes in DNA methylation a widely studied epigenetic mechanism contribute to the etiology of Autism Spectrum Disorder . However data is primarily derived from post mortem brain samples or peripheral tissue from adults . Deep phenotyped longitudinal infant cohorts are essential to understand how epigenetic modifications relate to early developmental trajectories and emergence of ASD symptoms . We present a proof of principle study designed to evaluate the potential of prospective epigenetic studies of infant siblings of children with ASD .

@highlight Studying mechanisms underpinning ASD might benefit from incorporating epigenetic analysis into infant sibling designs.
@highlight DNA methylation levels associated with early social attention are linked to genes involved in brain development and ASD.
@highlight Significant changes in the association between DNA methylation and behaviour were observed between 8 and 15 months.
@highlight Examining DNA methylation in age homogeneous samples might allow to detect meaningful signals in relatively small samples.
