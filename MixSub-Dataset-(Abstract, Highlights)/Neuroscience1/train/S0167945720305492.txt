 Biofeedback has recently been explored to target deviant lower extremity loading mechanics following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction to mitigate the development of post traumatic osteoarthritis . The impact this feedback has on the structure of the stride interval dynamicsa barometer of gait system healthhowever have yet to be examined . This study was designed to assess how feedback used to alter lower extremity loading during gait affects the structure of stride interval variability by examining long range stride to stride correlations during gait in those with unilateral ACLR . Twelve participants walked under three separate loading conditions control high loading and low loading . Baseline vertical ground reaction force data was used to calculate a target 5 change in vGRF for the appropriate loading condition . The target for the load condition was displayed on a screen along with real time vGRF values prescribing changes in stride to stride peak vertical ground reaction forces of each limb . From time series of stride intervals we analyzed the mean and standard deviation of stride to stride variability and via detrended fluctuation analysis temporal persistence for each feedback condition . Both the high and low loading conditions exhibited a change toward more temporally persistent stride intervals than walking under the control condition 0.78 high vs. control

@highlight Analyses of the influence of feedback on underlying stride interval dynamics
@highlight High and low feedback resulted in sorter more variable stride to stride intervals
@highlight Manipulating vGRF led to more temporally persistent stride intervals.
@highlight Strategies used to adhere to biofeedback impact stride dynamics
