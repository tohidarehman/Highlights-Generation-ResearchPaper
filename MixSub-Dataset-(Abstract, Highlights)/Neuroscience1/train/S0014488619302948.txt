 Postoperative electrical stimulation improves nerve regeneration by decreasing staggered regeneration at the coaptation site . By contrast conditioning electrical stimulation accelerates axon extension . Given that both techniques can be delivered at the bedside a direct comparison of outcomes is of significant clinical importance . In this study we compared regeneration and reinnervation outcomes of CES PES a combination of CES and PES and a no stimulation control . Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into i CES ii PES iii CES PES and iv no stimulation . CES was delivered one week prior to nerve cut coaptation and PES was delivered immediately following nerve repair . Length of nerve regeneration was assessed at 7days post coaptation

@highlight CES accelerates nerve regeneration greater than PES or a combination of CES PES.
@highlight CES promotes sensorimotor functional recovery greater than PES and CES PES.
@highlight CES PES did not have a synergistic effect to promote nerve regeneration.
