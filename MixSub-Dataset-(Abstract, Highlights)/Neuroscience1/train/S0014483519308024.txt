 Besides apoptosis necrosis can also occur in a highly regulated and genetically controlled manner defined as regulated necrosis which is characterized by a loss of cell membrane integrity and release of cytoplasmic content . Depending on the involvement of its signal pathway regulated necrosis can be further classified as necroptosis ferroptosis pyroptosis and parthanatos . Numerous studies have demonstrated that regulated necrosis is involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases covering almost all organs including the brain heart liver kidney intestine blood vessel eye and skin particularly myocardial infarction and stroke . Most recently growing evidence suggests that multiple types of regulated necrosis contribute to the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells retinal pigment epithelial cells or photoreceptor cells which are the main pathologic features for glaucoma age related macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa respectively . This review focuses on the involvement of necroptosis and ferroptosis in these blinding diseases .
