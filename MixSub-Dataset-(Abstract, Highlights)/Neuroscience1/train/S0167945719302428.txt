 We examined the effect of verbalization of a phylogenetic motor skill balance in older and young adults with a low or a high propensity for conscious verbal engagement in their movements . Seventy seven older adults and 53 young adults were categorized as high or low reinvestors using the Movement Specific Reinvestment Scale which assesses propensity for conscious processing of movements . Participants performed a pre and post test balance task that required quiet standing on a force measuring plate . Prior to the post test participants described their pre test balancing performance or listed animals . Only young adults were affected by verbalization with participants with a high propensity for reinvestment displaying increased medial lateral entropy and participants with a low propensity for reinvestment displaying increased area of sway and medial lateral sway variability following the intervention . The possible explanations for these results are discussed .

@highlight The effect of verbalisation of balance performance in older and young adults was examined.
@highlight Verbalisation affects balance performance of young but not older adults.
@highlight Young adults with a low propensity for reinvestment displayed worse postural control following verbalisation.
@highlight Verbalisation seems to disrupt the operations of the procedural memory system.
