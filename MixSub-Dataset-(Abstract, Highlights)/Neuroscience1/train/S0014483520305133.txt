 Reactive oxygen species normally play an important physiological role in health regulating cellular processes and signal transduction . The amount of ROS is usually kept in fine balance with the generation of ROS largely being offset by the body s antioxidants . A tipping of this balance has increasingly been recognised as a contributor to human disease . The retina as a result of its cellular anatomy and physical location is a potent generator of ROS that has been linked to several major retinal diseases . This review will provide a summary of the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy age related macular degeneration myopia retinal vein occlusion retinitis pigmentosa and retinopathy of prematurity . Therapies aimed at controlling oxidative stress in these diseases are also examined .

@highlight Reactive oxygen species play a major role in the pathogenesis of a variety of retinal diseases.
@highlight This review summarises our current understanding of oxidative stress and its effect on a variety of retinal diseases.
@highlight Minimising oxidative stress can prove to be crucial in preventing disease occurrence or progression.
