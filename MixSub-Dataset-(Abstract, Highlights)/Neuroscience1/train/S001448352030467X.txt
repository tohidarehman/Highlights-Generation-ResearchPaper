 To determine the roles of secretory phospholipase A2 IIa samples and tears were collected from patients with mild to severe non Sjogren s dry eye disease and normal controls . The IC samples were analyzed for transcription of sPLA Transcription of sPLA2 IIa was significantly increased in severe DED patients as compared to those of mild DED patients and normal controls . The transcription of inflammatory cytokines chemokines and matrix metalloproteinase 9 were simultaneously increased in the same IC samples of DED . Concentrations of IL 6 and IL 8 in tears were significantly higher in DED patients than those of the controls and positively correlated to DED severity scores . On the other hand IL 2 IL 4 IL 10 IL 12 and IFN were significantly lower in DED patients than those in the controls and inversely correlated to DEWS scores . Single treatment of sPLA2 IIa IL 1 or TNF of HCjE cells induced minimal to no PGE2 production . When sPLA2 IIa was added to HCjE cells that were pre treated with pro inflammatory cytokines significant stimulation of PGE2 production was observed concurrent with the extensive transcriptional changes of many inflammatory cytokines chemokines and their receptors . sPLA
