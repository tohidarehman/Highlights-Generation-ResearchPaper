 We aimed to investigate the associations among lens epithelium telomere length cataract types and systemic pro senescence factors in patients with age related cataract . In this prospective study the general demographic factors body mass index smoking history depression hypertension diabetes various psychological measures and uncorrected distant visual acuity of patients with age related cataract were recorded . Lens Opacities Classification System III scores and lens density measured by Scheimpflug imaging were used to evaluate the cataracts . LETL was measured by real time polymerase chain reaction . Correlations among these parameters were analyzed . The LOCS III nuclear opalescence score was associated with age 0.053

@highlight LOCS III nuclear opacity score but not cortical or posterior subcapsular score was influenced by systemic factors.
@highlight LOCS III scores were positively associated with maximum lens densities.
@highlight With lens epithelium telomere length reduction average lens density decreased significantly.
@highlight Association of lens epithelium telomere length with mean cortical lens density was larger than nucleus.
