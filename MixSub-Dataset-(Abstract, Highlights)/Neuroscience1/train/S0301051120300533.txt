 Emotion regulation is vital for healthy adaptation and influences how individuals respond to and recover from stress . We investigated whether ER improves cardiovascular neuroendocrine and psychological stress responses while taking into account the moderating role of habitual ER tendencies . Eighty six women applied either cognitive reappraisal or expressive suppression while undergoing a stressor . Reappraisal decreased heart rate variability during stress but also initiated a stronger post stress HRV recovery relative to suppression . This reappraisal induced cardiac vagal flexibility was particularly observed in habitual reappraisers . Furthermore the reappraisal group reported enhanced positive affect whereas the suppression group experienced more unpleasantness and expressed higher cortisol levels than controls . Heightened cortisol reactivity was also found in the reappraisal group but only for individuals scoring low or mean on trait reappraisal . These results provide preliminary evidence that reappraisal fosters psychophysiological adaptation in response to stress but also suggest that ER strategy efficacy critically depends on its habitual use .

@highlight Cognitive reappraisal promoted cardiac vagal flexibility during and after acute stress.
@highlight Expressive suppression increased unpleasantness and cortisol reactivity to stress.
@highlight Suppression and not reappraisal enhanced control expectancies about the stressor.
@highlight Trait reappraisal moderated the efficacy of instructed reappraisal.
@highlight Trait suppression did not moderate the efficacy of instructed suppression.
