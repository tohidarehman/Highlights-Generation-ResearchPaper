 Chronic hyperammonemia is a common condition affecting individuals with inherited urea cycle disorders resulting in progressive cognitive impairment and behavioral abnormalities . Altered neurotransmission has been proposed as major source of neuronal dysfunction during chronic hyperammonemia but the molecular pathomechanism has remained incompletely understood . Here we show that chronic exposure to ammonium acetate induces locomotor dysfunction and abnormal feeding behavior in zebrafish larvae indicative for an impairment of higher brain functions . Biochemically chronically elevated ammonium concentrations cause enhanced activity of glutamate decarboxylase isoforms GAD1 and GAD2 with increased formation of GABA and concomitant depletion of glutamate ultimately leading to a dysfunctional hypoglutamatergic and hyperGABAergic metabolic state . Moreover elevated GABA concentrations are accompanied by increased expression of GABA

@highlight Chronic hyperammonemia induces locomotor dysfunction and abnormal feeding behavior.
@highlight Increased GAD activity causes hypoglutamatergic and hyperGABAergic alterations.
@highlight Expression of GABA
@highlight receptor subunits alpha 1 gamma 2 and delta is upregulated.
@highlight Propionate oxidation sufficiently compensates for the withdrawal of 2 oxoglutarate.
