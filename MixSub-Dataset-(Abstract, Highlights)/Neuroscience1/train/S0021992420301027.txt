 Developing a clearer understanding of impairments that underlie the behavioral characteristics of aphasia is essential for the development of targeted treatments and will help inform theories of speech motor control . Impairments in sensorimotor integration of speech in individuals with conduction aphasia have previously been implicated in their repetition deficits . However much less is known about the extent to which these integrative deficits occur outside of conduction aphasia and how this manifests behaviorally in areas other than speech repetition . In this study we aimed to address these issues by examining the behavioral correlates of speech sensorimotor impairment under altered auditory feedback and their relationship with the impaired ability to independently correct for online errors during picture naming in people with aphasia . We found that people with aphasia generate slower vocal compensation response to pitch shift AAF stimuli compared with controls . However when the timing of responses was controlled for no significant difference in the magnitude of vocal pitch compensation was observed between aphasia and control groups . Moreover no relationship was found between self correction of naming errors and the timing and magnitude of vocal compensation responses to AAF . These findings suggest that slowed compensation is a potential behavioral marker of impaired sensorimotor integration in aphasia .

@highlight People with aphasia change their pitch to compensate for altered auditory feedback.
@highlight Vocal pitch compensation is slower in aphasia compared with normal speakers.
@highlight Slowed compensation is not correlated with self correction during naming in aphasia.
