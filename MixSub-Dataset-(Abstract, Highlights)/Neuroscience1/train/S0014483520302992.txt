 Animal studies suggest that the retinal dysfunction in diabetic subjects that precedes overt clinical vasculopathy may be due to a retinal dopamine deficit . We analyzed levels of dopamine and its primary metabolite 3 4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the vitreous of diabetic and non diabetic human subjects . Adult patients undergoing pars plana vitrectomy for non hemorrhagic indications were prospectively recruited from the Emory Eye Center in Atlanta GA. Vitreous samples were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography to measure levels of DOPAC and DA in the vitreous specimens . Vitreous samples from 9 diabetic patients and 20 from non diabetic patients were analyzed . No eyes had apparent diabetic retinopathy . Mean normalized DA concentration in vitreous of diabetic subjects was 0.760.12pg L

@highlight Animal models of diabetes mellitus DM indicate that deficits in retinal dopamine precede vascular dysfunction and contribute to compromised visual function.
@highlight Levels of dopamine and 3 4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid DOPAC in vitreous of human subjects were analyzed.
@highlight No statistically significant differences in dopamine or DOPAC levels were found between samples from type II DM subjects and non diabetic subjects.
