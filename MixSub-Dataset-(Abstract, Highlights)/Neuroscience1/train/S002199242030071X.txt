 Producing speech that is clear audible and intelligible to others is a challenge for many children with cerebral palsy and children with Down syndrome . Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of using the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment to increase vocal loudness and improve speech intelligibility in individuals with dysarthria secondary to Parkinsons disease and some research suggests that it also may be effective for individuals with dysarthria secondary to other conditions including CP and DS . Although LSVT LOUD targets healthy vocal loudness there is some evidence of spreading effects to the articulatory system . Acoustic data from two groups of children with secondary motor speech disorders and one with DS who received a full dose of LSVT LOUD and for whom post treatment intelligibility gains have been previously reported were analyzed for treatment effects on
