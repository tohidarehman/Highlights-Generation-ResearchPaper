 The purpose of this study is to evaluate outflow pathways from subconjunctival blebs and to identify their identity . Post mortem porcine human and bovine eyes were acquired and tracers were injected into the subconjunctival space to create raised blebs where outflow pathways were visualized qualitatively and quantitatively . Rodents with fluorescent reporter transgenes were imaged for structural comparison . Concurrent optical coherence tomography was obtained to study the structural nature of these pathways . Using fixable fluorescent dextrans tracers were trapped to the bleb outflow pathway lumen walls for histological visualization and molecular identification using immunofluorescence against lymphatic and blood vessel markers . Bleb outflow pathways could be observed using all tracers in all species . Quantitative analysis showed that the nasal quadrant had more bleb related outflow pathways compared to the temporal quadrant nasal 1.90.3 pathways vs. temporal 0.70.2 pathways

@highlight Glaucoma bleb forming surgeries rely upon subconjunctival aqueous outflow.
@highlight Subconjunctival drug delivery is limited by subconjunctival aqueous outflow.
@highlight Subconjunctival outflow is hypothesized to be via lymphatics or blood vessels.
@highlight Structural molecular imaging demonstrates use of the lymphatic route.
@highlight Better understood enhancing minimizing lymphatic outflow may benefit eye care.
