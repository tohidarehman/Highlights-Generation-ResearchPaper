 Spinal cord injury induces a secondary degenerative response that causes the loss of spared axons and worsens neurological outcome . The complex molecular mechanisms that mediate secondary axonal degeneration remain poorly understood . To further our understanding of secondary axonal degeneration following SCI we assessed the spatiotemporal dynamics of axonal spheroid and terminal bulb formation following a contusive SCI in real time in vivo .

@highlight Intravital imaging following contusive SCI reveals changes in spinal axons in real time.
@highlight Axons predominantly undergo spheroid formation acutely after contusive SCI.
@highlight Axonal spheroids spread mediolaterally over time indicative of secondary injury.
@highlight Axonal spheroids are highly dynamic and can resolve spontaneously.
@highlight Disrupted axonal transport likely underlies spheroid and endbulb formation.
