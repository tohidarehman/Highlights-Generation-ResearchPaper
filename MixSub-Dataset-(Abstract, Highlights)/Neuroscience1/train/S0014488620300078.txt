 Salicylate intoxication is a cause of tinnitus and comorbidly associated with anxiety in humans . In a previous work we showed that salicylate induces anxiety like behavior and hippocampal type 2 theta oscillations in mice . Here we investigate if the anxiogenic effect of salicylate is dependent on age and previous tinnitus experience . We also tested whether a single dose of DMT can prevent this effect . Using microwire electrode arrays we recorded local field potential in young and old mice to study the electrophysiological effect of tinnitus in the ventral hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex in an open field arena and elevated plus maze 1

@highlight Salicylate causes anxiety only when animals are normal hearing nave to tinnitus 
@highlight Type 2 theta in anxiety spreads from the ventral hippocampus to the medial prefrontal cortex 
@highlight Type 2 theta and slow gamma are complementary encoding safety and danger respectively during anxiety 
@highlight 5 MeO DMT can prevent anxiety driven by tinnitus.
