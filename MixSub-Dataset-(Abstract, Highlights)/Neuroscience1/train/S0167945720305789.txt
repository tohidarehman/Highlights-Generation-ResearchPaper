 We explored the phenomenon of unintentional finger force drift by using visual feedback on the force produced either by explicitly instructed finger pairs or by non instructed finger pairs . In particular we drew contrasting predictions from two hypotheses that force drifts represented consequences of drifts in effector referent coordinates at the level of individual fingers vs. at the level of finger modes . Subjects performed accurate force production with two fingers of a hand index ring or middle little . They received visual feedback on the force produced either by the master fingers or by the other two enslaved fingers . The feedback scale was adjusted to ensure that the subjects did not know the difference between these two randomly presented conditions . Under feedback on the master finger force enslaved force showed a consistent drift upward . Under feedback on the enslaved finger force master force showed a consistent drift downward . The subjects were unaware of the force drifts which could reach over 35 of the initial force magnitude . The data support the hypothesis on drifts in the referent coordinate at the level of individual digits not finger modes as the origin of unintentional force drifts . The consistent increase in the relative amount of force produced by the enslaved fingers suggests that the commonly used methods to quantify enslaving should include relatively brief force production tasks .

@highlight Under visual feedback on instructed finger force enslaved finger force drifts upward 
@highlight Under visual feedback on enslaved finger force instructed finger force drifts downward 
@highlight Subjects are unaware of either force drift 
@highlight Force drift is associated with increased indices of enslaving 
@highlight The results are interpreted within the theory of control with spatial referent coordinates.
