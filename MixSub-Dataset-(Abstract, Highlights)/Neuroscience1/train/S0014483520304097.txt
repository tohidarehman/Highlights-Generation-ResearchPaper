 Due to the unique anatomical structure of the eye ocular drug delivery is a promising delivery route for the treatment of several ocular diseases such as the ocular neovascularization that contributes to diabetic retinopathy . This disease is triggered by inflammation retinal ischemia and or deposits of advanced glycation end products as well as increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor interleukins or reactive oxygen species . Gold has unique antioxidant and antiangiogenic properties and can inhibit angiogenic molecules . Furthermore gold nanoparticles are not only biocompatible they are easy to synthesize they absorb and scatter visible light and they can be made with precise control over size and shape . GNPs are an excellent candidate for ocular drug delivery because they can be conjugated to an extraordinarily diverse array of different biomolecules and surface functionalization can improve the mobility of GNPs across the physiological barriers of the eye such as the vitreous humour or the inner limiting membrane . For this purpose we employed low molecular weight hyaluronan to increase the mobility of the nanoparticles as well as target them to HA receptors that are expressed in different cells of the eye . In this study the combination of gold and HA enhanced the stability of the whole carrier and promoted their distribution across ocular tissues and barriers to reach the retina . Moreover analysis
