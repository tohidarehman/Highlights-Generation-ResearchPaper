 An exploration of the physiological correlates of subjective emotional states has theoretical and practical significance . Previous studies have reported that subjective valence and arousal correspond to facial electromyography and electrodermal activity respectively across stimuli . However the reported results were inconsistent no study investigated subjectivephysiological concordance across time and measures of arousal remain controversial . To investigate these issues while healthy adults

@highlight We assessed dimensional emotional ratings and physiological signals while viewing films.
@highlight The corrugator and zygomatic EMG was associated with valence across stimuli time.
@highlight The palm and forehead EDA was associated with arousal across stimuli time.
@highlight The nose tip temperature was also associated with arousal across stimuli time.
