 Tears have a vital function to protect and lubricate the ocular surface . Tear production distribution and clearance is tightly regulated by the lacrimal functional unit to meet ocular surface demands . The tear film consists of an aqueous mucin layer containing fluid and soluble factors produced by the lacrimal glands and mucin secreted by the goblet cells that is covered by a lipid layer . The array of proteins glycoproteins and lipids in tears function to maintain a stable well lubricated and smooth optical surface . Tear factors also promote wound healing suppress inflammation scavenge free radicals and defend against microbial infection . Disease and dysfunction of the LFU leads to tear instability increased evaporation inflammation and blurred and fluctuating vision . The function of tear components and the consequences of tear deficiency on the ocular surface are reviewed .

@highlight The complex structure and composition of the tear film protects the cornea promotes wound healing and maintains eye comfort and quality vision.
@highlight The integrated lacrimal functional unit regulates tear production and maintains stability.
@highlight Altered tear composition and stability in dry eye cause eye inflammation corneal disease and blurred vision.
