 Structure and function of the retina mainly rely on its fatty acid composition . Evidence from epidemiological studies and from animal experiments indicates that FA composition of the retina is influenced by the diet . Mice under chronic high fat diet develop metabolic syndrome a risk factor for diabetes that is associated with structural and functional alterations of the retina . Here we studied the impact of chronic exposure of mice to HFD on retinal FA composition .

@highlight HFD modifies the relative proportion of retinal linoleic and alpha linolenic acids.
@highlight Imbalance in retinal essential fatty acids had no impact on the DHA and AA content.
@highlight HFD decreases retinal omega 7 MUFAs.
@highlight HFD modulates retinal content in plasmalogens.
