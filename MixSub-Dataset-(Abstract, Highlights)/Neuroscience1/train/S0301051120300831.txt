 Emotional deficits in major depressive disorder lead to changes in the distribution of attention in the visual field . We investigate the impact of unpleasant and neutral pictures presented in central and peripheral vision in 15 depression patients and 15 matched healthy controls . Heart rate skin conductance responses and electroencephalogram were recorded . A spatiotemporal principal component analysis was applied to the EEG and ANCOVAs controlling for participants state and trait anxiety and patients medication were performed to assess the effects of visual eccentricity and emotion . Unlike HC DP showed for CV stimulation 1 greater sensitivity with a response bias toward unpleasant pictures 2 larger SCRs especially to unpleasant pictures and 3 deeper cardiac deceleration . Furthermore eccentricity and emotion modulated cerebral components . Finally results bring a new vista on visual capture of negative information and support methods to enlarge the attentional span of depressed patients .

@highlight Depressed patients showed an opposite pattern of reactivity to controls.
@highlight Patients showed a negativity bias for central CV but not peripheral vision PV .
@highlight Patients enhanced autonomic responses to central but not peripheral presentation.
@highlight Patients showed greater early centro frontal responses to CV presentation.
