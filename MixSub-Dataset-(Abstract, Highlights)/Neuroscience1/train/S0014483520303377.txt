 Scleritis is a sight threatening inflammation characterized by severe pain and redness of the eye . It can cause blindness by severe complications like scleral and corneal necrosis keratitis and uveitis . The pathogenesis of scleritis is largely unknown due to a combination of the rarity of the disease the little available human tissue based research material and the lack of animal models . The immune system is assumed to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of scleritis . Multiple clues indicate probable antigenic stimuli in scleritis and the involvement of matrix metalloproteinases in the destruction of scleral tissue . In this article we review the current insights into the pathogenesis of scleritis and we suggest new hypotheses by implementing knowledge of systemic autoimmune disease pathogenesis . Understanding the pathogenesis of scleritis is crucial to improve the clinical management as well as to find novel treatment modalities .

@highlight The pathogenesis of scleritis a sight threatening ocular inflammation characterized by intense pain is largely unknown.
@highlight Autoimmunity has been hypothesized however defining autoantibodies and or T cell reactivity are not yet clarified.
@highlight Matrix metalloproteinases may be responsible for scleral destruction their blockage may enrich current treatment options.
@highlight Rapidly evolving imaging techniques can provide additional insight in the pathogenesis of scleritis.
