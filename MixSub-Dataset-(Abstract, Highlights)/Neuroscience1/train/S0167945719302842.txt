 Scapular muscle exercise is important for patients with shoulder disorders . Distal variance leads to changes in shoulder muscle activation . Here we aimed to determine whether scapular muscle activation is affected by different arm rotation angles . Overall 30 healthy men participated in this study . The subjects were asked to keep their arms at 120 degrees of shoulder flexion while holding a 1.0 kg dumbbell in palms down and palms up positions . Electromyography was used to measure anterior middle posterior deltoid serratus anterior upper and lower trapezius muscle activation during the task . The muscle activations of each shoulder were compared between the pronation and supination positions . Anterior deltoid and serratus anterior activations were significantly higher in supination than in pronation Scapular muscle activation changed with arm rotation angle . Arm rotation angle should be assessed to estimate scapular muscle activation during exercise and motion analysis in clinical practice .

@highlight Shoulder muscle activation changed with arm rotation angle.
@highlight The relative IEMG of the anterior deltoid and the serratus anterior in supination were higher than those in pronation.
@highlight The relative IEMG of the posterior deltoid and lower trapezius in pronation were higher than those in supination.
