 The lacrimal functional unit regulates tear production composition distribution and clearance to maintain a stable protective tear layer that is essential for maintaining corneal epithelial health . Dysfunction of the LFU commonly referred to as dry eye leads to increased tear osmolarity and levels of inflammatory mediators in tears that cause ocular surface epithelial disease termed keratoconjunctivitis sicca . Corneal changes in KCS include glycocalyx loss barrier disruption surface irregularity inflammatory cytokine chemokine production cornification and apoptosis . These can reduce visual function and the increased shear force on the corneal epithelium can stimulate nociceptors sensitized by inflammation causing irritation and pain that may precede frank clinical signs . Therapy of keratoconjunctivitis sicca should be tailored to improve tear stability normalize tear composition improve barrier function and minimize shear forces and damaging inflammation to improve corneal epithelial health .

@highlight This review highlights the effects of dry eye on the corneal epithelium.
@highlight The corneal epithelium has an essential function of protecting the cornea from environmental insults and inflammation. It also shields the nociceptors in the cornea from damage and sensitizing agents.
@highlight Reduced volume and tear compositional changes in dry eye cause dysfunction and death of the corneal epithelium that alters barrier function and differentiation and stimulates inflammation.
@highlight KCS degrade visual function and cause eye dryness and pain sensations.
