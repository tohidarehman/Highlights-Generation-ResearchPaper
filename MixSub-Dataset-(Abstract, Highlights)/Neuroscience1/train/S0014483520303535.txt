 The anterior surface of the eye functions as a barrier to the external environment and protects the delicate underlying tissues from injury . Central to this protection are the corneal limbal and conjunctival epithelia . The corneal epithelium is a self renewing stratified squamous epithelium that protects the underlying delicate structures of the eye supports a tear film and maintains transparency so that light can be transmitted to the interior of the eye . In this review dedicated to James Funderburgh and his contributions to visual science in particular the limbal niche corneal stroma and corneal stromal stem cells we will focus on recent data on the identification of novel regulators in corneal epithelial cell biology their roles in stem cell homeostasis wound healing limbal corneal boundary maintenance and the utility of single cell RNA sequencing in vision biology studies .
