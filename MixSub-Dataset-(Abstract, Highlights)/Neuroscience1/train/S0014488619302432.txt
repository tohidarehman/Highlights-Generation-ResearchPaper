 Central post stroke pain can occur after stroke in the somatosensory pathway that includes the posterolateral region of the thalamus . Tactile allodynia in which innocuous tactile stimuli are perceived as painful is common in patients with CPSP . Previous brain imaging studies have reported plastic changes in brain activity in patients with tactile allodynia after stroke but a causal relationship between such changes and the symptoms has not been established . We recently developed a non human primate model of CPSP based on thalamic lesions in which the animals show behavioral changes consistent with the occurrence of tactile allodynia . Here we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging under propofol anesthesia to investigate the changes in brain activation associated with the allodynia in this CPSP model . Before the lesion innocuous tactile stimuli significantly activated the contralateral sensorimotor cortex . When behavioral changes were observed after the thalamic lesion equivalent stimuli significantly activated pain related brain areas including the posterior insular cortex secondary somatosensory cortex anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala . Moreover when either PIC SII or ACC was pharmacologically inactivated the signs of tactile allodynia were dampened . Our results show that increased cortical activity plays a role in CPSP induced allodynia .

@highlight Change in brain activation in CPSP monkey model was investigated.
@highlight fMRI showed activation of pain related brain areas including ACC and PIC SII.
@highlight Allodynia was dampened by pharmacological inactivation of ACC or PIC SII.
@highlight These findings suggest that CPSP is mediated by the increased cortical activity.
