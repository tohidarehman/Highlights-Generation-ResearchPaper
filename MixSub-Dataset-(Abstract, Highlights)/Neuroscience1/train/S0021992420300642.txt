 In the course of productive phonological development fricatives are among the last speech sounds to emerge and to be mastered by children probably because of the high degree of articulatory precision they require or because of difficulties with their perception . Children with cochlear implants face additional difficulties with fricative perception since high spectral frequency components are shown to be especially difficult to perceive with a cochlear implant . Studying fricative production in children with CIs allows to study how the partial transmission of speech sounds by cochlear implants influences childrens speech production and therefore to explore how perceptual abilities influence the late stages of phonological development .

@highlight Children with cochlear implants CIs produce fricatives differently from their peers with NH.
@highlight Children with CIs produce f and s with lower centers of gravity than children with NH.
@highlight Children with CIs produce labiodentals f with a smaller standard deviation.
@highlight Children with CIs show less anticipatory coarticulation in consonant vowel sequences.
@highlight Production in older children with CIs is approaching that of children with NH.
