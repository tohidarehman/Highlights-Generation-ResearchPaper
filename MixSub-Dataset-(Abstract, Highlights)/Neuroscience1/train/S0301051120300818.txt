 This study tested two hypotheses of associations between dimensions of social connectedness and cardiovascular reactivity to acute stress high social support predicts diminished cardiovascular responses to stress and diminished cardiovascular responses predict lower social participation a form of motivated behaviour . Participants

@highlight High social support may facilitate lower cardiovascular responses to stress.
@highlight Diminished stress reactivity may predict lower motivated behaviour such as social participation.
@highlight We evaluated both hypotheses in a large midlife sample.
@highlight High social support was associated with higher rather than lower reactivity in unadjusted analyses.
@highlight No robust associations between reactivity and social support or participation were observed.
