 This study examined the effects of attachment styles on physiological responses during a perspective taking task . Sixty eight participants were selected according to attachment styles . Physiological responses were assessed using skin conductance responses in the three attachment groups during the presentation of attachment based pictures in two different perspective taking conditions self perspective taking or other perspective taking . In the self perspective taking condition insecure anxious individuals displayed higher SCRs than secure individuals for distress pictures . In the other perspective taking condition insecure anxious individuals showed higher SCRs than secure individuals for comfort pictures . The results also showed a strong negative association between self reported perspective taking tendencies and SCRs in secure individuals . The findings suggest that perspective taking plays an important role in the modulation of physiological responses in reaction to attachment related pictures which varies according to attachment styles .

@highlight Perspective taking effects depend upon individual factors such as attachment styles
@highlight While adopting a self perspective insecure anxious individuals displayed higher physiological responses than secure individuals
@highlight Secure individuals who had the highest scores in perspective taking tendencies displayed the lowest levels of physiological responses when faced with the distress of others
