 Experimental evidence suggests that dopamine modulates refractive eye growth . We evaluated whether increasing endogenous DA activity using pharmacological or genetic approaches decreased myopia susceptibility in mice . First we assessed the effects of systemic L 3 4 dihydroxyphenylalanine injections on form deprivation myopia in C57BL 6J WT

@highlight Systemic L DOPA administration prevents form deprivation myopia in mice.
@highlight The dopamine packaging protein VMAT2 may affect early form deprivation myopia.
@highlight Endogenously increased dopamine activity prevents form deprivation myopia in mice.
