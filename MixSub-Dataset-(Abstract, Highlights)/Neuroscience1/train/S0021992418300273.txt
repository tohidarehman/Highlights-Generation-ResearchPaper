 The purpose of this follow up study to Ludlow was to examine potential sources of variability within attributional ratings adults assigned to child speakers affected by either Specific Language Impairment or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder . Factors considered were raters gender or Rater Female the reported gender of the speakers or Speaker Female and the type of neurodevelopmental disorder involved . Eighty participants rated brief transcribed narratives previously produced in Ludlow by boys affected by either SLI ADHD or who had typical neurodevelopment . Narratives were presented to raters as having been generated by either a boy or a girl . After reading each narrative participants provided ratings in response to 15 questions about the narrative the child speakers attributes and family background . Analyses revealed a significant main effect for speaker group such that raters assigned more pejorative attributes to children with a disorder across all dimensions . Significant speaker gender main effects were limited to questions targeting the speakers behavioral attributes . Results obtained in this study with transcription stimuli replicated previous reports that had used audio stimuli . These findings contribute to a growing body of research documenting the presence of robust multidimensional implicit negative biases among most individuals towards children displaying language differences associated with common neurodevelopmental disorders .

@highlight Gender of rater did not influence ratings of children male or female .
@highlight Children with disorders are rated more negatively than typical neurodeveloping children.
@highlight Male children are perceived as having more potential behavior issues than female children.
@highlight There was a highly similar rating pattern between orthographic transcriptions and audio retellings of the same narratives.
