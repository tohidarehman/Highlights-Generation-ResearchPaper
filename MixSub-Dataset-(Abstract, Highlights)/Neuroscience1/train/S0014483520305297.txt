 Previous studies have reported that endothelial to mesenchymal transition contributes to pathological fibrosis in proliferative diabetic retinopathy . The hypothesis of our study was that exosomes from high glucose treated ARPE19cells reprogram endothelial cell behavior in HG conditions by transferring their genetic contents . Our study showed that ARPE19 derived exosomes were internalized by human umbilical vein endothelial cells . Additionally miR 202 5p a miRNA known to target TGFR2 was enriched in ARPE19 derived exosomes . A dual luciferase reporter assay qPCR and western blotting were used to characterize the expression of miR 202 5p and phosphorylation of the TGF Smad pathway proteins . We showed that miR 202 5p containing exosomes suppressed HUVEC cell growth migration and tube formation . Furthermore TGFR2 was confirmed as the target of miR 202 5p . A dual luciferase reporter assay showed that TGFR2 expression was negatively regulated by miR 202 5p . We also showed that miR 202 5p containing exosomes suppressed HG induced EndoMT . These collective results suggested that ARPE derived exosomes may serve as significant mediators of cell to cell crosstalk to suppress EndoMT by transferring miR 202 5p through the TGF Smad pathway and may be a potential treatment for PDR patients .
