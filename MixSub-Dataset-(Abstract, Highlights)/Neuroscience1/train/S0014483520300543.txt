 We aim to determine whether lymphatic drainage from the eye changes with age . Using quantitative photoacoustic tomography groups of young and older mice were studied in the live state . 10 CD 1 mice of 23 months were studied in addition to 13 older mice of 1213 months . In each of 23 mice near infrared tracer was injected into the right eye and imaging of ipsilateral cervical lymph nodes was performed with laser pulses at 11 different wavelengths prior to and 20min 2 4 and 6h after injection . Mean pixel intensities of nodes were calculated at each imaging session . The areas under the curves were calculated for both groups of mice and compared using the

@highlight A novel non invasive photoacoustic imaging approach was used to quantify lymphatic drainage from the eye.
@highlight Lymphatic drainage from the eye was found to be reduced in older compared to younger mice.
@highlight Age related decline of ocular lymphatic function and impaired clearance of proteins from the eye may be relevant to the understanding and treatment of age related eye diseases.
