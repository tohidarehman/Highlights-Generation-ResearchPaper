 The study aimed to evaluate the intraocular pharmacokinetics and efficacy of aflibercept after subconjunctival injection in animal models for treating choroidal neovascularization associated with Age Related Macular Degeneration . New Zealand albino rabbits received aflibercept in one eye and the other eye was used as control . At 7 14 21 and 28 days the animals were sacrificed to dissect the ocular tissues and serum was collected at 1hr 3h 1 7 14 21 and 28 days . The concentration of aflibercept in various ocular tissues and serum were measured using the immunoassay technique . The concentration maximum C

@highlight A delivery system that could release aflibercept in the subconjunctival space for a longer period as well to protect it from the conjunctival clearance to avoid increased systemic exposure would be highly beneficial.
@highlight The subconjunctival aflibercept could be a less invasive route for treating chorioretinal diseases.
