 Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell derived small extracellular vesicles but not fibroblast sEV provide retinal ganglion cell neuroprotection both

@highlight Damage to the optic nerve leads to permanent loss of retinal ganglion cells RGC .
@highlight Neuroprotective strategies are required to prevent loss of RGC and function.
@highlight The ability of miRNA to down regulate mRNA makes them a candidate treatment.
@highlight Here we deliver multiple miRNA to retinae of animals prior to optic nerve crush.
@highlight Combinations of miRNA are able to prevent RGC loss and preserve their function.
