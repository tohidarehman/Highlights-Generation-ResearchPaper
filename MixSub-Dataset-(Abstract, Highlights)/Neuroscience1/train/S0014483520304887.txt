 One of the major public health issues is the rising prevalence of cataracts a primary reason for preventable blindness . The causes for the development of age related cataracts and accelerated cataractogenesis in diabetes are multifactorial . Hence this study was designed to examine the status and relationship between the three majorly associated molecular events namely oxidative stress non enzymatic glycation and polyol pathway in age related cataracts with and without diabetes . A total of 472 subjects were distributed into four groups non diabetic subjects with clear lens diabetic subjects with clear lens non diabetic subjects with cataract and diabetic subjects with cataract . Cataracts were graded by slit lamp examination according to the Lens Opacities Classification System III . Age at onset of cataract type of opacity anthropometric measurements and sociodemographic characteristics were recorded and clinical profile was examined . Plasma oxidative stress markers were assessed by estimating the lipid peroxidation end product malondialdehyde protein oxidation products protein carbonyls and DNA oxidative damage marker 8 hydroxy 2 deoxyguanosine . Plasma advanced glycation end products index erythrocyte aldose reductase activity and sorbitol levels were evaluated . After adjusting for age plasma malondialdehyde levels were significantly higher in diabetic cataracts

@highlight Nuclear cataract was more predominant in both diabetic and non diabetic subjects.
@highlight Lipid peroxidation in age related cataracts is independent of diabetes.
@highlight Only the presence of diabetes augmented plasma advanced glycation index.
@highlight Disease free aging and controlled diabetes activated the polyol pathway equally.
