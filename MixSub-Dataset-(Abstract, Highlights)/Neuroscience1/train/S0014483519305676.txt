 The eye lens is mainly composed of crystallins which undergo modifications such as oxidation deamidation and isomerization with aging . Asp58 Asp76 Asp84 and Asp151 residues of A crystallin are site specifically isomerized to L iso D and D iso isomers in aged related cataract lenses . In addition an A6680 peptide corresponding to the 6680

@highlight A substation to the L iso form at Asp76 in A6680 peptides changed its properties.
@highlight The A6680 peptide containing L iso Asp76 gains chaperone activity.
@highlight The A6680 peptide containing L iso Asp76 has sheet structure.
