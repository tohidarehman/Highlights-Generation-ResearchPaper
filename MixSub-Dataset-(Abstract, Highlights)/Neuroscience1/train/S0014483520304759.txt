 In the adult retina ramifying microglia interact with the outer plexiform layer monitoring the synaptic integrity between photoreceptors and post synaptic target cells . Microglia are reactive during photoreceptor diseases but their disease related function are not fully understood . Retinal explant cultures are model systems used to study degenerative events including photoreceptor degeneration and gliosis . Our culture paradigm with adult porcine retinas subjected to coculture with human A retinal pigment epithelia 19 cells is an experimental approach resulting in improved photoreceptor survival and reduced gliosis . Under the

@highlight Microglial cells are reactive in cultured porcine retina.
@highlight Reactive Iba1 and CD11b immunolabeled microglia localize close to PSD95 immunolabeled photoreceptor terminals in the OPL.
@highlight Coculture with ARPE cells increase the density of reactive microglia at the OPL.
@highlight Microglia with dark cytoplasm localized at the OPL can be identified by electron microscopy.
@highlight The presumptive dark microglia are closely associated with synaptic profiles in the OPL.
