 Non mammalian models of CIPN remain relatively sparse but the knowledge gained from the few published studies suggest that these species have great potential to serve as a discovery platform for new pathways and underlying genetic mechanisms of CIPN . These models permit large scale genetic and pharmacological screening and they are highly suitable for

@highlight and zebrafish as chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity models
@highlight imaging revealed new CIPN mechanisms with conserved functions in mammals.
@highlight NMNAT DLK and MORN are major players in the control of paclitaxel induced axon degeneration.
@highlight ROS and altered microtubule function are aberrant in paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathy.
@highlight Epidermal damage contributes to paclitaxel neurotoxicity through activation of MMP 13.
