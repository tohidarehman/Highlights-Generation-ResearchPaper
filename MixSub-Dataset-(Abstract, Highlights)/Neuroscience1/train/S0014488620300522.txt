 Mechanisms underlying affective and cognitive deficits in Parkinson s disease remain less studied than motor symptoms . Nucleus accumbens is affected in PD and due to its well known involvement in motivation is an interesting target in this context . Furthermore PD is frequently asymmetrical with side specific deficits aligning with evidences of accumbal laterality . We therefore used a 6 hydroxydopamine model to study the role of left and right NAc dopamine depletion in a battery of behavioral tasks .

@highlight Non motor and side specific symptoms of PD are frequently underappreciated.
@highlight Behavioral impact of left and right dopamine depletion in the Nucleus Accumbens was analyzed.
@highlight Right sided dopamine depletion potentiated habitual behaviors.
@highlight Left sided dopamine depletion increased impulsivity.
@highlight No alterations in motor and anxiety and depressive like behaviors were observed.
