 Impairment of anticipatory postural adjustments is an important source of postural instability in older adults and individuals with neurological disorders . The aim of the study was to investigate whether APAs could be improved in people with stroke as a result of targeted exercise involving their unaffected upper extremity . Nine individuals with stroke and five healthy control individuals participated in the laboratory tests before and after a single session of practice consisting of pushing a medicine ball attached to the ceiling and stopping the ball with their palm when it returns . The tests included self initiated perturbations induced by fast discrete shoulder flexion movements and external perturbations induced by a pendulum impact . Bilateral EMG activity of eight trunk and leg muscles was recorded and analyzed during the anticipatory phase of postural control . Significantly early APAs onsets

@highlight Anticipatory postural adjustments in individuals with stroke were studied.
@highlight Exercises involved pushing a medicine ball attached to a ceiling.
@highlight Early activation of muscles was recorded after exercises.
@highlight Improvements of anticipatory postural adjustments were seen on the affected side.
