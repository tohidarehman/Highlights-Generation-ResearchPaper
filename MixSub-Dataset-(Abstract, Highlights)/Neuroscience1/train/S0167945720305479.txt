 The acquisition of high level motor skills beyond a plateau is important in sports training and rehabilitation . We aimed to investigate whether motor skills close to a plateau state can be improved further by performing motor imagery training while observing movements with difficulty levels optimized for individual motor skills . The subjects were divided randomly into four groups

@highlight The difficulty suitable for motor imagery with action observation MIAO training is unknown.
@highlight We tested the most effective difficulty to improve motor skills in MIAO training.
@highlight There was an inverse U shaped relationship between difficulty and learning benefit.
@highlight Optimized MIAO training has potential benefits for rehabilitation and sports training.
