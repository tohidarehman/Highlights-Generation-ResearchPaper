 Spatial constituents of adult symbolic number representation produce effects of size value congruity Spatial Numerical Association of Response Codes and numerical distance . According to behavioral experiments these effects belong to distinct processing stages . Yet these effects evoke overlapping responses in both early and late Event Related Potentials . To probe whether these overlaps indicate sharing of resources all relevant stimulus and response conditions were factorially combined in a numerical value comparison task . To secure ERP validity same numbers were compared against variable reference values . This design resulted in previously unobserved interactions in behavior but inhibited late ERP effects . All effects arose early in the P1 component and most showed hemispheric specificity . Independency of congruity and SNARC effects was observed whereas SNARC and numerical distance were closely intertwined . Differences in hemispheric specificity rather than stage wise separation were key to independence .

@highlight Investigation of interdependence of Size congruity SNARC and numerical distance effect.
@highlight A factorial design encompassing all three effects combined with EEG measurement comparing across identical visual stimuli.
@highlight All effects relating to spatial associations of symbolic numbers appear at an early stage of processing P1 .
@highlight Independence of size congruity and SNARC effects a matter of hemispheric specialization.
