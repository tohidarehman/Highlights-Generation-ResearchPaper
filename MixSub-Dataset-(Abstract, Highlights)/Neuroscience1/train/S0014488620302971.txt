 Senescence was recently linked to neurodegeneration and astrocytes are one of the major cell types to turn senescent under neurodegenerative conditions . Senescent astrocytes were detected in Parkinson s disease patients brains besides reactive astrocytes yet the difference between senescent and reactive astrocytes is unclear . We aimed to characterize senescent astrocytes in comparison to reactive astrocytes and investigate differences and similarities . In a cell culture model of human fetal astrocytes we determined a unique senescent transcriptome distinct from reactive astrocytes which comprises dysregulated pathways . Both senescent and reactive human astrocytes activated a proinflammatory pattern . Astrocyte senescence was at least partially depending on active mechanistic target of rapamycin and DNA damage response signaling both drivers of senescence . To further investigate how PD and senescence connect to each other we asked if a PD linked environmental factor induces senescence and if senescence impairs midbrain neurons . We could show that the PD linked pesticide rotenone causes astrocyte senescence . We further delineate that the senescent secretome exaggerates rotenone induced neurodegeneration in midbrain neurons differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells of PD patients with alpha synuclein gene

@highlight Senescent astrocytes express a unique transcriptome pattern.
@highlight A proinflammatory state is activated in both senescent and reactive astrocytes.
@highlight Stress induced senescence in astrocytes depends at least in part on active mTOR and DDR signaling.
@highlight The PD linked pesticide rotenone induces astrocyte senescence.
@highlight Human
@highlight duplication neurons exhibit a rotenone dependent vulnerability to senescent stimuli.
