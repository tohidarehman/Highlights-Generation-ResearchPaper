 The impact of stress on the dehydroepiandrosterone response in older population is understudied . This study investigated in healthy older people whether the DHEA and cortisol responses to the Trier Social Stress Test was related to performance on this task . Both speech and arithmetic performance were assessed . Sixty five participants were exposed to the TSST . Increases in negative affect state anxiety and cortisol levels could be observed but there were no significant changes in positive affect or DHEA levels . Interestingly a larger DHEA response was related to better verbal performance after controlling for the cortisols reactivity . No relationships were found between hormonal responses and the arithmetic task performance . Our results suggest that in healthy older people an increase in DHEA levels in response to acute psychosocial stress may help them to cope with this stressor by increasing verbal performance .

@highlight Older people did not show a significant DHEA response to acute stress.
@highlight No sex related differences in the DHEA response were found.
@highlight DHEA reactivity predicted verbal performance after controlling for cortisol reactivity.
@highlight Cortisol and DHEA did not predict arithmetic task performance.
