 Fatigue is a distressing symptom inversely related to postural stability in adults with neuromuscular and systemic diseases . However there is no information about the effects of lower limb muscles fatigability on the movement strategies for balance control in the upright standing . This study enrolled 41 healthy subjects female male 22 19 age 233years body mass index 25.43.7kg m Mean time to muscle fatigability was 258190s . Lower limb muscle fatigability increases postural instability but it is not associated with changes in movement strategies for balance control in the upright stance .

@highlight Fatigue is a distressing symptom inversely related to postural stability.
@highlight Displacement of body s center of pressure increases due to muscle fatigability.
@highlight Velocity of center of pressure also increases due to muscle fatigability.
@highlight Ankle and hip movement strategies remain unchanged after lower limb fatigue.
