 Ischemic stroke has become one of the main causes of death worldwide . MicroRNAs have been implicated in cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury and could serve as therapeutic targets . 5 Lipoxygenase is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes and has been implicated in inflammatory central nerve system disorders . The objective of this study was to explore the neuroprotective effects of miR 193b 3p against focal cerebral I R injury in rats by regulating 5 LOX expression . Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion injury . The level of miR 193b 3p expression was observed in the rat cortical peri infarct region after focal cerebral I R injury . Bioinformatics analysis was used to predict the binding sites of miR 193b 3p and a dual luciferase reporter gene assay was applied to verify the potential interaction between 5 LOX mRNA and miR 193b 3p . Then rats were injected with a miR 193b 3p agomir or antagomir in the right lateral ventricle of the brain . Neurological deficit scores infarct volumes neuron damage and 5 LOX enzymatic activity and expression were measured . In an in vitro experiment cultured PC12 cells were exposed to oxygenglucose deprivation and reperfusion . OGD R induced cells were treated with a miR 193b 3p mimic or inhibitor and 5 LOX siRNA . Cell viability lactate dehydrogenase release apoptosis rate and 5 LOX expression were evaluated . The level of miR 193b 3p expression was increased in the cortical peri infarct region of rats with cerebral focal I R injury . The results of the dual luciferase reporter gene assay showed that a miR 193b 3p binding site was located in the 3 untranslated region of 5 LOX mRNA . Neurological deficit scores infarct volumes and neuronal injury were alleviated by miR 193b 3p agomir treatment but aggravated by miR 193b 3p antagomir . Furthermore leukotriene B4 cysteinyl leukotrienes and 5 LOX expression in the cortical peri infarct region of rats with focal cerebral I R injury were also downregulated by miR 193b 3p agomir treatment but upregulated by miR 193b 3p antagomir . In PC12 cells miR 193b 3p mimic significantly decreased OGD R induced cell death and reduced lactate dehydrogenase release and 5 LOX expression . In contrast miR 193b 3p inhibitor exacerbated OGD R induced injury in PC12 cells . Additionally the in vitro effects of miR 193b 3p inhibitor on OGD R induced cell injury were partially reversed by 5 LOX siRNA treatment . MiR 193b 3p has a potentially neuroprotective effect on focal cerebral I R induced injury by inhibiting 5 LOX expression .

@highlight The miR 193b 3p was significantly up regulated in the rat penumbra cerebral cortex responding to a ischemic stroke.
@highlight miR 193b 3p could bind with the 3UTR 5 LOX mRNA and suppress its translation.
@highlight Exogenous miR 193b 3p could reduce rat brain infarct size and promote neurological recovery after ischemic stroke.
@highlight 5 LOX is a downstream component in the miR 193b 3p neuroprotective pathway.
