 Diabetic retinopathy is the most common complication of diabetes . Proliferative DR is a more advanced stage of DR which can cause severe impaired vision and even blindness . However the precise pathological mechanisms of PDR remain unknown . DNA methylation serves an important role in the initiation and progression of numerous types of disease including PDR . The purpose of this study was to identify the aberrantly methylated differentially expressed genes as potential therapeutic targets of PDR . The gene expression microarray dataset GSE60436 and the methylation profiling microarray dataset GSE57362 were used to determine the aberrantly methylated DEGs in PDR utilizing normal retinas as controls and fibrovascular membranes in patients with PDR as PDR samples . The functional term and signaling pathway enrichment analysis of the selected genes were subsequently performed . In addition protein protein interaction networks were constructed to determine the hub genes and the network of transcriptional factor and target hub genes was also analyzed . In total 132 hypomethylated genes were found to be upregulated whereas 172 hypermethylated genes were discovered to be downregulated in PDR . The hypomethylated upregulated genes were found to be enriched in the pathways such as cell substrate adhesion adherens junction cell adhesion molecule binding and extracellular matrix receptor interactions . Meanwhile the hypermethylated downregulated genes were enriched in the pathways such as visual perception presynapse and the synaptic vesicle cycle . Based on the PPI analysis a total of eight hub genes were identified

@highlight The present study was the first integrative analysis of DNA methylation alterations and gene expression differences in PDR.
@highlight Numerous aberrantly methylated differentially expressed genes were screened between PDR patients and healthy participants.
@highlight 8 hub genes
