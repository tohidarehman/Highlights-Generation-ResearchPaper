 In order to study the pathophysiological alterations of the ciliary body during persistent hypotony it is necessary to develop an animal model without CB injury . In this study we successfully established a modified model of persistent hypotony without CB injury in New Zealand rabbits . A 23 gauge pars plana vitrectomy was performed and a trocar formed fistula was allowed to remain

@highlight A model of hypotony without ciliary body injury is essential.
@highlight We established a model of persistent hypotony without ciliary body injury.
@highlight This is the only animal model that simulates secondary changes of hypotony.
@highlight This model represents a valuable tool for studying hypotony.
