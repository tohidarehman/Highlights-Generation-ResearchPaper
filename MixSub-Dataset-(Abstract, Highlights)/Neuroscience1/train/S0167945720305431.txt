 The understanding of fatigue of the human motor system is important in the fields of ergonomics sport rehabilitation and neurology . In order to understand the interactions between fatigue and reaction time we evaluated the effects of two different fatiguing tasks on reaction time . 83 healthy subjects were included in a case control study with three arms where single and double choice reaction time tasks were performed before and after 2min fatiguing task . After an isometric task the right fatigued hand was slower in the choice component of a double choice reaction time task also the subjects that felt more fatigued had slower choice reaction time respect to the baseline assessment . Moreover in relationship to the performance decay after two minutes finger tapping task produces more intense fatigability perception . We confirmed that two minutes of isometric or repetitive tasks are enough to produce fatigue . The fatigue perception is more intense for finger tapping tasks in relation to the performance decay . We therefore confirmed that the two fatiguing tasks produced two different kind of fatigue demonstrating that with a very simple protocol it is possible to test subjects or patients to quantify different form of fatigue .

@highlight Two minutes of isometric or finger tapping tasks are enough to produce fatigue.
@highlight An isometric task and a finger tapping task produces a different fatigability.
@highlight In relationship to the performance decay finger tapping task produces more intense fatigability perception.
@highlight The effects of fatigue on reaction time RT depends on the task employed.
