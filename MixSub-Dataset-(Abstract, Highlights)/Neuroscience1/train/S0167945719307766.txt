 During walking older adults gait is slower they take shorter steps and rely less on ankle and more on knee and hip joint moments and powers compared to young adults . Previous studies have suggested that walking speed and step length are confounds that affect joint moments and powers . Our purpose was to examine the effects of walking speed and step length manipulation on net joint moments and powers in young and older adults . Sixteen young and 18 older adults completed walking trials at three speeds under three step length conditions as marker position and force platform data were captured synchronously . Net joint moments were quantified using inverse dynamics and were subsequently used to compute net joint powers . Average extensor moments at each joint during the stance phase were then computed . Older adults displayed greater knee extensor moment compared to young adults . Older adults showed trends

@highlight Net joint moments increased with walking speed and step length SL .
@highlight Older vs. young adults had higher knee moments across speed SL conditions.
@highlight Ankle and hip moment were not different for older and young adults.
