 Biological theories of aggression propose that autonomic nervous system hypo reactivity may be more specific to proactive aggression whereas ANS hyper reactivity may be specific to reactive aggression . However the research findings in this area are mixed . Furthermore no study to date has examined whether emotion dysregulation moderates the aggression ANS relationship . The present study examined electrodermal activity respiratory sinus arrhythmia and heart rate reactivity in 76 undergraduate participants in response to a provocation task relative to baseline . Results showed that blunted HR reactivity was associated with increased proactive aggression . RSA augmentation and blunted EDA reactivity were both associated with increased proactive and reactive aggression but only among those above the sample mean on emotion dysregulation . Thus emotion dysregulation may play a key role in the relationship between ANS reactivity and both reactive and proactive aggression .

@highlight Blunted heart rate reactivity was uniquely associated with increased proactive aggression.
@highlight Emotion dysregulation moderated the relationship between physiology and aggression.
@highlight RSA augmentation was associated with increased aggression across forms.
@highlight Blunted EDA reactivity was associated with increased aggression across forms.
@highlight These associations occurred only among those above average on emotion dysregulation.
