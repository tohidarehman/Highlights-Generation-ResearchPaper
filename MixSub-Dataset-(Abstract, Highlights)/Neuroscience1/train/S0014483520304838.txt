 The aim of this study was to elucidate the intracellular sources of oxidant species the antioxidant response as well as the main signaling pathways involved in the regulation of the redox balance in the primary visual cortex of rats subjected to an experimental glaucoma model .

@highlight The primary visual cortex is target of oxidative damage and both lipids and proteins are vulnerable.
@highlight NOX4 is a source of ROS in glaucoma contributing to the pro oxidant environment.
@highlight Glaucoma alters brain GSH GSSG ratio by impairment of GSH synthesis and recycling.
@highlight iNOS is a source of NO in glaucoma due to NF kB translocation into the nucleus.
@highlight Nrf2 expression is decreased in glaucoma compromising the cell antioxidant capacity.
