 Accumulation of amyloid peptide and hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain is one of the pathological characteristics of Alzheimer s disease and attractive therapeutic targets in its treatment . In the present study the cognitive ability of 4 month old 3Tg AD mice significantly improved after 40days treatment with intraperitoneal injection of 2.25mg kg of SLOH which is a multifunctional carbazole based cyanine fluorophore . It reduced A deposition tau levels and its hyperphosphorylation by modulating AKT and promoting protein phosphatase 2A activity in the brain as well as in the primary neurons of 3Tg AD mice . Moreover SLOH attenuated synaptic deficit both in vitro and in vivo by regulating the Ca
