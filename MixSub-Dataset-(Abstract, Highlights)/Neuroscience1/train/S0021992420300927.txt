 Prosodic impairments occur in many clinical populations including those with autism and motor speech disorders . These impairments can negatively impact intelligibility as well as an individuals ability to signal and understand linguistic contrasts and emotions . For this study we surveyed 245 Speech Language Pathologists to assess their clinical practices with regards to prosody and to identify potential barriers to addressing prosody in the clinic . While a majority of respondents agreed that prosody was within their scope of practice they reported that they rarely assessed or treated prosody when they suspected that a client had a prosodic impairment . Overall respondents felt they were lacking in knowledge of the nature of prosody experience with clients who have prosodic impairments and knowledge of assessment and treatment methods for prosody . Recommendations include increasing training opportunities encouraging collaboration between researchers and SLPs with expertise in prosody and the development of a clinically feasible prosody assessment .
