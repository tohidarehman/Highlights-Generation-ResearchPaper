 We tested the hypothesis that exposure to intermittent hypoxia during pregnancy would prolong the laryngeal chemoreflex and diminish the capacity of serotonin to terminate the LCR . Prenatal exposure to IH was associated with significant prolongation of the LCR in younger anesthetized postnatal day rat pups age P8 to P16 compared to control room air exposed rat pups of the same age . Serotonin microinjected into the NTS shortened the LCR in rat pups exposed to RA during gestation but 5 HT failed to shorten the LCR in rat pups exposed to prenatal IH . Given these observations we tested the hypothesis that prenatal hypoxia would decrease binding to 5 HT

@highlight Prenatal exposure to IH was associated with prolongation of the LCR in younger postnatal P rat pups age P8 to P16 but not older pups
@highlight Serotonin 5 HT Microinjected serotonin in the nucleus of the solitary tract shortened the LCR in pups exposed to room air but not in pups exposed to prenatal IH.
@highlight The 5 HT
@highlight receptor binding in the nucleus of the solitary tract was reduced in IH exposed pups age P8 to P12 but not in RA exposed ups of the same age
@highlight Prenatal IH sensitized the LCR reduce 5 HT
@highlight receptor binding and blunted serotonergically mediated termination of the LCR.
