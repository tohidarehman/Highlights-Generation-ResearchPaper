 Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion promotes the development of Alzheimer s pathology . However whether and how CCH impairs the synaptic vesicle trafficking is still unclear . In the present study we found that the hippocampal glutamatergic vesicle trafficking was impaired as indicated by a significant shortened delayed response enhancement phase in CA3 CA1 circuit and decreased synapsin I in CCH rats suffering from bilateral common carotid artery occlusion . Further study showed an upregulated
