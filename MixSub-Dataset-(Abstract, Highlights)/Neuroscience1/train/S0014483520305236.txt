 The dog is an important animal model for tear dysfunction diseases however to date the electrolyte composition of the dog s tears is unknown . The aim of this study was to analyze the electrolyte content of canine tears and compare it to serum and plasma . Tear samples were collected from 18 eyes of 9 dogs . Blood for serum was collected in tubes with no anticoagulants plasma was obtained by using two different anticoagulants Citrate Phosphate Dextrose and heparin . The electrolytes were measured in all samples analyzed and compared . Most of the electrolyte values in tears were statistically different from electrolyte values in serum and plasma . Potassium and chloride values were significantly higher in tears compared to serum and plasma while calcium and phosphate values were significantly lower . Sodium values in tears were higher than in serum and heparinized plasma but lower than CPD plasma . Bicarbonate values were lower in tears compared to serum and heparinized plasma but was not statistically different than CPD plasma . While magnesium values were lower in tears compared to serum and heparinized plasma the difference was not statistically different . Herein we report for the first time the electrolyte composition of the canine tears and its comparison to serum and plasma .
