 is a common bacterial isolate from cases of microbial keratitis . The virulence factors that contribute to its pathogenicity during this disease have not been fully resolved . The aim of the current study was to examine the effects of the extracellular protease Staphopain A on corneal virulence . Two strains were used one Staph 38 that gives a high pathology score during keratitis and a less virulent strain ATCC 8325 4 . The effect of inhibition of Staphopain by general or specific protease inhibitors on adhesion of strains to fibronectin coated glass or PMMA was determined . This was followed by an analysis of the effect of Staphopain A on the ability of the bacteria to adhere to and invade corneal epithelial cells . Finally the effect of inhibiting Staphopain A on pathogenesis in a mouse model of keratitis was studied . Staphopain A increased the adhesion of strains to fibronectincoated substrata and inhibition of Staphopain A reduced adhesion . The inhibition of Staphopain A by staphostatin A significantly decreased both association with and invasion into human corneal epithelial cells by 15 fold for strain Saur38 . Inhibition of Staphopain A significantly reduced the pathology associated with
