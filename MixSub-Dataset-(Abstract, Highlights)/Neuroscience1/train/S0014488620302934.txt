 Traumatic brain injury has been regarded as one of the leading cause of injury related death and disability . White matter injury after TBI is characterized by axon damage and demyelination resulting in neural network impairment and neurological deficit . Brain derived neurotrophic factor can promote white matter repair . The activation of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma has been reported to promote microglia macrophages towards anti inflammatory state and therefore to promote axon regeneration . Bexarotene an agonist of retinoid X receptor can activate RXR PPAR heterodimers . The aim of the present study was to identify the effect of bexarotene on BDNF in microglia macrophages and axon sprouting after TBI in mice . Bexarotene was administered intraperitoneally in C57BL 6 mice undergoing controlled cortical impact . PPAR dependency was determined by intraperitoneal administration of a PPAR antagonist T0070907 . We found that bexarotene promoted axon regeneration indicated by increased growth associated protein 43 expression myelin basic protein expression and biotinylated dextran amine
