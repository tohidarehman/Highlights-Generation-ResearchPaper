 Most patients with chronic dry eye disease have episodic flares which can be triggered by a variety of activities and environmental stresses . These flares are typically associated with rapid exacerbation of discomfort symptoms followed by prolonged elevation of inflammation . In an acute flare ocular surface inflammation begins with a nonspecific innate immune response in some cases followed by a slower but more specific adaptive immune response . At the ocular surface epithelial cells are central to the innate immune response and we discuss their role in DED flares alongside the other core components . Epithelial cells and other cells of the innate response trigger flares in response to increased osmolarity detected via pattern receptors on their cell surface . Ultimately downstream signaling pathways activate innate and adaptive immune responses with consequent inflammation and symptoms . In chronic DED pathogenic T cells have infiltrated the ocular surface tissues . The established adaptive immune response is likely to lead to flare ups at lower thresholds of stress with inflammation maintained over a longer period . Increased understanding of the inflammatory cascades activated during a flare may guide management and improve outcomes .
