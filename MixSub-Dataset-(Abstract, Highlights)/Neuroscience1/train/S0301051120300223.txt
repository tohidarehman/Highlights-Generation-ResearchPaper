 We ask whether actions of the norepinephrine system during response inhibition are affected by properties of lower level sensory stimulus processing . We used a somato sensory Go Nogo task and combined ERP recordings with pupil diameter recordings as an index of NE system activity . The Go Nogo task was designed to achieve processing of tactile stimuli predominantly over primary somatosensory and secondary somatosensory areas . The data show that response inhibition was better when stimuli were processed via SII compared to SI areas . This was reflected by variations in the Nogo N2 P3 associated with anterior cingulate structures . Correlations with the pupil diameter data indicting modulations of the NE system during inhibitory control processes were only evident when SI sensory areas were involved . These dissociable modulatory effects were associated with activations in the superior frontal gyrus . Actions of the NE system during response inhibition are modulated by properties of lower level processing .

@highlight Impact of lower level sensory processes on response inhibition is examined.
@highlight The NE system is examined using pupil diameter data and integrated with EEG.
@highlight Action of the NE system during response inhibition is determined by lower level processes.
