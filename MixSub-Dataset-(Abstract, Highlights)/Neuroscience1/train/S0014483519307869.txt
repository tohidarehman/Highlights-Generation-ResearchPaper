 Bombina variegata 8 also known as prokineticin 2 is a potent pro angiogenic factor . However its role in retinal neovascularization remains unknown . In this study we explored the role of Bv8 in the pathogenesis of RNV . We found that the expression of Bv8 was significantly increased in two different models of retinal neovascularization the oxygen induced retinopathy mouse model and the rhodopsin promoter VEGF transgenic mouse model . Neutralization of Bv8 by intravitreal injections of its antibody not only inhibited retinal and subretinal neovascularization but also decreased the mRNA and protein levels of several pro angiogenic factors . Our in vitro assay showed that recombinant human Bv8 protein promoted human retinal microvascular endothelial cells tube formation cell proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 and receptor 2 expression . Our findings suggest that Bv8 could be used as a novel target for the treatment of RNV related ocular diseases .

@highlight The expression of Bombina variegate 8 Bv8 was significantly increased in the retinal neovascularization RNV mouse model.
@highlight Bv8 neutralizing not only inhibited RNV but also decreased the mRNA and protein level of several pro angiogenic factors.
@highlight Recombinant human Bv8 protein promoted human retinal microvascular endothelial cells tube formation cell proliferation and VEGFR1 2 expression.
