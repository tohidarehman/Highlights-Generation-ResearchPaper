 An unpleasant context is able to reduce the late positive potential elicited by affective pictures . This study attempted to influence this context with a placebo . Sixty eight women were randomly assigned to three groups Water Bitter No Placebo Bitter Placebo . Participants in the bitter groups first rinsed their mouth with wormwood tea that caused a bitter aftertaste . Subsequently the placebo group received sham light therapy on the tongue to reduce the sensitivity of the taste buds . All groups viewed disgusting and non disgusting pictures while their electroencephalogram was recorded . The Bitter Placebo group reported reduced bitterness and disgust for the aftertaste after the sham treatment . The LPP reduction associated with the bitter aftertaste was attenuated due to the placebo treatment . This is the first EEG study to demonstrate that a context targeting placebo is able to change automatic attention allocation .

@highlight This study investigated electrocortical effects of a context targeting placebo.
@highlight Participants viewed non disgusting images in a negative context aversive taste .
@highlight The placebo sham light therapy of the tongue reduced the aversive taste.
@highlight The LPP reduction 300600 ms by the bitter taste was attenuated by the placebo.
@highlight Placebos are able to change automatic attention allocation.
