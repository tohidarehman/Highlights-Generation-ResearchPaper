 Gene therapy has been proposed as a feasible strategy for RGC survival and optic nerve regeneration . Some preclinical and clinical studies revealed intraocular inflammation after intravitreal injection of adeno associated virus by slit lamp or indirect ophthalmoscope . Here we evaluate the longitudinal profile of immediate inflammatory responses after AAV2 injection in rat retina and vitreous body by optical coherence tomography . Adult Fischer F344 rats were intravitreally injected once with saline AAV2 or zymosan . Retinal thickness and cell infiltration were recorded by OCT longitudinally for 2 months and verified by histological analysis . The transduction rate of single intravitreal AAV2 injection was 21.34.9 of whole retina and the transduction efficiency on RGCs was 91.52.5 in the transduced area . Significant increase in cell infiltration was observed from Day 13 after AAV2 injection compared to very few infiltrating cells observed in the saline injected group . The infiltrating cells ceased at Day 5 after intravitreal injection and remained absent at 2 months . The thicknesses of total and inner retina were increased along Day 13 after AAV2 injection but reverted to normal afterwards . The surviving RGCs in the AAV2 injected groups at Day 14 showed no significant difference compared to saline injected group . In summary this study revealed the immediate inflammatory responses and retinal edema after intravitreal AAV2 injection in normal rats without influencing long term retinal thickness and RGC survival . OCT can be implemented for the time lapse

@highlight This study revealed the acute inflammatory responses and retinal edema after intravitreal injection of AAV2 mediated gene.
@highlight Intravitreal injection of AAV2 mediated gene didn t influence RGC survival in normal rats.
@highlight OCT can help to evaluate the time lapse
@highlight inflammatory response of gene therapy.
