 The central biological clock system of bird is formed by hypothalamus suprachiasmatic nucleus pineal gland and retina thereby interacting with each other in a neuroendocrine loop . Previous results have confirmed that monochromatic light can influence the clock genes in the pineal gland hypothalamus and retina of chicks in vivo . The present work was conducted to study whether the cultured retinal tissue of chick could maintain the circadian oscillation and whether the monochromatic light affect the expression level of cultured retinal circadian clock in vitro . Retinal tissues of 0 day old chicks were cultured in vitro under 4 light treatments with light dark cycle 12 12 and constant dark . The tissues and culture medium were collected every each 4h . Melanopsin clock genes

@highlight The cultured chick retinal tissue was established and the biological clock of retina was affected by the color of light.
@highlight In constant dark the molecular clock and melatonin in isolated chick retina tissue maintained circadian oscillation.
@highlight Green light increased melatonin and
@highlight by enhancing the circadian expression of melanopsin and positive clock genes.
