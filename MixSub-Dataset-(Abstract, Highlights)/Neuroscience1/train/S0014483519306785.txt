 Glaucoma is a progressive neurodegenerative process affecting the retinal ganglion cells and the optic nerve . Oxidative stress has been implicated in glaucoma pathogenesis and iron is a potent generator of oxidative stress . The oral iron chelator deferiprone is protective against retinal degenerations associated with oxidative stress . To test whether DFP could be protective in glaucoma we used microbead injections to induce elevated intraocular pressure in a cohort of 3 month old C57BL 6J mice . One eye of each animal was injected with magnetic microbeads resulting in ocular hypertension for 7 weeks while the fellow eye was injected with saline and served as a normotensive internal control . While half of the cohort received oral DFP the other half did not and served as controls . After 8 weeks Brn3a immunolabeling of flat mounted retinas was used for manual RGC quantification . Axon counts were obtained from thin sections of optic nerves using the AxonJ plugin for ImageJ . DFP administration was protective against RGC and optic nerve loss in the setting of elevated IOP . These results suggest that iron chelation by DFP may provide glaucoma neuroprotection .

@highlight Oral DFP improved RGC survival in a microbead induced mouse model of glaucoma.
@highlight DFP administration preserved retinal ganglion cells and optic nerve axons in hypertensive glaucomatous eyes.
@highlight Iron chelation may be neuroprotective in glaucoma.
