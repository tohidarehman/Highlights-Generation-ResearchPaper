 Although it has been documented that central nervous system pericytes are able to contract in response to physiological pharmacological or pathological stimuli the underlying mechanism of pericyte contractility is incompletely understood especially in downstream pericytes that express low amounts of alpha smooth muscle actin . To study whether pericyte contraction involves F actin polymerization as in vascular smooth muscle cells we increased retinal microvascular pericyte tonus by intravitreal injection of a vasoconstrictive agent noradrenaline . The contralateral eye of each mouse was used for vehicle injection . The retinas were rapidly extracted and fixed within 2min after injections . Polymeric filamentous and monomeric globular forms of actin were labeled by fluorescently conjugated phalloidin and deoxyribonuclease I respectively . We studied 108 and 83 pericytes from 6 NA and 6 vehicle treated retinas and found that F G actin ratio a microscopy based index of F actin polymerization significantly increased in NA treated retinas 4.2 vs. 3.5

@highlight Mechanisms of CNS pericyte contractility are incompletely understood
@highlight Noradrenaline promoted F actin polymerization in retinal microvascular pericytes
@highlight F actin polymerization was more pronounced in pericytes on downstream capillaries
@highlight They contracted tide like suggesting a role for regulating capillary tone and flow
@highlight F actin polymerization is needed for contractility of downstream pericytes poor in SMA
