 Connectomics has demonstrated that synaptic networks and their topologies are precise and directly correlate with physiology and behavior . The next extension of connectomics is pathoconnectomics to map neural network synaptology and circuit topologies corrupted by neurological disease in order to identify robust targets for therapeutics . In this report we characterize a pathoconnectome of early retinal degeneration . This pathoconnectome was generated using serial section transmission electron microscopy to achieve an ultrastructural connectome with 2.18nm px resolution for accurate identification of all chemical and gap junctional synapses . We observe aberrant connectivity in the rod network pathway and novel synaptic connections deriving from neurite sprouting . These observations reveal principles of neuron responses to the loss of network components and can be extended to other neurodegenerative diseases .
