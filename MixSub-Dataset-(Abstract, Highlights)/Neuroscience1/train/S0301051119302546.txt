 Recent research has highlighted atypical reactivity to sensory stimulation as a core symptom in children with autism spectrum disorder . However little is known about the dysfunctional neurological mechanisms underlying these aberrant sensitivities . Here we tested the hypothesis that the ability to filter out auditory repeated information is deficient in children with ASD already from subcortical levels yielding to auditory sensitivities . We recorded the frequency following response a non invasive measure of the neural tracking of the periodic characteristics of a sound in the subcortical auditory system to compare repetition related effects in children with ASD and typically developing children . Results revealed an increase of the FFR with stimulus repetition in children with ASD compared to their peers . Moreover such defective early sensory encoding of stimulus redundancy was associated with sensory overload . These results highlight that auditory sensitivities in ASD emerge already at the level of the subcortical auditory system .

@highlight Children with ASD present a defective repetition encoding mechanism.
@highlight They show an increased subcortical neural response to repeated sounds.
@highlight This atypical processing yields auditory sensitivities that cause sensory overload.
