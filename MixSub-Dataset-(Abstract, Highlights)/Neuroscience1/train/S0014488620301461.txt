 Parkinson s disease a debilitating progressive degenerative movement disorder associated with loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra afflicts approximately one million people in the U.S. including a significant number of Veterans . Disease characteristics include tremor rigidity postural instability bradykinesia and at a cellular level glial cell activation and Lewy body inclusions in DA neurons . The most potent medical surgical treatments do not ultimately prevent disease progression . Therefore new therapies must be developed to halt progression of the disease . While the mechanisms of the degenerative process in PD remain elusive chronic inflammation a common factor in many neurodegenerative diseases has been implicated with associated accumulation of toxic aggregated synuclein in neurons . Calpain a calcium activated cysteine neutral protease plays a pivotal role in SN and spinal cord degeneration in PD via its role in synuclein aggregation activation migration of microglia and T cells and upregulation of inflammatory processes . Here we report an increased expression of a subset of CD4 T cells in rodent models of PD including MPTP mice and DSP 4 N ethyl 2 bromobenzylamine hydrochloride 6 hydroxydopamine rats which produced higher levels of perforin and granzyme B typically found in cytotoxic T cells . Importantly the CD4 cytotoxic subtype was attenuated following calpain inhibition in MPTP mice suggesting that calpain and this distinct CD4 T cell subset may have critical roles in the inflammatory process disease progression and neurodegeneration in PD .
