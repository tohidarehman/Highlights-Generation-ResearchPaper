 To compare disease severity in detail between patients carrying variants in exons 114 and ORF15 of retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator Systematic next generation sequencing data analysis Sanger sequencing validation and segregation analysis were utilised to identify the pathogenic variants . Detailed ophthalmic examinations including electroretinograms fundus photography fundus autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography were performed . Statistical analysis including age adjustment and comparison were performed based on cross sectional level to compare disease severity between variants in the two Sixty two variants were identified in Patients with variants in exons 114 retained less visual acuity than patients with ORF15 variants and deteriorated faster . However the ellipsoid zone widths central retinal thickness and refractions were comparable between the two groups . Autofluorescence pattern relates to the age and the variant grouping .

@highlight The paper described phenotypic variability in a large cohort of 86 Chinese patients from 77 unrelated families with mutations in
@highlight gene.
@highlight We focused on comparing disease severity between variants in two predominant retinal
@highlight isoforms by assessing different retina function parameters in detail.
@highlight At a given age patients with variants in exons 114 retained less visual acuity than patients with ORF15 variants and progressed at a faster rate.
@highlight The visual fields EZWs and refractions are comparable between the two variant groups.
