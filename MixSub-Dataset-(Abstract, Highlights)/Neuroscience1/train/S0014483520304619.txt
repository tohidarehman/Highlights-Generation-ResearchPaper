 The involvement of leukocytes in the pathophysiology of DR has mostly examined the role of monocytes and neutrophils with little emphasis on other immune cell types . In this study we determined the systemic alterations in T cell subsets myeloid cell types NK cells and NKT cells in the streptozotocin mouse model of diabetic retinopathy and the role of NKT cells on retinal leukostasis and permeability changes . C57BL 6J mice were made diabetic with 60mg kg dose of STZ given for 5 days . Flow cytometry assay measured the frequency of leukocyte subsets in the peripheral blood spleen and bone marrow of STZ and vehicle treated C57BL 6J mice . Our results showed an increased proportion of memory CD8 T cells and interferon gamma secreting CD8 T cells in the bone marrow of STZ treated compared to control mice . Subsequently increased production of inflammatory monocytes in the bone marrow and an enhanced frequency of CD11b cells in the diabetic retina were seen in STZ treated compared to control mice . The diabetic mice also exhibited a decrease in total NKT and CD4 NKT cells . A monoclonal antibody based approach depleted NKT cells from STZ treated mice followed by measurements of retinal vascular permeability and leukostasis . The depletion of NKT cells in STZ treated mice resulted in a significant increase in vascular permeability in the retinal tissue . Together our results strongly imply the involvement of NKT cells in regulating the pathophysiology of the diabetic retina .

@highlight Retinal inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.
@highlight In diabetic retinopathy NKT cell frequency decreases in the peripheral blood.
@highlight IFN secreting CD8 T cells increases in the bone marrow of diabetic mice.
@highlight Loss of NKT cells enhances vascular permeability and leukostasis in diabetic retina.
