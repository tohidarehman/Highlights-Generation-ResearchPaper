 Spinal cord injury above the lumbosacral level results in lower urinary tract dysfunction including detrusor hyperreflexia wherein bladder compliance is low and a lack of external urethral sphincter control leading to detrusor sphincter dyssynergia with poor voiding efficiency . Experimental studies in animals have shown a dense innervation of serotonergic fibers and multiple 5 HT receptors in the spinal reflex circuits that control voiding function . Here we investigated the efficacy of NLX 112 in regulating lower urinary tract function after T8 contusive SCI in rats . NLX 112 is a very potent highly selective and fully efficacious 5 HT

@highlight NLX 112 improves LUT function after chronic complete SCI
@highlight NLX 112 improves LUT function after chronic contusive SCI.
@highlight The regulation of LUT function by NLX 112 is in a dose dependent manner.
@highlight The effect of NLX 112 in LUT function can be reversed by its antagonist.
