 Neurocysticercosis is the most common parasitic disease of the human central nervous system . However a diagnosis of NCC may be hard to make if the specific clinical and routine neuroimaging manifestations are lacking which hinders physicians from considering further immunodiagnostic tests . Seven patients presented with fever headache nausea cognitive decline confusion or progressive leg weakness . There were no pathogens found in the cerebrospinal fluid patients were clinically suspected of meningoencephalitis or cerebrovascular disease . To clearly determine the etiology next generation sequencing of the CSF was used to detect pathogens in these seven patients . DNA sequences were detected in the seven patients but not in the non template controls or the other patients with clinically suspected CNS infections . Based on the patients medical data and the diagnostic criteria for NCC seven patients were diagnosed with probable NCC . The unique reads aligning to This study showed that NGS of the CSF might be an auxiliary diagnostic method for NCC patients . Larger studies are required .

@highlight DNA sequences were detected by the Next Generation Sequencing of the cerebrospinal fluid.
@highlight Experience with this new diagnostic methodology were presented in the study.
@highlight The number of unique reads and genomic coverage were dropped after anti parasitic treatment.
