 Retinal detachment results in disruption of retinal physiology and visual function . Although surgical intervention has been well developed to restore the retinal anatomic structure post op progression of visual function decline is prominent in a large proportion of patients . Therefore the establishment of a disease model that accurately mimics RD pathogenesis is crucial to mechanistic study and drug screening . General protocols to induce RD in mice are frequently associated with complications leading to model instability and reduced reproducibility . In this study we established a stable and reproducible mice RD model with a detached area of over 90 and rare complications . Briefly the modified method was realized by vitreous humor extraction to reduce intraocular pressure followed by directly visible hyaluronic acid injection into subretinal space . The detachment of retina was confirmed by fundus photography and progressive thinning of the outer nuclear layer was determined by HE staining . Apoptotic signals were prominent in the ONL . Consistently visual function was significantly compromised as determined by ERG . Moreover retinal vasculature appeared to remodel and acquired winding twisted and dilated structures illustrated by 3D reconstruction . In addition activation of Mller cells and microglia and infiltration of blood derived macrophages were detected locally . Collectively we have established a modified protocol to model RD with increased stability reproducibility and fewer complications and 3D high resolution imaging and reconstruction of vasculature could provide new tools to evaluate this model .
