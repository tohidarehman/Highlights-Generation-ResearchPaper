 Attention is the gateway to perceptual cognitive and socioemotional development in humans . We observed 104 5 month old term and preterm infants and their mothers in social interactions to address three questions about the role of maturation in orienting and responding to attention . We used a fine grained coding system to allow parallel comparisons across infant and maternal orienting and sequential analysis to evaluate infant and maternal responding to attention . Orienting and responding to attention differed for attention to people versus objects as did the relations between maturity and attention . We conclude that maturity contributes to orienting and responding to attention and that orienting and responding to attention are specific rather than homogenous . We discuss the implications of these conclusions for future studies of how attention influences cognitive and communicative development .
