 Individuals with demyelinating diseases often experience difficulties during social interactions that are not well studied in preclinical models . Here we describe a novel juvenile focal corpus callosum demyelination murine model exhibiting a social interaction deficit . Using this preclinical murine demyelination model we discover that application of metformin an FDA approved drug in this model promotes oligodendrocyte regeneration and remyelination and improves the social interaction . This beneficial effect of metformin acts through stimulating Ser436 phosphorylation in CBP a histone acetyltransferase . In addition we found that metformin acts through two distinct molecular pathways to enhance oligodendrocyte precursor proliferation and differentiation respectively . Metformin enhances OPC proliferation through early stage autophagy inhibition while metformin promotes OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes through activating CBP Ser436 phosphorylation . In summary we identify that metformin is a promising remyelinating agent to improve juvenile demyelination associated social interaction deficits by promoting oligodendrocyte regeneration and remyelination .
