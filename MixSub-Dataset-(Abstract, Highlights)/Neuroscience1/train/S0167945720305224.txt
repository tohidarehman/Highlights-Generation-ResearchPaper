 Maintaining balance during gait allows subjects to minimize energy expenditure and avoid falls . Gait balance can be measured by assessing the relationship between the center of mass and center of pressure during gait . Demographics skeletal and postural parameters are known to influence gait balance . What are the determinants of dynamic balance during gait in asymptomatic adults among skeletal and demographic parameters 115 adults underwent 3D gait analysis and full body biplanar X rays . Angles between the COM COP line and the vertical were calculated in frontal and sagittal planes during gait maxima minima and ROM were evaluated . Full body 3D reconstructions were obtained skeletal and postural parameters of the spine pelvis and lower limbs were calculated . A univariate followed by a multivariate analysis were computed between the COM COP parameters and skeletal and demographic parameters . The univariate analysis showed that in the frontal plane maximum of the COM COP angle was significantly correlated with weight Frontal imbalance appeared to be mainly correlated to demographic parameters . Sagittal imbalance was found to be correlated with weight height acetabular parameters and SVA . These results suggest that in addition to demographic parameters acetabular parameters and SVA are important determinants of balance during gait .

@highlight To investigate how skeletal parameters influence gait balance.
@highlight 115 adults underwent 3D gait full body x rays to calculate skeletal parameters.
@highlight Gait balance was assessed through sagittal and frontal COM COP angles.
@highlight Demographics spinal and acetabular parameters determined gait balance.
