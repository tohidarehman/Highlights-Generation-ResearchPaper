 The transparent and refractive properties of the ocular lens are dependent on its precise cellular structure supported by the regulation of lens cellular processes of proliferation and differentiation that are essential throughout life . The ERK MAPK signalling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating lens cell proliferation and differentiation and in turn is regulated by inhibitory molecules including the Spred family of proteins to modulate and attenuate the impact of growth factor stimulation . Given Spreds are strongly and distinctly expressed in lens along with their established inhibitory role in a range of different tissues we investigated the role these antagonists play in regulating lens cell proliferation and differentiation and their contribution to lens structure and growth . Using established mice lines deficient for either or both Spred 1 and Spred 2 we demonstrate their role in regulating lens development by negatively regulating ERK1 2 activity . Mice deficient for both Spred 1 and Spred 2 have impaired lens and eye development displaying irregular lens epithelial and fibre cell activity as a result of increased levels of phosphorylated ERK1 2 . While Spred 1 and Spred 2 do not appear to be necessary for induction and early stages of lens morphogenesis nor for the formation of the primary fibre cells they are required for the continuous embryonic growth and differentiation of the lens .

@highlight The loss of Spreds results in a small lens eye phenotype.
@highlight Spreds negatively regulate ERK1 2 signalling.
@highlight Spreds negatively regulate lens epithelial cell proliferation.
@highlight Spreds 1 and 2 complement each other in lens development.
