 Benevolent sexism is a double edged sword that uses praise to maintain gender inequality which consequently makes women feel less efficacious agentic and competent . This study investigated whether benevolently sexist feedback that was supportive could result in cardiovascular responses indicative of threat . Women received either supportive non sexist or supportive yet benevolent sexist feedback from a male evaluator following practice trials on a verbal reasoning test . As expected women receiving benevolent sexist feedback exhibited cardiovascular threat during a subsequent test relative to women receiving non sexist feedback . There was no support for an alternative hypothesis that benevolent sexist feedback would lead to cardiovascular responses consistent with disengaging from the task altogether . These findings illustrate that the consequences of benevolent sexism can occur spontaneously while women are engaged with a task and when the sexist feedback is intended as supportive .

@highlight We compared effects of non sexist vs. benevolently sexist supportive feedback.
@highlight Cardiovascular measures of challenge threat were assessed during a reasoning test.
@highlight Benevolently sexist feedback led to cardiovascular responses consistent with threat.
@highlight Threat occurred spontaneously without opportunity for undistracted rumination.
@highlight Supportive benevolent sexism undermines womens evaluations of personal resources and skills during subsequent motivated performance tasks.
