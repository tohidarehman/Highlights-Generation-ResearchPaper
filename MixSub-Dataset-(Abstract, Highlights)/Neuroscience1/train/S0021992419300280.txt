 this study evaluated the effectiveness of different speech techniques for the rehabilitation of hypernasality in children with a cleft palate with or without a cleft lip . The impact of speech rate and or mouth opening was investigated on both hypernasality and speech intelligibility . thirteen patients with CPL and perceived hypernasality and 13 age and gender matched children without CPL were included . Children were asked to read an oral and oronasal text passage in ten different speaking conditions where speech rate and or mouth opening was manipulated . Outcome measures included instrumental measurements of hypernasality and perceptual ratings of speech intelligibility and hypernasality . speaking with a lower speech rate had a statistically significant positive influence on objective measures of hypernasality in both groups especially when elicited by a metronome . An increased mouth opening and the combination of both techniques was only effective in the control group . Moreover it was found that children without CP L were less intelligible when speaking with a decreased mouth opening . a metronome controlled decrease of speech rate had a positive influence on objective measures of hypernasality both in children with and without CPL . However present study could not provide any evidence that speaking with increased mouth opening reduces objective and perceptual measures of hypernasality in children with CPL . Further research investigating the use of these techniques is necessary .

@highlight Increased mouth opening did not influence measures of hypernasality in children with CPL.
@highlight Decreased mouth opening decreased speech intelligibility in children without CPL.
@highlight A slower speech rate reduced nasalance values in children with and without CPL.
