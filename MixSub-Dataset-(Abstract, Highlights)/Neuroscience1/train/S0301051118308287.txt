 Child depression has been inconsistency linked to cortisol and salivary alpha amylase reactivity . This study assessed three factors that contribute to inconsistencies 1 the differential effectiveness of laboratory challenges to elicit cortisol and sAA 2 the impact of cortisol sAA coordination and 3 variation in parent versus child ratings of depression . A community sample of 52 children participated in the Trier Social Stress Test Child Version and a competition challenge . Saliva was collected and assayed for cortisol and sAA . Analyses were conducted using multilevel modeling . Child reported depressive symptoms were associated with a declining cortisol trajectory in the TSST C. Mother reported depressive symptoms were associated with higher baseline sAA in the TSST C and the competition challenge . Further child reported depressive symptoms were associated with cortisol sAA coordination in the competition challenge . Findings underscore the nature of the challenge and the behavioral informant as impacting associations between child depressive symptoms and cortisol and sAA secretion .

@highlight Child depressive symptoms are related to cortisol sAA and cortisol sAA coordination in two distinct stressor paradigms.
@highlight Type of challenge and rater parent or child influenced associations between depressive symptoms and cortisol and sAA.
@highlight Depressive symptoms were only associated with cortisol sAA coordination in the competition challenge.
@highlight Multiple informants and stressor contexts are needed to understand the link between depression and stress reactivity.
@highlight Future research should integrate these factors in models of physiological stress and developmental psychopathology.
