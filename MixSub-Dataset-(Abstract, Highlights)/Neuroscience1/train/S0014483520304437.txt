 Age related cataract is the leading cause of visual impairment or even blindness among the aged population globally . Long non coding RNA has been proven to be the potential regulator of ARC . The latest study reveals that maternally expressed gene 3 promotes the apoptosis and inhibits the proliferation of multiple cancer cells . However the expression and role of MEG3 in ARC are unclear . In this study we investigated the effects of MEG3 in ARC and explored the regulatory mechanisms underlying these effects . We observed that MEG3 expression was up regulated in the age related cortical cataract lens capsules and positively correlated with the histological degree of ARCC . The pro apoptosis protein active caspase 3 and Bax increased in the anterior lens capsules of ARCC tissue while the anti apoptotic protein Bcl 2 decreased compared to normal lens . Knockdown of MEG3 increased the viability and inhibited the apoptosis of LECs upon the oxidative stress induced by H
