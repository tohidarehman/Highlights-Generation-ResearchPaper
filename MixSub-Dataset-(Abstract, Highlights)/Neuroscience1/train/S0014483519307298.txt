 Elastic fibres provide tissues with elasticity and flexibility . In the healthy human cornea elastic fibres are limited to the posterior region of the peripheral stroma but their specific functional role remains elusive .

@highlight mg
@highlight mice showed abnormalities in corneal thickness from embryonic development through to adulthood.
@highlight Elastic fibres were evident from E16.5 in both the WT and mg
@highlight mouse corneas.
@highlight Adult mg
@highlight mouse corneas exhibited a disorganised elastic fibre network with unusually high levels of branching.
@highlight The disrupted collagen arrangement seen in adult mg
@highlight mice corneas is likely linked to lower levels of decorin in these corneas.
