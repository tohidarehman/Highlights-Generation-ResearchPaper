 The cornea is a highly innervated tissue exhibiting a complex nerve architecture distribution and structural organization . Significant contributions over the years have allowed us to come to the current understanding about the corneal nerves . Mechanical or chemical trauma infections surgical wounds ocular or systemic comorbidities can induce corneal neuroplastic changes . Consequently a cascade of events involving the corneal wound healing trophic functions neural circuits and the lacrimal products may interfere in the corneal homeostasis . Nerve physiology drew the attention of investigators due to the popularization of modern laser refractive surgery and the perception of the destructive potential of the excimer laser to the corneal nerve population . Nerve fiber loss can lead to symptoms that may impact the patient s quality of life and impair the best corrected vision leading to patient and physician dissatisfaction . Therefore there is a need to better understand preoperative signs of corneal nerve dysfunction the postoperative mechanisms of nerve degeneration and recovery aiming to achieve the most efficient way of treating nerve disorders related to diseases and refractive surgery .

@highlight Corneal nerve impairment after disorders or secondary to refractive surgery can lead to nerve dysfunction.
@highlight There is not necessarily a correspondence between signs and symptoms of corneal nerve injury.
@highlight The neural remodeling following refractive surgery is complex and can differ according to the laser technique.
