 The transforming growth factor beta plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of some ophthalmologic diseases including neovascular age related macular degeneration and proliferative vitreoretinopathy . TGFB activates the transcription factors SMAD2 and SMAD3 via the TGFB receptor which together activate several genes including VEGFA . TGFB treated ARPE 19cells show an increased proliferation rate and undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition . Since microRNAs are capable of inhibiting the translation of multiple genes we screened for miRNAs that regulate the TGFB signalling pathways at multiple levels . In this study we focused on two miRNAs miR 302d and miR 93 which inhibit TGFB signalling pathway and therefore TGFB induced EMT transition as well as VEGFA secretion from ARPE 19cells . Furthermore we could show that both miRNAs can retransform TGFB stimulated mesenchymal ARPE 19cells towards the morphological epithelial like state . Taken together transient overexpression of these miRNAs in RPE cells might be a promising approach for further translational strategies .

@highlight miR 302d and miR 93 are capable of inhibiting TGFB mediated VEGFA secretion from ARPE 19 cells by directly targeting TGFBR2 as well as VEGFA.
@highlight Both miRNAs can prevent TGFBinduced EMT of ARPE 19 cells in vitro mainly by inhibiting TGFBR2 at the transcriptional and translational level.
@highlight Both miRNAs can revert TGFB induced mesenchymal ARPE 19 cells towards an epithelial like state and therefore promote MET.
