 Sudden acquired retinal degeneration syndrome in dogs is proposed to have an immune mediated etiology . However there is conflicting evidence regarding the presence of antiretinal antibodies as assessed by western blotting in the serum of SARDS patients . Because of the possibility that antibodies recognize only conformational epitopes we hypothesized that a more sensitive method to investigate circulating retinal autoantibodies in SARDS is immunofluorescence . Sera from 14 dogs with early SARDS and 14 age and breed matched healthy control dogs were screened for circulating antiretinal IgG IgM IgE and IgA using indirect immunofluorescence on lightly fixed frozen sections of normal canine retina . Controls without canine serum were also performed . A nuclear counterstain was used to identify cellular retinal layers . Images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope and 2 3 separate masked observers graded retinal layers for fluorescence staining intensity using a 03 scale . Total circulating IgG and IgM was assessed by radial immunodiffusion . Statistical analysis was performed using 2 way ANOVA paired 2 tailed student s t test and correlation analysis . Intensity of IgG staining of photoreceptor outer segments was significantly higher using serum from dogs with SARDS compared with healthy controls in 2 3 observers

@highlight The serum of dogs with SARDS contains anti photoreceptor IgG.
@highlight Dogs with SARDS have elevated total circulating IgM and reduced total circulating IgG compared with matched controls.
@highlight Canine SARDS and human AIR have similarities in terms of presence of antiretinal antibodies on indirect immunofluorescence.
