 Formation of the eye lens depends on the continuous differentiation of lens epithelial cells into lens fiber cells . To attain their mature structure and transparent function nascent lens fiber cells must complete a precise cellular remodeling program hallmarked by the complete elimination of organelles to form the core lens organelle free zone . Lacking a blood supply the lens resides in a hypoxic environment that results in a decreasing oxygen concentration from the lens surface to the lens core . This oxygen gradient results in a hypoxic microenvironment in the region of the lens where immature lens fiber cells initiate loss of organelles to form the core OFZ . These features of the lens suggest a potential role for low lens oxygen levels in the regulation of organelle degradation and other events critical for mature lens fiber cell formation . Hypoxia activates the master regulator of the hypoxic response hypoxia inducible factor 1a that regulates hypoxia responsive genes . To identify a potential role for hypoxia and HIF1a in the elimination of organelles during lens fiber cell maturation we tested the requirement for hypoxia in the degradation of non nuclear organelles in
