 Neuropathic dry eye is one of the most frequently seen complications after corneal refractive surgery however its incidence decreases in a significant manner along the first six months postoperative reaching between 10 and 45 incidence . However little is known on the inflammatory status of the ocular surface during this recovery process . We aim to analyze the clinical and tear molecule concentration changes along six months after advanced surface ablation for myopia correction in a prospective study including 18 eyes of 18 subjects who bilaterally underwent advanced surface ablation corneal refractive surgery . Clinical variables and a panel of 23 pro and anti inflammatory cytokines chemokines concentration in tears preoperatively and at 1 3 and 6 months postoperatively were evaluated . We found that uncorrected distance visual acuity improved significantly from baseline at 1 month visit symptoms improved and tear osmolarity decreased significantly from baseline at 3 month visit and there was a decrease in mechanical corneal threshold between 1 month and 3 and 6 month visits . Regarding tear molecules IL 4 IL 5 IL 6 IL 13 IL 17A and IFN tear levels were significantly increased at all the three visits compared to preoperative levels at V0 IL 2 and VEGF were also significantly increased at 1 month and 6 month visits but not at 3 month visit whereas IL 9 IL 10 and IL 12 were only significantly increased at 6 month visit . Although we found that there is a recovery in clinical variables at 6 months postoperatively ocular surface homeostasis is not completely restored as it can be seen by the changes in concentration of some pro and anti inflammatory molecules measured in tears .

@highlight Clinical variables completely restore after 6 months of ASA refractive surgery.
@highlight Some tear pro inflammatory cytokines chemokines do not recover their basal values.
@highlight Ocular surface homeostasis is not completely restored after 6 months of ASA surgery.
