 Three dimensional in vitro models are excellent tools for studying complex biological systems because of their physiological similarity to in vivo studies cost effectiveness and decreased reliance on animals . The influence of tissue microenvironment on the cells cell cell interaction and the cell matrix interactions can be elucidated in 3D models which are difficult to mimic in 2D cultures . In order to develop a 3D model the required cell types are derived from the tissues or stem cells . A 3D tissue organ model typically includes all the relevant cell types and the microenvironment corresponding to that tissue organ . For instance a full corneal 3D model is expected to have epithelial stromal endothelial and nerve cells along with the extracellular matrix and membrane components associated with the cells . Although it is challenging to develop a corneal 3D model several attempts have been made and various technologies established which closely mimic the in vivo environment . In this review three major technologies are highlighted organotypic cultures organoids and 3D bioprinting . Also several combinations of organotypic cultures such as the epithelium and stroma or endothelium and neural cultures are discussed along with the disease relevance and potential applications of these models . In the future new biomaterials will likely promote better cell cell and cell matrix interactions in organotypic corneal cultures .
