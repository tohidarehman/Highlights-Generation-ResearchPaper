 Although it is known that individuals with Parkinson s disease have difficulties performing dual task activities most of the studies have verified the effect of dual tasks on gait using tasks that are uncommon to perform while walking . However the realization of tasks involving gait that really represents the daily activities carried out by the participants allow us to detect real fall risk situations of individuals with PD during their gait . Our aim was to verify the influence of daily life dual tasks on gait spatiotemporal variables of the older adults with PD . 20 older adults without PD and 20 older adults with PD participated in the study . Gait kinematic was analyzed under three different conditions walking without dual task walking carrying bags with weight and walking talking on the cell phone . Older adults with PD presented lower speed Daily life dual tasks impair the spatiotemporal variables of gait in the older adults with PD which was most evident during walking talking on the cell phone .

@highlight Daily life dual task influenced spatiotemporal variables even of healthy elderly.
@highlight Gait impairment was more evident during the motor cognitive multi task.
@highlight Daily life dual tasks are able to detect risk situations.
@highlight The complexity of the task is determinant for the interference severity.
