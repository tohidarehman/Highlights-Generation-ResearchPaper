 Vision loss is a devastating consequence of systemic hypoxia but the cellular mechanisms are unclear . We investigated the impact of acute hypoxia in the retina and optic nerve . We induced systemic hypoxia 10 O

@highlight Acute systemic hypoxia led to glial response in the visual system.
@highlight Hypoxia induced astrocyte stress and reactivity in the unmyelinated optic nerve.
@highlight Hypoxia led to loss of oligodendrocytes in the myelinated optic nerve.
