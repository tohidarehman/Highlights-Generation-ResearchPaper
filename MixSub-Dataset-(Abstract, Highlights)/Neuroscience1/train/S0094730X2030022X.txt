 Adults who stutter often develop social anxiety disorder . This study was to provide comparative data on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale Japanese version from AWS and non stuttering adult controls . LSAS J a 24 item self reported survey of social phobia and avoidance across various daily situations was administered to 130 AWS and 114 non stuttering adults . The test retest reliability and internal consistency of the LSAS J were assessed . A between subject multivariate analysis of variance was also conducted to determine whether attitude toward social anxiety differed between AWS and AWNS or by age or sex . AWS reported higher scores on both fear subscales of the LSAS J . Age had no significant influence on the social anxiety levels reported by either participant group . Sex differences were found in the fear subscales with females scoring higher on both fear subscales although these were only marginally significant Given the similarly high incidence of social anxiety in adults in Japan who stutter compared with those in other countries social anxiety should be identified and assessed during clinical decision making and before decisions are made about stuttering treatment . LSAS J is an easy tool to administer and showed reliable results of social phobia and avoidance for AWS .
