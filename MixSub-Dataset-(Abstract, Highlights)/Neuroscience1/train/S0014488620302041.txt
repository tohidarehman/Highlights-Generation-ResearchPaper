 Neurofibromatosis type 1 is associated with higher rates of epilepsy compared to the general population . Some NF1 patients with epilepsy do not have intracranial lesions suggesting the genetic mutation itself may contribute to higher rates of epilepsy in these patients . We have recently demonstrated increased seizure susceptibility in the Young male or female adult The average initial neocortical after discharge threshold was significantly lower in the We have demonstrated for the first time an increased rate of epileptogenesis in an animal model of NF1 with no known macroscopic neoplastic brain lesions . This work provides evidence for the genetic mutation itself playing a role in seizures and epilepsy in patients with NF1 and supports the use of the

@highlight mice have a faster neocortical kindling progression than WT mice.
@highlight A subset of
@highlight mice develop SRSs after hippocampal or neocortical kindling which is not seen in WT mice
@highlight Electrical kindling induces an increase in the ratio of phosphorylated Akt and Erk proteins.
@highlight Increased epileptogenicity in a non lesional model of
@highlight suggests the genetic mutation itself contributes to increased seizures and epilepsy.
