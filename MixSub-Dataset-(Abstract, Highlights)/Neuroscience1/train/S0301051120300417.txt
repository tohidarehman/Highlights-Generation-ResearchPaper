 In this study we focus on the spontaneous activity related to manual verbs to determine the extent to which semantic processing of manual verbs affects spontaneous arm muscle activity . For this purpose we recorded the arms electromyographic activity while participants read manual and non manual verbs focusing their attention on the semantic content or a specific letter . In addition we manipulated the arm position to observe postural priming effects for spontaneous muscle activity . Our results show that when arms were placed forward and the attention was directed to the semantic content there was an enhanced spontaneous activation . Our results suggest that spontaneous motor responses are related to the involvement of the motor system in action language comprehension as suggested by language embodiment theories .

@highlight Whether muscle activity is associated with semantic processing is unclear.
@highlight Spontaneous muscle activity SMA related to manual verbs was measured.
@highlight SMA was found when the position of the hands primes the manual action.
@highlight SMA was found when attention was directed to the semantic content.
@highlight SMA was related to action language comprehension in line with embodied cognition.
