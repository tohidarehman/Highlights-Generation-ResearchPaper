 We assessed audience response systems based evaluation of intelligibility with a view to find a valid and reliable intelligibility measure that is accessible to non trained participants . In addition we investigated potential listener differences between pediatric speech and language pathologists and untrained adults . Sixteen one minute samples of connected speech were compiled collected from 14 children with a speech sound disorder and two children with typical speech . 16 SLPs and 13 untrained adults participated in a series of ARS listening sessions where they were fitted with headphones and hand controls and instructed to click a button whenever they did not understand the child speaking . Listeners button clicks were registered and for each speech sample totaled into an intelligibility index . The proportion of syllables perceived correctly based on orthographic listener transcripts was used as a reference score of intelligibility . The ARS based intelligibility scores correlated strongly with the intelligibility reference score . Reliability was high across listener groups and weaker for single listeners . No significant difference was found between the evaluations of SLPs and untrained adults . ARS based evaluation offers a valid and reliable measure of intelligibility of particular value in research as a practical tool for collecting input from listeners without experience or knowledge of SSDs . We stress that the ARS design presupposes a listener panel and that evaluations obtained from individual listeners are predictably inadequate in terms of reliability .

@highlight Audience Response System ARS based scores of intelligibility are valid
@highlight ARS based intelligibility scores need to be based on a panel of listeners
@highlight Panels of clinicians and untrained listeners provide similar intelligibility scores
@highlight ARS based evaluations are useful primarily in a research context
