 Transsynaptic anterograde and retrograde degeneration of neurons and neural fibers are assumed to trigger local excitotoxicity and inflammatory processes . These processes in turn are thought to drive

@highlight Cortical stroke induces widespread degeneration of ipsilesional dopaminergic cells.
@highlight Synaptic coupling is no prerequisite for post ischemic dopaminergic midbrain degeneration.
@highlight Dopaminergic midbrain degeneration is likely not triggered by inflammation.
@highlight Degeneration manifests independent of the pro inflammatory peptide Substance P.
