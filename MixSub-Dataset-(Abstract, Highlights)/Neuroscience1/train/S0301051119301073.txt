 This study investigated the effect of interoceptive attention on emotional responses during illness imagery and the moderating role of illness anxiety . 101 students with low moderate and high levels of illness anxiety had to imagine personally relevant illness scenarios and standardized fearful joyful and neutral scenarios after undergoing an attention manipulation to direct their attention towards interoceptive or exteroceptive stimuli . Emotional responses assessed included self reports of arousal valence and somatic sensations and psychophysiological measures of heart rate reactivity and variability skin conductance level and facial electromyography . Findings showed increased reports of emotional arousal negative affect and somatic symptoms accompanied by negative emotion expressions but a hypo arousal physiological response pattern during illness imagery after interoceptive attention irrespective of illness anxiety levels . Under directed attention the observed emotional response to illness imagery may increase the risk for developing and perpetuating illness anxiety .

@highlight Attention to somatic sensations may underlie emotional responses to illness imagery.
@highlight Illness imagery x attention to somatic sensations are linked to intense negative emotions.
@highlight A hypo arousal physiological response pattern is however observed.
@highlight Illness anxiety levels do not influence emotional response to imagery.
@highlight Results inform the conceptualization of illness related information processing.
