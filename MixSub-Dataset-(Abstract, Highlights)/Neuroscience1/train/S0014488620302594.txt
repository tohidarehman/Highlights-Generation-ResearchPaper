 Chronic pain is one of the most challenging and debilitating symptoms to manage after traumatic brain injury yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive . The disruption of normal endogenous pain control mechanisms has been linked to several forms of chronic pain and may play a role in pain after TBI . We hypothesized therefore that dysfunctional descending noradrenergic and serotonergic pain control circuits may contribute to the loss of diffuse noxious inhibitory control a critical endogenous pain control mechanism weeks to months after TBI . For these studies the rat lateral fluid percussion model of mild TBI was used along with a DNIC paradigm involving a capsaicin conditioning stimulus . We observed sustained failure of the DNIC response up to 180 days post injury . We confirmed that descending

@highlight DNIC is an endogenous pain control mechanism lost after TBI in rats.
@highlight Augmenting descending NA signaling via RBX fails to restore DNIC after TBI.
@highlight Blocking pronociceptive serotonergic signaling after TBI also fails to restore DNIC.
@highlight Augmenting the serotoninergic inhibitory pain pathway via SSRIs does restore DNIC after TBI.
