 HIV associated neurocognitive disorders continue to persist despite effective control of viral replication . Although the mechanisms underlying HAND are poorly understood recent attention has focused on altered neuronal population activity as a correlate of impaired cognition . However while alterations in neuronal population activity in the gamma frequency range are noted in the setting of HAND the underlying mechanisms for these changes is unclear . Perineuronal nets are a specialized extracellular matrix that surrounds a subset of inhibitory neurons important to the expression of neuronal oscillatory activity . In the present study we observe that levels of PNN degrading matrix metalloproteinases are elevated in HIV infected post mortem human brain tissue . Furthermore analysis of two PNN components aggrecan and brevican reveals increased proteolysis in HIV infected brains . In addition local field potential recordings from

@highlight Altered brain oscillations have been previously reported in HIV patients.

@highlight PNN degradation in murine hippocampal slices results in increased gamma power.
@highlight Aberrant PNN proteolysis may underlie altered brain oscillations in HIV patients.
