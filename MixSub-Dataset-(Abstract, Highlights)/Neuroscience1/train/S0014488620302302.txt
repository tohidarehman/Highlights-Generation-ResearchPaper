 After cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury pro inflammatory M1 like and anti inflammatory M2 like phenotypes of microglia are involved in neuroinflammation in which NLRP3 inflammasome plays an essential role . Kv1.3 channel has been recognized as neuro immunomodulatory target but it is not clear as to its role in the neuroinflammation after cerebral ischemic injury . The current study aimed to investigate the issue . Middle cerebral artery occlusion reperfusion model in rats and oxygen glucose deprivation reoxygenation in primary microglia were utilized to mimic disease state of ischemic stroke . Treatment with PAP 1 a Kv1.3 channel blocker produced a significant improvement in neurological deficit scores and a decrease in infarct volume in MCAO R model . An increased number of M2 like phenotypic microglia and a reduced number of M1 like phenotypic microglia were observed by immunofluorescent staining in the in vivo model which was further validated by flow cytometry in vitro . Western blot showed that PAP 1 treatment profoundly reduced cleavage of caspase 1 and IL 1

@highlight Kv1.3 channel blockade produced neuroprotective effect in MCAO R model.
@highlight Kv1.3 channel blockade reshaped microglial phenotypes from M1 towards M2 and compromised inflammasome activation in microglia after cerebral ischemic injury.
@highlight Kv1.3 channel blockade may provide a promising neuro immunomodulatory strategy for ischemic stroke.
