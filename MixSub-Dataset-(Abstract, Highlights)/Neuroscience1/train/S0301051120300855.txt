 We offer an interdisciplinary framework for understanding the expanded capacity for emotional awareness in humans relative to other animals synthesizing work within computational neuroscience evolutionary psychology and comparative anatomy . We argue that disproportionate cortical expansion during human evolution reflects additional hierarchical levels of computational processing allowing representation of multimodal regularities over longer timescales affording abstract concept learning internal simulation of distal future outcomes and expanded working memory capacity . This allows for the ability to simulate emotions learn emotion concepts and manipulate them in working memory when deciding how to act . We also draw on the construct of life history strategy within evolutionary psychology to argue that individual differences in EA within humans can be understood as the result of tuning particular computational parameters to the predictability of long timescale socioemotional regularities of the local environment . We conclude by discussing the implications and testable hypotheses offered by our proposed framework .

@highlight Humans have evolved an expanded capacity for emotional awareness.
@highlight We present an interdisciplinary framework for understanding this expanded capacity.
@highlight Computational models suggest cortical expansion allows deeper hierarchical processing.
@highlight This allows expanded working memory conceptualization and simulation capacities.
@highlight Experience can tune the application of these capacities to socio emotional signals.
