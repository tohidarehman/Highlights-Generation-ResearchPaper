 Two independent lines of evidence suggest that drowsiness and mind wandering share common neurocognitive processes indexed by ocular parameters . Mind wandering and drowsiness frequently co occur however such that it remains unclear whether observed oculometric variations are related to mind wandering drowsiness or a mix of both . To address this issue we assessed fluctuations in mind wandering and sleepiness during a sustained attention task while ocular parameters were recorded . Results showed that oculometric variations during mind wandering were fully explained by increased sleepiness . However mind wandering and sleepiness had additive deleterious effects on performance that were not fully explained by ocular parameters . These findings suggest that oculometric variations during task performance reflect increased drowsiness rather than processes specifically involved in mind wandering and that the neurocognitive processes indexed by oculometric parameters do not fully explain how mind wandering and sleepiness cause attentional lapses .

@highlight Mind wandering and drowsiness tend to co occur.
@highlight Mind wandering and drowsiness are associated with similar oculometric variations.
@highlight Oculometric variations during mind wandering are explained by increased drowsiness.
@highlight Mind wandering and drowsiness have additive deleterious effect on performance.
@highlight Impaired performance is not fully explained by oculometric variation.
