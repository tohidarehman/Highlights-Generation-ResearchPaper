 Persistent non infectious uveitis has a significant morbidity but the extent to which this is accompanied by inflammation driven remodelling of the tissue is unclear . To address this question we studied a series of samples selected from two ocular tissue repositories and identified 15 samples with focal infiltration . Eleven of fifteen contained lymphocytes both B cells and T cells . In 20 of the samples there was evidence of ectopic lymphoid like structures with focal aggregations of B cells and T cells segregated into anatomically different adjacent zones . To investigate inflammation in the tissue an analysis of 520 immune relevant transcripts was carried out and 24 genes were differentially upregulated compared with control tissue . Two of these were increased in ocular inflammation compared to control immune tissue . We demonstrate that in a significant minority of patients chronic persistent uveitis leads to dysregulation of ocular immune surveillance characterized by the development of areas of local ectopic lymphoid like structures which may be a target for therapeutic intervention directed at antibody producing cells .

@highlight Active inflammation continues in cases of persistent uveitis.
@highlight Some patients develop ectopic lymphoid like structure.
@highlight In these cases targeting B cells may be beneficial.
