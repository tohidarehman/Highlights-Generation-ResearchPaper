 Targeting interhemispheric inhibition using brain stimulation has shown potential for enhancing stroke recovery . Following stroke increased inhibition originating from the contralesional hemisphere impairs motor activation in ipsilesional areas . We have previously reported that low intensity electrical theta burst stimulation applied to an implanted electrode in the contralesional rat motor cortex reduces interhemispheric inhibition and improves functional recovery when commenced three days after cortical injury . Here we apply this approach at more clinically relevant later time points and measure recovery from photothrombotic stroke following three weeks of low intensity intermittent TBS continuous TBS or sham stimulation applied to the contralesional motor cortex . Interhemispheric inhibition and cellular excitability were measured in the same rats from single pyramidal neurons in the peri infarct area using

@highlight Three weeks of contralesional electrical intermittent theta burst stimulation from 10 days post stroke enhances recovery in rats.
@highlight Functional recovery following contralesional stimulation positively correlates with excitability of the ipsilesional cortex.
@highlight Interhemispheric inhibition negatively correlates with ipsilesional excitability but not with functional recovery.
