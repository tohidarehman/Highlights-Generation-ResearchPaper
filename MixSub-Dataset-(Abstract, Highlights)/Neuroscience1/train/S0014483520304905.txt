 NADPH oxidases are activated in ischemic conditions leading to increases in reactive oxygen species and neurotoxicity . The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of NOX in the development of retinal pathologies associated with excitotoxicity and the evaluation of NOX inhibitors as putative therapeutic agents . Sprague Dawley rats were used for the induction of the

@highlight NADPH oxidases NOX mediate AMPA induced toxicity.
@highlight NOX1 inhibition reduces AMPA induced macro microglial activation and cell death.
@highlight NOX4 inhibition reverses AMPA induced oxidative damage macro microglial activation.
@highlight NOX as therapeutic targets of retinal neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation.
