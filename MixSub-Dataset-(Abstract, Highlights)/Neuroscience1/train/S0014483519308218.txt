 Mesenchymal stem cells exhibit beneficial effects on autoimmune dacryoadenitis . However the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood . In this study we investigated the therapeutic effect of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells on rabbit autoimmune dacryoadenitis an animal model of Sjgren s syndrome dry eye and explored whether the effects of MSCs were related to their modulation on macrophage polarization . We have showed that systemic infusion of hUC MSCs after disease onset efficiently diminished the chronic inflammation in diseased LGs and improved the clinical symptoms . Further analysis revealed that hUC MSC treatment significantly inhibited the expression of pro inflammatory M1 macrophage markers iNOS TNF and IL 6 and promoted the expression of anti inflammatory M2 macrophage markers Arg1 CD206 IL 10 IL 4 and TGF in LGs . Mechanistically hUC MSCs activated AKT pathway in macrophages resulting in upregulation of M2 associated molecule Arg1 which was partly abolished by PI3K inhibitor LY294002 . Together our data indicated that hUC MSCs can skew macrophages into an M2 phenotype via affecting AKT pathway . These data may provide a new insight into the mechanisms of hUC MSCs in the therapy of SS dry eye .
