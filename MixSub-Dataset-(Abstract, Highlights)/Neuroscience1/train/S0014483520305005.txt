 The photopic negative response of the electroretinogram reflects retinal ganglion cell function and consequently aids diagnosis of optic nerve diseases including glaucoma . In this study we assessed the efficacy of stimulation parameters for electroretinographic recordings of the multifocal photopic negative response for the detection of glaucoma and compared the diagnostic accuracy of electrophysiological structural and functional measures of glaucoma . We compared the diagnostic performance of the mfPhNR for 6 different stimulation rates in a cohort of 24 controls 10 glaucoma suspects GLA

@highlight Multifocal photopic negative response mfPhNR reflects retinal dysfunction.
@highlight Fast mfPhNR protocols outperform slower protocols in the glaucoma detection.
@highlight MfPhNR recordings might serve as surrogate marker of ganglion cell damage.
