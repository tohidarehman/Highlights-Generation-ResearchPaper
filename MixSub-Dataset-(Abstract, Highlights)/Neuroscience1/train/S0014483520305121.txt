 Ongoing research using cell transplantation and viral mediated gene therapy has been making progress to restore vision by retinal repair but targeted delivery and complete cellular integration remain challenging . An alternative approach is to induce endogenous Mller glia to regenerate lost neurons and photoreceptors as occurs spontaneously in teleost fish and amphibians . Extracellular vesicles can transfer protein and RNA cargo between cells serving as a novel means of cell cell communication . We conducted an

@highlight Intravitreal injection of extracellular vesicles can induce proliferation.
@highlight In vivo screen identified 12 sources of extracellular vesicles capable of inducing proliferation.
@highlight Extracellular vesicles from C6 cells promote Mller glia derived proliferation.
@highlight Extracellular vesicles from C6 cells induce Ascl1a expression.
