 Functional movements dysfunction is a potential risk factor of injuries . A variety of training strategies is proposed to improve the performance of FMs . We investigated if a system of fundamental movement exercises called Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization could improve FMs . Thirty four female students were randomly assigned into two matched groups to receive DNS versus physical fitness training . The groups practiced for six weeks . We used five FMs tests as pre and post measures of exercise effectiveness . Repeated Measures ANOVA showed a significant interaction in all five FMs tests in favour of DNS group F

@highlight Both PF and DNS groups have made significant progression.
@highlight The rate of progression was higher in DNS group vs. PF group in all five FMTs.
@highlight Progress rate in FMS scores was 12 times better in DNS group 60 vs. PF group 5 .
@highlight Practicing fundamental movements positively influenced all five FMTs.
@highlight Fundamental movement drills are likely to improve FMs.
