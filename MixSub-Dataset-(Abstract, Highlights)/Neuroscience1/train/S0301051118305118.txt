 Conflict induces psychophysiological responses but less is known about responses to intergroup conflict . Intergroup relationships activate social processes adding complexity to peoples physiological responses . This study analyzes the psychophysiological responses to intergroup conflict considering sex differences . Thus 150 young people were distributed in 50 groups in two conditions . Conflict was created in the interaction between two groups in the laboratory . Their responses were compared to a control group . Mood heart rate variability cortisol and testosterone were measured . Results showed that intergroup conflict induced a less pronounced decrease in negative and positive mood and a reduction in parasympathetic activity . Moreover women in conflict showed lower testosterone levels than men in conflict and control women . Finally womens conflict perception correlated with their psychophysiological response . Results suggest that intergroup conflict induces emotional cardiovascular and endocrine responses and that men and women interpret conflict differently .

@highlight During conflict participants showed decreases in parasympathetic activation.
@highlight During conflict only women showed decreases in testosterone levels.
@highlight Conflict perception only correlated with psychophysiological responses in women.
