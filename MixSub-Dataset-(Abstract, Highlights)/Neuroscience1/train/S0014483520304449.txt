 A significant proportion of research on the visual system focuses on general principles that apply to samples and or populations . Many questions however are more suited to the specific characteristics of an individual . The visual system like most systems of the body is extremely variable with respect to function and susceptibility to disease . Understanding this variation is an important avenue to better measurement disease prevention and treatment .

@highlight All things equal even young healthy adults show large individual variation in visual parameters and function. For example.
@highlight Peak macular pigment and lens optical density vary by over a factor of ten.
@highlight Photostress recovery times vary by over a factor of eight.
@highlight Visual range how far one can see varies by about 30 despite equal refractive state.
@highlight Intraocular scatter with its related glare issues varies over a two log unit range.
