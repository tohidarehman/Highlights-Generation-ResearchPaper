 Interoceptive deficits are associated with medial temporal lobe lesions and especially the hippocampus which may relate to interoception s reliance upon predictive coding and hence on mnemonic processes . Here we develop a new task to assess interoceptive predictions and assess their dependence upon MTL memory systems . Healthy participants were asked to imagine and predict what they would feel like across nine interoceptive situations . Later each situation was physically experienced and participants reported what they actually felt . An index of predictive congruence was derived and correlated with a neuropsychological measure of hippocampal dependent learning and memory finding that more accurate predictions were associated with better HDLM . We suggest the MTL and in particular the hippocampus generates contextually appropriate episodic memories providing a predictive framework for interpreting afferent bodily neurohormonal signals . The loss of this capacity may account for the profound interoceptive deficits observed following MTL lesions .

@highlight We develop a new measure of interoceptive prediction IP .
@highlight We demonstrate that IP is linked to Medial temporal lobe MTL memory systems.
@highlight This study points to the significance of MTL memory systems in interoception.
