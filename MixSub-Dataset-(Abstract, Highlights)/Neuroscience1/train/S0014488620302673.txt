 Despite the ability of peripheral nerves to regenerate after injury failure occurs due to an inability of supporting cells to maintain growth resulting in long term consequences such as sensorimotor dysfunction and neuropathic pain . Here we investigate the potential of engaging the cellular adaptive response to hypoxia via inhibiting its negative regulators to enhance the regenerative process . Under normoxic conditions prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins 1 2 and 3 hydroxylate the key metabolic regulator hypoxia inducible factor 1 marking it for subsequent proteasomal degradation . We inhibited PHD protein function systemically via either individual genetic deletion or pharmacological pan PHD inhibition using dimethyloxalylglycine . We show enhanced axonal regeneration after sciatic nerve crush injury in PHD1
