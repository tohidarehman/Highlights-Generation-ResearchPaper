 Evidence suggests that the relevant variable in the anti myopigenic effect of increased time spent outdoors is the increase in light intensity . Because light is the strongest Zeitgeber it is plausible that the effects of bright light exposure depend on time of day and may impact circadian rhythms . In these studies we asked whether the effects on eye growth rates and ocular rhythms of brief daily exposures to bright light differed depending on time of day in eyes developing myopia in response to form deprivation or negative lens induced hyperopic defocus . We also studied the effects of concurrent exposures to brief hyperopic defocus and bright light .

@highlight Brief bright light inhibits myopic eye growth only when given in the evening.
@highlight Concurrent brief bright light and hyperopic defocus inhibits growth in the morning.
@highlight Bright light at transition times affect ocular rhythms.
@highlight Effect of bright light on eye growth depend on whether defocus is continuous or brief.
