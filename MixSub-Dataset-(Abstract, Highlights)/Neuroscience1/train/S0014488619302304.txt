 Chitinase 3 like 1 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases . We investigated the effect of Chi3L1 knockout on stroke development . Ischemia reperfusion was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in Chi3L1 knockout and wildtype mice . Significantly increased infarct volume and decreased neurological deficit scores at 24h after ischemia reperfusion were found in Chi3L1 knockout mice compared to wildtype mice . Moreover ischemic neuronal cell death was increased in Chi3L1 knockout mice through increased oxidative stress and release of IL 6 and IL 1 but IL 10 and IL 4 were reduced . Furthermore expression of inflammation related proteins was significantly increased in Chi3L1 knockout mice compared to wildtype . In microglia isolated from MCAO injured Chi3L1 knockout mice expression of M1 markers was increased and M2 markers was decreased . In BV 2 cells knockdown of Chi3L1 increased TNF and INF induced expression of iNOS COX 2 and Iba 1 but decreased the expression of Arg1 MRC1 and IL 4 receptor alpha . Expression of IL 4R an important factor of M2 polarization and its downstream signals p JAK1 p JAK3 and p STAT6 was much reduced in the knockout mice . Additionally in BV 2 cells knockdown of Chi3L1 by siRNA Chi3L1 decreased rhTNF and INF induced expression of IL 4R p JAK1 p JAK3 and p STAT6 . Furthermore treatment with AS1517499 abolished Chi3L1 knockdown induced reduced IL 4R and Arg1 but not CD86 expression . Our results indicate that deletion of Chi3L1 accelerates stroke development through enhancement of neuroinflammation by markedly decreasing STAT6 dependent M2 macrophage polarization .

@highlight Chi3L1 is important for IL 4R expression and phosphorylation of STAT6 affecting micorglial M2 polarization.
@highlight Knockdown of Chi3L1 decrease IL 4R p JAK1 p JAK3 and p STAT6 expression level which blocking microglial M2 polarization.
@highlight Absence of Chi3L1 accelerates stroke development through STAT6 dependent M2 microglia inactivation.
