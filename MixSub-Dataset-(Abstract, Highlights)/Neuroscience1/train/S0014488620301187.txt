 The antiarrhythmic sodium channel blocker mexiletine is used to treat patients with myotonia . However around 30 of patients do not benefit from mexiletine due to poor tolerability or suboptimal response . Safinamide is an add on therapy to levodopa for Parkinson s disease . In addition to MAOB inhibition safinamide inhibits neuronal sodium channels conferring anticonvulsant activity in models of epilepsy . Here we investigated the effects of safinamide on skeletal muscle hNa

@highlight Safinamide reversibly inhibits skeletal muscle voltage gated sodium channels.
@highlight Safinamide effects on sodium channels are voltage and frequency dependent.
@highlight Safinamide likely binds to the local anesthetic receptor in the sodium channel pore.
@highlight Safinamide reduces action potential firing in hyperexcited rat skeletal muscle fibers.
@highlight Safinamide counteracts muscle stiffness in the myotonic rat in vivo.
