 Optic fissure closure defects result in uveal coloboma a potentially blinding condition affecting between 0.5 and 2.6 per 10 000 births that may cause up to 10 of childhood blindness . Uveal coloboma is on a phenotypic continuum with microphthalmia and anophthalmia the so called MAC spectrum . This review gives a brief overview of the developmental biology behind coloboma and its clinical presentation spectrum . Special attention will be given to two prominent syndromic forms of coloboma namely CHARGE
