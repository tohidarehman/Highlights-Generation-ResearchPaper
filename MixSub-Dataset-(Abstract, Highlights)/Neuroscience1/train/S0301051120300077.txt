 Psychosocial factors predict the development and course of cardiovascular disease perhaps through sympathetic and parasympathetic mechanisms . At rest heart rate is under parasympathetic control often measured as high frequency heart rate variability . During stress HR is influenced jointly by parasympathetic and sympathetic processes the latter often quantified as pre ejection period . In studies of cardiovascular risk factors that involve social interaction HF HRV might be altered by speech artifacts weakening its validity as a measure of parasympathetic activity . To evaluate this possibility we tested associations of HF HRV and PEP with HR at rest and across periods of marital conflict interaction that varied in experimentally manipulated degrees of speech in 104 couples . At rest only HF HRV was independently related to HR for both husbands and wives . During speaking listening and recovery periods husbands and wives HF HRV and PEP change independently predicted HR change . These findings support interpretation of HF HRV as a parasympathetic index during stressful social interactions that may confer risk for cardiovascular disease .

@highlight HF HRV was inversely associated with HR during a marital conflict task in the lab.
@highlight HF HRV HR association did not vary across task periods that differed in respiratory patterns.
@highlight HF HRV is a valid index of parasympathetic functioning during marital conflict.
@highlight Wives displayed sympathetic influence on HR before and after a marital conflict task.
