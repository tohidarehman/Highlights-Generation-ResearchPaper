 It has been suggested that factors such as auditory perception oral motor skills phonological awareness and working memory are all associated with speech production problems in children with speech sound disorder and developmental language disorder . However it remains unclear whether the severity of the speech production problems in these children can be explained by an interaction among the aforementioned factors . The aim of this study was to determine which of these four factors best explain the severity of the speech production problems in children with SSD and DLD and whether an interaction between factors occurs . Forty one children with SSD and DLD between 5 and 5 11 years old were selected . The number of phonological process errors was used as a measure of the severity of the speech production problems . The association between the number of phonological process errors and performance in auditory perception oral motor skills phonological awareness and working memory along with the severity of the DLD was explored using univariate and multivariate regression models . The results showed that the number of phonological process errors was largely explained by working memory and phonological awareness . An interaction between these two factors was also found . This means that working memory and phonological awareness interact to have an effect on the number of phonological process errors that is more than the sum of their parts .

@highlight Phonological awareness is associated with the severity of speech production problems.
@highlight The severity of the developmental language disorder is associated with the severity of speech production problems.
@highlight The severity of speech production problems is mainly explained by working memory.
