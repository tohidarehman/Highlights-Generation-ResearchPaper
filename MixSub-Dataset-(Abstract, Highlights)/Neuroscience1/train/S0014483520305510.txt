 This human primary co culture model using human retinal microvascular endothelial cells and human retinal pericyte cells aims to improve current understanding of the cellular changes occurring in the retinal microvasculature during diabetic retinopathy . Currently patients often present in clinic with late stage DR only when vision becomes impaired . Therefore new strategies for earlier detection in clinic combined with novel pharmaceutical and cellular interventions are essential in order to slow or halt the progression of DR from background to sight threatening stage . This co culture model can be used as a simple replicable in vitro tool to discover and assess novel drug therapies and improve fundamental understanding of alterations to cell behaviour in the human retinal microvasculature during DR .

@highlight hREC and hRP were successfully cultured long term without dedifferentiation.
@highlight In vitro hypoxic and hyperglycaemic conditions induced a diabetic like environment.
@highlight The endothelial barrier was maintained in healthy and diabetic long term culture.
@highlight hRP formed physical cytoplasmic contacts with hREC through pores in the BM mimic.
@highlight The angiogenic response profile was different between mono and co culture.
