 Eyelid basal cell carcinoma is the most common eyelid malignancy . Metabolic reprogramming is critical in tumorigenesis but the metabolic feature of eyelid BCC remains elusive . In this study we aim to reveal the metabolic profile in eyelid BCC using targeted metabolomics . Eyelid samples were collected from patients who had removal of BCC and from control patients who underwent blepharoplasty . Multivariate analysis of metabolomics data distinguished the two groups indicating that eyelid BCC has significantly different metabolome than the healthy tissue . We found 16 increased and 11 decreased metabolites in the BCC tissues . These metabolites were highly enriched in the metabolism of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide glutathione metabolism polyamine metabolism and the metabolism of glycine serine threonine arginine and proline . amino acid metabolism . Metabolites from NAD metabolism had the highest sensitivity specificity and prediction accuracy in a prediction model for eyelid BCC . In conclusion eyelid BCC has a signature change of cell metabolome . Metabolites in NAD metabolic pathways could potentially be biomarkers or therapeutic targets for eyelid BCC .

@highlight Using targeted metabolomics we reveal metabolic features in the most common eyelid malignancy basal cell carcinoma BCC .
@highlight Eyelid BCC alters NAD metabolism glutathione metabolism polyamine metabolism and amino acid metabolism.
@highlight Metabolites in NAD pathways are potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for eyelid BCC.
