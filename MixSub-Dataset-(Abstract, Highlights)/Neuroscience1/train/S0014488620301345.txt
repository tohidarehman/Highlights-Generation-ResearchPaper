 Death associated protein kinase 1 is a key protein that mediates neuronal death in ischemic stroke . Although the substrates of DAPK1 and molecular signal in stroke have been gradually discovered the modulation of DAPK1 itself is still unclear . Here we first reveal that Caytaxin a brain specific member of BCL2 adenovirus E1B interacting protein increases and interacts with DAPK1 as early as 2h after middle cerebral artery occlusion in the penumbra area of mouse brain . Furthermore Caytaxin binds to DAPK1 at the presynaptic site and inhibits DAPK1 catalytic activity . Silencing Caytaxin by Caytaxin shRNA enhances DAPK1 activity deteriorates neuronal apoptosis and brain injuries both

@highlight Caytaxin increases in the ischemic brain at the early phase of cerebral ischemic stroke.
@highlight Caytaxin interacts and inhibits DAPK1 in the presynaptic area.
@highlight Caytaxin prevents neuronal apoptosis and alleviates ischemic brain injury by inhibiting DAPK1 catalytic activity.
