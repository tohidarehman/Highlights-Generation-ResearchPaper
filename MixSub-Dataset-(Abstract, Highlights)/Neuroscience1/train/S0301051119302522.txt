 Although maternal postpartum depressive symptoms are associated with child behavior problems the underlying biological mechanisms are poorly understood . Thus the current study focused on 193 healthy mother child dyads and investigated child cortisol and telomere length as potential mediating factors . At 3 and 6 months postpartum mothers reported on PDS . At age 6 children provided saliva and buccal swab samples . At age 10 mothers and children reported on child behavior problems .

@highlight No associations found between postpartum depressive symptoms and child problems.
@highlight Biological markers at age 6 predicted child behavior problems at age 10.
@highlight Lower cortisol was related to more child reported internalizing problems.
@highlight Shorter telomere length was related to more child reported behavior problems.
@highlight First study to longitudinally link telomere length and child behavior problems.
