 An external focus of attention has consistently been associated with improved balance . Recent work has considered whether changes in postural control entropy a measure of repeated movement patterns could be a factor influencing this benefit . Rheaet al . reported that during quiet standing sample entropy when using an external focus was increased relative to baseline whereas an internal focus did not differ from baseline . External and internal focus conditions did not differ from each other but the authors speculated this difference may emerge with more complex balance tasks . The purpose of the present study was to determine if sample entropy and standard deviation of angular displacement differed when balancing on a stability platform while using an external internal or holistic focus . Young healthy adults

@highlight An external focus led to higher sample entropy in a balancing task.
@highlight An external focus may promote more adaptive motor control strategies.
@highlight A holistic focus does not appear to promote better balance performance.
