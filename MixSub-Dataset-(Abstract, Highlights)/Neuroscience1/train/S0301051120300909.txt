 The mutual influence of stimulus complexity and chunk tightness on perceptual restructuring was examined using a chunk decomposition task . Participants attempted to remove components of Chinese characters in order to produce new valid characters . Participants had their electroencephalogram recorded while completing a CDT in conditions of low or high stimulus complexity crossed with two levels of chunk tightness . Tight chunks overlapped spatially whereas loose chunks did not . Both increasing chunk tightness and increasing stimulus complexity impaired performance and these factors interacted such that highly complex tight chunks produced the worst performance . These factors also had interacting effects on the late positive complex . The LPC amplitude was reduced by increasing chunk tightness but this effect was attenuated for highly complex stimuli . These results suggest that though chunk tightness and stimulus complexity impair performance in the CDT they have dissociable neural underpinnings .

@highlight The influence of stimulus complexity and chunk tightness on perceptual restructuring was investigated.
@highlight The influence of stimulus complexity on chunk decomposition was modulated by chunk tightness.
@highlight Both chunk tightness and stimulus complexity impeded performances but had opposite effects on LPC.
