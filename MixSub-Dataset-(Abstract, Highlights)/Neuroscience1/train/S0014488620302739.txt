 Hypoxic ischemic brain injury is one of the most common neurological problems occurring in premature and full term infants after perinatal complications . Hypothermia is the only treatment approved for HI encephalopathy in newborns . However this treatment is only partially protective can not be used to treat premature infants and has limited efficacy to treat severe HI encephalopathy . Inflammation contributes to the evolution of HI brain injury in neonates . Inter alpha Inhibitor Proteins are immunomodulatory proteins that have neuroprotective properties after exposure to moderate HI in neonatal rats . The objective of the current study was to determine the neuroprotective efficacy of treatment with IAIPs starting immediately after or with a delay of one hour after exposure to severe HI of 120min duration . One hundred and forty six 7 day old rat pups were randomized to sham control HI and immediate treatment with IAIPs or placebo and sham HI and delayed treatment with IAIPs or PL . IAIPs or PL were given at zero 24 and 48h after HI or 1 24 and 48h after HI . Total brain infarct volume was determined 72h after exposure to HI . Treatment with IAIPs immediately after HI decreased

@highlight Exogenous inter alpha inhibitor proteins IAIPs reduce severe hypoxic ischemic injury.
@highlight Exogenous IAIPs decrease hypoxic ischemic infarction volumes in males and females.
@highlight IAIP treatment after a 1h reduces hypoxic ischemic infarction volumes in male rats.
