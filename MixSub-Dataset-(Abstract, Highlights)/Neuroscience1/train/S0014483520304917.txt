 Animal models have demonstrated a link between dysregulation of the retinal dopamine system and the development of experimental myopia . However pharmacological investigations of dopamine in animal models rely heavily on intravitreal or systemic administration which have several limitations for longer term experiments . We therefore investigated whether administration of dopamine as a topical eye drop can inhibit the development of form deprivation myopia in chicks . We also examined whether chemical modification of dopamine through deuterium substitution which might enhance stability and bioavailability can increase dopamine s effectiveness against FDM when given topically . Dopamine or deuterated dopamine Dopamine 1 1 2 2 d Both intravitreal ED Both intravitreal and topical application of dopamine inhibit the development of FDM in a dose dependent manner indicating that topical administration may be an effective avenue for longer term dopamine experiments . Deuterium substitution does not alter the protection afforded by dopamine against FDM when given as either an intravitreal injection or topical eye drop .

@highlight Dopamine eye drops inhibit deprivation myopia in a dose dependent manner in chicks.
@highlight Drops avoid the risks associated with intravitreal injections in chronic treatment.
@highlight When dose adjusted eye drops were 312 as effective as intravitreal injections.
@highlight Dopamine similarly inhibits deprivation myopia when chemically modified deuterated .
