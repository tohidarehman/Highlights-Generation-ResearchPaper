 Basement membranes are layers of extracellular matrix which anchor the epithelium or endothelium to connective tissues in most organs . Descemet s membrane which is the basement membrane for the corneal endothelium is a dense thick relatively transparent and cell free matrix that separates the posterior corneal stroma from the underlying endothelium . It was historically named Descemet s membrane after Jean Descemet a French physician but it is also known as the posterior limiting elastic lamina lamina elastica posterior and membrane of Demours . Normal Descemet s membrane ultrastructure in humans has been shown to consist of an interfacial matrix that attaches to the overlying corneal stroma an anterior banded layer and a posterior non banded layerupon which corneal endothelial cells attach . These layers have been shown to have unique composition and morphology and to contribute to corneal homeostasis and clarity participate in the control of corneal hydration and to modulate TGF induced posterior corneal fibrosis . Pathophysiological alterations of Descemet s membrane are noted in ocular diseases such as Fuchs dystrophy bullous keratopathy keratoconus primary congenital glaucoma as well as in systemic conditions . Unrepaired extensive damage to Descemet s membrane results in severe corneal opacity and vision loss due to stromal fibrosis which may require penetrating keratoplasty to restore corneal transparency . The purpose of this article is to highlight the current understanding of Descemet s membrane structure function and potential for regeneration .
