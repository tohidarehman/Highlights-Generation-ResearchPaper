 Accurate interpretation of speech requires the integration of verbal and nonverbal signals . This study investigated sex differences in behavior and neural activities associated with the integration of semantic content and emotional speech prosody while the level of autistic traits was controlled for . Adults listened to Cantonese words spoken with happy and sad prosody and made judgments on semantic valence while event related potentials were recorded . Behaviorally men were slower than women in making semantic valence judgments . At the neural level men had a greater congruity effect in the N400 component whereas women had a greater congruity effect in the 11501300 ms time window for happy prosodies . There was no effect of sex in case of sad prosodies . Our study reveals novel findings on sex differences in the timing of the integration between verbal and non verbal signals that can not be explained by differences in autistic traits .

@highlight Women made semantic valence judgments faster than men.
@highlight Men integrate happy prosody and word meaning earlier than women.
@highlight No effect of sex in sad prosody conditions.
