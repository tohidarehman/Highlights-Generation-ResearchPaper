 Retinal ischemia leads to an early severe damage of the retina and thus plays an important role in eye diseases such as angle closure glaucoma or retinal vascular occlusion . In retinal diseases there is common sense about the affection of the optic nerve by ischemic injury . However the exact dynamic processes of this optic nerve degeneration are mainly unclear . In this study retinal ischemia was induced in one eye of Brown Norway rats by raising the intraocular pressure 60min to 140mmHg followed by natural reperfusion . Optic nerves were analyzed at six different points in time 2 6 12 and 24h as well as 3 and 7 days after ischemic injury . Cell infiltration and moreover signs of tissue demyelination and dissolution were noticed in optic nerves 7 days after ischemia . Although microglial activation was verified already from 12h on after ischemia the beginning of a structural degeneration of the neurofilament was seen at 3 days . Interestingly proliferative microglia were present later on . At this point the number of total microglia was also increased in ischemic nerves . Concluding our data indicate that not only retinal tissue is affected by an ischemia the optic nerve also demonstrates progressive damage . Interestingly a microglia activation was noted days before structural damage became visible .

@highlight Structural alterations and demyelination are detectable in the optic nerve at the earliest 3 days after ischemic injury.
@highlight The microglia activation in the optic nerve starts already days before the later onset of the structural damage.
@highlight Results indicate that the optic nerve degenerates subsequently after retinal damage induced by ischemia.
