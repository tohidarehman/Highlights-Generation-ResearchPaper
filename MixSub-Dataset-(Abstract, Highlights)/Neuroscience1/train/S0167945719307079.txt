 The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Abdominal Enhancement on the muscle activation of vastus medialis obliquus vastus lateralis and rectus femoris muscle activation levels during eccentric isometric and concentric phases of single leg raise single leg wall squat and forward lunge exercises . Sixteen healthy individuals were included in the study . Internal Obliques Transversus Abdominis VMO RF and VL muscle activation levels were measured by surface EMG during the exercises in two conditions with and without AE . The abdominal drawing in technique was used for AE . Repeated measures analysis of variance was performed for statistical analysis . With AE the average of IO TA muscle activation level was 28.9 . VMO and VL muscle activation levels were significantly greater with AE during SLR

@highlight Enhanced abdominal co activation increase quadriceps activity during functional exercises.
@highlight Abdominal drawing in technique can be combined with the functional exercises.
@highlight Abdominal enhancement is more effective during single leg wall squat exercise.
