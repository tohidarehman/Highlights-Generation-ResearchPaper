 Research on heart rate variability received increasing attention . This study analysed the reliability of the most common HRV parameters for baseline measurements . 103 healthy students 83 women

@highlight Relative reliability of HRV measurements was lower than expected from literature.
@highlight Within subjects variability of HRV indices was large.
@highlight Reliability was unaffected by time interval between recordings and subjects posture.
@highlight This state of affairs hampers the detection of intended HRV changes over time.
