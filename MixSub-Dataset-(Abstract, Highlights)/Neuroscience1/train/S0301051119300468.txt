 Reward positivity is an EEG component reflecting reward prediction errors . Using multilevel models we measured single trial RewP amplitude from trial to trial while reward and prediction varied during learning . Sixty participants completed a category learning task in either engaging or sterile conditions with the RewP time locked to feedback . Sequential analysis of single trial RewP showed its relationship to current and previous accuracy and the probability of changing ones response to subsequent stimuli . Simulations show these effects can be explained in detail by the dynamics of participants expectations according to principles of reinforcement learning . The single trial RewP findings were consistent with previous literature linking RewP to reward prediction error under reinforcement learning theory . In contrast the aggregate RewP was unrelated to the engagement manipulation or to delayed retention performance . Thus the present results provide a detailed computational account how RewP relates to acute adaptation but suggest RewP plays little role in long term learning .

@highlight Participants learned to categorize complex visual stimuli.
@highlight Mixed effects regression modeled EEG amplitude time locked to feedback.
@highlight Single trial feedback amplitude was complexly related to accuracy and adaptation.
@highlight Novel simulations explain these results with a reinforcement learning model.
