 Previous research demonstrated that individuals are able to reliably reproduce their heart rate under physical load however they are prone to underestimate it . It was also assumed that the ability to perceive heartbeats under resting conditions might play a role in the regulation of physical activity . In an experimental setting 47 young individuals were asked to complete the Schandry task and reproduce three different exercise intensities with respect to heart rate on a treadmill . Resting heartbeat counting was moderately related to replication performance under slight physical load but not under more intense conditions . In all exercise conditions participants were prone to underestimate their actual heart rate . No significant gender difference was revealed . Actual and perceived performance were moderately associated at rest but not under physical load . In conclusion perception of heartbeats at rest is related to replication of heart rate during physical activity only at very weak physical load .

@highlight People are able to reliably replicate their heart rate under physical load.
@highlight However they usually underestimate the actual heart rate.
@highlight Resting heartbeat perception ability does not influence replication performance.
@highlight Objective and subjective perceived performance are not associated with each other.
