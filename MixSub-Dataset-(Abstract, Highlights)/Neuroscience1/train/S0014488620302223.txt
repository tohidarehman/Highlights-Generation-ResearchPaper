 Volume regulated anion channels are critically involved in regulating cell volume and leucine rich repeat containing protein 8A is an obligatory subunit of VRACs . Cell swelling occurs early after brain ischemia but it is unclear whether neuronal LRRC8a contributes to ischemia induced glutamate release and brain injury . We found that

@highlight Cerebral ischemia transiently increases LRRC8A protein levels in the hippocampus.
@highlight LRRC8A is essential for hippocampal neuronal VRAC activity increased by ischemia.
@highlight LRRC8A is required for hypotonicity potentiated glutamatergic input to neurons.
@highlight LRRC8A dependent VRACs contribute to brain injury caused by cerebral ischemia.
