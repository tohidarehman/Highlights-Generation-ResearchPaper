 The neuropeptide oxytocin has been shown to play a role in variety of cognitive and social processes and different hypotheses have been put forth to explain OTs effects on brain and behavior in humans . However these previous explanatory accounts do not provide information about OT related temporal modulation in the brain . This paper systematically reviewed intranasal OT administration studies employing event related potentials and synthesized the existing evidence into a novel conceptual framework . Empirical studies published until February 2020 and cited in major databases were examined in accordance with PRISMA guidelines . To be included studies had to The search criteria yielded 17 empirical studies . The systematic review resulted in conceptualization of the offers an empirically derived conceptual framework that can guide the study of OT related modulation on attentional processes starting very early in the processing stream . This novel account furthers theoretical understanding and informs empirical investigation into OT modulation on the brain .
