 Although acute hyperoxia hypoxia alternation can shift sharply physiological processes of vessel development e.g . oxygen induced retinopathy very little is known of metabolic products resulted from the neovascularization disorder . In this study the influence of abnormal oxygen exposures on the plasma metabolomic profiles of rats with OIR was investigated by the gas chromatography mass spectrometry . Rat pups were divided into four groups each with 12 individuals reared in room air and sampled at P12 exposed to high oxygen for 5 days and sampled at P12 reared in room air and sampled at P17 exposed to high oxygen for 5 days then followed by room air for 5 days and sampled at P17 . Plasma samples were analyzed with GC MS resulted in 122 metabolite species . Distinct differences in the plasma metabolome were found between groups of CT1 vs. HO1 and HO1 vs. HO2 by using univariate and multivariate analyses . Alternating hyperoxia hypoxia conditions induced significant changes of richness of proline ornithine and glutamine that were important components of arginine and proline metabolism pathway . These metabolites contributed largely to plasma sample classification determined with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and were involved profoundly in the proline dependent production of reactive oxygen species related to the cellular redox reactions . Our results from the rat OIR model suggest proline and arginine and proline metabolism pathway as the potential biomarkers for human retinopathy of prematurity diagnosis .
