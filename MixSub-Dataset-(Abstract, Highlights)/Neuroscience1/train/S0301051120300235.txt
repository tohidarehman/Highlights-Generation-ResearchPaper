 Transcutaneous stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve has been proposed as a treatment for a spectrum of physical and psychological disorders . One of the proposed working mechanisms of tVNS is a modulatory effect on the locus coeruleus noradrenaline network . We tested this hypothesis in humans in a series of three studies one focusing on high trait worriers and two in healthy populations . In all three studies we tested whether tVNS increases resting pupil diameter as an index of LC NA network activity . Additionally we tested whether tVNS affects task performance and task related pupil dilation during an Attentional Blink task . We found no evidence that tVNS increases pupil diameter or task related pupil dilation in any of the tasks . No consistent effects of tVNS on performance on the attentional blink task were found . Overall the results of these studies indicate that tVNS does not affect these behavioral and physiological indices of noradrenergic activity .

@highlight Effects of vagus nerve stimulation on noradrenergic activity is tested in three studies.
@highlight Vagus nerve stimulation does not affect attentional control in high trait worriers.
@highlight Vagus nerve stimulation does not affect noradrenergically driven pupil dilation.
