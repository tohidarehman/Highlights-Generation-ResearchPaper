 The eye is a very important organ in the human body which is affected by various external factors . One of these factors is the sunlight which can cause the visual impairment and as well as the increase in the oxidative stress . The heme oxygenase I plays a very important role in the fight against the oxidative stress . The HO enzyme catalyses the degradation of the heme to the ferrous iron the biliverdin and the carbon monoxide . The HO 2 is the isoform HO 1 and is mainly constitutively expressed . We have studied the changes in the HO 1 and the HO 2 in the retina on the level of the RNA and the protein in the summer and in the winter season . The retina of the eye was obtained from the breeding pigs in concern

@highlight HO enzyme is a protective protein against oxidative stress and main producer of CO recognized as anti depression factor.
@highlight Seasonal variation in HO expression in retina tissue was investigated.
@highlight Changes in the gene expression and protein synthesis of HO 1 and HO 2 isoforms were characterized.
@highlight The impact of some factors such as the length of the light day and biological clock on the HO synthesis was discussed.
