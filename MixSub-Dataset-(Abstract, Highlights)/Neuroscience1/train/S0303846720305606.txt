 SARS CoV 2 mainly invades respiratory epithelial cells by adhesion to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and thus infected patients may develop mild to severe inflammatory responses and acute lung injury . Afferent impulses that result from the stimulation of pulmonary mechano chemoreceptors peripheral and central chemoreceptors by inflammatory cytokines are conducted to the brainstem . Integration and processing of these input signals occur within the central nervous system especially in the limbic system and sensorimotor cortex and importantly feedback regulation exists between O

@highlight SARS CoV 2 mainly enter to CNS via direct neuronal and hematologic route and indirect route.
@highlight SARS CoV 2 can infect leukocytes within the bloodstream and then cross the blood brain barrier via diapedesis.
@highlight SARS CoV 2 can invade the vascular endothelium by binding to ACE 2 leading to increased permeability of blood brain barrier and then infecting glial cells in the CNS.
@highlight Future research is desirable to confirm or disprove such hypothesis.
