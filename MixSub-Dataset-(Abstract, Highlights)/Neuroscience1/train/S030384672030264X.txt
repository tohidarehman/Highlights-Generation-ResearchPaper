 Increasing research reports neurological manifestations of COVID 19 patients . SARS CoV 2 shares homology with other human coronaviruses that have also had nervous system involvement . To review the neurological aspects of SARS cov2 and other coronavirus including transmission pathways mechanisms of invasion into the nervous system and mechanisms of neurological disease . We conducted a systematic review of articles in PubMed SCOPUS and EMBASE data bases . Reviewed evidence is presented in sections of this manuscript which includes pathogenesis neuro invasion encephalitis Guillain Barr ADEM multiple sclerosis polyneuropathy and cerebrovascular disease . A total 67 studies were included in the final analysis of experimental studies case reports series of cases cohort studies and systematic reviews related to neurological manifestations of SARS CoV 2 and other human coronavirus infections . An increasing number of reports of COVID 19 patients with neurological disorders add to emergent experimental models with neuro invasion as a reasonable concern that SARS CoV 2 is a new neuropathogen . How it may cause acute and chronic neurologic disorders needs to be clarified in future research .

@highlight Neurological manifestations has been reported in SARS CoV2 infection recently.
@highlight SARS CoV2 could spread to the brain hematogenously or through the cribriform plate.
