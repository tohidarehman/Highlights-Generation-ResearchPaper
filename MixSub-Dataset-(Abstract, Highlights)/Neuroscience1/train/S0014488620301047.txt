 This report was produced by an Expert Working Group consisting of UK based researchers veterinarians and regulators of animal experiments with specialist knowledge of the use of animal models of spinal cord injury . It aims to facilitate the implementation of the Three Rs with an emphasis on refinement . Specific animal welfare issues were identified and discussed and practical measures proposed with the aim of reducing animal use and suffering reducing experimental variability and increasing translatability within this critically important research field .

@highlight Pre clinical research into SCI is currently dominated by the use of animal models.
@highlight These models can involve significant injury and have the potential to cause high levels of suffering.
@highlight A UK based expert working group has identified animal welfare issues associated with modelling SCI in animals.
@highlight This article sets out practical refinements to improve animal welfare.
