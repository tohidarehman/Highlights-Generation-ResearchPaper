 Neurogenic bowel following spinal cord injury leads to decreased colonic motility remodeling of the neuromuscular compartment and results in chronic evacuation difficulties . The distal colon of the rat serves a dual role for fluid absorption and storage that is homologous to the descending colon of humans . Dysmotility of the descending colon is one component of neurogenic bowel . We investigated the integrity of the enteric neuromuscular transmission responsible for the generation of excitatory and inhibitory junction potentials in the distal colon of rats . We previously demonstrated a chronic reduction in colonic enteric neurons from rats with acute and chronic high thoracic SCI and hypothesized that neurogenic bowel following T3 SCI results from diminished enteric neuromuscular transmission .

@highlight Inhibitory myenteric nNOS immunoreactive cells are reduced by injury
@highlight Excitatory neuromuscular signaling is diminished following spinal cord injury
@highlight Nitrergic slow inhibitory neuromuscular signaling is diminished following SCI
@highlight Purinergic fast inhibitory neuromuscular signaling was unaffected by SCI
@highlight Excitatory myenteric choline acetyltransferase immunopositive cells are reduced by injury
