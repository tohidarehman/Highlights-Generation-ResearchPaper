 Given the essential role of the blood brain barrier in the central nervous system cumulative investigations have been performed to elucidate how modulation of BBB structural and functional integrity affects the pathogenesis of CNS diseases such as stroke traumatic brain injuries dementia and cerebral infection . Recent studies have demonstrated that microRNAs contribute to the maintenance of the BBB and thereby mediate CNS homeostasis . This review summarizes emerging studies that demonstrate cerebral miRNAs regulate BBB function in CNS disorders emphasizing the direct role of miRNAs in BBB molecular composition . Evidence presented in this review will encourage a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which miRNAs regulate BBB function and facilitate the development of new miRNAs based therapies in patients with CNS diseases .

@highlight MiRNAs play a crucial role in the regulation of BBB structure and function.
@highlight MiRNAs directly regulate the expression of junctional proteins in CNS diseases.
@highlight MiRNAs mediate BBB structure and function
@highlight multiple mechanisms in CNS diseases.
