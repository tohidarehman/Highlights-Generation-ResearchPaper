 The reactive oxygen species producing enzyme NADPH oxidase 4 is upregulated in response to TGF in lens epithelial cells

@highlight Nox4 is not essential but involved in TGF induced lens EMT
@highlight Nox4 deficiency delays the onset of TGF induced cataract
@highlight In situ Nox2 upregulation may compensate for a loss of Nox4 expression.
@highlight ERK1 2 signaling is required for TGF Smad2 3 signaling.
