 To identify the feasibility of reconstructing corneal endothelial sheets by seeding non infected monoclonal human corneal endothelial cells onto porcine Descemet s membrane and verifying the function in vitro and in vivo . Denuded porcine DM was decellularized for haematoxylin and eosin staining and DNA was removed via incubation with ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether . The physical properties of the incubated DMs were evaluated and compared to those of unincubated DMs . The non infected monoclonal HCECs were examined by chromosome analysis and the cell proliferation was evaluated by BrdU labelling . Then HCECs at passage 30 were then seeded on the DM and cultured for approximately 5 days . The cell growth density and expression of the sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase . Results of chromosome analysis shown the number of the HCEC cell line was still 46 and no abnormal chromosome structure was found . BrdU labelling shown the HCECs stopped proliferating after 5 days and the cells formed a single layer . The cells transferred to porcine DM formed tight connections with the substrate and generated layers of hexagonal cells on day 5 . Adjacent cells cultivated on DM were closely attached to each other tightly adhered to the porcine DM and expressed the Na Seeding non infected monoclonal HCECs on porcine DM could reconstruct functional corneal endothelial sheets . These results may help uncover new applications for tissue engineered endothelium in endothelial keratoplasty .

@highlight Human corneal endothelial cells HCECs cultured on porcine Descemets membrane DM expressed functional proteins.
@highlight Corneas received the reconstructed HCEC sheets became transparency after Descemets membrane endothelial keratoplasty DMEK .
@highlight The corneal thickness and the density of corneal endothelial cells were similar to normal corneas after DMEK.
@highlight 98 days after surgery cells on the transplanted sheets were dense and tightly adhered to the porcine DM.
