 Long noncoding RNA potassium voltage gated channel subfamily Q member 1 opposite strand antisense transcript 1 takes part in diabetic cataract progression . This research aims to analyze the function and mechanism of KCNQ1OT1 on viability migration and epithelial mesenchymal transition in lens epithelial cells . 20 diabetic cataract posterior lens capsule tissues and normal samples were collected . Lens epithelial cells were stimulated via high glucose . The levels of KCNQ1OT1 miR 26a 5p integrin V TGF Smad3 and phosphorylated Smad3 were measured via quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction or Western blot . Cell viability migration and EMT were analyzed via MTT wound healing transwell and Western blot assays . The target relationship between miR 26a 5p and KCNQ1OT1 or ITGAV was determined via luciferase reporter assay . KCNQ1OT1 was up regulated and miR 26a 5p level was reduced in diabetic cataract tissues and HG treated SRA01 04 cells . Silence of KCNQ1OT1 or miR 26a 5p up regulation repressed cell viability migration and EMT in SRA01 04 cells stimulated via HG . KCNQ1OT1 could target miR 26a 5p and controlled cell viability migration and EMT via regulating miR 26a 5p . ITGAV was targeted via miR 26a 5p and positively regulated via KCNQ1OT1 . ITGAV overexpression promoted cell viability migration and EMT in HG treated SRA01 04 cells which were mitigated by KCNQ1OT1 silence . KCNQ1OT1 knockdown mitigated HG induced the activation of TGF Smad3 signaling by regulating miR 26a 5p . KCNQ1OT1 knockdown represses cell viability migration and EMT through miR 26a 5p ITGAV TGF Smad3 axis in SRA01 04 cells under HG condition providing a new target for the treatment of diabetic cataract .
