 Against the backdrop of hundreds of studies documenting negative stereotypes and stigma held by the public regarding people who stutter a substantial number of investigations have attempted to improve public attitudes and measure their results with a standard instrument the This study sought to determine what properties of interventions and demographic variables were predictive of least to most successful interventions . Preliminary to that however it required the division of samples into clearly differentiated categories of success . Twenty nine different study samples containing 934 participants were categorized into four levels of success of interventions according to pre versus post Interventions characterized by high interest or involvement meaningful material and content that respondents found to be relevant but not excessive tended to be associated with more successful interventions . In contrast demographic variables were weak predictors of intervention success . The authors hypothesize that maximally effective interventions reflect optimal matches between participant characteristics and intervention features although the critical variables in each are not yet apparent .

@highlight pre and post means classified 29 different samples into 4 success categories.
@highlight Three factors of interventions predicted success in improving stuttering attitudes.
@highlight These were audience interest personal connection and relevant information.
@highlight Demographic variables did not predict intervention success.
@highlight Effective interventions reflect optimal matches between interventions and audiences.
