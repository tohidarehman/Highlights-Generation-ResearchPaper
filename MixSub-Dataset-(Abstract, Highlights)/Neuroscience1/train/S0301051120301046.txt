 Terror management theory proposes cultural worldview and self esteem as two buffers against death anxiety . The neural mediators of these buffering effects however have not been fully understood . The present work investigated neural mediation mechanisms between self esteem cultural trait and mortality salience effects on self face processing . We found that MS priming eliminated self face advantage in behavioral judgments of face orientation in low self esteem individuals and reduced self face advantage in behavioral judgments of facial familiarity in individuals with high interdependent self construals . Our functional magnetic resonance imaging results showed that following MS priming insular activities mediated the relationship between self esteem and self face advantage in face orientation judgments whereas dorsal medial prefrontal activity mediated the relationship between interdependent self construal and self face advantage in face familiarity judgments . Our findings suggest that distinct neural mechanisms are engaged in mediating the relationships between self esteem cultural trait and MS effects on the emotional and cognitive processes of self relevant information .

@highlight Self esteem buffered the MS effect on implicit self face advantage SFA .
@highlight Interdependent self construal IDS buffered the MS effect on explicit SFA.
@highlight Self esteem and the IDS buffered the MS effect in different neural circuits.
@highlight Self esteem enhanced the SFA by decreasing the insula activities after MS priming.
@highlight Interdependent self construal reduced the SFA by increasing the dmPFC activities.
