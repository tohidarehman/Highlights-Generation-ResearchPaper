 Inherited retinal degenerative disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa and Usher syndrome are characterized by progressive death of photoreceptor cells . To restore vision to patients blinded by these diseases a stem cell based photoreceptor cell replacement strategy will likely be required . Although retinal stem cell differentiation protocols suitable for generating photoreceptor cells exist they often yield a rather heterogenous mixture of cell types . To enrich the donor cell population for one or a few cell types scientists have traditionally relied upon the use of antibody based selection approaches . However these strategies are quite labor intensive and require animal derived reagents and equipment that are not well suited to current good manufacturing practices . The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a microfluidic cell sorting device capable of exploiting the physical and mechanical differences between retinal cell types to enrich specific donor cell populations such as Retinal Pigment Epithelial cells and photoreceptor cells . Using this device we were able to separate a mixture of RPE and iPSC derived photoreceptor precursor cell lines into two substantially enriched fractions . The enrichment factor of the RPE fraction was 2 and that of the photoreceptor precursor cell fraction was 2.7 . Similarly when human retina obtained from 3 independent donors was dissociated and passed through the sorting device the heterogeneous mixture could be reliably sorted into RPE and photoreceptor cell rich fractions . In summary microfluidic cell sorting is a promising approach for antibody free enrichment of retinal cell populations .
