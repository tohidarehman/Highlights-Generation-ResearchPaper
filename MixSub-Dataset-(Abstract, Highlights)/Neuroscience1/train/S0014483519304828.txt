 Acylated lysine residues represent major chemical modifications in proteins . We investigated the malonylation and propionylation of lysine residues in the proteins of aging human lenses . Western blot results showed that the two modifications are present in human lens proteins . Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry results showed 418 and 432pmol mg protein of MalK and PropK respectively in human lens proteins with no apparent changes related to aging . Mass spectrometry results revealed that MalK and PropK modified lysine residues are present in all major crystallins other cytosolic proteins and membrane and cytoskeletal proteins of the lens . Several mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins in cultured human lens epithelial cells showed MalK and PropK modifications . Sirtuin 3 and sirtuin 5 were present in human lens epithelial and fiber cells . Moreover lens epithelial cell lysate deacylated propionylated and malonylated lysozyme . The absence of SIRT3 and SIRT5 led to higher PropK and MalK levels in mouse lenses . Together these data suggest that MalK and PropK are widespread modifications in lens and SIRT3 and SIRT5 could regulate their levels in lens epithelial cells .

@highlight SIRT3 and SIRT5 are present in human lenses and they are catalytically active in epithelial cells but not in fiber cells.
@highlight Malonylation and propionylation of lysine residues occurs in human lens proteins and the levels of MalK and PropK do not change significantly during aging.
@highlight The absence of SIRT3 and SIRT5 leads to increased propionylation and malonylation proteins in mouse lenses.
