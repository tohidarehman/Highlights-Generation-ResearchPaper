 SARM1 is the central executioner of pathological axon degeneration promoting axonal demise in response to axotomy traumatic brain injury and neurotoxic chemotherapeutics that induce peripheral neuropathy . SARM1 is an injury activated NAD

@highlight cADPR is gene dosage sensitive biomarker of SARM1 activity.
@highlight SARM1 is the major source of neuronal cADPR.
@highlight cADPR is unlikely to promote axon degeneration.
@highlight Mitochondrial dysfunction can trigger partial SARM1 activation.
@highlight cADPR and NfL are complementary biomarkers of SARM1 dependent axon degeneration.
