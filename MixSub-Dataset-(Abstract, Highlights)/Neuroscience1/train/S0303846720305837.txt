 Subcutaneous immunoglobulin administered through infusion pump has been reported as effective in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy patients . In this study we evaluate an alternative technique of SCIg administration based on the delivery of lower volumes administered daily using manual push technique in 10 CIDP patients . In this randomized controlled two arm crossover clinical trial CIDP patients were randomly assigned 1 1 to receive SCIg either by MPT or pumps for 4 consecutive months with crossover to the other . The primary objective was to assess whether MPT had the same effectiveness as pumps . The secondary objectives were to assess whether MPT resulted in greater plasma IgG levels and improved quality of life . Ten patients were enrolled . No significant changes were observed in the efficacy parameters . A positive mean variation of 5.4 in plasma IgG levels in the group treated with MPT was observed at the end of MPT periods . Treatment interference which is one of the dimensions of the Life Quality Index showed a significant improvement in the MPT periods . In CIDP patients the MPT technique was as effective as pump infusion allowed comparable slightly increases plasma IgG levels and also improved the QoL .

@highlight Patients affected by CIDP were enrolled in this proof of concept study.
@highlight Manual push technique MPT is widely used to administer SCIg in PIDD patients.
@highlight Also in CIDP patients MPT proved clinically effective and improved QoL.
