 Sigma 1 receptors have been implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders and are a novel target for the treatment of such disorders . Sig 1R expression activity deficits are linked to neurodegeneration whereas the mechanisms mediated by Sig 1R are still unclear . Here presynaptic

@highlight Sigma 1R antagonist NE 100 has biphasic effects on synaptosomal GABA uptake
@highlight NE 100 mitigates hypoxia associated transporter mediated glutamate release
@highlight NE 100 decreases synaptosomal KCl evoked exocytotic release of GABA glutamate
@highlight Ionomycin stimulated release of GABA glutamate is not affected by NE 100
@highlight Therefore NE 100 specifically acts in an acute manner at the presynaptic level
