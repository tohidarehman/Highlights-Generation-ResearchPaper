 Retinal vessels are at least in part involved in clearing of Fc terminus containing proteins from the vitreous . In vitro the Fc fusion protein aflibercept is transported through a monolayer of unchallenged immortalized bovine retinal endothelial cells mediated by the neonatal Fc receptor but part of the Fc fusion protein is also degraded . Aflibercept s target VEGF A not only enhances the permeability of REC by destabilization of tight junctions thereby allowing for paracellular flow it may also lower the intracellular stability of the Fc fusion protein by changing its binding properties to the FcRn . Therefore we investigated the transport and fate of aflibercept in VEGF A

@highlight VEGF A enhances aflibercept s passage through a monolayer of retinal endothelial cells.
@highlight Passage of aflibercept is not dependent on the FcRn under these conditions.
@highlight Exogenously added VEGF A is internalized and degraded by retinal endothelial cells.
@highlight Aflibercept prevents uptake of VEGF A by retinal endothelial cells early after addition.
@highlight VEGF A induced disturbances persist for nearly one day after addition of aflibercept.
