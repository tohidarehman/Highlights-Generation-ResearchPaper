 Although there have been suggestions that altered cognitive control and food reward sensitivity contribute to overeating in obese individuals neurophysiological correlates of these mechanisms have been poorly investigated . The current study investigated event related potentials in 24 severely obese and 26 normal weight individuals in fasting condition using a novel Simon task with food and object distractors .

@highlight The effect of a food distractor on cognitive control increases with the desire to eat.
@highlight The obese participants showed a larger interference for the food distractors.
@highlight The PF N1 was sensitive to food distractors in both groups of participants.
@highlight The obese subjects showed delayed P2 and smaller N2 amplitudes for the distractors.
@highlight Both metabolic states and neural abnormalities seem to affect control toward food.
