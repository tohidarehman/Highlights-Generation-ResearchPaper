 Safe street crossing is important for older adults social inclusion . We assessed gait kinematic adaptation under different simulated street crossing conditions in older adults with Parkinson s disease and made comparisons with older adults without PD to understand how PD interferes in outdoor task performance helping in the development of strategies to reduce road traffic accident risk . In 20 older adults without PD and 20 with PD we assessed usual gait gait during street crossing simulation and gait during reduced time street crossing simulation . Velocity step length and step swing stance and double support time were analyzed . Spatiotemporal differences in gait between groups and conditions were analyzed . The GPD walked 16 slower in C1 and 12 slower in C2 and C3 than the CG . GPD also took 11 shorter steps in C1 and 9.5 shorter steps in C2 . The double support time was 8.5 greater in C1 . In intragroup comparisons there were significant differences in all gait conditions . The CG showed increased velocity step length and swing time and decreased step time stance time and double support time . GPD showed increased velocity step length and swing time and decreased step time stance time and double support time . Kinematic changes observed in the intergroup comparison show that participants with PD had lower velocity in all conditions . However per the intragroup results both participants with and without PD managed to significantly modify gait variables to attempt to cross the street in the given time . It is necessary to assess whether this increases fall risk by exposing them to road traffic accidents .
