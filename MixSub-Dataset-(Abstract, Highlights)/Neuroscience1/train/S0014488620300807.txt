 Adult neurogenesis in hippocampus dentate gyrus is associated with the etiology on the early stage of Alzheimer s disease . Factors that affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been shown to contribute to the neuropathology of AD . Adiponectin a peptide hormone secreted by adipocytes plays a critical role in insulin sensitizing anti inflammatory and anti diabetic effects in peripheral tissues . We previously showed that AdipoRon as an agonist of adiponectin promotes neurite outgrowth under ischemia . However the role of AdipoRon on neural stem cells proliferation and cognitive dysfunction in the early stage of AD remains unknown . In this study we investigated the role of AdipoRon on cognitive dysfunction and deficits of NSCs proliferation in AD . The
