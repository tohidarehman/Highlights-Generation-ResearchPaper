 Neovascularization is a critical process in the pathophysiology of neovascular eye diseases . Although anti VEGF therapy has achieved remarkable curative effects complications limited efficacy and drug resistance remain the prominent problems . DCZ3301 an aryl guanidino compound was reported to have anti tumor activity in the previous studies . Here we demonstrated the effects of DCZ3301 on human umbilical vein endothelial cell

@highlight DCZ3301 retards the proliferation migration and tube formation of HUVECs.
@highlight DCZ3301 inhibits choroid microvascular sprouting.
@highlight DCZ3301 diminishes the area of corneal neovascularization after alkali burn in mice.
@highlight DCZ3301 induces spontaneous apoptosis of HUVECs by suppressing the activation of PI3K AKT and ERK1 2 pathways.
