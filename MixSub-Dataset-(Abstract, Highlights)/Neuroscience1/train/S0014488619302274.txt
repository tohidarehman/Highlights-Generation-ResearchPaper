 Migraine is a complex brain disorder that involves abnormal activation of the trigeminocervical complex . Since an increase of oxytocin concentration has been found in cerebrospinal fluid in migrainous patients and intranasal oxytocin seems to relieve migrainous pain some studies suggest that the hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin may play a role in migraine pathophysiology . However it remains unknown whether oxytocin can interact with the trigeminovascular system at TCC level . The present study was designed to test the above hypothesis in a well established electrophysiological model of migraine . Using anesthetized rats we evaluated the effect of oxytocin on TCC neuronal activity in response to dural nociceptive trigeminovascular activation . We found that spinal oxytocin significantly reduced TCC neuronal firing evoked by meningeal electrical stimulation . Furthermore pretreatment with L 368 899 abolished the oxytocin induced inhibition of trigeminovascular neuronal responses . This study provides the first direct evidence that oxytocin probably by OTR activation at TCC level inhibited dural nociceptive evoked action potential in this complex . Thus targeting OTR at TCC could represent a new avenue to treat migraine .

@highlight The trigeminocervical complex TCC is involved in migraine and dural nociception.
@highlight Oxytocin at TCC inhibits the dural evoked nociception.
@highlight Blockade of oxytocin receptors OTR at TCC abolished the OXT induced antinociception.
@highlight Relevance of oxytocinergic neurotransmission modulating migraine is suggested.
