 Previous studies have provided inconsistent evidence concerning the association between delayed retrieval of story information from long term memory and retrieval of words on verbal fluency tasks . The current study looks for shared retrieval mechanisms in these tasks from childhood to old age . Three hundred and eighty participants performed tasks of story recall digit span phonemic fluency and semantic fluency . Significant correlations between delayed story recall and both fluency tasks emerged in all age groups and the contribution of delayed story recall to fluency performance remained significant when analyzing the combined effects of story recall and digit span . These findings suggest that retrieval of information through story recall and retrieval of words on fluency tasks may share similar cognitive components .

@highlight Delayed story recall associates with phonemic and semantic fluency.
@highlight Associations between story recall and fluency appear across a wide age range.
@highlight Working memory predicts phonemic fluency only and only in adults.
@highlight Retrieval of story details and retrieval of words may rely on similar components.
