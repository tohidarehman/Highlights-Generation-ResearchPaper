 Despite internationally established diagnostic criteria multiple system atrophy is frequently misdiagnosed particularly at disease onset . While neuropathological changes such as demyelination and iron deposition are typically detected in MSA these structural hallmarks were so far only demonstrated

@highlight MBP29 h syn mice show severe myelin deficit and iron accumulation in white matter.
@highlight Quantitative susceptibility mapping QSM visualizes and quantifies both hallmarks.
@highlight QSM and T2 weighted MRI allow precise distinction of MBP29 h syn mice from controls.
@highlight Magnetic susceptibility highly correlated with iron and myelin optical density.
