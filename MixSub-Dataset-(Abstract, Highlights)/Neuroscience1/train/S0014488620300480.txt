 Traumatic brain injury affects millions of individuals every year . Many of these injuries lead to lasting effects particularly impairments in domains broadly classified as executive functions such as impulse control and decision making . While these impairments have been historically associated with frontal brain damage other injuries such as concussion or parietal injury also contribute to similar dysfunction . However it is unknown whether animal models of TBI would replicate these broad effects that are observed in human patients . In the current study we delivered a unilateral parietal controlled cortical impact injury and assessed the performance of rats on a motoric task and a test of decision making and impulsivity . TBI rats demonstrated significant motor impairments on the rotarod task however this did not extend to difficulties inhibiting motor actions . In addition TBI caused chronic alterations to risk based decision making extending out to 12weeks post injury . Specifically rats with TBI preferred the riskiest and most suboptimal option over all others . The current data suggest that models of unilateral TBI are sufficient for replicating some aspects of executive dysfunction while others are limited to frontal damage . These models may be used to develop therapeutics targeted at the chronic post injury period when these symptoms often manifest in patients a critically understudied area in preclinical TBI research .

@highlight Unilateral parietal traumatic brain injury TBI increased choice of the riskiest alternatives.
@highlight Unilateral parietal TBI caused motor impairments on the rotarod task but had no effect on motor impulsivity.
@highlight Though primarily prefrontally mediated unilateral parietal TBI is sufficient to impair risk based decision making.
