 The simple manipulation of pairing specific outcomes with the sample stimuli strongly affects discriminative learning and memory processes . This procedure has been named the Differential Outcomes Procedure and is usually compared to a control condition consisting in the random administration of the outcomes after each correct response . Recent research has revealed that the DOP effect arises even under unconscious conditions . In this study we explored the temporal dynamics of short term memory processes in both the DOP and the NOP in the absence of awareness of either the outcome or the initial sample stimulus through the evoked related potentials technique . Results showed distinctive electrophysiological activation patterns in the DOP compared with the NOP at encoding maintenance and retrieval phases . The present findings provide electrophysiological evidence of implicit prospective processes involved in the DOP . They elucidate the processes that result in improved visual recognition memory .
