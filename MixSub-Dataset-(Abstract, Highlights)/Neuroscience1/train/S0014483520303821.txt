 Pterygium is a degenerative disease that characterized by excessive fibrovascular proliferation . To reduce the recurrence rate surgery is the main strategy in combination with adjacent procedures or adjunctive therapy . One of the most common adjunctive agents mitomycin C is known as an alkylating agent that inhibits fibroblast proliferation but is limitedly applied in pterygium due to various complications . A previous study demonstrated that activated pterygium subconjunctival fibroblasts overexpressed low density lipoprotein receptors . In this study we designed and synthesized MMC loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles conjugated with LDL

@highlight LDL is conjugated with mitomycin C loaded nanoparticles for targeted delivery.
@highlight Activated pterygium fibroblasts uptake more targeted nanoparticles.
@highlight LDL targeted MMC shows a good antiproliferative effect on pterygium fibroblasts.
@highlight LDL targeted MMC shows a lower toxicity to normal fibroblasts.
