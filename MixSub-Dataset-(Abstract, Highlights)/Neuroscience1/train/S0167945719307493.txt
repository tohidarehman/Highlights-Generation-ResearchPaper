 The OPTIMAL theory of motor learning contends that an external focus of attention enhanced expectancies and autonomy support are key attentional and motivational variables that optimise motor performance . We examined how integrating an EF into EE and AS interventions would impact young adolescents standing long jump performance and self efficacy perceived competence task effort task importance and positive affect . Forty eight participants completed 3 jumps in a baseline EF EE EF and AS EF conditions . Both the EF and AS EF conditions improved jump performance from baseline . The EF EE EF and AS EF conditions improved young adolescents self efficacy perceived competence task effort and positive affect in comparison to baseline and were predictors of jump performance . However in the EE EF condition motivational states improved but this did not translate into performance improvements . The findings show that directing attention to visual external cues both independently and when framed within AS conditions enhanced young adolescents jump performance and motivation through efficient goal action coupling . In practice PE teachers and sports coaches working with young adolescents can support autonomy by allowing self definition of success using an external cue to enhance effective goal action coupling motor performance and motivation .

@highlight Directing attention to a visual external cue improved young adolescents jump performance.
@highlight An external focus when paired with autonomy support also improved motor performance from baseline .
@highlight Enhanced expectancies when combined with an external focus led to enhanced motivation but not performance.
@highlight OPTIMAL variables positively influenced motivational characteristics.
@highlight Motivational characteristics significantly contributed to jump performance.
