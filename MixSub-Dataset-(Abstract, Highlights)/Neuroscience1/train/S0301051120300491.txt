 Conditioned pain modulation test examines central pain inhibitory processing . Aerobically trained individuals show greater CPM . However there is a paucity of knowledge regarding CPM among resistance exercise trained individuals although regular engagement in resistance exercise may lead to greater CPM via augmented blood pressure responses during the CPM test . Therefore the present study compared CPM and BP responses between resistance exercisers and controls . The participants completed the CPM test to evaluate changes in electrical pain ratings to the ankle after cold pressor test consisting of immersing a hand into a cold water bath compared to baseline . REs and controls exhibited similar CPM although REs showed greater systolic BP responses to CPT compared to controls . The results suggest that the role of BP in CPM is likely complex and the role of exercise in central pain processing and cardiovascular system needs to be studied .

@highlight Less is known about pain inhibition and blood pressure in resistance exercisers.
@highlight Resistance exercisers showed greater blood pressure responses to cold pressor test.
@highlight Resistance exercisers did not show greater pain inhibition after cold pressor test.
@highlight Role of exercise in pain and blood pressure regulation is likely complex.
