 The goal of this study in anesthetized cats was to identify silent hypogastric nerve afferent fibers that do not respond to bladder distention but become responsive after chemical irritation of the bladder . The HGN was split into multiple filaments small enough for recording action potentials from single or multiple afferent fibers . The bladder was distended by infusion of either saline or 0.5 acetic acid through a urethral catheter while recording intravesical pressure . A total of 90 HGN filaments from 17 cats responded to bladder distention with saline or AA . Three types of HGN afferents were identified . The first type was non nociceptive mechano sensitive that responded to bladder distention at normal physiological pressures 1040 cmH

@highlight Hypogastric afferents respond to both bladder distention and irritation.
@highlight Silent hypogastric afferents can only respond to high bladder pressure.
@highlight Some chemo sensitive hypogastric afferents do not respond to bladder distension.
@highlight Hypogastric afferents may play an important role in bladder pain or overactivity.
