 Mental disorders with physical symptoms e.g . somatic symptom disorder are characterized by altered interoceptive accuracy which can be explained by individual differences in interoceptive learning . We investigated if stress facilitates IL . Seventy three healthy participants performed a heartbeat counting task and a heartbeat perception training . After exposure to a socially evaluated cold pressor stress test or a control condition two more HCTs were performed . After the HBPT all participants showed an increase in IAc . We separated the stress group into high vs. low systolic blood pressures responders with high SBP responders showing the largest IAc increases . Only SBP but not cortisol responsiveness significantly predicted IAc increase from T1 to T2 . Our results indicate that post learning autonomic stress response facilitates IL whereas the HPA axis response may be less important for this effect .

@highlight We investigated if post learning stress facilitates interoceptive accuracy IAc learning.
@highlight IAc increased in the stress groups and the control group 30 min and 24 h after IAc training.
@highlight IAc showed highest increase in high systolic blood pressure SBP responders after 30 min.
@highlight SBP response but not cortisol response to the stressor predicted IAc increase.
@highlight Interoceptive learning may be facilitated by post learning autonomic stress.
