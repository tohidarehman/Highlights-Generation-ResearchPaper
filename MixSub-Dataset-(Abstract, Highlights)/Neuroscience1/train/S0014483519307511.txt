 Loss of choriocapillaris in advanced age related macular degeneration is well documented but changes in early AMD have not been quantified . Postmortem eyes from donors with clinically documented early AMD were examined in choroidal whole mounts to determine the area pattern and severity of CC loss . Choroids from postmortem human eyes without AMD and from eyes with a Grade 2 clinical classification of early AMD were immunolabeled with

@highlight There is significant loss of submacular choriocapillaris in subjects with early AMD compared to control subjects.
@highlight On the contrary there was no vascular pathology in paramacular choriocapillaris of the AMD subjects.
@highlight Attenuation of choriocapillaris was associated with arteriosclerotic and hypertensive changes in Sattler s layer arterioles.
@highlight Some of the areas of choriocapillaris loss had early choroidal neovascularization formations.
