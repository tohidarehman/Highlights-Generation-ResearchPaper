 Collagen fibers organized circumferentially around the canal in the peripapillary sclera are thought to provide biomechanical support to the sensitive tissues within the optic nerve head . Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a family of fibers in the innermost sclera organized radially from the scleral canal . Our goal was to determine the role of these radial fibers in the sensitivity of scleral canal biomechanics to acute increases in intraocular pressure . Following the same general approach of previous parametric sensitivity studies we created nonlinear generic finite element models of a posterior pole with various combinations of radial and circumferential fibers at an IOP of 0mmHg . We then simulated the effects of normal and elevated IOP levels . We monitored four IOP induced geometric changes peripapillary sclera stretch scleral canal displacement lamina cribrosa displacement and scleral canal expansion . In addition we examined the radial and through thickness strains within the ONH tissues . Our models predicted that 1 radial fibers reduced the posterior displacement of the lamina especially at elevated IOP 2 radial fibers reduced IOP induced radial strain within the peripapillary sclera and retinal tissue and 3 a combination of radial and circumferential fibers maintained strains within the ONH at a level similar to those conferred by circumferential fibers alone . In conclusion radial fibers provide support for the posterior globe additional to that provided by circumferential fibers . Most importantly a combination of both fiber families can better protect ONH tissues from excessive IOP induced deformation than either alone .

@highlight Radial fibers reduce lamina cribrosa displacement especially at elevated IOP.
@highlight Radial fibers reduce the maximum tension in peripapillary sclera and retinal tissues.
@highlight Radial and circumferential fibers together protect the ONH better than either alone.
