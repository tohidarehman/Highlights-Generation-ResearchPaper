 IQ domain GTPase activating protein 1 is a multidomain scaffold protein that is involved in cytoskeleton dynamics and tumor metastasis . Although the role of IQGAP1 in various cancers had been reported the function of IQGAP1 in pterygium has not been studied . In this study surgically excised pterygium and control conjunctival tissue from cataract patients were analysed by immunohistochemistry confocal microscopy and Western blot for IQGAP1 expression mast cell counts and microvascular count . Pterygium was clinically divided into mild and severe types according to Tan s classification and Kim s criteria based on translucency and vascularity of the tissue . Greater clinical severity of pterygium was associated with higher expression of IQGAP1 expression . Compared to normal conjunctival tissue severe pterygium had significantly higher IQGAP1 expression which strongly correlated to the number of microvessels and mast cells . Confocal microscopy revealed IQGAP1 colocalization with mast cell and CD31 . IQGAP1 expression was higher in the pterygium body compared to the head . In conclusion the level of IQGAP1 expression was found to be correlated to the clinical severity of pterygium . Mast cells were identified in pterygium and is suspected to be involved in promoting fibrovascular invasion .

@highlight IQGAP1 is expressed in both the normal conjunctiva and pterygium.
@highlight Greater clinical severity of pterygium is correlated with higher IQGAP1 expression.
@highlight Greater mast cells and microvascular counts are associated with clinical severity of pterygium.
