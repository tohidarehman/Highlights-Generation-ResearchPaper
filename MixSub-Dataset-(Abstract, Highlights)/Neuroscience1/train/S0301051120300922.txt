 The item to be concealed elicits greater physiological arousal than other items . Since high physiological arousal causes an overestimation of time the display duration of an item is expected to be perceived as longer when people intend to conceal it . After stealing and concealing one item 36 university students were asked to judge the display duration of an item as shorter than equal to or longer than a memorised duration of 2 s. Pictures of three items including the stolen item were presented in the guilty condition whereas pictures of three items that had not been stolen were presented in the innocent condition . The display of all items in the guilty condition was perceived as longer than in the innocent condition without difference between the concealed and other items . The intention to conceal increases tonic arousal reflected in a higher skin conductance level and leads to a non specific temporal overestimation .

@highlight Time perception during concealment was investigated.
@highlight People perceived the duration of items as longer when they concealed one of them.
@highlight Skin conductance level was higher in the guilty than in the innocent condition.
