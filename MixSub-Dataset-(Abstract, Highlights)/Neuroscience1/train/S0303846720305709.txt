 To compare ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients with COVID 19 to non COVID 19 controls and to describe changes in stroke admission patterns during the pandemic . This is a single center retrospective observational study . All consecutive patients admitted with primary diagnosis of ischemic hemorrhagic stroke between March1st May10th 2020 were included and compared with the same time period in 2019 . There was a 41.9 increase in stroke admissions in 2020 . When comparing all ischemic strokes higher rate of large vessel occlusion and significant delay in initiation of mechanical thrombectomy after hospital arrival was observed in 2020 . When comparing all hemorrhagic strokes there were no differences between the two years . Among 591 COVID 19 admissions 31 patients with stroke including 19 with ischemic and 12 with hemorrhagic stroke were identified . Patients with COVID 19 and ischemic stroke were significantly younger predominantly male had lesser vascular risk factors had more severe clinical presentation and higher rate of LVO . There was no difference in the rate of endovascular thrombectomy but time to groin puncture was significantly longer in COVID 19 patients . For hemorrhagic stroke COVID 19 patients did not differ from non COVID 19 patients . Stroke continues to occur during this pandemic and stroke pathways have been affected by the pandemic . Stroke occurs in approximately 5 of patients with COVID 19 . COVID 19 associated ischemic stroke occurs in predominantly male patients who are younger with fewer vascular risk factors can be more severe and have higher rates of LVO . Despite an increase in LVO during the pandemic treatment with mechanical thrombectomy has not increased . COVID 19 associated hemorrhagic stroke does not differ from non COVID 19 hemorrhagic stroke patients .

@highlight in 2019 and 2020 at a single comprehensive stroke center in Middle East there was a 41.9 increase in stroke admissions in 2020. A higher rate of large vessel occlusion LVO and significant delay in initiation of mechanical thrombectomy after hospital arrival was observed in 2020.
@highlight Among all COVID 19 admissions in 2020 5.24 patients suffered stroke including 3.21 with ischemic and 2 with hemorrhagic stroke.
@highlight Patients with COVID 19 and ischemic stroke were significantly younger predominantly male had fewer vascular risk factors had more severe clinical presentation and higher rate of LVO ccompared to ischemic stroke patients without COVID 19
@highlight For hemorrhagic stroke COVID 19 patients did not differ from non COVID 19 patients.
