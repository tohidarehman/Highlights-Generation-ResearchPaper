 Methamphetamine an addictive stimulant of neurotransmitters is associated with cardiovascular and neurological diseases . METH induced ophthalmic complications are also present but have been insufficiently investigated . The purpose of this study is to investigate the retinal effects of METH . C57BL 6 mice were administrated progressively increasing doses of METH by repetitive intraperitoneal injections for 5 days . Retinal degeneration was examined by morphological changes and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling assay . Norepinephrine levels were measured by ELISA protein expression levels were determined by immunoblot and immunostaining and gelatinase activity was examined by zymography . The thickness of the retina and the number of nuclei in the inner and outer nuclear layers were decreased by METH . Retinal cell death and astrocyte activation by METH treatment were confirmed by TUNEL assay and glial fibrillary acidic protein expression respectively . Increased tumor necrosis factor protein in the retina and elevated norepinephrine levels in plasma were found in METH treated mice . Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 protein expression level was decreased in the retina and central retinal artery by METH treatment along with the endothelial proteoglycans glypican 1 and syndecan 1 . Moreover a regulator of the extracellular matrix matrix metalloproteinase 14 in the retina and MMP 2 and MMP 9 in plasma were increased by METH treatment . In conclusion METH administration is involved in retinal degeneration with a vascular loss of PECAM 1 and the glycocalyx in the CRA and retina and an increase of MMPs .

@highlight Methamphetamine induces retinal neurodegeneration in mice.
@highlight PECAM 1 and glycocalyx are lost from retinal vessels and central retinal artery following methamphetamine administration.
@highlight Methamphetamine increases MMP 14 levels in the retina and MMP 2 and MMP 9 levels in plasma.
