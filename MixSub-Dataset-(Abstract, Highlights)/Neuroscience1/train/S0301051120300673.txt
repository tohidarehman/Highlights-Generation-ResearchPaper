 Past work has demonstrated that the reward positivity indexes a feedback monitoring system sensitive to positive outcomes . Research on the RewP has frequently used simple guessing tasks . In the doors task participants receive either feedback denoting monetary gain or loss on each trial after choosing one of two doors to open . Typically these tasks present visual stimuli on a computer monitor . The current study developed and validated a version of the doors task utilizing auditory stimuli to indicate gains and losses . Thirty eight young adults completed both a standard visual doors task and a novel auditory doors task . Results indicated that the audio RewP was more positive and peaked earlier than the visual RewP . Additionally the audio RewP both moderately correlated with and demonstrated similar internal consistency as the visual RewP . These results suggest that the auditory doors task elicits the same feedback monitoring processes as the visual doors task .

@highlight Neural responses to feedback of varying sensory modalities were compared.
@highlight RewPs in auditory and visual doors tasks showed similar psychometric properties.
@highlight The auditory RewP was more positive than and correlated with the visual RewP.
