 Orbital venous malformations are the most common benign orbital vascular disorders in adults and are characterized as enlarging encapsulated vascular neoplasms . These painless lesions grow slowly and become symptomatic with proptosis or visual disturbance . However the pathogenic mechanism and diagnostic markers of OVMs remain poorly understood . To identify potential pathways involved in OVM formation a cDNA microarray analysis was conducted with OVM samples and normal vascular tissues . These data were deposited in the National Omics Data Encyclopedia database . These pathway expression data were further confirmed by reverse transcription qPCR in an OVM cohort . To explore the diagnostic markers in OVM an angiogenesis antibody array was analyzed . The altered factors were further validated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in the OVM cohort . Transcriptome screening revealed upregulated autophagy and VEGF pathways and downregulated Hippo Wnt hedgehog and vascular smooth muscle contraction signaling pathways in OVM samples . Furthermore plasma EGF and Leptin levels were significantly elevated in OVM patients . Here for the first time we revealed the transcriptional background and plasma diagnostic markers in OVM providing a novel understanding of OVM pathogenesis and facilitating the early diagnosis of OVM .

@highlight Transcriptome screening revealed 2 upregulated and 4 downregulated signaling pathways in OVM samples.
@highlight E2F1 was identified as the key transcriptional factor in regulating aberrant expression of lncRNAs.
@highlight The plasma EGF and Leptin levels were significantly elevated in OVM patients.
