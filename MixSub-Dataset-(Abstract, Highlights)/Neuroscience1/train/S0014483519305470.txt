 The interaction of keratocytes with extracellular matrix components plays an important role in the maintenance of corneal transparency and shape as well as in the healing of corneal wounds . In particular the interaction of these cells with collagen and cell mediated collagen contraction contribute to wound closure . Endo180 is a receptor for collagen that mediates its cellular internalization . We have now examined the role of Endo180 in collagen contraction mediated by corneal fibroblasts . Antibodies to Endo180 inhibited the contractile activity of mouse corneal fibroblasts embedded in a three dimensional collagen gel and cultured in the presence of serum with this effect being both concentration and time dependent and essentially complete at an antibody concentration of 0.2g ml . Whereas corneal fibroblasts cultured in a collagen gel manifested a flattened morphology with prominent stress fibers under control conditions they showed a spindlelike shape with few stress fibers in the presence of antibodies to Endo180 . Antibodies to Endo180 had no effect on the expression of smooth muscle actin or the extent of collagen degradation in collagen gel cultures of corneal fibroblasts . Immunohistofluorescence analysis did not detect the expression of Endo180 in the unwounded mouse cornea . However Endo180 expression was detected in keratocytes migrating into the wound area at 3 days after a corneal incisional injury . Together our results suggest that Endo180 is required for the contraction of collagen matrix mediated by corneal fibroblasts and that its expression in these cells may contribute to the healing of corneal stromal wounds .
