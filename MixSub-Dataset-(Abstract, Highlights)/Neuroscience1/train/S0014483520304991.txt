 The cannabinoid signaling system regulates intraocular pressure in the mouse via a complex system that includes three receptors CB1 GPR18 and GPR119 . In each case activating the receptor lowers IOP but CB1 receptors are found both at sites of aqueous humor inflow and outflow . As such knockout mice for any of these receptors would be expected to have higher than average or at least unchanged intraocular pressure . The current study investigates the unexpected observation that CB1 knockout mice have lower pressure than wild type counterparts by testing various regulators of cannabinoid signaling in murine models of IOP . We now report that a CB1 antagonist has differential effects on IOP SR141716 raises IOP in standard light cycle but lowers IOP in reverse light cycle . This is mimicked by ABD1085 a negative allosteric modulator of CB1 . CB1 inhibitors lower IOP in both normotensive and hypertensive mouse eyes . The pressure lowering effect is absent in CB1 knockout mice . IOP rebounds after the end of treatment but shows no sign of desensitization with daily treatment for a week . Unlike the positive cannabinoid effect antagonist effects are not sex dependent . We propose that there are two mechanisms of action for CB1 one that lowers IOP upon activation and a second with inverse sign that lowers IOP when CB1 is antagonized . The relatively lower pressure in CB1 knockout mouse eyes suggests that this second negative regulation of IOP is dominant .

@highlight Cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation and antagonism can each lower ocular pressure.
@highlight CB1 antagonism appears to be dominant in terms of its effects on ocular pressure.
@highlight Both CB1 antagonists and negative allosteric modulators can lower ocular pressure.
@highlight Unlike CB1 agonist effects CB1 antagonist action is not sex dependent.
