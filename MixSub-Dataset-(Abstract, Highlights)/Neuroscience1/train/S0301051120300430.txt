 People are better at recognizing familiar versus unfamiliar faces . The current study investigated whether familiarity would lead to a larger face individuation response as measured via fast periodic visual stimulation . While electroencephalography was recorded participants viewed oddball sequences of faces made up of more versus less familiarized faces . In each sequence a single base face was repeated at a rate of 6 Hz and oddball faces with different identities were presented every fifth face . As in previous studies significant face individuation responses were observed at 1.2 Hz and its harmonics with the strongest responses located over right occipito temporal electrode sites . Despite a relatively minimal learning manipulation the face individuation response over right occipito temporal sites was stronger for more versus less familiarized faces . These results suggest that the fast periodic visual oddball paradigm offers a promising means for investigating face learning .
