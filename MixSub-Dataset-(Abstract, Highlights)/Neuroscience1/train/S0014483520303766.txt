 Large animal models of optic nerve injury are essential for translating novel findings into effective therapies due to their similarity to humans in many respects . However most current tests evaluating the integrity of retinal ganglion cells and optic nerve are based on rodent animal models . We aimed to evaluate and optimize the

@highlight We established a system to test optic nerve s integrity in Goats and rhesus macaques.
@highlight Anesthesia with isoflurane resulted in more reproducible FVEP than xylazine in goats.
@highlight Anesthesia with xylazine resulted in more reproducible PERG than xylazine in goats.
@highlight Intra ocular crosstalk of PERG was undetectable in goats.
@highlight Large Ganzfeld stimulator resulted in more reproducible FVEP than minimized one.
