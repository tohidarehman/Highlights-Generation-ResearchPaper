 Serotonin axons in the adult rodent brain can regrow and recover their function following several forms of injury including controlled cortical impact a neocortical stab wound or systemic amphetamine toxicity . To assess whether this capacity for regrowth is unique to serotonergic fibers we used CCI and stab injury models to assess whether fibers from other neuromodulatory systems can also regrow following injury . Using tyrosine hydoxylase immunohistochemistry we measured the density of catecholaminergic axons before and at various time points after injury . One week after CCI injury we observed a pronounced loss across cortical layers of TH axons posterior to the site of injury . One month after CCI injury the same was true of TH axons both anterior and posterior to the site of injury . This loss was followed by significant recovery of TH fiber density across cortical layers both anterior and posterior to the site of injury measured three months after injury . TH axon loss and recovery over weeks to months was also observed throughout cortical layers using the stab injury model . Double label immunohistochemistry revealed that nearly all TH axons in neocortical layer 1 2 are also dopamine beta hyroxylase while TH axons in layer 5 are a mixture of DBH and dopamine transporter types . This suggests that noradrenergic axons can regrow following CCI or stab injury in the adult mouse neocortex and leaves open the question of whether dopaminergic axons can do the same .

@highlight We measured catecholaminergic axon density using TH immunohistochemistry following two forms of brain injury.
@highlight Controlled cortical impact and stab injuries caused extensive damage to catecholamine axons in the neocortex of adult mice.
@highlight Following both types of injury axon density slowly returned to control values over many weeks.
@highlight These findings suggest that monaminergic axons have an unusual capacity for regrowth following injury in the adult brain.
