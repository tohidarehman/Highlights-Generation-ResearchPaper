 CDKL5 deficiency disorder is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by early onset epilepsy severe intellectual disability cortical visual impairment and motor disabilities . Epilepsy is a central feature of CDD with most patients having intractable seizures but seizure frequency and severity can vary . Clinical reports demonstrate a diversity in seizure semiology and electrographic features with no pattern diagnostic of CDD . Although animal models of CDD have shown evidence of hyperexcitability spontaneous seizures have not been previously reported . Here we present the first systematic study of spontaneous seizures in mouse models of CDD . Epileptic spasms the most frequent and persistent seizure type in CDD patients were recapitulated in two mouse models of CDD carrying heterozygous mutations
