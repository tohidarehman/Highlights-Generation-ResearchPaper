 The lamina cribrosa is the initial site of glaucomatous injury . Pathological changes to the lamina cribrosa include posterior displacement of the lamina cribrosa loss of trophic support and remodeling of the extracellular matrix . Optic nerve head astrocytes and lamina cribrosa cells synthesize extracellular matrix proteins to support and maintain the lamina cribrosa under physiological conditions . During glaucoma these cells respond to mechanical strain and other stimuli which leads to pathological remodeling of the ONH . Although ONH astrocytes and lamina cribrosa cells have been previously cultured there is no well accepted straightforward technique to isolate both cell types from a single dissected human ONH . To better understand the pathophysiology of glaucoma we obtained and cultured lamina cribrosa explants from human donor eyes . Initially cells that grew out from the explant were ONH astrocytes and lamina cribrosa cells . Using a specialized medium we isolated pure populations of lamina cribrosa cells and ONH astrocytes . ONH astrocytes expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein . Lamina cribrosa cells expressed alpha smooth muscle actin but were negative for GFAP . This method of ONH cell isolation and cell culture will provide a technique to better understand the molecular and cell specific changes in glaucomatous damage to the ONH .
