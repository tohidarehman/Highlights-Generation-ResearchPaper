 Peripheral nerve injuries can significantly reduce quality of life . While some recover most do not recover fully resulting in neuropathic pain and loss of sensation and motor function . Research on the mechanisms of peripheral nerve regeneration could elucidate poor patient outcomes and potential treatments . This study was designed to determine if brain derived neurotrophic factor is necessary for pudendal nerve regeneration and functional recovery . Peripheral administration of tyrosine kinase B functional chimera was used to inhibit the BDNF regenerative pathway . Female Sprague Dawley rats received tyrosine kinase B functional chimera or saline after a pudendal nerve crush or Sham PNC and were divided into three groups Sham PNC PNC Saline and PNC TrkB . Seven days after injury relative

@highlight Brain derived neurotrophic factor is needed for pudendal nerve regeneration.
@highlight TrkB Fc decreases peripheral free brain derived neurotrophic factor.
@highlight TrkB Fc administration decreases PN motoneuron beta II tubulin expression.
