 Individuals with 5p deletion syndrome ten times over a period of five years . His scores were compared to those of typically developing infants aged eight to 20 months . It was found that the subject followed a considerably delayed but not deviant developmental trajectory in three areas receptive vocabulary productive vocabulary and communicative gestures compared to typically developing infants and toddlers . The speech and language problems of individuals with 5p deletion syndrome which have been documented in the domains of phonetics and phonology and grammar also extend to gestural and lexical development . The findings of this study will have clinical implications for assessment in that a broad assessment of gestural and lexical skills should be carried out as early as possible as a basis for interventions to improve communicative skills .

@highlight Communicative gestures develop over time in 5p deletion syndrome.
@highlight Receptive and productive vocabulary develop like in typically developing children.
@highlight Gestural and lexical skills show a considerably protracted development.
