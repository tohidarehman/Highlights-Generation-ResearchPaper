 Autophagy plays critical roles in various ocular diseases including age related macular degeneration . Tie2 expressing macrophages play crucial roles in angiogenesis . To investigate the role of TEMs and autophagy in the development of AMD we employed macrophage specific Tie2 knockout mice and used a laser induced choroidal neovascularization . The results showed that TEMs can promote CNV formation by up regulating the level of autophagy . These results were further verified by in vitro cell experiments that peritoneal macrophages from Tie2 knockout mice can inhibit the expression of autophagy related factors and inhibit the expression of angiogenic factor of VEGF by activating AMPK signaling pathway . Our results suggest that TEMs and macrophage Tie2 signal mediated autophagy play critical role in experimental CNV and they may be novel preventive targets for AMD treatment .
