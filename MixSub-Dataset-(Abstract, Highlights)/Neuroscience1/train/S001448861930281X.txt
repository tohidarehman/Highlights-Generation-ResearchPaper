 Fabry disease is an X linked lysosomal storage disorder that leads to cellular globotriaosylceramide accumulation due to mutations in the gene encoding galactosidase A . Trigger induced acral burning pain is an early FD symptom of unknown pathophysiology . We aimed at investigating the potential role of skin fibroblasts in nociceptor sensitization . We enrolled 40 adult FD patients and ten healthy controls who underwent a 6 mm skin punch biopsy at the lower leg . Dermal fibroblasts were cultivated and analyzed for Gb3 load . Fibroblast electrical activity was assessed using patch clamp analysis at baseline and upon incubation with agalsidase for 24h . We investigated gene expression of C Total Gb3 load was higher in FD fibroblasts than in control fibroblasts Gb3 deposition in skin fibroblasts may impair K

@highlight Gb3 load is elevated in Fabry dermal fibroblasts
@highlight Gb3 induces immediate reduction of K
@highlight 1.1 channel activity
@highlight Notch1 pathway is activated in fibroblasts of male Fabry patients with pain
@highlight Cytokine gene expression is elevated in fibroblasts of male Fabry patients with pain
