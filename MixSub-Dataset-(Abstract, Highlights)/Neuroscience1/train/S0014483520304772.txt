 Oxidative damage in retinal pigment epithelial cells is considered to be a crucial pathogenesis of age related macular degeneration . Although dysregulation of the DNA repair system has been found in RPE cells of AMD patients the detailed molecular mechanisms of this dysregulation and their relationship with the intraocular microenvironment of AMD patients remain unclear . Here we established an RPE model of H

@highlight High deacetylation of E2F1 depends on Sirt1 in oxidative stress adapted RPE cells.
@highlight Deacetylated E2F1 promotes the pentose phosphate pathway through activating the E2F1 HMGA1 G6PD axis.
@highlight IL 6 induces the phosphorylation of Sirt1 and inhibits its deacetylase activity by activating PI3K AKT mTOR signaling.
@highlight IL 6 induced acetylation of E2F1 impairs the antioxidant capacity of RPE cells.
