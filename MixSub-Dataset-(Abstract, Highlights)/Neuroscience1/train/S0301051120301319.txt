 Although great progress has been made in our understanding of perceptual cognitive expertise in team sports the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying such cognitive advantage in the face of multiple sometimes conflicting channels of information are not well understood . Two electroencephalographic indices associated with perceptual decisions the P3 component of event related potential and alpha inter trial phase coherence were measured and compared across elite soccer players and non athletic controls while performing a redundant target task . Specifically we adopted an effective diagnostic tool Systems Factorial Technology to assess participants workload capacity . Soccer players exhibited larger workload capacity while making faster decisions compared with controls . Moreover this larger workload capacity was associated with modulations of P3 and alpha ITPC when processing two targets relative to one target and one distractor an effect that was not observed in controls . Together the present findings offer a possible mechanistic explanation of perceptual cognitive expertise in the context of team sports .

@highlight We used Systems Factorial Technology to examine perceptual decision making in elite soccer players.
@highlight We used both ERP and EEG to explore the neural mechanisms underlying perceptual decisions.
@highlight Soccer players showed greater processing capacity when making faster decisions.
@highlight Soccer exhibited greater faster and more stable neural activities during multiple signal processing.
@highlight Team sports players process multiple sources of information in a different way than their peers.
