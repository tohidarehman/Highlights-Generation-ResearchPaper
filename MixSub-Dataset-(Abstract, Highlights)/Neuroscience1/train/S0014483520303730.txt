 The corneal endothelium is the inner cell monolayer involved in the maintenance of corneal transparence by the generation of homeostatic dehydration . The glycosaminoglycans of the corneal stroma develop a continuous swelling pressure that should be counteracted by the corneal endothelial cells through active transport mechanisms to move the water to the anterior chamber . Protein transporters for sodium Na
