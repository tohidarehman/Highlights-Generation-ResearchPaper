 The central nervous system and the eye are involved in Human immunodeficiency virus related disease . Although optic nerve is considered an extension of the CNS it has not been systematically evaluated to determine if infections of brain can extend into the eye or vice versa . The brain and posterior compartment of eyeball retrieved at autopsy of patients succumbing to NeuroAIDS were evaluated with Hematoxylin Eosin special stains and immunohistochemistry for infective pathogens . Multiplex PCR was performed in vitreous CSF and serum for simultaneous detection of bacterial viral and protozoal opportunistic infections . Ocular involvement in NeuroAIDS was seen in 93.7 with opportunistic infection being the most common 62.5 with toxoplasma optic neuropathy in 5 Cryptococcal optic neuritis in 3 and Cytomegalovirus chorioretinitis in 2 . Concordance between ocular and CNS pathology was seen in 50 of cases . CSF PCR was more sensitive than PCR in vitreous for detecting ocular infections in posterior compartment of eye .

@highlight First study to evaluate both ocular and CNS pathology in HIV AIDS for detecting opportunistic infections by multiplex PCR.
@highlight Ocular manifestations were common in cases of NeuroAIDS even in the absence of clinical symptoms of ocular involvement.
@highlight CSF PCR was more sensitive than vitreous PCR in detecting posterior chamber pathology.
