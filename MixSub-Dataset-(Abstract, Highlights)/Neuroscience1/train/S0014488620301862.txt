 Large peripheral nerve defects require bridging substrates to restore tissue continuity and permit the regrowth of sensory and motor axons . We previously showed that cell free PN segments repopulated

@highlight Schwann cells genetically engineered to express different neurotrophic factors.
@highlight Transduced Schwann cells added to nerve sheaths prior to peroneal nerve engraftment.
@highlight Graft morphology and the amount of axon regeneration varied between graft types.
@highlight The type of sensory neuron that regenerated varied depending on neurotrophic factor.
@highlight There were more regenerating NeuN negative motor neurons in NT 3 nerve grafts.
