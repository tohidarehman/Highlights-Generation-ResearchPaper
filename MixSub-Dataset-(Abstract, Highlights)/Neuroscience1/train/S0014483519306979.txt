 Multiple aspects of cornea development including the innervation of the cornea by trigeminal axons are sensitive to embryonic levels of thyroid hormone . Although previous work showed that increased TH levels could enhance the rate of axonal extension within the cornea in a thyroxine dependent manner details underlying the stimulatory effect of TH on cornea innervation are unclear . Here by examining the effects throughout all stages of cornea innervation of the two main THs triiodothyronine and T4 we provide a more complete characterization of the stimulatory effects of TH on corneal nerves and begin to unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms . During development trigeminal axons are initially repelled at the corneal periphery and encircle the cornea in a pericorneal nerve ring prior to advancing into the corneal stroma radially from all along the nerve ring . Overall exogenous T3 led to pleiotropic effects throughout all stages of cornea innervation whereas the effects of exogenous T4 was confined to timepoints following completion of the nerve ring . Specifically exogenous T3 accelerated the formation of the pericorneal nerve ring . By utilizing

@highlight Pericorneal nerve ring formation was accelerated and corneas became precociously innerved in T3 treated embryos.
@highlight T3 acts as a trophic factor to directly stimulate trigeminal nerve growth.
@highlight Robo Slit pathway expression is reduced in eyefronts following T3 exposure.
@highlight Growth rate and defasciculation of nerves increased within T3 or T4 treated corneas.
@highlight KSPG CSPG and sulfation enzyme levels were modulated in T3 and T4 treated corneas.
