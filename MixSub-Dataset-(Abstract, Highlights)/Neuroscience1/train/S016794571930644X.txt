 Since the upper cervical spine has been regarded to be distinct from the lower cervical spine joint position error needs to be tested separately for both regions . The purpose of this study was to investigate the JPE after cervical protraction retraction movements involving opposite movements of extension and flexion for the UCS and LCS . These movements are frequently performed during office work .

@highlight Joint position error measurements after pro retraction movements in office workers
@highlight Kinect sensor used for measurements to distinguish upper from lower cervical spine
@highlight No effect of movement direction cervical region and sex on JPE
@highlight Open eyes condition do not improve reposition accuracy after pro retraction
