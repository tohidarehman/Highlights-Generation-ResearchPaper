 Sleep wake disturbances are both a risk factor and reported morbidity for intracerebral hemorrhage . ICH begins with a ruptured blood vessel and blood leakage into the parenchyma . In response to initial damage pathophysiological processes ensue that both exacerbate and repair damage . Inflammation is a hallmark process of ICH which includes microglia activation and increased cytokine signaling . Due to the dual role of cytokines as inflammatory signaling proteins and sleep regulatory substances we hypothesized that ICH would activate microglia increase SRSs and alter sleep wake patterns following an experimental model of ICH in the mouse . Male mice were randomized to receive an injection of collagenase ICH

@highlight We investigated inflammation and sleep wake patterns after ICH.
@highlight Experimental ICH increased sleep and reduced wake was time of day dependent.
@highlight Microglia were activated in the perihematomal region after experimental ICH.
@highlight Inflammation may contribute to ICH induced sleep wake patterns.
