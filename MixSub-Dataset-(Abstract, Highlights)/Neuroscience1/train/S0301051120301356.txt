 While impairments in reward learning have been observed in depression individual differences also exist among healthy normative populations and these differences have been parametrically mapped onto naturally occurring inter individual variability in neuroanatomy . To date alterations of cortical thickness as a function of reward learning have not been studied . Structural MRI and behaviourally assessedrobabilistic reward learning data from 103 participants n

@highlight Reward learning is positively associated with cortical thickness.
@highlight This effect emerged in the right medial superior frontal cortex.
@highlight Female participants showed higher levels of reward learning.
