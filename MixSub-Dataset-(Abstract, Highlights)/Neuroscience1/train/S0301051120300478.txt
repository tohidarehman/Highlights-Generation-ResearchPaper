 Auditory mismatch processing is accompanied by activation of a distributed brain network which can be detected by fMRI . However the impact of different experimental designs such as event related or block designs and different stimulus characteristics on the auditory mismatch response and the activity of this network remains controversial . In the present study we applied five auditory mismatch paradigms with standard experimental designs and recorded fMRI in 31 healthy participants . Brain activity was analyzed using general linear models as well as classification approaches . The results stress a greater role of the type of the applied deviant stimulus compared to the experimental design . Moreover the absolute number of the deviants as well as the length of the experimental run seems to play a greater role than the experimental design . The present study promotes optimization of experimental paradigms in the context of mismatch research . In particular our findings contribute to designing auditory mismatch paradigms for application in clinical settings .

@highlight Effect of auditory oddball stimulation design on mismatch network was tested.
@highlight Event related vs. block oddball design has less influence on the network than deviants type.
@highlight Optimum mismatch paradigm elicited the strongest activity of the mismatch network.
@highlight The network activity profile differs between different deviants types.
