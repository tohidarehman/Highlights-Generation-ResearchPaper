 Spinal cord injury often results in devastating effects on function and quality of life . The majority of SCIs occur in the cervical region with restoration of arm and hand function being the highest priority by patients . Current restoration strategies rely on maximizing and optimally redistributing residual muscle functions that remain under volitional control . The polio epidemic and World Wars led to the development and refinement of tendon transfers which has long been the standard reconstructive approach for the upper extremity following SCI . However the past few decades has seen the emergence of nerve transfers from a salvage procedure for the management of peripheral nerve injuries to a powerful reconstructive tool following SCI . Nerve transfers offer distinct advantages over tendon transfers however optimal functional recovery frequently benefits from a multi modality approach and must be tailored to specific injury patterns . Extension of nerve transfers to the lower body presents additional hurdles such as limited donor nerve sources and much longer target distances .
