 Mechano growth factor is an alternatively spliced form of insulin like growth factor 1 that has shown to be neuroprotective against 6 hydroxydopamine toxicity and ischemic injury in the brain . MGF also induces neural stem cell proliferation in the hippocampus and preserves olfactory function in aging mice . Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug that induces peripheral neuropathy in 3040 of treated patients . Our studies were designed to see if MGF would protect dorsal root ganglion neurons from cisplatin induced neurotoxicity and to identify potential mechanisms that may be involved . Expression of endogenous MGF in adult DRG neurons
