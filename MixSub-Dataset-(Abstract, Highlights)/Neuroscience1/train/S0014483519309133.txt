 Scleral fibroblast activation occurs in glaucomatous and myopic eyes . Here we perform an unbiased screen to identify kinase inhibitors that reduce fibroblast activation to diverse stimuli

@highlight Scleral biomechanics and collagen ultrastructure are altered in glaucoma.
@highlight We performed a screen to identify kinase inhibitors that reduce scleral myofibroblast differentiation.
@highlight The multikinase inhibitor dasatinib reduces scleral myofibroblasts at nanomolar dosages.
