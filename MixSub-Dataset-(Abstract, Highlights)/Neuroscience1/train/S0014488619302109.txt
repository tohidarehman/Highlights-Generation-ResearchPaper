 Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system characterized by locomotor impairments cognitive deficits affective disorders and chronic pain . Females are predominately affected by MS compared to males and develop motor symptoms earlier . However key symptoms affect all patients regardless of sex . Previous studies have shown that demyelination and axonal damage play key roles in symptom development but it is unclear why sex differences exist in MS onset and effective symptom treatment is still lacking . We here used a non pertussis toxin experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model in C57BL 6 mice to explore chronic symptoms and sex differences in CNS autoimmunity . We observed that like in humans female mice developed motor disease earlier than males . Further changes in pre and post synaptic protein expression levels were observed in a sexually dimorphic manner with an overall shift towards excitatory signaling . Our data suggest that this shift towards excitatory signaling is achieved through different mechanisms in males and females . Altogether our study helps to better understand sex specific disease mechanisms to ultimately develop better diagnostic and treatment tools .

@highlight nPTX EAE reflects some aspects female and male MS motor and sensory deficits.
@highlight Behavioral deficits are seen in both female and male EAE.
@highlight Macrophage mediated innate immune response is stronger in males.
@highlight Synaptic protein expression are sexually dimorphic but favor excitatory signaling.
