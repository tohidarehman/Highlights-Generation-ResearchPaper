 Sighs have important physiological and psychological regulatory functions . These rewarding effects of a sigh potentially reinforce sighing in situations that require physiological and or psychological regulation . The present study aimed to investigate whether sighs can become learned behaviors via operant learning . In two studies we manipulated the effect of spontaneous sighs in response to dyspnea relief by either punishing a sigh by the onset of dyspnea or not punishing a sigh by continued dyspnea relief . Results show that sigh rates in response to cues predicting the punishment of sighs are 1.201.28 times lower than sigh rates in response to cues predicting no punishment of sighs . These findings suggest that sighs can become learned behaviors via operant learning contributing to both maladaptive sighing potentially leading to respiratory dysregulation and respiratory complaints and to adaptive sighing . Furthermore these findings suggest new clinical practices to increase and decrease sigh rates during breathing training .

@highlight Sighs can become learned behaviours via operant learning.
@highlight Punishment of sighs may decrease sigh rate.
@highlight Operant learning may contribute to excessive sighing and respiratory dysregulation.
