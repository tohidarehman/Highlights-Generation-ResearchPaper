 A salient stimulus can trigger a coordinated orienting response consisting of a saccade pupil and microsaccadic responses . Saliency models predict that the degree of visual conspicuity of all visual stimuli guides visual orienting . By presenting a multiple item array that included an oddball colored item randomly mixed colored items or single color items we examined the effects of saliency and priority on pupil size and microsaccade responses . Larger pupil responses were produced in the pop out compared to the mixed color or single color conditions after stimulus presentation . However the saliency modulation on microsaccades was not significant . Furthermore although goal relevancy information did not modulate pupil responses and microsaccade rate microsaccade direction was biased toward the pop out item when it was the subsequent saccadic target . Together our results demonstrate saliency modulation on pupil size and priority effects on microsaccade direction during visual pop out .

@highlight We investigated saliency and priority modulation in multiple components of the orienting response in a pop out paradigm.
@highlight Larger pupil responses were produced in the pop out condition than in other control conditions after stimulus presentation.
@highlight Microsaccade direction was biased toward the pop out item when it was the subsequent saccadic target.
@highlight The midbrain superior colliculus is coordinating these behaviors because of its central role in orienting behavior including pupil size and microsaccades.
