 Numerous small N studies of language ability in children who stutter have produced differing conclusions . We combined test and spontaneous language data from a large cohort of children who stutter and typically fluent peers gathered from independent laboratories across the US to appraise a variety of lexical measures . Standardized receptive and expressive vocabulary test data and spontaneous language samples from 99 pairs of CWS and age gender and SES matched children who do not stutter were compared . Language sample transcripts were analyzed with four measures of lexical diversity . Correlations between lexical diversity measures and expressive vocabulary scores were also calculated . On standardized tests of both receptive and expressive vocabulary there were significant differences between CWS and CWNS . In contrast on spontaneous language measures of lexical diversity CWS did not differ in their lexical diversity across analyses compared to CWNS . Three of the four lexical diversity analyses MATTR VocD and NDW were significantly correlated with each other . We were able to confirm prior findings of relative disadvantage on standardized vocabulary tests for a very large sample of well matched CWS . However spontaneous language measures of lexical diversity did not distinguish the groups . This relative weakness in CWS may emerge from task differences CWS are free to encode their own spontaneous utterances but must comply with explicit lexical prompts in standardized testing situations .

@highlight CWS did not differ from CWNS in conversational lexical diversity.
@highlight CWS performed significantly worse than CWNS on standardized vocabulary tests.
@highlight Significant correlations among NDW VocD and MATTR.
@highlight Only measure that correlated with scores on standardized expressive vocabulary was TTR50.
