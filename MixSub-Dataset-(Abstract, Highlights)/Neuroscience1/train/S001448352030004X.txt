 Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is a disease exhibits a wide range of clinical signs ranging mild peripheral retinal vascular anomalies to severe retinal detachments . Individuals with mild FEVR are frequently asymptomatic with good visual function and are often undiagnosed . However little is known about the genetic characters of the cohort . The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and genetic spectrum of in patients with asymptomatic mild FEVR . Herein sixty two patients with asymptomatic mild FEVR were studied in a case series . Comprehensive ophthalmic examinations and genetic testing were performed in all patients . Clinical examinations showed that the avascular zone was seen in all 124 eyes and was the most common abnormality observed . Increased vessel branching and straightened peripheral vessel branches were found in 122 eyes . Late phase angiographic posterior and peripheral leakage was observed in 80 eyes and V shape degeneration was noted in 36 eyes . Other manifestations including extensive anastomoses retinal ridges and extraretinal neovascularization which were detected in 30 10 and 2 eyes respectively . Overall pathogenic mutations were identified in 48.4 of individuals with asymptomatic mild FEVR . Mutations in

@highlight The clinical and genetic characteristics were analyzed.
@highlight Ten novel variants were detected.
