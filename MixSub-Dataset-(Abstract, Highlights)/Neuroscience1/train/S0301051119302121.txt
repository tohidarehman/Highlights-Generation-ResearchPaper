 It is widely known that emotionally arousing pictures are perceived more rapidly than non arousing pictures although neural underpinnings of this effect remain unclear . Using electroencephalography we presently measured neural oscillatory rhythms of the human brain in response to various emotional images from the International Affective Picture System . We found that an oscillation frequency in the alpha to beta band became higher over the parietal cortex when participants viewed emotionally arousing than non arousing pictures . This modulation of neural rhythms was also observed in a valence dimension emotionally negative pictures induced faster neural rhythm than emotionally positive pictures . Those results were consistent with previous studies reporting a speeded perception of high arousing and negative stimuli and further provided neural evidence for an adaptive function of emotion to accelerate the processing of potentially dangerous stimuli .

@highlight We analyzed oscillation frequencies of brain rhythms to various affective pictures.
@highlight Alpha to beta rhythm became faster to emotionally arousing than non arousing stimuli.
@highlight Alpha to beta rhythm became faster to emotionally negative than positive stimuli.
@highlight Our data showed frequency changes of brain rhythms by both arousal and valence.
