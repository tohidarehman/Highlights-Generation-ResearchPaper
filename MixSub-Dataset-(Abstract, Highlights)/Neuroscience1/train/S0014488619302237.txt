 Nerve graft reconstruction of gap defects may result in poor clinical outcomes particularly with long regeneration distances . Electrical stimulation of nerves may improve outcomes in such patients . A single session of ES at 20Hz for 1h significantly enhances axon regeneration in animals and human subjects after nerve crush or nerve transection and repair . The objectives of this study were to evaluate if ES enhances axon regeneration through nerve grafts and if there is added benefit of a second delayed session of ES on axon regeneration as compared to a single session only of ES . In female rats a gap defect was created in the hindlimb common peroneal nerve and immediately reconstructed with a 10mm nerve autograft or a 20mm nerve autograft . In Experiment 1 rats were randomized to 1h of CP nerve ES or sham stimulation . In Experiment 2 rats were randomized to control single ES or serial ES which consisted of an initial 1h session of either ES or sham stimulation of the CP nerve followed by a second 1h session of ES or sham stimulation of the CP nerve 4weeks later . In both experiments after a 6week period of nerve regeneration CP neurons that had regenerated axons distal to the autograft were retrograde labelled for enumeration and the CP nerve distal to the autograft was harvested for histomorphometry . In Experiment 1 rats that received CP nerve ES had statistically significantly more motor

@highlight A single 1h session of 20Hz direct nerve electrical stimulation enhances axon regeneration through nerve autografts
@highlight Direct nerve electrical stimulation increases axonal branching through nerve autografts
@highlight A second delayed 1h session of 20Hz direct nerve electrical stimulation does not further enhance axon regeneration through nerve autografts.
