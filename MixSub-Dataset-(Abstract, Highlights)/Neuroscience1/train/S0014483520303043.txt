 The purpose of this study was to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and their ligand gene are associated with susceptibility to Behcet s Disease in Chinese Han . A two phase case control study was performed in 1055 BD patients and 1829 healthy controls . A total of 27 SNPs was tested using MassARRAY iPLEX technology . Data were analyzed using a Chi square test and Fisher s exact calibration test . The Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple testing . A statistically significant higher frequency of the A allele and a lower frequency of the G allele of rs1800692 was found in BD

@highlight We designed the population based two phase case control study.
@highlight Identification of a novel SNP rs1800692 associated with BD in a Chinese Han population.
@highlight The polymorphism of TNFRSF1A might confer genetic susceptibility to BD in a Chinese Han population.
@highlight Our data provides a new insight into the role of TNF pathway in BD and may lead to novel treatments.
