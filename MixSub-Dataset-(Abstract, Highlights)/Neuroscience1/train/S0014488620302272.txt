 Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of a polyglutamine repeat in the huntingtin protein . Aberrant activation of caspase 6 and cleavage of mutant HTT generating the toxic N terminal 586 HTT fragment are important steps in the pathogenesis of HD . Similarly alterations in the insulin like growth factor 1 signaling pathway have been implicated in the disease as a result of decreased plasma IGF 1 levels in HD patients . In addition two recent studies have demonstrated therapeutic benefit of IGF 1 treatment in mouse models of HD . Since IGF 1 promotes pro survival pathways we examined the relationship between IGF 1 signaling and aberrant caspase 6 activation in HD . Using immortalized mouse striatal cells expressing wild type or mutant HTT we show that reduced levels of IGF 1 are associated with enhanced activation of caspase 6 increased cell death and mutant HTT cleavage in a cellular stress paradigm . We demonstrate that IGF 1 supplementation reverses these effects and lowers the level of the toxic 586 HTT fragment . In addition transcriptional analysis in the R6 2 HD transgenic mouse model demonstrated that the IGF 1 signaling system is dysregulated at multiple levels in several tissues including liver muscle and brain . Among these changes we found increased expression of IGF 1 binding protein 3 which may further reduce the bioavailability of IGF 1 as a consequence of increased IGF 1 binding . Our findings thus suggest that the therapeutic benefit of IGF 1 supplementation in HD may be significantly improved if other defects in the IGF 1 signaling pathway are corrected concurrently .

@highlight Caspase 6 activation mutant 586 HTT fragments and cell death can be reduced by IGF 1.
@highlight The IGF system is impaired at multiple levels in HD striatal cell and HD mouse tissues.
@highlight Increasing IGF 1 bioavailability by correcting the IGF 1 signaling system may potentiate its therapeutic benefit.
