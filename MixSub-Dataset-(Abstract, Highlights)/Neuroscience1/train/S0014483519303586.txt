 Glaucoma is a major cause of blindness and IOP reduction remains the only clinically validated therapy . In this study we analyze a novel IOP lowering strategy that uses a modest negative pressure applied locally to the periorbital region by a pair of goggles with each lens individually connected to a programmable pump . Motivated by clinical data showing an IOP reduction we used an existing validated lumped parameter model of the eye to understand the putative mechanism of this treatment . The model considers aqueous humor dynamics episcleral venous pressure and changes in ocular blood volume to describe how IOP changes with time in response to an external perturbation . We find that clinical data are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with model predictions if we include two primary mechanisms in the model first negative pressure application causes a relatively rapid increase in globe volume accompanied by increased blood volume in the eye . Second negative pressure application reduces episcleral venous pressure causing a slower adjustment of IOP due to altered aqueous humor dynamics . These results provide testable hypotheses that hopefully will lead to a fuller experimentally driven understanding of how negative periocular pressure influences IOP . Evaluating the long term effects of such treatments on glaucoma patients requires further clinical study .

@highlight A novel strategy for IOP management has been recently proposed patients wear goggles to deliver a modest negative pressure to the anterior globe and orbit.
@highlight We used a lumped parameter mathematical model to investigate possible mechanisms of IOP lowering in this treatment.
@highlight Model predictions are consistent with clinical data if we include ocular blood volume changes and reduction of episcleral venous pressure.
@highlight The long term benefit for vision preservation of goggle wear remains to be determined but these results motivate further clinical studies.
