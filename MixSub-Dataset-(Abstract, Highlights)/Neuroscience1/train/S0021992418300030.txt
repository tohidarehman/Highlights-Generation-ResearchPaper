 The objective of this study was to investigate the development of consonant inventory and accuracy in pediatric cochlear implant recipients and compare their performance to typical hearing children . One hundred and twenty nine children with CIs implanted between 638 months of age and 30 age matched children with TH participated in this study . Spontaneous speech samples were collected at 3.5 and 4.5 years chronological age and the first 100 different words spoken by each participant were transcribed . Two consonant production measures were subsequently calculated to assess consonant acquisition and mastery . The percentage of Consonants Correct was used for measuring accuracy and Consonant Diversity an inventory measure was used to identify the number of different consonants spoken by each participant . Repeated measures analyses of variance were conducted to examine the differences in consonant production scores based on presence of CI participants and chronological age at data collection . CI recipients displayed lower consonant production scores compared to TH children . Children with the most device experience performed on par with their TH peers . The two measures used in this study together appear capable of comprehensively describing the changes in consonant production skills of children . Results from this study indicate that while most CI participants display lower scores compared to TH children many of the CI users are able to produce speech sounds on par with TH children .

@highlight On average children with CIs lag behind TH children when producing consonants.
@highlight CI recipients display higher production scores with increasing device use.
@highlight Very early implanted children display production on par with TH children.
