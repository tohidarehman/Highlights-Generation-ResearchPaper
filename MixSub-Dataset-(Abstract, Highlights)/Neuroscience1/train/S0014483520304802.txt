 We are reporting for the first time the synthesis and application of an innovative nanometric system for the controlled topic release of melatonin in the retina . The ethylcellulose nanocapsules were characterized by diverse physicochemical techniques and an in vitro release study was done . A complete ex vivo and in vivo trans corneal permeation and an irritation study were carried out with the new formulations in albino rabbits to which a retinal degenerative model was induced . The results obtained demonstrate that the in vitro release of melatonin transported by nanocapsules is slower when compared to a solution of melatonin . Greater penetration of melatonin through the cornea was demonstrated by ex vivo and in vivo tests . This can be attributable to an enhanced neuroprotective effect of melatonin on retinal ganglion cells when it is included in ethylcellulose nanocapsules compared to a solution of melatonin . These outstanding findings add promising new perspectives to current knowledge about administrations using nano technological tools in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases at the ocular level .
