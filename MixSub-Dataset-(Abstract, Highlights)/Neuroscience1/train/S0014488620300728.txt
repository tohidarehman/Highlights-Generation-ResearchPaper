 Central neuropathic pain is the main symptom caused by spinal cord lesion in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis but its management is still not effective . The transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 is a pain detecting ion channel involved in neuropathic pain development . Thus the aim of our study was to evaluate the role of TRPA1 in central neuropathic nociception induced by relapsing remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model . In this model we observed the development of similar clinical conditions of RRMS in C57BL 6 female mice through RR EAE using MOG

@highlight Relapsing remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis RR EAE causes nociception.
@highlight Mechanical and cold allodynia induced by RR EAE model are reduced by pregabalin.
@highlight Nociception in this model is reduced by TRPA1 antagonists and antioxidant.
@highlight The TRPA1 agonists are increased in spinal cord tissue of induced mice.
@highlight The RR EAE model did not alter
@highlight RNA expression in spinal cord.
