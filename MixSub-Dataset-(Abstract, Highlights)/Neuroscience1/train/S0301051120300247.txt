 Heart rate variability is discussed to signal social safety . Conversely shyness might be accompanied by attenuated feelings of social safety . This study aimed to examine if shy individuals show compromised HRV in everyday life and if social interactions with close others might moderate this association . Social interactions and HRV were recorded across three consecutive days in 51 participants . HRV was lower in shy as compared to non shy individuals . When interacting with close others HRV in shy individuals increased considerably while there was no effect for non shy individuals . Exploratory analyses confirmed that effects were more reliable for face to face as compared to computer mediated interactions . Shyness may be associated with compromised social engagement as indicated by lower HRV . However shy individuals may benefit from face to face interactions with close others thus suggesting a buffering effect on cardiac function .

@highlight Shyness signals behavioral inhibition associated with lower heart rate variability.
@highlight Cardiac function in shy individuals benefits from interacting with close others.
@highlight Effects are particularly pronounced for face to face social interactions.
