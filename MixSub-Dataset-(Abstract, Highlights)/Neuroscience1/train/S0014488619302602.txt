 A synthetic monomeric peptide triple receptor agonist termed Triagonist that incorporates glucagon like peptide 1 glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon actions was previously developed to improve upon metabolic and glucose regulatory benefits of single and dual receptor agonists in rodent models of diet induced obesity and type 2 diabetes . In the current study the neurotrophic and neuroprotective actions of this Triagonist were probed in cellular and mouse models of mild traumatic brain injury a prevalent cause of neurodegeneration in both the young and elderly . Triagonist dose and time dependently elevated cyclic AMP levels in cultured human SH SY5Y neuronal cells and induced neurotrophic and neuroprotective actions mitigating oxidative stress and glutamate excitotoxicity . These actions were inhibited only by the co administration of antagonists for all three receptor types indicating the balanced co involvement of GLP 1 GIP and Gcg receptors . To evaluate physiological relevance a clinically translatable dose of Triagonist was administered subcutaneously once daily for 7days to mice following a 30g weight drop close head injury . Triagonist fully mitigated mTBI induced visual and spatial memory deficits evaluated at 7 and 30days post injury . These results establish Triagonist as a novel neurotrophic protective agent worthy of further evaluation as a TBI treatment strategy .
