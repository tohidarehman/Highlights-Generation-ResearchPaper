 Regeneration after spinal cord injury is a goal of many studies . Although the most obvious target is to recover motor function restoration of sensation can also improve the quality of life after spinal cord injury . For many patients recovery of sensation in the perineal and genital area is a high priority . Currently there is no experimental test in rodents for measuring changes in sensation in the perineal and genital area after spinal cord injury . The aim of our study was to develop a behavioural test for measuring the sensitivity of the perineal and genital area in rats . We have modified the tape removal test used routinely to test sensorimotor deficits after stroke and spinal cord injury to test the perineal area with several variations . A small piece of tape approximately 1cm

@highlight The modified tape removal test is suitable for testing the perineal area sensitivity.
@highlight Detects deficits in the sensation after spinal cord injury for at least 3weeks.
@highlight Correlates with the size of the lesion.
@highlight Suitable for testing treatments for sensory restoration in the genital region.
