 Why are some people more religious than others According to one hypothesis people who strongly seek definitive explanations for situations with incomplete information are more likely to be religious . According to a different hypothesis individuals with smaller prediction error responses to unexpected stimuli are more likely to discount evidence contradicting religious beliefs predisposing them to maintain such beliefs . We sought neurophysiological evidence for these hypotheses using the N400 event related potential which is smaller to more contextually expected stimuli reflecting prediction of probable completions for meaningful situations . We recorded ERPs from participants viewing category definitions followed by high typicality category exemplar low typicality exemplar or non exemplar words . As expected N400s were largest for NEs intermediate for LTEs and smallest for HTEs . Religiosity correlated with smaller N400 amplitude differences between HTEs and both LTEs and NEs . Less strong prediction of probable stimuli based on prior information may predispose to religiosity .

@highlight Higher need for cognitive closure is hypothesized to contribute to religiosity.
@highlight Alternatively lower prediction error activity may predispose to religiosity.
@highlight N400 event related potential response is smaller to more expected semantic stimuli.
@highlight Religiosity was linked to smaller N400 effects for more vs. less expected stimuli.
@highlight Results are consistent with a role for attenuated prediction error in religiosity.
