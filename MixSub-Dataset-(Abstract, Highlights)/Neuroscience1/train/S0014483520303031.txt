 Optic neuropathies such as glaucoma lead to retinal ganglion cell death . Transgenic mouse strains that express fluorescent proteins under the control of the Thy1 promoter have permitted single RGC imaging . Specifically in one strain of mice expressing yellow fluorescent protein fluorescence is expressed in only 0.2 of RGCs . This reduced expression allows visualization of the full dendritic arbour of YFP expressing RGCs facilitating the investigation of structural changes . As susceptibility amongst RGCs varies with morphology and subtype labelling methods should ideally non discriminately label RGCs to accurately determine the effects of experimental glaucoma . This study therefore sought to determine morphological subtypes of RGCs in the Thy1 YFP mouse strain . Retinas from Thy1 YFP mice were imaged

@highlight We identify 13 morphological clusters of retinal ganglion cells in Thy1 yellow fluorescent protein expressing mice.
@highlight Among the 13 clusters there was a wide range in features with further variation within dendritic field size.
@highlight Agreement with previous dye injection studies suggests Thy1 is expressed non discriminatingly in retinal ganglion cells.
