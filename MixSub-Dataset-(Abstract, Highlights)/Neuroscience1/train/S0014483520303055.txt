 Segmental flow in the human trabecular meshwork is a well documented phenomenon but in depth mechanistic investigations of high flow and low flow regions are restricted due to the small amount of tissue available from a single donor . To address this issue we have generated and characterized multiple paired HF and LF cell strains . Here paired HF and LF cell strains were generated from single donors . Cells were characterized for growth and proliferation as well as gene and protein expression of potential segmental region markers . Cells isolated from HF and LF regions have similar growth and proliferation rates . Gene expression data reveals vascular cell adhesion protein 1 thrombospondin 2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 are potential markers of LF cells

@highlight Here we generate novel cell strains from segmental regions of human TM tissues.
@highlight High flow and low flow cell strains have similar growth and proliferation rates.
@highlight THBS2 VCAM1 and TIMP1 are potential low flow cell markers.
@highlight Low flow cell markers may be useful for developing targeted therapeutics.
