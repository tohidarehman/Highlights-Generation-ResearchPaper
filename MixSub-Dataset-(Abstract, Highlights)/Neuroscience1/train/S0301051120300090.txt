 The feedback that we receive shapes how we learn . Previous research has demonstrated that quantitative feedback results in better performance than qualitative feedback . However the data supporting a quantitative feedback advantage are not conclusive and further little work has been done to examine the mechanistic neural differences that underlie the relative benefits of quantitative and qualitative feedback . To address these issues participants learned a simple motor task in quantitative and qualitative feedback conditions while electroencephalographic data were recorded . We found that participants were more accurate and had a larger neural response the feedback related negativity when qualitative feedback was provided . Our data suggest that qualitative feedback is more advantageous than quantitative feedback during the early stages of skill acquisition . Additionally our findings support previous work suggesting that a reinforcement learning system within the human medial frontal cortex plays a key role in motor skill acquisition .
