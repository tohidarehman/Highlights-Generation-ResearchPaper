 With the rise of biofeedback in gait training in cerebral palsy there is a need for real time measurements of gait kinematics . The Human Body Model is a recently developed model optimized for the real time computing of kinematics . This study evaluated differences between HBM and two commonly used models for clinical gait analysis the Newington Model also known as Plug in Gait and the calibrated anatomical system technique . Twenty five children with cerebral palsy participated . 3D instrumented gait analyses were performed in three laboratories across Europe using a comprehensive retroreflective marker set comprising three models HBM PiG and CAST . Gait kinematics from the three models were compared using statistical parametric mapping and RMSE values were used to quantify differences . The minimal clinically significant difference was set at 5 . Sagittal plane differences were mostly less than 5 . For frontal and transverse planes differences between all three models for almost all segment and joint angles exceeded the value of minimal clinical significance . Which model holds the most accurate information remains undecided since none of the three models represents a ground truth . Meanwhile it can be concluded that all three models are equivalent in representing sagittal plane gait kinematics in clinical gait analysis .

@highlight All three marker models show similar outcomes for sagittal plane joint kinematics.
@highlight The three marker models differ largely in frontal and transverse plane joint kinematics
@highlight HBM is accurate enough to be used in gait analysis and biofeedback training.
