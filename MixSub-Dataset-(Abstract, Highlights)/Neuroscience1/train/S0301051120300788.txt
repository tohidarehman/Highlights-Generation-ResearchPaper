 Starting from the evidence that complex tasks require lots of cognitive resources this research aims at assessing the change of attentional electrophysiological correlates during an oddball task performed while driving a simulator .

@highlight Lots of cognitive resources are employed in complex tasks such as driving.
@highlight The oddball paradigm can be employed as an index of available attentional resources.
@highlight Subjects drove a simulator during a passive auditory multi feature oddball task.
@highlight Learning to drive safely leads to larger amplitudes in early ERP components.
@highlight Traffic related sounds elicit higher P3a amplitude than other tones.
