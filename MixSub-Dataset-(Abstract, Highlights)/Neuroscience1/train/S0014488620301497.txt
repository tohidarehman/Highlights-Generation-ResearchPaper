 Early life stress is a risk factor for many psychopathologies that happen later in life . Although stress can occur in cases of child abuse studies on non accidental brain injuries in pediatric populations do not consider the possible increase in vulnerability caused by ELS . Hence we sought to determine whether ELS increases the effects of pediatric mild traumatic brain injury on cognition hippocampal inflammation and plasticity . Male rats were subjected to maternal separation for 180min per day or used as controls during the first 21 post natal days . At P21 the rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and subjected to a mild controlled cortical impact or sham injury . At P32 the rats were injected with the cell proliferation marker bromodeoxyuridine then evaluated for spatial learning and memory in a water maze and sacrificed for quantification of Ki67

@highlight Early life stress ELS increases cognitive impairments after mild pediatric TBI.
@highlight ELS increases hippocampal microglial activation after mild pediatric TBI.
@highlight ELS TBI decreases proliferation in the hippocampal neurogenic niche.
@highlight ELS TBI did not further affect the survival or differentiation of newly generated cells.
