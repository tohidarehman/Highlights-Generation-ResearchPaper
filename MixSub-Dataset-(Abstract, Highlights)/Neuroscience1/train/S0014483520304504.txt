 Due to their very poor proliferative capacity the dysfunction of corneal endothelial cells can sometimes lead to incurable eye diseases that require corneal transplantation . Although many studies have been performed to reconstruct corneal endothelial cells corneal transplantation is still considered to be the established approach . In this study we developed bio engineered Descemet stripping endothelial layers using porcine cornea and induced pluripotent stem cell derived corneal endothelial cells . First we optimized a protocol to prepare an ultra thin and decellularized Descemet stripping scaffold from porcine cornea . Our DS layers show over 90 transparency compared to the control . Porcine derived cells and xenogenic antigens disappeared whereas the collagen matrix remained in the graft . Next corneal endothelial cell lines or iCECs were seeded on the decellularized DS graft and cultured for 7 days . The drying method reduced graft rolling and edema and increased transparency during culture . The reseeded cells were evenly distributed over the graft and most of the cells survived . Although future clinical studies are warranted engineered DSE tissues using xenogenic tissues and stem cells will be useful tools for the treatment of incurable corneal diseases .

@highlight We optimized the decellularization protocols for ultra thin and transparent Descemet stripping grafts from porcine eyes.
@highlight We optimized the recellularization to produce a clear and homogeneously reseeded Descemet stripped endothelial tissue.
@highlight The stem cell derived corneal endothelial cells were evenly spread and attached on the engineered endothelial tissue.
@highlight The engineered Descemet stripping endothelial grafts using stem cells will be promising for the corneal diseases.
