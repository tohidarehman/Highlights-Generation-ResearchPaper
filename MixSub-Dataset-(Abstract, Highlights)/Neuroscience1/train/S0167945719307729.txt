 A large proportion of the mass of the body is contained within the trunk segment . Therefore small changes in the inclination of this segment have the potential to influence the direction of the ground reaction force and alter lower limb joint moments and muscle activation patterns during walking . The aim of this study was to investigate if variability in sagittal trunk inclination in healthy participants is associated with differences in lower limb biomechanics . Gait analysis data was collected on 41 healthy participants during walking . Two groups were defined based on habitual trunk flexion angle during normal walking a forward lean group

@highlight The forward lean group walk with 5 more trunk flexion than the backward lean group.
@highlight The peak hip extensor moment was 28 larger in the forward lean group.
@highlight Increased knee flexor muscle activity was associated with increased trunk flexion.
@highlight Increased gastroc quadriceps co contraction was associated with more trunk flexion.
