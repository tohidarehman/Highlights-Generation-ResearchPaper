 Recent literature stresses the importance of resilience as a trait for successful coping with lifes difficulties or stressors . However only a limited number of studies were conducted on resilience among people who stutter . These studies did not examine the association between resilience and the specific characteristics of stuttering . This study was therefore aimed to directly examine the association between resilience and measures of both the covert and overt characteristics of stuttering . Thirty adults who stutter completed the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale and the Overall Assessment of Speakers Experience of Stuttering Adults . In addition stuttering severity of all participants was quantified using the Stuttering Severity Instrument 4 . The associations between all measures were examined statistically . A strong and significant association was found between the participants scores on the CD RISC and the OASES A This study demonstrates the role of resilience in shaping the individual s experience with stuttering . Results also show that the individuals resilience levels do not necessarily predict stuttering severity per se or its overt manifestations but can predict the individuals subjective perception of his her stuttering . This highlights the importance of addressing and promoting resilience among PWS in stuttering therapy .
