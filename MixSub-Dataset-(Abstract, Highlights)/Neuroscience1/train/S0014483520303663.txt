 Pathological ocular angiogenesis commonly results in visual impairment or even blindness . Unveiling the mechanisms of pathological angiogenesis is critical to identify the regulators and develop effective targeted therapies . Here we used corneal neovascularization model to investigate the mechanism of pathological ocular angiogenesis . We show that

@highlight We used cornea as a unique system for studying the mechanism of pathological ocular angiogenesis.
@highlight FTO regulates the progression of corneal neovascularization.
@highlight FTO regulates vascular endothelial function via m
@highlight A YTHDF2 mechanism.
@highlight Targeting m
@highlight A modification is a potential therapy for pathological ocular angiogenesis.
