 In order to repair chronic nerve injuries the damaged nerve segments are resected and stumps are bridged by grafts . Autografts remain the gold standard but outcomes are typically poor even after long periods of recovery . In a recent study we described the use of a nerve lengthening device to gradually elongate the proximal stump of a transected nerve towards the distal stump enabling a tension free end to end repair . This approach showed significantly improved outcomes in comparison to autografts in repairing acutely injured nerves . In this study we compared the use of nerve lengthening end to end repair to isograft repair of chronically transected nerves in a rat model . Structural and functional regenerative outcomes following LETER were comparable to isograft based repair with no significant differences found in outcomes involving functional recovery or axon growth . These data demonstrate the feasibility of nerve lengthening as a viable graft free strategy for repairing chronically injured nerves . Not unexpectedly outcomes for chronic nerve injuries were less favorable in both groups compared to repair of acutely injured nerves . Nonetheless the findings provide insight into barriers to restoring function after chronic nerve injury through novel comprehensive characterization of a diverse set of neuromuscular outcomes . This analysis revealed key parameters predicting functional recovery .

@highlight Recovery outcomes were similar when comparing nerve repairs by graft or lengthening.
@highlight Nerve lengthening after chronic injury is viable and avoids need to harvest graft.
@highlight Chronic and acute nerve injuries have very different outcomes.
