 The aim of the present work was to explore the effect of the inclusion of nutritional warnings on consumer associations with labels of ultra processed products . The study was conducted in Uruguay at two points in time before and after the compulsory implementation of nutritional warnings . A total of 163 participants evaluated three labels of ultra processed products using a word association task . In the first evaluation performed 9months before the entry into force of nutritional warnings labels were presented without warnings . Nine months later participants evaluated the labels with warnings again . Data were analyzed using content analysis . At T1 when labels were presented without nutritional warnings responses to the word association task were related to a description of the product category expected sensory characteristics of the products brand names liking and eating occasions . However when the labels were presented with the warnings at T2 a significant increase in the frequency of mention of responses was observed within the categories
