 As tasting is a dynamic process temporal data are collected simultaneously with tasting . Indeed most newly reported studies involving consumers have been conducted using the Temporal Dominance of Sensations or Temporal Check That Apply methods . Concurrent data collection reduces potential bias such as memory but it attaches great importance to the moment at which the sensations are cited . Thus it results in measurement of durations possibly made imprecise due to heterogeneity in consumers behaviour which could affect conclusions . A new retrospective method inspired from Temporal Order of Sensations Pick 3 and Rank and the 3 phases of wine evaluation is introduced in this article . Based on a concept close to dominance the Attack Evolution Finish method allows consumers to select one descriptor each at the beginning at the middle and at the end of the tasting . The results obtained with two different panels carrying out both the AEF and TDS tasks on dark chocolates are compared . The conclusions are very similar in terms of product discrimination . The retrospective task removes the consumers heterogeneity in terms of the number of citations delays and durations and thus requires no data transformation before analyses . In view of these results rather than promoting a new method the article raises questions about the level of detail to look at in temporal sensory data .

@highlight Attack Evolution Finish allows temporal data collection from consumers without briefing.
@highlight It is limited to one dominant attribute per period but discriminates products as the TDS does.
@highlight Retrospective measurement avoids the heterogeneity inherent to concurrent measurement.
@highlight Retrospective measurement raises questions about several aspects of temporal data collection.
