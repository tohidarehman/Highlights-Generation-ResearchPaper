 Involvement in vegetable preparation is thought to be an effective strategy to increase childrens vegetable intake but the evidence from experimental studies is scarce . A between subject experiment was executed in a restaurant setting to investigate the effect of participation in vegetable preparation on 46 year old childrens vegetable intake . After a baseline evening meal intervention children participated in a vegetable preparation session together with an enthusiastic chef . Control children participated in small groups in a book reading activity . Subsequently they ate an evening meal . Follow up sessions at one month and three months were included to assess possible longer term effects . Vegetable intake was the main outcome . Secondary outcomes were vegetable choice and involvement in food related activities at home . For all four sessions childrens vegetable intake ranged between 50 and 60g in both conditions . Participation in carrot preparation did not increase childrens vegetable intake . Involvement in food related activities at home remained stable in the intervention group whereas it decreased slightly in the control group . A cluster analysis identified four distinct vegetable eating patterns over time suggesting that there are different segments of children . To conclude participating once in an out of home vegetable preparation session with an enthusiastic chef did not influence childrens intake of a familiar vegetable but it may support their general involvement in food related activities at home .

@highlight The effect of an interactive cooking session was experimentally investigated.
@highlight One vegetable preparation session did not increase childrens vegetable intake.
@highlight A small positive effect on involvement in food related activities at home was found.
@highlight Based on childrens vegetable eating patterns four different clusters were identified.
