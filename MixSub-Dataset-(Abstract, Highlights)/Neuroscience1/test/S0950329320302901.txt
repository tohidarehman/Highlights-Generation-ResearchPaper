 Satisfaction with food related life is one component of satisfaction with life . Although researchers have identified associations between satisfaction with food related life and specific food behaviours it is still not clear how consumers conceptualize this complex construct . The aims of the present study were to explore consumers conceptualization of SWFRL to compare how parents and adolescents in dual headed households perceive SWFRL and to identify aspects that would increase their SWFRL . One hundred and sixty four dual families composed of mother father and at least one adolescent child between 10 and 17years of age participated in the study . They completed a word association task with Being satisfied with my food related life and completed the sentence I would be more satisfied with my food related life if . Participants responses were aligned with the formal definition of SWFRL . References to specific foods and food characteristics were also mentioned in the word association task . No significant differences were found between parents and adolescents in the frequency of mention of responses related to the identified categories and supra categories suggesting lack of differences in their conceptualization of SWFRL . Changes in eating behaviours and individuals resources for purchasing and preparing foods were regarded as the main factors that could increase SWFRL . Differences between family members were found in some of the aspects associated with an increase in SWFRL . Results from this study can aid in the development of strategies for promoting changes in eating habits and increasing SWFRL targeted at different family members .
