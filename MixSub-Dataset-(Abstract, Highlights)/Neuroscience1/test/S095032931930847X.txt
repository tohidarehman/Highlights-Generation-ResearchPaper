 In the last decade considerable interest was given to the measurement of emotional responses to samples . Such measures were designed to go beyond liking and better understand how the actual product with or without a context could elicit positive of negative emotions that help inform overall product performance . Products can be optimised according to their emotions profile as well as their sensory profile and such information is valuable from a marketing point of view as it opens new doors for advertising claims etc . What needs further investigation is how relevant and how valid this information is . In recent studies it was argued that emotional responses are not so much driven by the samples themselves but by the context gravitating around the samples and around the assessors .
