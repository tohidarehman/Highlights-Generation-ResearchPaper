 Research on the relationship between vegetarianism and subjective well being has produced inconsistent results which may partly be due to small sample sizes and divergent operationalizations of well being . For these reasons the present study aimed to thoroughly examine this association in two large representative samples from Germany Study 1

@highlight The present study aimed to examine the association between vegetarianism and subjective well being in two large representative samples from Germany and Australia.
@highlight Results of
@highlight  tests showed that vegetarians reported slightly higher scores in negative affect Study 1 and 2 but also slightly higher levels of satisfaction with health Study 1 and 2 and life satisfaction Study 1 compared to meat eaters.
@highlight These differences between vegetarians and meat eaters in some components of SWB although significant due to the large sample sizes are small at best 
@highlight around 0.15 .
@highlight Because sex age and education were associated with diet type and SWB analyses controlling for socio demographic variables were also conducted.
@highlight Taken together the very small effects found in the
@highlight  tests for some components of SWB seem to be due to socio demographic variables meaning that the true effects of diet on SWB are non existent or negligible.
