 Consumers and policy makers interest in local foods is growing . Accordingly researchers are also increasingly paying attention to the consumption of local foods . Studies have identified preference for local foods as an emergent consumer ideology called locavorism but they have not yet addressed its antecedents or put it into a theoretical context . In addition extant research provides several insights into local food buying behaviour in developed economies however studies simultaneously conducted in developed and emerging economies are lacking . To address these research gaps this study develops a conceptual framework with proposed relationships among values beliefs and attitudes towards and intentions to purchase local foods in China and Denmark . We conducted an online survey in China and Denmark that evaluated our constructs with pre developed multiple item measures . Using structural equation modelling to test the integrated model we find that values and long term orientation are antecedents of consumer beliefs but the influences of values on consumer beliefs differ between collectivistic dominated China and individualistic dominated Denmark . Specifically collectivistic values are significantly and positively related to locavorism in both countries while individualistic values are strongly linked to locavorism only in Denmark collectivistic values have no effects on fresh start mindset for the two samples but individualistic values are significantly and positively related to a fresh start mindset in Denmark . In addition consumer beliefs are significantly and positively associated with attitudes towards and intentions to buy local foods . Local food marketers can use our findings to target their communications more effectively .
