 We examine the effectiveness of specific nudges in the choice environment to foster healthy choice and consumption among consumers with fast vs. slow life history strategies short term impulsive reward sensitive vs. long term reflective controlled fociassociated with low and high socio economic status respectively . The results of two experiments conducted in a field and an online setting show that consumers with a fast rather than slow life history strategy are more susceptible to scarcity cues boosting choice and actual consumption of healthy foods when these cues are associated with the healthy option . Conversely for slow LHS consumers the evidence suggests that scarcity cues are less influential and instead abundance cues tend to foster healthy choice . Finally in line with the LHS logic acute food craving mediates the impact of scarcity vs. abundance cues for fast but not slow strategists while perceptions of socially validated trust in the food source fulfill this role for slow but not fast strategists .

@highlight We examine when scarcity and abundance cues foster healthy consumption.
@highlight Health related scarcity cues do so for fast Life History Strategy LHS consumers.
@highlight For slow LHS consumers abundance cues foster healthy choice.
@highlight Acute food craving mediates the impact of cue type for fast strategists.
@highlight Socially validated trust fulfills this role for slow strategists.
