 Initial research indicates that the use of immersive technologies may improve the predictive validity and reliability of liking scores in consumer testing . However how immersive technologies impact Just About Right ratings is hardly known . Forty five participants took part in three tasting sessions each in a different context 1 laboratory 2 immersive context simulating a caf using audiovisual cues and 3 real caf . Each session participants tasted four tomato soups varying in salt content preceded by a warm up sample . Liking optimal levels of sensory attributes and engagement were measured . Results showed that there were no differences in liking or JAR ratings on sensory attributes of the soups across the three contexts . Nevertheless participants felt more engaged in the real caf and simulated caf than in the laboratory . These results contribute to a better understanding of how sensory differences as assessed in a laboratory or immersive context relate to sensory differences that consumers would notice when they use the products in real life .

@highlight Three contexts laboratory immersive simulated and real life were compared.
@highlight We found no differences in liking nor Just About Right scores between the contexts.
