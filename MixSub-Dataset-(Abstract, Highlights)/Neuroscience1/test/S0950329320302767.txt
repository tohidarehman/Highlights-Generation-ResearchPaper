 The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of front of pack variations on consumer attention . In a laboratory experiment using an eye tracking method the authors exposed 165 respondents to planograms containing target products displaying identical FOPs or FOPs with variations . Attention was measured by fixation duration and fixation counts and eye movements were recorded at 250Hz . The findings showed that FOP variations catch respondents attention . Visual saliency has often been defined as a physical property of an object . In the current study we show the importance of also taking into account the interaction of one stimulus with other stimuli . To our knowledge this is the first time that the effects of FOP variations have been investigated . On a managerial level the current study offers a simple and low priced solution to cut through the clutter and catch consumers attention which is the first step to a product purchase .

@highlight This study investigates the impact of front of pack variations on attention.
@highlight The perceptual saliency of stimuli critically depends on the surrounding context.
@highlight Front of pack variations increase visual saliency.
@highlight Front of pack variations might attract attention in a cluttered retail environment.
