 Berlynes theory of hedonic appreciation in experimental esthetics includes complexity as a relevant dimension in the development of preferences . However the soundness of this theory in the field of food and beverages has been challenged . The work reported here investigates the influence of perceived complexity on consumers preferences for some dairy desserts . Given the limits on sensory complexity reported in the literature we controlled for consumers level of familiarity with the products used enough products to be able to test a quadratic model evaluated sensory complexity with consumers and analyzed data after clustering . Seven gourmet dairy desserts were tested by 145 French consumers unfamiliar with this type of product in a quantitative study . Products were also sensory characterized by a panel using an adaptation of Sequential Profiling . We distinguished four groups of consumers with different perceptions of sensory complexity . For one group the influence of complexity on preference was in line with Berlynes theory . Individual differences were also underlined between groups as the self reported eating style and the level of familiarity with dairy products . Finally our results confirm the importance of a dynamic evaluation to understand sensory complexity . Indeed our findings show the influence of the number of sensations and their temporal evolution on sensory complexity . For the first time we underline the potential effect of texture and flavor sensations on perceived complexity .

@highlight Four groups of consumers with different perceptions of sensory complexity were observed.
@highlight Berlynes theory applies for a majority of consumers observed.
@highlight The eating style and the level of familiarity with dairy products influence the perception of complexity.
@highlight Complexity is influenced by the number of sensations and their temporal evolution during consumption.
