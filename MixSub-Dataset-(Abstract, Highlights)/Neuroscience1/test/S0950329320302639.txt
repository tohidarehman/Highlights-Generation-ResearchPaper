 Bitterness is classically considered undesirable in foods and beverages . Yet widespread commercial success of beers indicate bitterness is desirable for some consumers . Here we tested whether personality traits influence beer liking and intake . Under laboratory conditions beer consumers rated liking and intensity of 2 pale ales and a lager and intensity of two bitter solutions . Participants also completed intake and personality questionnaires . A liking ratio for each beer was calculated from each participants liking for that specific beer and their total liking for all beers . Participants were classified as weekly monthly or yearly pale ale consumers using intake data . Using intensity ratings personality measures and other parameters hierarchical linear regression was used to predict liking ratios and logistic regression was used to predict beer intake frequency . A significant interaction between Sensation Seeking and quinine bitterness was found for the liking ratio of a pale ale . The interaction revealed liking of the pale ale increased with Sensation Seeking but only if quinine bitterness was also high . Intake models showed increased odds of frequent pale ale intake with greater quinine bitterness and lower liking for lager beer . These data suggest liking and intake of pale ales is positively related to Sensation Seeking and bitter taste perception . Contrary to findings in other bitter foods and beverages the high bitterness found in pale ales may be desirable for some consumers .

@highlight Pale ale intake frequency is predicted by more bitterness less liking of lager beer.
@highlight Sensation seekers like bitter ales more if they also get more bitterness from quinine.
@highlight Quinine intensity may be a broader measure of taste perception than specific products.
