 The aims of the present study are to assess the impact of a pleasure oriented intervention on the nutritional quality of midafternoon snacks chosen by mother child dyads and to evaluate the evolution of the relationship between the liking and perceived healthiness of the food items offered for the snack choices . Data were collected at two laboratory sessions during which children and mothers were separately asked to choose two food items for a midafternoon snack first for themselves and then for the other dyad member . Participants also rated their liking and perceived healthiness of the 10 food items . After T1 dyads were randomly assigned to an experimental group with an in home pleasure oriented intervention to stimulate the pleasure of consuming healthy foods or to a control group . Our study shows the lack of a significant effect of the intervention on the nutritional quality of snacks chosen at T2 . However for the children in the experimental group the relationship between liking and perceived healthiness which was not significant at T1
