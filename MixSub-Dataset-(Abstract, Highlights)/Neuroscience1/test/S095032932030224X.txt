 Little research has been published on emotional responses evoked by completely new innovative food products . The objectives of the present study were 1 to assess the emotional response to new products in two different scenarios looking at the smoothie pouch or tasting the smoothie with the smoothie pouch alongside 2 to compare the information obtained when the participants use photographs or use words to express emotions . In the Pack alone scenario similar emotional spaces and sample configurations were obtained with both images and words . In the Pack and tasting scenario the richness of the emotional response increased when using images . In both scenarios the participants used a greater number of negative emotions when these were presented as images rather than as words . This could be considered an advantage as it enables some negative emotional loads to be portrayed . The present results also demonstrate that evaluating the emotional response allows effective discrimination between samples with similar overall liking scores .
