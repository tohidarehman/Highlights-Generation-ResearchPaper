 Sound can have a profound impact on our eating experience and behavior . The term sonic seasoning arising from crossmodal correspondences denotes the tendency for soundtracks with congruent taste flavor attributes to alter peoples food perception . However the implicit behavior effects of such sound taste correspondence have not yet been tested . Employing eye tracking technology the current study explored the influence of custom composed taste congruent soundtracks on visual attention to food and how this audio visual relationship differs across cultures . Seventy two participants were each exposed to three sound conditions while observing different food items in a choice paradigm . Across both cultures participants spent more time fixating on sweet food while listening to sweet music and salty food when listening to salty music while no differences were observed in the no music condition . Danish participants had regardless of sound condition longer fixation times on the food images compared to their Chinese counterparts . Participants choices in each sound condition were consistent with fixation time spent implying a clear congruency effect between music and choice behavior . Our findings provide evidence of how specifically tailored music can guide consumers visual attention to specific food items suggesting that the brain indeed integrates multiple streams of sensory information during decision making . The cross cultural aspect of our study can ultimately be valuable for understanding auditory nudging in different market segments .
