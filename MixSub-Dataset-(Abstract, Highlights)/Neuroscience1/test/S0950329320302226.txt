 Emojis were suggested for children to be used to measure food elicited emotions . The present study was aimed to explore the appropriateness of emojis to describe pre adolescents emotions elicited by foods recalled in relation to different evoked eating contexts and to explore related age and gender differences . Fifty five boys and forty one girls aged 913 participated to the study . First subjects were asked to recall by means of an open ended question the foods they had in specific eating contexts Most liked food and Most disliked food Breakfast Dinner Snack Birthday and Novel food . Then they were asked to select the emojis appropriate to describe their feelings for the context related foods by selecting from a list of 92 facial emojis . Emojis selected by more than 20 of children in at least one eating context qualified as food related . In total 46 emojis resulted as appropriate to describe emotions in different eating contexts . Pre adolescents used mainly positive emojis except for the context Most disliked food where mainly negative emojis were used . Most food related emojis resulted from Most liked food and Most disliked food but the context Birthday also added some context specific emojis . The number of selected emojis varied across evoked eating contexts eliciting different foods . Age and gender significantly affected emoji selection across and within foods elicited by varied eating contexts with girls and 911 year old subjects selecting some emojis more frequently across all contexts but also within contexts . The approach used in the present study has the potential to be used for the development of a food related emotion measurement tool for pre adolescents . Future research aimed at interpreting the meaning of facial emojis is needed and should consider age and gender differences .

@highlight Pre adolescents are able to use specific emojis to describe how they feel about recalled foods.
@highlight Emoji selection varied across foods elicited by different eating contexts.
@highlight Gender and age affect the frequency of emoji selection across eating contexts.
@highlight Younger pre adolescents aged 911 tend to select more food related emojis than older.
