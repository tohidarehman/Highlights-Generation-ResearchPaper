 Check All That Apply is a popular method used for collecting word based sensory descriptions from consumers . Free Comment as a response to open ended questions is an interesting alternative because it removes biases due to the use of a predefined list of descriptors . In the context of a home used test FC enables subjects to express themselves more naturally . The present study investigated the relevance of the use of FC at home for word based sensory description of a set of products . Two groups of 60 consumers of red wines characterised four French red wines from different terroirs performing either a CATA task or a FC task . The two sensory tasks were performed at home according to sensory modality visual olfactory and gustatory . The first objective was to investigate whether a FC protocol can be successfully conducted at home and whether it enables the characterisation and discrimination of a set of products . The second objective was to investigate whether extrinsic sensory information affects FC descriptions . The third objective was to investigate whether CATA and FC provide comparable information in the HUT context . The results show that an FC protocol is feasible at home and that the extrinsic sensory information did not affect FC descriptions . FC enabled better characterisation and discrimination of the products than CATA . A new test of product differences based on the total bootstrap procedure was proposed to compare FC and CATA .
