 Consumers physiological responses such as heart rate electrodermal responses and frontal alpha activity can enhance the understanding of the consumers food experience . This study looked at physiological responses of the autonomic nervous system as a measure for level of arousal and to responses of the central nervous system as a measure for approach withdrawal motivational tendency to accepted and non accepted solutions and drinks .

@highlight Examines physiological responses including frontal alpha activity during tasting.
@highlight Non accepted taste stimuli evoked significantly higher heart rate.
@highlight Lower latency of electrodermal response for non accepted taste stimuli.
@highlight Innovative use of physiological measures in sensory evaluation.
@highlight Stepping stone to examine differences between explicit and implicit evaluations.
