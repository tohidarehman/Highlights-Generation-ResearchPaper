 Measuring food evoked emotions dynamically during consumption can be done using explicit self report methods such as Temporal Dominance of Emotions and implicit methods such as recording facial expressions . It is not known whether or how dynamic explicit and implicit emotion measures correspond . This study investigated how explicit self reported food evoked emotions evaluated with TDE are related to implicit food evoked emotions determined from facial expressions . Fifty six participants evaluated six yogurts with granola pieces varying in size hardness and concentration using multiple bite assessment employing TDE for the first third and fifth bite of consumption . Consumers were video recorded during each bite of consumption and facial expressions were analysed using FaceReader .

@highlight Comparison between Temporal Dominance of Emotions TDE and FaceReader was performed.
@highlight Multiple bite evaluations of yogurt with granola were done.
@highlight Emotion profiles of food products did not change over the course of consumption.
@highlight Emotion profiles obtained with TDE and FaceReader show little overlap.
