 This paper reports the estimation of an Actor Partner Interdependence Model examining how meal preparation focus measured by taste context and thriftaffect actors and partners satisfaction with food related life in cohabiting couples . Questionnaires were administered to 187 different sex couples in Denmark . Both members of the couple reported their degree of agreement with a set of statements regarding meal production focus and the SWFRL scale . Using the APIM and structural equation modeling we found that the womans SWFRL was positively associated with her own focus on taste in meal production as wells as by her partners focus on taste . Womens SWFRL was also positively associated with their own focus on physical context in meal production and negatively by their partners focus on physical context . The mans SWFRL only was positively associated with his own focus on physical context and by his partners focus on thrift in meal production . These results suggest that meal preparation focus relationships between members of a couple through by both actor and partner effects can effectively contribute to increase both their satisfaction with food related life and their well being .
