 The perception that a food is healthy or low fat has been proposed as an important issue influencing eating behaviour . This study had two aims a to test the perceived health value of two popular foods in Brazil and b to investigate the impact of consuming these foods on subsequent food reward . Individual differences in adiposity and eating behaviour traits were also explored . Twenty four adults were included mean Body Mass Index 27.64.1kg m2 and mean weight 77.414.8kg . They attended the laboratory on two different occasions for Perceived high Fat and perceived Low Fat conditions . Food reward was tested by the LFPQ BR in fasted and fed states for each condition . Two popular food in Brazil were chosen to be used as test meals and were prepared in order to be similar in terms of weight calorie content and macronutrient composition it was hypothesised that Coxinha would be perceived as less healthy and higher fat content than a chicken sandwich . A paper based visual analogue scale was used to confirm this hypothesis . Anthropometric measures and eating behaviour traits scores were undertaken . Results showed that the two nutritionally matched foods differed on several indicators of perceived healthiness including perceived fat content . Post consumption there was an increased implicit wanting for high fat sweet food after the PLF meal . Exploratory analyses showed that cognitive restraint was an independent predictor for the perception of the fat content of PHF and moderated the impact of PHF on implicit wanting . These findings have implications for food marketing and the role of restrained eating on food perception and food reward .

@highlight Nutritionally matched foods differed on indicators of perceived healthiness including perceived fat content.
@highlight Implicit wanting for high fat sweet food increased after the perceived low fat meal.
@highlight Cognitive restraint was an independent predictor for the healthiness perception of the foods.
@highlight Cognitive restraint also moderated the impact of perceived fat content on subsequent food reward.
