 The use of virtual reality in sensory science studies can offer new possibilities for experimental design . For instance VR allows for the modification of visual product properties without changing the product composition . In a set of two augmented virtuality studies we investigated whether the results we obtained in real life settings were comparable to the results we obtained in a VR environment . In Study 1 we transferred an existing sensory science experiment to a VR setting . We invited 100 participants to taste two juices and a piece of cake . In the VR environment participants saw the product either in its original colour or in a modified product atypical colour . After the product tasting we asked them to identify the most dominant flavour . Participants had more difficulties identifying the flavour when the product was shown in a modified colour than when it was shown in its original colour . In Study 2 we added an RL control condition to facilitate a direct comparison between the two conditions and to verify our findings from Study 1 . A chi square test for association revealed no significant differences between the RL and VR conditions . We conclude that sensory studies can be successfully transferred to VR and obtain a generally similar pattern of results .
