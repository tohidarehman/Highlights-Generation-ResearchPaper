 In several situations it is desired to simultaneously alter the intensities of two food stimuli without affecting acceptance or causing sensory rejection . However at present it is only possible to determine sensory thresholds by varying just one stimulus at a time . The objective of this study was to propose a new methodology the Hedonic Thresholds Methodology Varying Two Stimuli HTM

@highlight We propose the Hedonic Threshold Methodology Varying Two Stimuli.
@highlight Hedonic thresholds were determined by simultaneously varying two stimuli.
@highlight A new affective threshold was proposed the favored acceptance threshold.
@highlight Adding garlic to hamburger allows for reducing sodium by 55 and improving acceptance.
