 The common practice of particle addition into semisolid foods is known to influence sensory textural properties but the resulting influence on consumer acceptability is not well understood . A systematic trial was therefore designed involving a set of nine yoghurt samples to investigate the effect of particle addition on consumer acceptability . Agar microgels were fabricated and added to yoghurt at varying levels of modulus particle size and particle concentration . The yoghurt samples were presented to consumers who rated acceptability and subsequently selected from the attributes

@highlight Yoghurt consumer acceptance is influenced by particle detection.
@highlight Particle concentration followed by modulus were key drivers of reduced acceptance of yoghurt.
@highlight Sensory detection threshold for particles in yoghurt related to size hardness and concentration.
