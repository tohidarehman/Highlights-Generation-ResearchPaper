 Previous eye tracking research has demonstrated that high calorie food cues capture visual attention particularly in individuals with overweight and weight concerns . The present experiment investigated whether this attentional bias can be influenced by context variables and changes over time . This was studied via time course analysis . Ninety women were presented with 60 picture pairs that either showed a combination of high calorie food low calorie food high calorie food non food or low calorie food non food . The women were assigned to one of three groups overweight with weight concerns normal weight with weight concerns normal weight without weight concerns . The relative number of fixations on food cues was examined across the course of the picture pair presentations for one second intervals . High calorie food was fixated more often than low calorie food and non food only during the first second of the picture pair presentation . Subsequently all participants showed the tendency to gaze on low calorie cues when these cues were combined with high calorie cues . This study revealed timing related context effects on visual food cue reactivity . While the early attentional bias to high calorie cues could not be changed by context this was possible during the later processing stage . Future studies need to examine whether the observed context effect can influence food choices and eating behavior .

@highlight Time course analysis of food cue processing via eye tracking.
@highlight High calorie food captured more early visual attention than low calorie food cues.
@highlight Visual attention shifted to low calorie food cues during a later processing stage.
@highlight Findings point to the interaction of visual context and timing for food cue processing.
