 Temporal Dominance of Sensations and Temporal Check All That Apply are the most popular methods used with consumers for the temporal sensory characterization of a set of products . However TDS and TCATA share the same limitation they rely on a predefined and necessarily short list of descriptors . Free Comment enables the sensory characterization of a set of products freed of any issue induced by the use of a list of descriptors but for practical reasons collecting FC descriptions concurrently to the product intake is nearly impossible . Attack Evolution Finish is an alternative to TDS and TCATA that replace concurrent by retrospective data collection . In AEF subjects are asked to choose in a list one descriptor for each of the so called periods Attack Evolution and Finish . The paper introduced Free Comment Attack Evolution Finish to extend FC to temporal sensory analysis where descriptor selections of AEF are replaced by FC descriptions . FC AEF has been used at home with 63 consumers having tasted five dark chocolates . The data were analysed product wise and period wise and showed that FC AEF enabled to provide temporal discrimination and characterization of the products . The product wise analyses identified in each period the descriptors of each product enabling this discrimination . The period wise analyses identified for each product the descriptors generating a temporal kinetic of its perception .
