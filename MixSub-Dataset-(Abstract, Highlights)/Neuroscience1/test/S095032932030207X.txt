 This study proposes a new model for understanding the behavior of consumers of organic products using the theory of self esteem and the congruence among images containing organic and transgenic attributes . The study employed image visualization metrics based on experiments using the eye tracking instrument . The methodological part was divided into two stages . The first was based on a Discrete Choice model obtaining the following probabilities of the consumer choosing the product 2.52 8.5 4.3 2.43 and 5.2 for an increase in self esteem for the male gender for the presence of an organic seal for the presence of a transgenic seal and for the presence of a seal that represents a large property respectively . The second stage was based on hypothesis tests as a complementary methodology to the first stage . In this context the time metrics total fixation of look on the product and time of first fixation on the product for the organic vs. transgenic seals did not differ for individuals classified as having low self esteem and in individuals of the male gender . As for women and for individuals with high self esteem these metrics were lower in the visualizations of an organic seal compared to the transgenic ones . We conclude that visual attention is influenced by the self esteem and the congruency of the image in food decision . It is suggested that other studies should delve more deeply into applying the model to other behaviors and products .
