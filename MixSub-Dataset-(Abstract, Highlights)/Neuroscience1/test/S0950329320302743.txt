 This study aimed to determine how sample temperatures affect sensory attributes of and emotional responses to tomato soup samples . Six professionally trained panelists evaluated two tomato soup products randomly served at four temperatures 25 40 55 and 70C and rated intensities of 29 attributes . Trained panelists found that five attributes changed with sample temperature of tomato soup . A total of 103 consumers also evaluated the same tomato soup products served at four temperatures using check all that apply ballots related to sensory attributes and emotional responses . The 27 emotional and 20 sensory attributes differed significantly among samples of two product types served at four temperatures . A principal component analysis showed that variation in sensory attributes could better be explained by product type rather than sample temperature while emotional response variation was attributed more to sample temperature than to product type . Sensory and emotional drivers of liking were also found to differ with sample temperature . Another study in which 66 consumers characterized sensory and emotional attributes of purified water at the four temperatures was conducted . Consumer emotional responses to water samples changed with sample temperature while sensory perception varied only minimally . In conclusion our findings provide empirical evidence that sample temperature significantly influences both emotional responses and sensory attributes and temperature effects vary with the type of food .

@highlight Panelists characterized tomato soup samples served at 25 40 55 and 70C.
@highlight A trained panel found that 5 of 29 sensory attributes changed with temperature.
@highlight Consumers emotional responses to tomato soup also changed with temperature.
@highlight Different water temperatures evoked variation in emotional responses.
@highlight Temperature induced sensory and emotional changes of foods should be considered.
