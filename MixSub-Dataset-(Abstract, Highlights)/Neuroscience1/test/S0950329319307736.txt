 Recent studies have pointed out some cross modal correspondences between flavoured beverages as well as basic taste solutions and specific geometric visual cues . Some of them associate known drink tastes to shapes of receptacles . In particular sweetness is associated with curved receptacles and bitterness with sharp angled ones . Our study aimed to test the hypothesis according to which near threshold solutions might also activate this cross modal correspondence . We used two different cup forms one curved and the other sharp angled with pure sweet and bitter solutions just above sensorial thresholds . We designed two tasks using a two alternative forced choice test . Participants had to decide which drink was sweeter Task 1 and bitterer Task 2 from the curved and sharp angled cups . Results showed the cross modal correspondence but only when participants drank first from the curved cup and second from the sharp angled cup . The effect disappeared when participants drank first from the sharp angled cup and second from the curved cup . This suggests that the correspondence emerges using sweet and bitter near threshold solutions in specific conditions . On the other hand results also showed that confidence level of responses was significantly higher in the bitter task than in the sweet task . We discuss these complex results in the light of different theoretical proposals to explain this cross modal correspondence .

@highlight Receptacle shape shows taste correspondence in sweet and bitter near threshold drinks.
@highlight Sweet associates to curved and bitter to sharp receptacles in specific comparisons.
@highlight Confidence level of responses is higher in the bitter than in the sweet comparisons.
