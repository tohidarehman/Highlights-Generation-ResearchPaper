 Targeted interventions have important under explored potential for reducing meat consumption . We hypothesized that group specific interventions targeting reduction for reducer moderate hindrance and strong hindrance meat eaters would be effective . All participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions designed for these three meat eating groups or to a control condition . Following the intervention up to 28days of food diaries were gathered to measure their consumption of animal products which were weighted according to their greenhouse gas emissions . The targeted interventions significantly outperformed the non targeted interventions . That is participants in the group matched conditions reduced their animal product consumption by 40g of CO
