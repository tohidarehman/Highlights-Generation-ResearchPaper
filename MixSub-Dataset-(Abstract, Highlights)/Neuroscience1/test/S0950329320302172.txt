 Front of Pack nutrition labels are emerging as a prominent public policy tool for promoting healthy eating . In this study we question how different FoP nutrition labels ranging from more directive to semi directive and non directive affect perceived visual attention and nutritional quality perception . The visual attention was measured by eye tracing measures and nutritional quality by healthiness perception and recommended frequency of consumption . Seventy six participants were randomly assigned in one of three experimental conditions where they were asked to give estimates on eight different chocolate snack bars . To test whether participants estimates were accurate we surveyed fifty six nutritionists and asked for their assessments of the same group of products . The results showed that Nutriscore required least visual attention in terms of dwell time number of fixations and average fixation duration followed by MTL and GDA . Participants in NS and MTL condition gave significantly higher estimates of nutritional quality compared to experts estimates . Most accurate estimates came from products with GDA label . Color coded fields required less visual attention compared to GDA without adding to visual efficiency . More directive FoP nutrition labels require less visual attention but lead to inflated estimates of products nutrition quality in the category of less healthy products . In creating public policies removing the possibility for consumers to process nutritional information and absolute estimates of products nutrition quality should not be disregarded .

@highlight Visual attention that FOP nutrition labels require does not guarantee memory coding.
@highlight Less directive labels require more visual attention.
@highlight More directive labels lead to inflated estimates of products nutrition quality.
