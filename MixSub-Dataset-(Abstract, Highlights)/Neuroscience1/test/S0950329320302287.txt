 We are surrounded by sensory food cues such as odors that may trigger conscious decisions and even lead to eating it is therefore crucial to better understand the effect of food odors on behavioral responses . Food odor exposure has been shown to enhance appetite for food products with similar properties sensory specific appetite . This suggests that based on previous encounters with foods we have learned to detect the nutritional content of foods through our sense of smell . We investigated the influence of aware exposure of macronutrient related odors on various measures of eating behavior in a cross over intervention study . Thirty two normal weight healthy and unrestrained Dutch females took part in five test sessions . On each test session they were exposed to one of five conditions and assessed on specific appetite food preferences and intake . Odor exposure increased congruent appetite after protein related odor exposure . Similarly protein related odor exposure influenced the liking for protein foods and the preference ranking for savory products . However food intake was not affected by smelling congruent food odors . Together this indicates that exposure to food odors may mostly influence appetite but does not impact subsequent food intake . Moreover appetite seems to be triggered by taste qualities rather than macronutrient information of the food as signaled by olfactory cues . Future studies should investigate the role of awareness in more detail to fully understand how odors might be used to steer people towards healthier food choices .

@highlight Effects of food odors on appetite food preferences and intake were investigated.
@highlight Protein related odors enhanced congruent appetite.
@highlight Odors did not affect macronutrient preference nor food intake.
