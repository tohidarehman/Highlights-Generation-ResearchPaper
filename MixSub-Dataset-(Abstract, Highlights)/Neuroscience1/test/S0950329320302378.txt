 Nutritional claims and health claims on food products have been introduced as interpretative aids to simplify the information provided on food labelling . However HCs have been criticised for being unappealing and an information overload on food packages . We aimed to explore whether adding a HC to the associated NC is a good strategy or information overload in a close to real non hypothetical choice experiment with real products and real payments . Consumers valuation of two NCs and HCs in breakfast biscuits is measured in two treatments . Treatment A communicates NCs and tests for the external ecological validity of the experiment while treatment B communicates both the NC and the associated HC . Results from the willingness to pay estimates showed that consumers are willing to pay premiums for the fat related HC in addition to the NC while not for the claims related to the fibre content .

@highlight Utility increases when NCs and or HCs are present on breakfast biscuits than not.
@highlight Health claims related to fibre content do not add value to the associated NC.
@highlight Health claims allied to the reduction of saturated fat add value to the related NC.
@highlight Reduction of risk claims have stronger influence than function claims.
@highlight The external validity extended findings and provided more real life results.
