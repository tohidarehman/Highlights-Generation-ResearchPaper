 Excessive salt in the diet can pose significant health risks and therefore the reduction of salt derived from food is an important issue relating to human nutrition and health . Furthermore the perception of saltiness will be different among people when considering their innate sensitivity gender age psychological traits and dietary habits . In this study 31 younger participants and 29 older participants were used as research subjects . A web based questionnaire survey was used to collect information regarding of socio demographics consumption frequency and liking for salty and pungent food as well as personality traits throughout the younger and the older participants . In addition the 6 n propylthiouracil ratings were tested by the generalized Labeled Magnitude Scale in the laboratory conditions . The rated difference from control method was used to test the sensitivity differences in the saltiness of NaCl and the pungent sensation elicited by Sichuan pepper oleoresin between the younger and older groups . The results showed that the thresholds were significantly lower in the younger group than in the older group except for the detection threshold of saltiness . Furthermore the recognition threshold of saltiness decreased in the presence of the sub threshold pungency solution while the salty intensity was enhanced in both the younger and older groups when exposed to the slightly pungent solution compared to the control . For the younger group the enhancement percentage of the salty intensity was between 9.3 and 12.5 while at the concentration of 4.05g L the salty enhancement percentage increased by 6.4 in the older group . In addition the reduction percentageof NaCl reached a level of up to 34.4 in the younger group and was 4.4 in the older group . The Partial Least Squares Regression results indicated that the percentage change in salty intensity increased when the detection threshold of saltiness the sensation seeking ratings and PROP ratings increased . On the contrary the change decreased when the age life satisfaction ratings detection threshold of pungency and consumption frequency of salty food increased . These findings not only provide new information for the flavor design of salt reduced food and dishes but also be valuable to public health as well as economic benefits .

@highlight RT of saltiness is decreased in the sub threshold pungent carrier.
@highlight The enhancement effect of slight pungency carrier on salty intensity differs among age groups.
@highlight The perception of saltiness is influenced by the individual sensitivity and psychological traits.
