 Many people implicitly believe that unhealthy foods are tastier than healthy foods even when they explicitly report that they dont . It is unclear whether this unhealthy tasty intuition is already present in childhood . Children from families with a lower socioeconomic position consume poorer diets than children from families with a higher SEP. Paradoxically populations with a lower SEP are underrepresented in research and least reached by lifestyle interventions . This study explored implicit and explicit associations between healthiness tastiness and liking of foods in primary school aged children and parents with a lower SEP .

@highlight Unique insight in food related associations in low SEP parents and children.
@highlight Results suggest implicit healthy is tasty intuition.
@highlight In depth methodological and theoretical considerations.
@highlight Difficult to reach study population with a lower socioeconomic position.
@highlight Dyads of primary school aged children and parents.
