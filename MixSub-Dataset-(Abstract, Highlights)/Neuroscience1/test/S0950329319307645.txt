 Grandparents are playing an increasingly important role in shaping the nutrition environment and eating behaviours of their grandchildren . Yet research assessing the various feeding practices of grandparents and the association between grandparents engagement in these practices and the nutritional quality of the food consumed by their grandchild is limited . Accordingly the present study examined the feeding practices of grandparents who report providing childcare to their grandchildren developed and tested a model linking the various practices of grandparent caregivers to the frequency with which their grandchildren consume healthy and unhealthy foods while in grandparental care and explored the socio demographic predictors of engagement in feeding practices . An online survey was administered to grandparents who reported providing regular care to at least one grandchild aged 314years
