 In recent years consumers emotional responses have been found to be an important complement to sensory and hedonic evaluations for the prediction of food choice and consumption behaviour . Given this trend it is essential that the influence of contextual variables on emotion are investigated . The present study contributes to the discussion with an investigation of the effect of social context on implicit emotional responses to food images . 87 participants viewed food images of varying acceptability either alone with a stranger or with a friend . Subjective liking ratings were measured using a labelled affective magnitude scale and facial muscle activity from zygomaticus major corrugator supercilii and levator labii superioris were measured with an EMG recording system . Controlling for individual differences in facial expressivity and food image acceptability using linear mixed models it was found that the presence of a co acting stranger facilitated muscle activity indicative of a disgust response increased the strength of relationship between muscle activity and subjective liking ratings and led to lower subjective liking overall . No differences in muscle activity or subjective liking were found between subjects who participated alone and with a co acting friend . This suggests that the influence of social context is complex where the relationship between the subject and the social environment can impact both hedonic and emotional evaluations of food stimuli . These findings indicate that facial EMG can be a useful dynamic and implicit measure of emotion in consumer research but it is critical to consider the social context of the testing environment .

@highlight Social context effects on food evoked facial affective responses was studied.
@highlight Participants viewed food images alone with a stranger or with a friend.
@highlight Co acting strangers facilitated muscle activity indicative of a disgust response.
@highlight The sociality of test environments should be considered when measuring emotion.
