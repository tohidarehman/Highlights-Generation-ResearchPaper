 Electronic cigarettes are a recent development in tobacco harm reduction . They are marketed as a healthier alternative to conventional cigarettes but their health impact is unknown . Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the odor perception of smokers and vapers in comparison to non smokers . For the study 181 study participants aged 18 to 46years were selected and divided into three groups including the control group as well as two investigated groups consisted of smokers and vapers . The individuals were evaluated by applying the Sniffin Sticks odor threshold discrimination and identification test . To express the overall results a composite threshold discrimination identification score was calculated . The results of the threshold test showed a significant difference between non smokers and smokers as well as smokers and vapers . The data of odor discrimination and odor identification as well as the TDI score revealed a significant difference between all three evaluated groups . Furthermore according to the Pearson test there was a significant correlation between the pack years and odor threshold and the TDI score . However the correlation between the pack years and the results of the odor discrimination and identification was not statistically significant . Besides the duration of vaping and amount of consumed liquid did not correlate with the odor threshold discrimination identification as well as the TDI score . Finally it can be stated that the non smoker group exhibited the best performance in the conducted olfactory tests closely followed by the vapers . In contrast the consumption of cigarettes had a negative impact on the olfactory perception of smokers .

@highlight Non smoker and vapers presented good performance in the conducted olfactory tests.
@highlight Smoking affects odor threshold odor discrimination and odor identification.
@highlight The pack years correlated with the odor threshold and TDI Score.
@highlight The duration of vaping did not correlate with the results of olfactory tests.
@highlight Daily consumption rates of vaping liquid did not correlate with the results of olfactory tests.
