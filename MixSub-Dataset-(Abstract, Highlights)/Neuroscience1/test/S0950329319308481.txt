 At Australian wine shows public tastings after formal judging provide an efficient condition for consumer preference testing to identify wine styles that are both liked and innovative . The aim of this study was to devise a method to conveniently obtain that information . We developed a new method relative preference mapping based on projective mapping and using relative scoring to make the task cognitively less demanding . Using wine consumers we tested the concept of a two dimensional labelled map to identify an innovative product and determined the level of difficulty in using a map scale .. The RPM method highlighted innovative wine styles those wines that were simultaneously liked and considered different to a reference . Liking results from the RPM method were similar to results from the traditional 9 point hedonic scale providing validity for the preference component of the new method . RPM conveniently and simultaneously identifies preferred and innovative wine styles in a 2D product map a unique contribution that no other scale is capable of achieving .

@highlight A valid and rapid method to identify innovative products using 2D scale.
@highlight ANOVA or GPA is applied to understand consumer preferences for wine.
@highlight Liking scores from RPM were comparable to liking scores from 9 point hedonic scale.
@highlight Relative scoring improved ease of scoring difference and liking simultaneously.
