 This study explores the role of food brand logo orientation on consumers perceptions and attitudes regarding food products through four studies . Study 1 examines the effects of food brand logo orientation on consumer perceptions of food tastiness and risk . The findings suggest that diagonal food brand logos result in higher taste and risk perception in branded food . Study 2 reveals the underlying mechanisms of this effect by introducing perceived movement as a mediator between logo orientation and food perception . The results support the inference that movement is an underlying mechanism for the effect . Study 3 examines the effects of brand logo orientation and regulatory focus on consumer attitudes regarding branded food . The results suggest that for consumers with a promotion focus a diagonal oriented logo leads to a more favorable attitude toward the food . For consumers with a prevention focus a diagonal oriented logo leads to a less favorable attitude toward the food . Study 4 establishes validity of the above findings regarding native English speakers .
