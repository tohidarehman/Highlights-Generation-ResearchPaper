 Sensory scientists have adapted several sensory methods to fit childrens cognitive abilities according to their different developmental stages . Although children have been reported to be able to use sensory methods to describe foods and beverages published applications are limited to static characterizations . In this context the objective of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of using two dynamic methods for sensory characterization with children . A video featuring colored circles was used to convey the idea of temporal perception and to familiarize children with the methods . A series of six vanilla milk desserts was used in the tasting session . A total of 102 children recruited from two Uruguayan schools participated in the study . They were randomly divided in two groups each of which used one of the methods . Results showed that TCATA and TDS allowed capturing the dynamics in the video . However TCATA provided a more detailed description of how the colored circles evolved with time than TDS . In the case of the milk desserts samples both methodologies showed similar results regarding the most relevant sensory characteristics . However children mostly used them as static methods . In the TDS task children dithered for long before selecting a new attribute which points towards difficulties in evaluating dominance . Results from the present work suggest that refinements are needed to make TCATA and TDS methods applicable with children for characterizing food stimuli .

@highlight Children were able to use TCATA and TDS to describe visual stimuli.
@highlight TCATA provided a more detailed and accurate description of the video than TDS.
@highlight Dominance may be conceptually complex for children.
@highlight Children used TCATA and TDS methods as static when applied to food stimuli.
@highlight Refinements are needed to use TCATA and TDS with children to characterize food.
