 Current lifestyles always pose increasing time pressure that can result in unhealthy diets .

While convenience foods are in fact often associated with poor nutritional values the spread of healthy convenience foods could respond to the needs of new lifestyles and promote better food choices . The study is based on a multicomponent model of the Theory of Planned Behaviour that has made it possible to verify how control factors such as cooking skills product availability budget time pressure and interest in healthy eating can affect the consumption of precooked plant based foods . The results of Structural Equation Models applied to a sample representative of the Italian population highlight the presence of a consistent group of consumers that consider plant based convenience foods as a useful means to improve their diet . For this cluster the control factors that significantly influence behaviour are market availability interest in healthy eating and time pressure . The advancements in knowledge that this research produces are translated into guidelines for producers retailers and policy makers that in synergy might encourage consumers to replace unhealthy foods with healthy ones .
