 A panellists experience with a specific sensory method can influence product differentiation during a sensory task . Projective mapping and ultra flash profiling have been used extensively to create a description of food products . The objective of this study was to identify how familiarization with a specific sensory method can influence the results . As such this study compares the results of a PM and UFP task completed by experienced panellists to the results from trained panellists nave consumers and individuals who are employed in the wine industry . All panellists evaluated eight single varietal white wines produced in Nova Scotia Canada . The experienced panellists in this study had experience with the PM task however they did not have experience or knowledge about the products being tested . There was no significant correlation between nave consumers and the experienced panellists . However there was a high similarity between the results of the experienced panellists and the trained panellists . The experts results were significantly different from the other participants . The results of this study indicate that knowledge of the sensory method effects the panellists evaluations and that experienced panellists may be a viable option to evaluate food products when time resources or samples are limited . More studies need to be done to explore the use of experienced panellists to evaluate different food products .

@highlight Different panellists experienced trained consumers and experts evaluated wine.
@highlight The experienced panellists gave similar results to that of the trained panellists.
@highlight The experts results were significantly different from the other panellists.
@highlight Experienced panellists can be used when the amount of time or samples is restricted.
