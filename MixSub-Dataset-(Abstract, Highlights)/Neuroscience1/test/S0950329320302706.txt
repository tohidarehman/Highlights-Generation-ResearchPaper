 3D printing has the potential to produce on demand food tailored to individuals needs and preferences . The present study explored 3D printed food acceptance in a real life military setting . Over a period of 4weeks soldiers consumed and evaluated multiple recovery snack bars . In week 1 participants received a benchmark bar that was created with conventional manufacturing processes . In week 2 to 4 participants received a 3D printed snack bar with increasing customisation options choice of texture in week 2 choice of texture and taste in week 3 and choice of texture taste and ingredients in week 4 . Attitudes towards 3D food printing and potential drivers of 3D printed food acceptance were assessed in weeks 1 and 4 before and after repeated consumption of the snack bars .

@highlight Repeated consumption of 3D printed food increases its acceptance by consumers.
@highlight Increasing options for food customisation seems to positively impact food liking.
@highlight 3D food product development and consumer research need to go hand in hand.
