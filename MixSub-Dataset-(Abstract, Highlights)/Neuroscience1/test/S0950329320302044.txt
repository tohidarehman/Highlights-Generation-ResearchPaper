 The aim of the study was to identify the importance of individual food product attributes as well as their relation to the purchase behaviour . To achieve this consumer preferences were decomposed in conditions of full access to information and data was compared with actual consumer behaviour related to making purchasing decisions in front of the store shelf . Based on data from 338 respondents conjoint analysis and repeated ANOVA measurements were carried out allowing to eliminate individual behavioural patterns . The results showed a dissonance between the consumers attitudes towards the attributes and their shopping behaviour . The processing method was the most important declared attribute for consumers meanwhile this information was the least searched for during purchase . At the same time shelf life period marked as the least important was the main information searched for by consumers when shopping . The results also show a clear dislike towards the use of microwaves as a preservation method while traditional thermal preservation was marked as the most positive for consumers . In addition consumers were classified into 3 heterogeneous groups identifying differences in the preferences of food attributes . The obtained results have practical value relating not only to the preferences of individual attributes but also to their various variants . The results can be a guide for companies to properly label food products . The indicated dissonance illustrates the educational gap and related insufficient motivation to get to know the product before buying it . This is extremely important in connection with technological development and new food processing methods .
