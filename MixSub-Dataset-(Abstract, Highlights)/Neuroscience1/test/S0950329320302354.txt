 The use of immersive technologies allows for the addition of contextually relevant information into the otherwise sterile laboratory experience . The addition of context has been hypothesized to yield improved sample discriminability in part due to enhanced involvement or engagement of the panelist . A questionnaire was recently developed to characterize consumer engagement during sensory and consumer testing . The main factors contributing to engagement were active involvement purposeful intent and affective value . The objective of this study was to further validate the temporal reliability of the engagement questionnaire and evaluate how subject engagement changes when assessing red wines in a traditional immersive and actual environment . After evaluating the wines in each environment participants rated their level of agreement on a 10 item questionnaire that measured overall levels of engagement with a task . Participants were less actively involved in the wine evaluation F

@highlight The EQ was validated in an immersive application testing how context influences wine liking.
@highlight Subjects were less actively involved in the evaluation over time.
@highlight Overall subjects reported similar levels of purpose and intent across all three environments.
@highlight Context might differentially impact individuals.
@highlight The EQ is a valid tool to characterize engagement in various sensory and consumer studies.
