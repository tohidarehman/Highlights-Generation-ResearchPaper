 Organically certified wild plant foods are rarely addressed in scientific or public discourses on organic food even though 30 of the worlds organically certified land is dedicated to wild plant gathering . This oversight may leave organic consumers unaware of the market relevance of wild plant foods . The aim of this study was therefore to understand organic consumers attitudes knowledge and purchasing and gathering practices with respect to wild plant foods and how sociodemographic variables and attitudes can predict knowledge and practices . A purposive sample was drawn from 22 urban and rural food markets across Austria and 497 organic consumers were interviewed using successive freelists and four point Likert scale questions on attitudes . Data were analysed using exploratory factor analysis and multiple linear regressions . Organic consumers knew a median of nine wild food plants and reported five as being gathered and one as being purchased . They valued food quality and the responsible harvest of wild food plants but assigned them a low economic relevance with some respondents sceptical about their suitability as food . Rural residence a higher share of organic consumption and a greater emphasis on responsible harvesting predicted knowledge and gathering of a larger number of plant species . These results confirm that organic consumers know gather and have positive attitudes with respect to wild plant foods although they are hardly aware about their market relevance . We argue that consumers need to be better informed about the wild origin of food ingredients and the added value of organic certification of wild plant foods .
