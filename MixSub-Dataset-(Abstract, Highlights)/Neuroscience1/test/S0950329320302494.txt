 The most common tools to understand perception of food products are hall tests surveys and observations . However these approaches require large samples to get reliable results and they are rather costly and time consuming . Furthermore they are also highly expert dependent and rely on the assumption that study participants can express their preferences consciously and explicitly . In our paper we suggest an electroencephalography based approach to evaluate perceived product similarity in a cross modal taste visual task . We tested two potential neurometrics measured from Fz electrode the amplitude of the N400 like evoked response potentials and the power of induced gamma oscillations during 400600ms period after visual stimulus presentation . Both metrics showed a strong correlation with the perceived similarity scores at both individual and group levels however N400 like amplitude had greater inter subject variability making it less suitable for practical applications . The results based on the power of induced gamma oscillations could be compared to traditional hall tests and may potentially reveal subtle differences in food perception that can not be captured in the hall tests .

@highlight EEG metrics can be used to test perceived similarity between different food products.
@highlight Induced gamma waves reflect concordance between product taste and visual appearance.
@highlight Higher N430 620 amplitude indicates a mismatch between taste and visual appearance.
@highlight EEG approaches are comparable to hall tests but can be performed on smaller samples.
