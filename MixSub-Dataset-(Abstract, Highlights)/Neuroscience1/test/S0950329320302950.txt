 Traditionally wines have been described using lexicons and trained panels . However consumers of wine have varying knowledge about wine s sensory properties and they may interpret these attributes in different manners or use different words to describe the wines . As such the objective of the study was to investigate how consumers evaluate cool climate wines produced in Nova Scotia Canada . The study involved 972 wine consumers and 76 wines . Each wine was evaluated using projective mapping and ultra flash profiling . Each PM and UFP involved seven different wines and one replicate sample . The participants were able to distinguish between the different varieties of wine and positioned the identical samples together . Overall the participants used many attributes that described the taste and aroma of the wines as well as distinguished wines based on their sweetness and bitterness . The participants used very few terms to describe the mouthfeel and appearance of the wines . Based on these results wine producers and organizations may want to focus on educating consumers on the importance of mouthfeel and appearance attributes of wines . Overall the participants in this study had a low level of objective wine knowledge but they purchased wine frequently and were interested in wine . Wine producers and organizations should create labels that use descriptors that are used by consumers but also include descriptors that educate the consumers .
