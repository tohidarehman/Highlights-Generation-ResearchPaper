 A growing body of research has demonstrated the existence of cross modal correspondences that involve tastes and sounds . For example front vowels and voiceless consonants are more matched with sweetness than back vowels and voiced consonants . However research on taste sound correspondences so far has focused mainly on the vowel position and or consonant types . The literature on onomatopoeia and phonaesthetics suggests that vowel length can be used to convey pleasure or euphony and displeasure . This paper explores the linkages between vowel length and taste attributes . Specifically this paper investigated the link between long vowel sounds and sweetness . In three studies we demonstrate that people expect words containing long vowels to connote sweeter tastes than words containing short vowels . Our findings reveal the importance of vowel length in taste sound associations and show its linkage with the taste continuum .
