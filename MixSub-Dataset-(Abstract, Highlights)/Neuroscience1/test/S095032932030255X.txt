 CATA questions are popular for sensory product characterisation tasks with consumers . Lingering uncertainty over the meaning of term citation frequency was addressed in the present research which directly compared CATA questions with intensity and applicability ratings obtained on 10cm unstructured line scales . In three studies evidence fitting with expectations based on the extant literature was obtained to confirm that citation frequency reflects intensity . The two response types were strongly linearly related meaning that it is possible to infer significant differences between samples for a given CATA term as representing differences in perceived intensity . This finding emphasises how despite the simplicity of the CATA task and the fact that individual responses are not measures of intensity the average citation frequencies do reflect perceived intensity . Therefore across a group of consumers there is no information loss relative to rating scales . A systematic difference between citation frequencies and intensity ratings was attenuation of scale use in the latter which was between 15 and 80 on a 0 to 100 scale . Attenuation was less pronounced in CATA responses which spanned approx . 5 to 85 . In the second part of the research which included six studies CATA questions were compared with applicability ratings obtained on 10cm unstructured line scales . The results were highly similar to the comparison between CATA questions and intensity scales and further confirmed that average CATA term citation frequency can be interpreted as representing consumers intensity perceptions . The attenuation in scale range was again observed . Collectively the results contribute further support for the popularity of CATA questions for sensory characterization by consumers in product testing .

@highlight Average citation frequencies of CATA terms reflect but do not directly measure intensity.
@highlight Sensory term citation frequencies reflect consumers term intensity ratings well.
@highlight Citation frequency and intensity ratings are very strongly and linearly related.
@highlight The results extend to comparison of CATA questions with applicability ratings.
