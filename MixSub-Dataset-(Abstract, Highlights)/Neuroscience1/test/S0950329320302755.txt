 The consumption of infusions is affected by many factors namely those associated with culture health and sensory properties . The main goal of this research was to explore and understand consumers perceptions and behaviours regarding consumption and preparation of herbal infusions applying a mixed methodology the evaluation of consumers behaviours assessed through direct self reported measures and indirect methods such as free word association and auto videography . A total of 489 Portuguese consumers replied to a web based questionnaire . Based on their frequency of consumption and availability 60 participants were selected for an observational study . Over 27 of the participants had at least a daily cup of herbal infusion and over 74 had it at least every week . At home participants reported the use of teapots or mugs cups to prepare their infusions and mostly chose bags . Approximately 80 of the respondents removed the bags or loose leaves after steeping mainly based on the infusion colour . The freeword association results show that daily and weekly consumers establish a stronger connection with the sensory emotional health and wellbeing dimensions of the product while less frequent consumers only consider the composition of the herbal infusion . From the observational study it was noticeable that most of the consumers take less than one minute to steep the infusions clearly below the four to ten minutes recommended for the most popular herbal infusions like lemon verbena or peppermint . These results emphasize the need for communication strategies focused on the preparation process to give consumers tools to improve their sensory experience .
