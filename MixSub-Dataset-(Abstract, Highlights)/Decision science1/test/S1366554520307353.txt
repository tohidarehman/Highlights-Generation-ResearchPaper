 In order to increase the order picking efficiency e commerce retailers have started to implement order picking systems where mobile robots carry inventory pods to pick stations . In pick stations pickers pick the products from inventory pods and put them in customer bins . In such a robotic mobile fulfillment center pickers are constantly busy with picking customer orders and avoid non value adding activities such as walking to reach storage locations . To fulfill customer orders each robot needs to complete a sequence of missions and each mission includes a set of retrieval requests . We study the operational problem of scheduling a mobile robot fulfilling a set of customer orders from a pick station . The mobile robot needs to bring each pod from a retrieval location to the pick station and return the pod to a storage location . The objective is to minimize the total travel time of the robot which can be considered as a proxy for other objectives such a shorter lead time higher throughput and less capital investment . We formulate the basic problem as an asymmetric traveling salesman problem . We then extend the model by adding general precedence constraints to give different priorities to customer orders based on their urgency . We also study a variation of the problem where the pod can be stored in multiple alternative locations . In this case we model the problem as a generalized asymmetric traveling salesman problem . An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic is developed to efficiently solve real size instances . The method outperforms the heuristics commonly used in practice .

@highlight We study the order retrieval problem in a Robotic Mobile Fulfillment System RMFS .
@highlight We schedule a mobile robot fulfilling customer orders from a single pick station.
@highlight We extend by considering multiple storage locations and precedence constraints.
@highlight We develop an efficient heuristic to solve the real size instances.
@highlight The results show that our method outperforms commonly used in practice heuristics.
