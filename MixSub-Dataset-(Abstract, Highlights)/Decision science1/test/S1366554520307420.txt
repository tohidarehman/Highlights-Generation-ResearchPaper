 This paper investigates the optimal pricing strategies of domestic imported electric vehicle manufacturer and the governments optimal decisions by developing the game theoretic models . The results show that the technology spillover caused by introducing IEVs into domestic markets can affect the profits of electric vehicle manufacturers and the governments decisions on subsidies and tariffs . In addition implementing the subsidy and tariff policies can help to improve the profit of the domestic electric vehicle manufacturer and the social welfare . Moreover when the degree of technology spillover is relatively large implementing the subsidy and tariff policies can also help to improve the consumer surplus .

@highlight We study the effect of technology spillover on the domestic market.
@highlight We obtain optimal manufacturers pricing strategies and the governments policies.
@highlight Impacts of government policies on manufacturers and social welfare are examined.
@highlight The policies can help increase the domestic electric vehicle manufacturers profit.
@highlight The implementation of the policies can improve social welfare.
