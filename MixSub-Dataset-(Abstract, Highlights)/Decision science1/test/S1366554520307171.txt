 We examine the value of blockchain for disclosing secondhand product quality in a supply chain in which contributors consign secondhand products to an online platform that resells them and competes with suppliers of new products . We find that the platform is more likely to provide a uniform pricing strategy with new products when the revenue sharing portion of the consignment contract is sufficiently low . Moreover surprisingly without blockchain the platform prefers moderately perceived and true quality secondhand products instead of extremely high or low quality . With blockchain the platform prefers selling low uniqueness and low quality secondhand products . Furthermore we find that with blockchain horizontal integration is more effective in improving the supply chains total profit . A win win win outcome can be achieved for the platform the supplier and consumers in a supply chain that sells low uniqueness products .
