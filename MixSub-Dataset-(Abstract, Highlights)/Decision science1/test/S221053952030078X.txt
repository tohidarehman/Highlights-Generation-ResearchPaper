 Ride sourcing has recently been at the centre of attention as the most disruptive mode of transport associated with the so called shared mobility era . Drivers riders the platform policymakers and the general public are considered as the main stakeholders of the system . While ride sourcing platforms have been growing so did the heightened tension between them and their drivers . That is why understanding drivers behaviour and preferences is of key importance to ride sourcing companies in managing their relationship with drivers and in retaining them in the presence of competence . Ride sourcing drivers are not only chauffeurs but fleet owners . They can make various operational and tactical decisions that directly influence other stakeholders and the transport system performance as a whole . Conducting a series of focus groups with ride sourcing drivers in the Netherlands we have studied their opinions about the system functionalities as well as their possible interactions with the platform and wishes for changes . The focus group results suggest that the main decisions of drivers which are ride acceptance relocation strategies working shift and area in which to work could be affected by many elements depending on platform strategies drivers characteristics riders attributes and exogenous factors . We find that part time and full time drivers as well as experienced and beginning drivers are characterized by distinctive behaviour . Flexibility and freedom were mentioned as the key reasons for joining the platform while an unfair reputation system unreliable navigation algorithm high competition between drivers passenger oriented platform high commission fee and misleading guidance were acknowledged as being the main system drawbacks . Based on our findings we propose a conceptual model that frames the relationship between the tactical and operational decisions of drivers and related factors .
