 Recent years the multi objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition has been researched and applied for numerous optimization problems . In this study we propose an improved version of MOEA D with problem specific heuristics named PH MOEAD to solve the hybrid flowshop scheduling lot streaming problems where the variable sub lots constraint is considered to minimize four objectives i.e . the penalty caused by the average sojourn time the energy consumption in the last stage as well as the earliness and the tardiness values . For solving this complex scheduling problem each solution is coded by a two vector based solution representation i.e . a sub lot vector and a scheduling vector . Then a novel mutation heuristic considering the permutations in the sub lots is proposed which can improve the exploitation abilities . Next a problem specific crossover heuristic is developed which considered solutions with different sub lot size and therefore can make a solution feasible and enhance the exploration abilities of the algorithm as well . Moreover several problem specific lemmas are proposed and a right shift heuristic based on them is subsequently developed which can further improve the performance of the algorithm . Lastly a population initialization mechanism is embedded that can assign a fit reference vector for each solution . Through comprehensive computational comparisons and statistical analysis the highly effective performance of the proposed algorithm is favorably compared against several presented algorithms both in solution quality and population diversity .
