 In consideration of the uncertainty of manufacturing system this paper investigates a distributed fuzzy blocking flow shop scheduling problem in which there are multiple homogeneous factories and each one is set as a flow shop with no intermediate buffers between any consecutive machines . The processing time is uncertain and represented by the fuzzy number . The objective is to minimize the fuzzy makespan among all factories . To address this problem two constructive heuristics are firstly proposed based on the problem specific knowledge and the NEH heuristic . The INEH employs the spread value of fuzzy processing time to generate the initial job sequence . The DPFNEH assigns the partial jobs to factories by reducing the total expected idle time and blocking time . Afterwards two iterated greedy methods are presented in which the proposed constructive heuristic is employed to generate the initial solution with high quality . A novel plateau exploration based local search is incorporated to enhance the quality of solutions . To keep the search vitality an improved acceptance criterion based on the fuzzy characteristic is designed to avoid falling into the local optimum . Finally a comprehensive computational experiment and comparisons with the state of the art methods in the literature are conducted based on an extended benchmark set and a new evaluation indicator . The results show that the proposed constructive heuristics and IG methods can effectively and efficiently solve the considered problem .
