 This work presents a novel parallel branch and bound algorithm to efficiently solve to optimality a set of instances of the multi objective flexible job shop scheduling problem for the first time to the very best of our knowledge . It makes use of the well known NSGA II algorithm to initialize its upper bound . The algorithm is implemented for shared memory architectures and among its main features it incorporates a grid representation of the solution space and a concurrent priority queue to store and dispatch the pending sub problems to be solved . We report the optimal Pareto front of thirteen well known instances from the literature which were unknown before . They will be very useful for the scientific community to provide more accuracy in the performance measurement of their algorithms . Indeed we carefully analyze the performance of NSGA II on these instances comparing the results against the optimal ones computed in this work . Extensive computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm using 24 cores achieves a speedup of 15.64x with an efficiency of 65.20 .
