 This paper studies the container slot allocation problem for time sensitive cargoes with consideration of dynamic pricing and port congestion under uncertain demand . Time sensitive cargoes call for express delivery . However port congestion is a non negligible factor to affect the delivery time . Hence a new freight rate function with respect to the delivery time considering port congestion is proposed for time sensitive cargoes and two different slot allocation strategies are proposed Loyal Strategy and Expansive Strategy . Accordingly we formulate the problem as a one stage container slot allocation model and a two stage container slot allocation model respectively . Both of the two models are stochastic mixed integer quadratic programming models with chance constraints due to the involvement of dynamic pricing port congestion and uncertain demand . To solve the proposed models a tailored algorithm that combines the Sample Average Approximation approach and the Reformulation Linearization Technique is developed in this paper . Finally numerical experiments are carried out to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed models and the solution algorithm .
