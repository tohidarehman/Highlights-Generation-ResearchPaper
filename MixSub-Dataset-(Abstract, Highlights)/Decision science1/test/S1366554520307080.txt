 In this paper we will study a typical problem in inland container shipping concerning the barge transportation of maritime containers between a dry port and a set of seaport terminals . The barges depart from the dry port and visit a set of sea terminals where containers need either to be dropped off or picked up . The goal is to achieve economies of scale with barges and avoid trucking as much as possible . The decision thus involves finding the best allocation of containers to barges in order to guarantee on time delivery and meet capacity restrictions . The problem will be modeled as a variant of the split vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickups and deliveries coupled with time features . The model includes parameters that can be tuned to improve barge utilization and travelling distance . A hybrid local search meta heuristic algorithm combined with a branch and cut solver will be developed to solve the model . Numerical experiments have been conducted to test the performance of the algorithm and provide solution analysis for practical insights . Real world data has been collected from a local barge operator based in the Port of Rotterdam region and will be used as input for the experiments . This will result in an in depth analysis into current planning practices . The proposed framework complements existing models in the literature and contributes to the development of a comprehensive set of decision support tools which help in the decision making process for inland terminals .
