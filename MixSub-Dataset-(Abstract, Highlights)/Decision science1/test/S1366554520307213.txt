 In China rapid development of online food delivery brings massive orders which relies heavily on deliverymen riding e bikes . In practice actual delivery routes of most orders are not the same as the system recommended routes and the road network information for some areas is outdated or incomplete . In this research we develop a deep inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to capture deliverymens preferences from historical GPS trajectories and recommend their preferred routes . Considering the characteristics of food delivery routes we employ Dijkstras algorithm instead of value iteration to determine the current policy and compute the gradient of IRL . Moreover we plan routes at the presence and absence of road network information providing accurate navigation when road network information is unknown . Numerical experiments on real delivery trajectories provided by Meituan Dianping Group show that our approach improves

@highlight We exploit the characteristics of food delivery routes.
@highlight We develop an improved inverse reinforcement learning method for route planning.
@highlight We develop an approach to conduct route recommendation in the absence of road network information.
