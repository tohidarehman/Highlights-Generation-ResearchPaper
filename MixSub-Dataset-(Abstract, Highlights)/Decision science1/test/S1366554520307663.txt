 Optimization of the green logistics location routing problem with eco packages involves solving a two echelon location routing problem and the pickup and delivery problem with time windows . The first echelon consists of large eco package transport which is modeled by a time discretized transport concentrated network flow programming in the resource sharing statespacetime network . The second echelon focuses on small eco package pickups and deliveries established by the cost minimized synchronization oriented location routing model that minimizes the total generalized cost which includes internal transportation cost value of eco packages short term benefits and environmental externalities . In addition the Gaussian mixture clustering algorithm is utilized to assign customers to their respective service providers in the pickup and delivery process and a ClarkeWright saving method based non dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is designed to optimize pickup and delivery routes and improve their cost effectiveness and degree of synchronization . Different strategy testing results are used in the service phase as input data to calculate the cost of the transport phase which is solved through a Lagrangian relaxation approach . The 3D SST network representation innovatively captures the eco package route sequence and state transition constraints over the shortest path in the pickup and delivery at any given moment of the transport phase . A large scale logistics network in Chengdu China is used to demonstrate the proposed model and algorithm and undertake sensitivity analysis considering the life cycle of green eco packages .
