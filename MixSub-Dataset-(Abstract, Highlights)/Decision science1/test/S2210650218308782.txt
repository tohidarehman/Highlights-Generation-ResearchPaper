 We introduce a family of interactive evolutionary algorithms for Multiple Objective Optimization . In the phase of preference elicitation a Decision Maker is asked to compare some pairs of solutions from the current population . Such holistic information is represented by a set of compatible instances of achievement scalarizing or quasi convex preference functions which contribute to the construction of preference cones in the objective space . These cones are systematically contracted during the evolutionary search because an incremental specification of the DM s pairwise comparisons is progressively reducing the DM s most preferred region in the objective space . An inclusion of evolved solutions in this region is used along with the dominance relation to revise an elitism principle of the employed optimization algorithm . In this way the evolutionary search is focused on a subset of Pareto optimal solutions that are particularly interesting to the DM . We investigate moreover how the convergence is influenced by the use of some pre defined and newly proposed self adjusting interaction patterns . We also propose a new way for visualizing the progress of an evolutionary search . It supports understanding the differences between effects of a selection pressure imposed by various optimization algorithms .
