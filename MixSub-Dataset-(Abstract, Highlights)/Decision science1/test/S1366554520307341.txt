 We study request acceptance dynamics in same day delivery systems by formulating the Dynamic Dispatch Waves Problem with Immediate Acceptance which models integrated management and distribution for dynamically arriving customer requests . We consider an e commerce platform that attempts to serve most customers with same day delivery service . When a shopper attempts to place an order a decision is made immediately to offer same day delivery service or to deny service . Accepted requests are not available for immediate dispatch they must be processed before they are loaded for delivery . Vehicle routes are updated dynamically and serve each accepted delivery request no later than the end of the service day . In this work we limit the study to the case of a single vehicle serving requests potentially using multiple trips from the distribution center . The objective is to make request acceptance and distribution decisions that minimize the expected sum of vehicle travel costs and penalties for service denials . We develop a framework for dynamic decision policies over continuous time for such systems where a feasible vehicle dispatch plan is redesigned and used to guide decisions over time . We design methods for determining an initial optimal
