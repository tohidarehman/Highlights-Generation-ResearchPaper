 This study addresses an interesting tugboat scheduling problem considering uncertainty in both container ship arrival and tugging process times for large container ports . The uncertain ship arrival and tugging process times are formulated as a finite set of discrete scenarios that can be generated from historical port traffic data . We deal with the uncertainty by integrating proactive and reactive scheduling strategies such that this study is distinct from most existing studies in the literature . The proactive scheduling strategy considers the expected degree of variability and uncertainty during the execution of a tugboat fleet schedule while the reactive scheduling strategy properly adjusts the initial schedule to cope with unexpected scenarios with minimum recovery cost . A mixed integer linear programming model for the proposed tugboat scheduling problem is established . For a large scale problem an ad hoc algorithm is designed to generate tugging chains such that the large scale problem can be tackled effectively . The extensive numerical experiments are finally carried out to demonstrate the practical significances of the models and algorithms developed by this study .

@highlight We consider the tugboat scheduling problem under ship arrival and tugging process time uncertainty.
@highlight The uncertain ship arrival and tugging process times are modeled by a finite set of discrete scenarios.
@highlight The proactive scheduling strategy and reactive scheduling strategy are both considered in the problem.
@highlight A MILP model is built to minimize the total weighted service time and the expected value of recovery cost.
@highlight An ad hoc algorithm is designed to generate tugging chains such that the large scale problems can be tackled effectively.
