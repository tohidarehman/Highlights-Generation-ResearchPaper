 In the cruise operations management literature scant knowledge is available regarding the choice of ports of call . Hence insight into cruise lines decisions to visit a given port through a two step decision making process may provide an effective means to inform cruise operations management . Based on a novel perspective on cruise online ratings and reviews this research applied a Heckman double hurdle approach to 505 global cruise ports to analyze the patterns of cruise visits . Results revealed that the number of cruise visits were significantly related to cruise port ratings excursion ratings and the number of reviews . Next Sobel Goodman mediation tests showed that online platforms had substantial mediating effects on cruise port ratings . Further robustness checks based on two sub samples demonstrated that the empirical results of the double hurdle models were reliable . This paper provides the first empirical attempt to demonstrate the nexus between cruise lines and ports in an online platform context . The empirical findings provide implications for source credibility theory and cruise operations management . They are also believed to be useful for researchers in operations management studies business practitioners in international cruising policymakers and port authorities .
