 This paper presents a novel healthcare waste location routing problem by concentrating on a new perspective in healthcare logistics networks . In this problem there are healthcare treatment and disposal centers . Locations of healthcare centers are known however it is required to select appropriate locations for treatment recycling and disposal centers . Healthcare wastes are divided into infectious and non infectious wastes . Since a great volume of healthcare wastes are infectious the emission of contamination can have obnoxious impacts on the environment . The proposed problem considers a stochastic essence for the emission of contamination which depends on the transferring times . In this respect transferring times between healthcare and treatment centers have been considered as normal random variables . As transferring time increases it is more likely for the contamination to spread . Having visited a treatment center infectious wastes are sterilized and they will no longer be harmful to the environment . This research develops a bi objective mixed integer mathematical formulation to tackle this problem . The objectives of this model are minimization of total costs and emission of contamination simultaneously . Complexity of the proposed problem led the researchers to another contribution . This study also develops a Multi Objective Water Flow like Algorithm which is a
