 The Taiwan High Speed Rail has transformed transportation in western Taiwan . Increasing costs of construction and operation have rendered THSR tickets much more expensive than other forms of transportation . The effects of ticket price benefits on the relevant transportation agency and the distribution of passenger flow have been analyzed to improve the profitability of the THSR . However relying on analysis of passenger flow information alone may be insufficient to the adjustment of ticket fares . An evolutionary optimization model for maximizing the profits of the transportation agency that considers conflicts between executive decision making and passenger flow was developed herein . To resolve these conflicts the bi level planning approach was applied to consider both upper level and lower level planning and reflect passenger behavior and transportation profit management . Therefore developing business plans and strategies that maximize cost efficiency while optimally balancing passenger satisfaction and profitability could improve THSR performance . Results indicated that optimal fare rates should be divided into three groups 3.1 3.0 and 4.2 NTD person km for long medium and short distances respectively . This tool could be used to model and validate THSR fare adjustments and as a reference for authorities when making policy recommendations .

@highlight This study presents the pricing of HSR tickets using a bi level planning model.
@highlight The objective is to maximize profits by considering passengers satisfaction and agency s efficiency.
@highlight The model analyzes and adjusts the ticket fare based on the changes of traveling distance.
@highlight The ideal and actual THSR ticket rates are compared to provide a reference.
@highlight The model can be a supportive tool of the authority s decision making process.
