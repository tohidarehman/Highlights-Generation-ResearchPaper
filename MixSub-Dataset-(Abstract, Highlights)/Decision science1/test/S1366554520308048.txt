 This article proposes an innovative path finding algorithm to achieve on time arrival reliability on road networks under uncertainty with stochastic delays at signalized intersections . Typically we extend conventional path finding algorithms to signalized traffic networks of 1 random and correlated running travel time along links 2 delays at intersections and traffic signals and their correlations as well as 3 correlations between RTTL and DITS . We first discuss the theoretical foundations concerning the existence of the optimal solutions and analyze the efficient convergence speed of our proposed algorithm . Lastly we conduct numerical studies to demonstrate efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm .
