 In this paper we study a Multi Attribute Inventory Routing Problem . A mathematical formulation and exact solution algorithms are introduced for this problem . More precisely we extend the Multi Depot Inventory Routing Problem in order to consider the multi product case with a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles and explicit constraints for the route duration . The MAIRP is an NP hard problem more complex than the classical Inventory Routing Problem . Moreover it captures many features that can be found in real applications of a vendor managed inventory strategy . We introduce a hybrid exact algorithm to solve it in which several Mixed Integer Programming models are solved to explore the neighborhoods of a Variable Neighborhood Search scheme applied to the MAIRP . We design several neighborhoods that are based on the features of the problem . The impact of this hybridization is a faster convergence of the model and an accelerated resolution process with respect to a branch and cut algorithm applied to the regular MIP formulation . Extensive computational results on new and existing instances from the literature on two benchmark problems and a real data set confirm the high efficiency of our algorithm .

@highlight The algorithm is tested on four classes of both classical and real data instances.
