 We propose a consistent information flow to integrate Interval Travel Times into a city logistics vehicle routing problem with satellites . The consistent information flow encompasses the derivation of ITT the usage of ITT in robust shortest path computation and the integration of ITT into robust vehicle routing . Based on the results of the information flow robust meeting times of first tier and second tier vehicles are created . We evaluate the approach with large real world traffic data sets . We observe that the integration of ITT leads to first tier routes that are reasonably efficient and robust .
