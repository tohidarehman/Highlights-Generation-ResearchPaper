 Crowd shipping is an innovative logistics service that occasional and professional couriers sign up for via an online platform to deliver packages upon requests by senders . Currently the demand and supply of CS is not yet well understood largely due to the limited real world data . This study aims to first fill this gap by analyzing the real world CS data from the city of Atlanta GA between April 2015 and August 2018 . We first present an overview of the real world CS data in three aspects the CS pricing scheme the CS spatial and temporal delivery patterns and comparison of preferences between the senders requests and the couriers bids . The analysis finds that the CS service has a clear price advantage over FedEx in the same day and express service as well as in the large extra large and huge size package delivery . The data analysis also reveals considerable discrepancies between senders and couriers preferences . We then compare two classes of the state of the art Deep Learning methods in their ability to predict short term CS delivery trip production . One class captures only the temporal features namely the Long Short term Memory Neural Network the Bidirectional Long Short term Memory Neural Network and the Gated Recurrent Unit . The other class considers both spatial and temporal features namely Convolutional Neural Network

@highlight This study analyzes the CS demand and supply characteristics with real world data.
@highlight CS has a price advantage over FedEx in same day or express service.
@highlight CS is competitive in larger package delivery of short to medium distance.
@highlight There is mismatch in delivery preference between the senders and the couriers.
@highlight This study applies spatio temporal Deep Learning methods in CS demand prediction.
@highlight ConvLSTM captures the convolutional nature of the spatial and temporal CS demand.
