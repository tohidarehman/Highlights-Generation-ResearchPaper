 The plant disease classification based on using digital images is very challenging . In the last decade machine learning techniques and plant images classification tools such as deep learning can be used for recognizing detecting and diagnosing plant diseases . Currently deep learning technology has been used for plant disease detection and classification . In this paper an ensemble model of two pre trained convolutional neural networks namely VGG16 and VGG19 have been developed for the task plant disease diagnosis by classifying the leaves images of healthy and unhealthy . In this context CNNs are used due to its capability of overcoming the technical problems which are associated with the classification problem of plant diseases . However CNNs suffer from a great variety of hyperparameters with specific architectures which is considered as a challenge to identify manually the optimal hyperparameters . Therefore orthogonal learning particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized in this paper to optimize a number of these hyperparameters by finding optimal values for these hyperparameters rather than using traditional methods such as the manual trial and error method . In this paper to prevent CNNs from falling into the local minimum and to train efficiently an exponentially decaying learning rate schema is used . In this paper the problem of the imbalanced used dataset has been solved by using random minority oversampling and random majority undersampling methods and some restrictions in terms of both the number and diversity of samples have been overcome . The obtained results of this work show that the accuracy of the proposed model is very competitive . The experimental results are compared with the performance of other pre trained CNN models namely InceptionV3 and Xception whose hyperparameters were selected using a non evolutionary method . The comparison results demonstrated that the proposed diagnostic approach has achieved higher performance than the other models .
