 Multi modal transportation takes advantage of multiple transport modes and can be an effective way to ease the negative environmental effects of freight transportation . This paper addresses a multi modal distribution network design problem with the aim of balancing the trade off between economic and environmental benefits . The distribution network that we consider includes both transportation with trucks and ships . We propose a new mixed integer programming model which decides the optimal design of the system i.e . how many ships of each type to use their corresponding routes and sailing speeds . It also suggests an optimal cargo flow through the maritime and road based network . We show how the MIP model can be used to provide decision support through a case study from the distribution of automobiles in India which has a vast coastline that can be used for maritime transportation . Environmental emissions from automobile transportation in India have been rapidly increasing in recent years with the fast economic development and it has become a major contributor to regional air pollution and road congestion . One possible way to ease these negative environmental consequences is to consider a modal shift where some of the automobile transportation from the production facilities located close to the coastline is replaced by roll on roll off ships . Our study shows that multi modal distribution is both environmentally friendly and economically beneficial especially if more industrial players can collaborate to create economies of scale .
