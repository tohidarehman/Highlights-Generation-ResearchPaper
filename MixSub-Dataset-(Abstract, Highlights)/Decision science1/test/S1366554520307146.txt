 This paper examines CSR in fashion supply chains by applying a multi methodological approach . We first investigate the CSR performance and consumer expectation towards luxury fast fashion and functional brands through a case study and semi structure interviews . Then by building a stylized analytical model we uncover that it is optimal for the higher priced fast fashion and functional brands to commit a high CSR commitment with a low advertisement level while the luxury brands should act oppositely . To entice the luxury fashion brand to create a CSR improving situation we propose the use of disruptive technologies such as blockchain to help .
