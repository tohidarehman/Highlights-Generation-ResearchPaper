 The energy efficient distributed job shop scheduling problem is studied in this paper with the criteria of minimizing both makespan and energy consumption . A mathematical model is presented and an effective modified multi objective evolutionary algorithm with decomposition is proposed . First the encoding scheme and decoding scheme are designed based on the characteristics of the EEDJSP . Second several initialization rules are fused together to produce a diverse population with certain diversity . Third a collaborative search is proposed to exchange the information between individuals for exploring good solutions . Fourth three problem specific local intensification heuristics are designed . Moreover an adaptive selection strategy is proposed to adjust the utilization of local search operators dynamically . Besides an energy adjustment strategy is designed for further improvement . We carry out extensive numerical tests with the benchmarking instances . The effectiveness of local intensification as well as energy adjustment strategy is verified via the statistical comparisons . It also shows that the MMOEA D outperforms other algorithms .
