 Expected to operate in the imminent future air taxi service is an aerial on demand transport for a single passenger or a small group of riders which seeks to transform the method of everyday commute . This uncharted territory in the emerging transportation world is anticipated to enable consumers bypass traffic congestion in urban road networks . By adopting an electric vertical takeoff and landing concept air taxis could be operational from skyports retrofitted on building rooftops thus gaining advantage from an implementation standpoint . Motivated by the potential impact of ATS this study provides a review of air taxi systems and associated operations . We first discuss the current developments in the ATS . Next we anticipate potential future challenges of ATS from an operations management perspective and review the existing literature that could be leveraged to tackle these problems . Finally we detail future research opportunities in the air taxi domain .
