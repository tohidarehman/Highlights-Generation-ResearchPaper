 Airline ancillary services play an increasingly important role in the airline industry . Ancillary revenues account for more than 40 of the total revenue for airlines like Spirit VivaAerobus and Frontier . However current academic research has addressed this practical topic on only a limited scale . Almost no research has focused on the ancillary services of the Chinese aviation market . It is likely that in the future China will outdistance the United States as the world s largest aviation market indicating the importance of the Chinese market . Accordingly this article focuses on one of the airline ancillary services namely paying extra to choose economy class seats . A mixed methods approach was used to explore factors influencing Chinese air consumers willingness to pay for economy class seat selection . Our findings show that both intrinsic cues and extrinsic cues have a significant impact on Chinese airline consumers willingness to pay for ECSS . The results of this research could contribute to enhancing the current ancillary services literature uncovering insights about Chinese airline consumers and providing implications to the marketing of airline ancillary services .
