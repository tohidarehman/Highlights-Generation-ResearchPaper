 Drivers can make significant impacts on transportation systems . They can leave important information due to their social behaviors . But the role of drivers has been overlooked yet . In this paper for the first time drivers collaboration network is introduced . The network is considered in a heterogenous form because of existence multiple relationships between drivers in the real world situation . Since drivers do not belong to only one community the overlapping of communities is considered and a new overlapping community detection algorithm is developed to discover the hidden structure of the network . Also we present a new overlapping score to improve the community detection algorithm using the adjacencies among non memeber neighbor nodes and communities . Solving the algorithm will lead to discovering dense communities of drivers that have meaningful relationships with each other . This will result in a better understanding of the transportation network and also improving the overall performance of the system . A comparison of the developed algorithm with the others demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm . To evaluate the applicability of the algorithm a real drivers collaboration network is presented and the developed algorithm is applied to derive insights .

@highlight We introduce drivers collaboration networks in two monoplex and multiplex perspectives.
@highlight We develop a new overlapping community detection algorithm for two layered social networks.
@highlight A novel overlapping score is proposed to evaluate the overlapping communities.
@highlight We validate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
@highlight The developed algorithm applies to Iran freight drivers collaboration network.
