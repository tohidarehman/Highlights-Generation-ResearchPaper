 Blockchain is a technology with unique combination of features such as decentralized structure distributed notes and storage mechanism consensus algorithm smart contracting and asymmetric encryption to ensure network security transparency and visibility . Blockchain has immense potential to transform supply chain functions from SC provenance business process reengineering to security enhancement . More and more studies exploring the use of blockchain in SCs have appeared in recent years . In this paper we consider a total of 178 articles and examine all the relevant research done in the field associated with the use of blockchain integration in SC operations . We highlight the corresponding opportunities possible societal impacts current state of the art technologies along with major trends and challenges . We examine several industrial sectors such as shipping manufacturing automotive aviation finance technology energy healthcare agriculture and food e commerce and education among others that can be successfully revamped with blockchain based technologies through enhanced visibility and business process management . A future research agenda is established which lays the solid foundation for further studies on this important emerging research area .
