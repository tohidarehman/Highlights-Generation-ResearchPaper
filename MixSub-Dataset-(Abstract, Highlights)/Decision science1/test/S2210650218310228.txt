 The use of unmanned airborne agents as relays for ground agents to ensure ground network survivability is gaining traction at both theoretical and practical levels in research that targets contexts like search and rescue in disaster areas farming with autonomous equipment surveillance internet of things military operations autonomous transportation systems and many others . This comes with some challenges which include the dynamics of the ground unit behaviors the scalability of the system the mobility model of the airborne agents and the integration between ground and air agents . This paper contributes to addressing the above challenges by using a bio inspired approach that combines swarm intelligence and evolutionary computation for providing ground network survivability for a wide range of ground movement patterns . The proposed approach models ground and airborne agents as a dual air ground swarm that uses boids like rules and optimizes the movement of the airborne agents using an on line real time genetic algorithm with shadow simulation and prediction . Arguably the proposed approach provides system scalability both size wise and context wise while also offering a certain amount of integration between the ground and air swarms of agents . The results of the investigation demonstrate that the methods employed endow the airborne agents with the needed capability to ensure network survivability for complex ground activity including resilience to changes in the ground movement pattern and good responsiveness to activities that have no pattern at all such as uniform random walks .
