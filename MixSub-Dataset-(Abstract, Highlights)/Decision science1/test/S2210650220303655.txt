 In the present research a new variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem the Environmental Prize Collecting Vehicle Routing Problem is introduced . The E PCVRP is a selective routing problem that focuses on the maximization of the aggregated prize values collected from the visited nodes while minimizing the fixed and variable cost of the formed routes . In terms of variable cost the CO2 emissions of the vehicles performing the routes are considered as a load distance function . The presented solution approach is based on the Firefly Algorithm . The FA is an optimization algorithm designed for the solution of continuous problems while the proposed E PCVRP requires a discrete solution approach . Addressing the above discrepancy the Firefly Algorithm based on Coordinates is introduced which incorporates the proposed Coordinates Related encoding decoding process in the original FA scheme . The CR is a novel process that allows for algorithms designed for continuous optimization to by employed in the solution of discrete problems such as the VRP . Specifically the CR utilizes auxiliary vectors for solution representation containing the Cartesian coordinates of each node that allows for the original movement equation of the FA to be applied directly . The effectiveness of the FAC algorithm is showed over computational experiments and statistical analysis in comparison to the performance of other bio inspired algorithms and a mathematical solver .
