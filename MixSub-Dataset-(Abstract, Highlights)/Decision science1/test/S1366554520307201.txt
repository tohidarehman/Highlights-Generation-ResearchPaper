 This paper models a single allocation multi commodity hub and spoke network problem through a bi objective mathematical model considering the congestion in both hubs and connection links . A novel aggregation model is developed based on a general GI G c queuing system to evaluate the congestion of the flow of the multiple products in the hubs . The proposed model is then solved using a novel learning based metaheuristic based on NSGA II
