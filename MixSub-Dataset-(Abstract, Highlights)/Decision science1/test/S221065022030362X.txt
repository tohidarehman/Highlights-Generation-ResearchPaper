 Up to now different genetic algorithm based error correcting output codes algorithms have been proposed by setting accuracy as the optimization objective . However it was demonstrated that diversity among learners is of great significance to a robust ensemble . In this paper we propose a multi objective GA with setting accuracy and diversity as two objectives . To further promote diversity in an ensemble a new individual structure is designed to accommodate heterogeneous dichotomizers . Three multi objective ranking strategies are deployed to balance two objectives respectively . A novel genetic operator is designed to produce ECOC compatible offspring in the evolutionary process and a local improvement algorithm is designed to promote individuals fitness values . To verify the performance of our GA a single objective ranking strategy and the design of homogeneous learner based GA are also adopted . Ten widely used ECOC algorithms and three famous ensemble algorithms are deployed for performance comparisons based on a set of the UCI data and microarray data sets . Results show that compared with other algorithms our GA obtains higher performance in most cases due to the trade off between performance and diversity . Besides the accommodation of heterogeneous dichotomizers in an ensemble provides higher generalization ability compared with homogeneous ensembles .
