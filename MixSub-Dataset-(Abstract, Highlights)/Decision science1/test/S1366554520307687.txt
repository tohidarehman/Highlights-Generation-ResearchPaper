 The tradable credit scheme as a revenue neutral management measure has received much attention in the field of traffic management in recent years . This paper investigates the management performance of the TCS on high occupancy vehicle lanes with the approach of equilibrium analysis . The analysis is based on a commuting scenario in which commuters use a multi lane highway with HOV lanes . We developed a basic system in which commuters have two alternative travel modes driving alone in general purpose lanes or carpooling in HOV lanes . Under this assumption the HOV lane management with TCSs is formulated as a mathematical programming problem . We analyze the effects with respect to feasible TCSs effective TCSs and optimal TCSs respectively . We extend the basic system by considering regular carpoolers with the scenario of HOVs choosing GP lanes . Under this situation the HOV lane management with TCSs is formulated as a variational inequality problem . We further analyze the management effects of different TCSs . Numerical examples demonstrate system indicators with several typical states the impact of key parameters on TCS management performance and the feature of the extended system in typical scenarios . Results show that the optimal TCS is achievable in the basic system by limiting the traffic flow of GP lanes . However the optimal TCS may not exist in the extended system considering regular carpoolers and a sufficient condition is proposed to guarantee its existence .
