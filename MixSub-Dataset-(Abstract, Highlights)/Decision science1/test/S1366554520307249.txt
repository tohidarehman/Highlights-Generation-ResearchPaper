 Dynamic macroeconomic conditions and non binding truckload freight contracts enable both shippers and carriers to behave opportunistically . We present an empirical analysis of carrier reciprocity in the US truckload transportation sector to demonstrate whether consistent performance and fair pricing by shippers when markets are in their favor result in maintained primary carrier tender acceptance when markets turn . The results suggest carriers have short memories they do not remember shippers previous period pricing tendering behavior or performance when making freight acceptance decisions . However carriers appear to be myopic and respond to shippers current market period behaviors ostensibly without regard to shippers previous behaviors .

@highlight Industry data shows shipper and motor carrier relationships change as markets cycle.
@highlight Carriers appear to be myopic respond to shippers current market behaviors.
@highlight Shippers must prioritize certain tight market behaviors for high tender acceptance.
@highlight Shippers should price competitively to current market rates and tender consistently.
@highlight Destination facilities should reduce dwell time to receive higher tender acceptance.
