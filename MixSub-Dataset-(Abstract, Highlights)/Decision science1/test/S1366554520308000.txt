 Internet shortens the distance between consumers and firms in a supply chain and facilitates firms to consider consumers behaviors when making business decisions . In this paper we study the decoy effect on firms product proposition decisions under various circumstances . The decoy effect is the phenomenon whereby consumers change their preference between two options when presented with a third option that is less desirable . We examine the product propositions in a competitive supply chain adopting decoy effect from the perspectives of a high end firm or a low end firm respectively . We also investigate impacts of consumers behavioral factors on the decoy effect such as rationality social influence and loss aversion preference . Further we test whether decoys can be as effective online as they are offline and effective in a monopolistic supply chain as well . A multi agent system is built to conduct simulations .
