 Quick response systems which aim to respond promptly to market changes by postponing inventory decisions with a reduced lead time are critical to support fast fashion operations . Under QR systems in the digital data analytics era the fashion brand can acquire market information using digital technologies to improve demand forecasting . This enhances the respective ordering and transportation mode selection decisions . It is known that to implement QR systems requires the availability of the right logistics option and the needed logistics capacity in the future . An Internet based elastic logistics platform hence emerges to help . In this paper in the main model we analytically derive via stochastic dynamic programming the optimal transportation option selection and inventory ordering policy with the ELP . We further examine the value of ELP and identify the situations in which it is especially beneficial to adopt it . Robustness checking is conducted which proves that the theoretical findings derived in the main model are solid . Specific managerial action plans and managerial implications are developed .
