 Container ports play an important role in global logistics and supply chains by providing container handling services for container ships . In a port container ships usually need the assistance of tugboats in order to undergo berthing shifting and unberthing movements . Effective scheduling of the tugboats for serving the ships is thus of great importance for ensuring safe and efficient container ship movements in a port . However research on tugboat scheduling is scarce in the literature . We contribute to the literature by studying a real life tugboat scheduling problem . We formulate the Tug SP using a mixed integer linear programming model taking into consideration various practical constraints . In view of the specific problem structure we further develop six families of valid inequalities to strengthen the MILP model . To efficiently solve the Tug SP we develop a tailored branch and cut algorithm by incorporating these valid inequalities into a standard branch and bound solution framework . We evaluate the computational performance of the proposed branch and cut algorithm using a set of test instances generated from real life ship traffic data collected from the Port of Singapore . The computational results validate the effectiveness of the proposed valid inequalities and show that the branch and cut algorithm can optimally solve instances of realistic sizes with a reasonable amount of computation time .
