 Pricing and package size decisions are critical to the success or failure of reward based crowdfunding projects the importance of these decisions has been overlooked in the existing crowdfunding literature . In this paper we develop a two period model to study pricing and package size decisions in a crowdfunding game where a creator sells perishable products to sequentially arriving consumers . Consumers are heterogeneous in their usages and valuations and they get utility by consuming products rather than owning them . The creator can choose to provide a product menu that contains two types of packages or only provide one type of package to match the consumers usages and valuations . The project would succeed only when the project target is achieved during the funding period otherwise the transaction would be canceled . We show that consumers usages and valuations have a large impact on deciding the creators optimal pricing strategy and project target regardless of whether the exogenous or endogenous package sizes are used . In addition market outcomes depend not only on the optimal pricing strategy but also on the optimal project target . Moreover the creator can benefit from providing two types of packages instead of one type of package . Finally the creator can strategically reduce the size of the large package and narrow the gap between the two packages to attract more funds .

@highlight Consider consumers heterogeneity of usages and valuations in a crowdfunding mechanism.
@highlight Identify the optimal pricing strategy and project target under exogenous package size.
@highlight Providing different kinds of packages can benefit the creator compared with a single package.
@highlight Derive the optimal joint decision in package size pricing strategy and project target.
