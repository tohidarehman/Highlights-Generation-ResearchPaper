 The transit equilibrium assignment problem aims to predict the distributions of passenger flows on lines or line segments in a transit network . Compared to the traffic assignment problem for highway networks the TEAP is much less studied especially in terms of solution algorithms . This paper proposes two Newton type hyperpath based algorithms for a frequency based TEAP formulation that considers both the congestion effect related to crowding and the queuing effect related to boarding . These newly developed algorithms as well as two benchmark algorithms from the literature are tested and compared on a number of transit networks including two constructed using real world data . The results show the proposed hyperpath based algorithms significantly outperform the benchmark algorithms in large networks .
