 As the number of countries liberalizing their skies increases some airlines notably carriers in the Middle East have extended their hub and spoke networks beyond domestic borders . This allows them to serve international destinations without the need to go through traditional gateway hubs so that they can compete with airline alliances relying on the traditional dual gateway or the so called dog bone networks . This paper proposes a stochastic optimization model to address the location choice issue of additional gateway airports with a consideration of the competition between airlines running traditional dog bone networks and hub and spoke networks in a liberalizing inter continental market . A two stage approach is adopted to model the effects of demand uncertainty . In the first stage the future passenger demand is not observable and thus airlines or airline alliances aim to maximize their own expected profit by choosing additional gateway airports from the set of candidate gateway airports pre specified by the regulator . In the second stage with the passenger demand observed and the gateway scheme fixed airlines determine their aircraft sizes and service frequencies to maximize their own profit and air passengers choose routes that minimize their own travel disutility . Based on a calibration of the demand dispersion parameters in elastic demand function the proposed model is applied to the China Europe aviation market which includes the inter continental international market and the associated Chinese and European domestic markets so that to ascertain the comparative advantages of different network configurations . The social welfares of the system under different demand scenarios and different gateway schemes are compared and the sensitivity analyses of some parameters are also implemented .

@highlight Investigate competition and cooperation between airlines operating dog bone and hub and spoke networks.
@highlight Determine the optimal locations of new gateway airports under demand uncertainty.
@highlight Present a maximum likelihood method to calibrate the key parameter in the elastic demand function.
@highlight Reveal the effects of aviation liberalization on airlines passengers and social welfare.
@highlight Conduct a case study for China Europe inter continental aviation market.
