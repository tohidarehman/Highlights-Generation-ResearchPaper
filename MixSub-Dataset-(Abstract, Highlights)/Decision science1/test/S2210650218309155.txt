 Environmental selection in Pareto based many objective evolutionary algorithms generally employ Pareto dominance relation to first consider the convergence and give higher priority to convergence than diversity . When the many objective optimization problem has a complicated Pareto front this selection strategy can easily miss the promising areas and converge into a subregion of the Pareto front . To address this issue we propose a many objective evolutionary algorithm with diversity first based environmental selection . Different from the existing selection strategies the environmental selection procedure in the proposed algorithm adopts a diversity first and convergence second principle which first selects the representative solutions that having better diversity and then considers using the well converged solutions to replace them in subregions . This selection replacement strategy can maintain the diversity and make contribution to the convergence . In addition a selection criterion termed adaptive angle penalized distance is designed to judge whether the replacement is implemented or not . The proposed algorithm is compared with five state of the art many objective evolutionary algorithms on a large number of test problems with various characteristics . Experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has competitive performance on many objective optimization problems .
