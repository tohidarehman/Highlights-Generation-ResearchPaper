 The crew pairing problem is one of the most important but challenging tasks for commercial airlines . However the operation environment of the aviation industry is highly volatile with diverse uncertainties . Flight flying time variability is an important disruption that usually causes deviations of flight departure arrival times from the schedule . Traditional crew pairing frameworks without considering flight flying time variability can generate pairings that are fragile to flight delays . However the impact of flight flying time variability on crew pairings is under explored . In this paper we propose two robustness enhancement strategies based on the consideration of flight flying time variability . Besides two robustness measurements are developed to construct two novel robust crew pairing models . One is time based while the other is number based . A customized column generation based solution algorithm is proposed . Computational experiments based on real flight schedules show that our new models can greatly enhance solution robustness at a price of an acceptable increase in operating costs compared with the traditional model . Besides extreme delay flights can be completely avoided in the proposed models . Moreover the solutions obtained from the time based model show higher resistance against the disruption of flight flying time variability with a lower operating cost than the number based model .
