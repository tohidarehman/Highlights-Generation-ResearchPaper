 Mandibular Distraction Osteogenesis is a common clinical procedure to correct mandibular retrognathia . However since there is not a gold standard for determining the screw positions for current MDO operations deviation of distraction direction and malocclusion increases . This case results in need of additional operations that affect the callus stability . In these cases relapse risk increases and remodelling period gets longer . On the other hand large volume of the distractor plates results in more invasive treatment and negatively affects the patients comfort . To overcome these problems this study offers a new method including virtual surgery simulation determining the optimum screw configuration using particle swarm optimization loop linked between MATLAB PYTHON ANSYS programs and the design of distractor plate geometry with topology optimization . In order to test the proposed method two different Finite Element models CM and OM were established based on conventional and optimum method respectively . FEA results of the current study reveals that OM has 33.56 less displacement compared to CM and the most critical screw in terms of screw loosening for OM has 35.29 less strain value than CM . These outcomes show OM shows superior callus stability in comparison with CM . On the other hand redesign of the distractor plates using topology optimization according to the best screw positions provides 43.32 reduction in the total implant volume which means reduced cost and a less invasive MDO operation . Therefore the clinical use of this protocol is expected to increase the success of the operation by shortening the recovery period .
