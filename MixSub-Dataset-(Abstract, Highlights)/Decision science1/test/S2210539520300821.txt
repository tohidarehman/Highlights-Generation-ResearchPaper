 This research proposes a Robust Customer Satisfaction Index for air domestic journeys which could be less sensitive to outlier data than index scores based on the American customer satisfaction index formulation . Since traveler experiences in air journeys are a chain of services related to departure airport service airline service and arrival airport service a new index for measuring passenger satisfaction for air journeys is required . In a sense then this study is the first step towards integrating satisfaction literature to propose a robust index for air journeys . The Structural Equation Model was used to validate the theoretical model . The RCSI model was tested in the context of Colombian major domestic air route where traveler s perceived quality and perceived value were found to predict significantly overall passenger satisfaction . In this study we found that the RCSI score is similar to the average for the airline industry in ACSI . The findings show that the RCSI is less sensitive to outlier data than customer satisfaction indexes based on the ACSI model formulation . The RCSI model also allows the airline and airport managers to understand the specific factors which significantly influence overall traveler satisfaction by reading the causal relationship in the RCSI model .

@highlight The new robust satisfaction index assesses passenger satisfaction for air journeys.
@highlight Traveler satisfaction is influenced by a strong service quality concept.
@highlight Passenger perceived quality is based on a chain of air services.
@highlight Service quality and perceived value are predictor of overall passenger satisfaction.
@highlight The RCSI is less sensitive to outlier data than other customer satisfaction indexes.
