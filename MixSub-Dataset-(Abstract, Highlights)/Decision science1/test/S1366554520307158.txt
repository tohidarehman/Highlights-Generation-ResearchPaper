We extend our study to a multi tiered product setting and examine the impacts of social influences and loss aversion on SC decisions and channel coordination . Given the gloomy post Covid 19 economic prospects in an era of reglobalization this study urges trade associations and business leaders to immunize their SCs by considering behavioral biases and social influences and revisiting their contractual obligations .
