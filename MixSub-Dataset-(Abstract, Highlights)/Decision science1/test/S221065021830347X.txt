 In recent years the scientific community has witnessed an explosion in the use of pattern recognition algorithms . However little attention has been paid to the tasks preceding the execution of these algorithms the preprocessing activities . One of these tasks is dimensionality reduction in which a subset of features that improves the performance of the mining algorithm is located and algorithm s runtime is reduced . Although there are many methods that address the problems in pattern recognition algorithms effective solutions still need to be researched and explored . Hence this paper aims to address three of the issues surrounding these algorithms . First we propose adapting a promising meta heuristic called biased random key genetic algorithm which considers a random initial population construction . We call this algorithm as unsupervised feature selection by biased random key genetic algorithm I . Next we propose an approach for building the initial population partly in a deterministic way . Thus we applied this idea in two algorithms named unsupervised feature selection by particle swarm optimization and unsupervised feature selection by biased random key genetic algorithm II . Finally we simulated different datasets to study the effects of relevant and irrelevant attributes and of noisy and missing data on the performance of the algorithms . After the Wilcoxon rank sum test we can state that the proposed algorithms outperform all other methods in different datasets . It was also observed that the construction of the initial population in a partially deterministic way contributed to the better performance . It should be noted that some methods are more sensitive to noisy and missing data than others as well as to relevant and irrelevant attributes .
