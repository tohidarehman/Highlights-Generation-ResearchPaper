 We consider a firm producing and selling experience products over two periods with private quality information . Consumers strategically decide their purchasing timing driven by the imitation effect and the firm chooses pricing policy and equilibrium type . Results imply that the firm prefers preannounced pricing but consumers prefer dynamic pricing . Under both pricing schemes the first period price decreases but the second period price increases with the imitation effect . A pooling pooling equilibrium is always preferred unless the firm is farsighted and the imitation effect is weak under dynamic pricing .
