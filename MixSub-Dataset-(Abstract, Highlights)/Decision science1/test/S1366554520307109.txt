 One innovative solution to the last mile delivery problem is the self service locker system . Motivated by a real case in Singapore we consider a POP Locker Alliance who operates a set of POP stations and wishes to improve the last mile delivery by opening new locker facilities . We propose a quantitative approach to determine the optimal locker location with the objective to maximize the overall service provided by the alliance . Customers choices regarding the use of facilities are explicitly considered . They are predicted by a multinomial logit model . We then formulate the location problem as a multi ratio linear fractional 01 program and provide two solution approaches . The first one is to reformulate the original problem as a mixed integer linear program which is further strengthened using conditional McCormick inequalities . This approach is an exact method developed for small scale problems . For large scale problems we propose an alternating algorithm i.e . Quadratic Transform with Linear Alternating . The numerical experiment indicates that QT LA is an efficient approach that yields high quality solutions . Finally we conducted a case study . The results highlighted the importance of considering the customers choices . Under different parameter values of the multinomial logit model the decisions could be completely different . Therefore the parameter value should be carefully estimated in advance .
