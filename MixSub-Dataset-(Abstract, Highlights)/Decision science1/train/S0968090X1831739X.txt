 We develop a personalized system to modify individual travel behaviors by offering personalized incentives . Individual preferences are learned to provide personalized incentives so that the promoted alternative is likely accepted . Using knowledge from control theories and state estimation we model travelers choice making behaviors with the random utility theory and responses from the individuals are mined by a particle filter for learning individual preferences to promote sustainable behaviors . The discrete nature of travel behavior naturally leads to limited observability . We overcome this problem by designing a measurement function from which additional information can be solicited . Additionally the inherent trade offs between factors that affect travel choices result in an infinite set of solutions . We thus propose two solutions the divide and conquer strategy in which a multi dimensional conditional probability function is proposed and use of domain knowledge to restrict that preference values fall in certain ranges and are consistent with certain distributions . The performance of preference learning with these two solutions applied is shown via simulation tests and an online experiment involving human participants . For departure time choices we show an average acceptance ratio of 0.68 for all participants when being promoted with alternatives with personalized incentives . We also show that changes in individual departure time choices will lead to 48 reduction in total travel time on a simple transportation network .
