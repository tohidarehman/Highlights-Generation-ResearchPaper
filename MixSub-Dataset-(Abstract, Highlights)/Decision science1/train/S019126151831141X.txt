 Rapidly advancing on demand ridesharing services including those with self driving technologies hold the promise to revolutionize delivery of mobility . Yet significant imbalance between spatiotemporal distributions of vehicle supply and travel demand poses a pressing challenge . This paper proposes a multi period game theoretic model that addresses dynamic pricing and idling vehicle dispatching problems in the on demand ridesharing systems with fully compliant drivers vehicles . A dynamic mathematical program with equilibrium constraints is formulated to capture the interdependent decision making processes of the mobility service provider and travelers . An algorithm based on approximate dynamic programming with customized subroutines for solving the MPEC is developed to solve the overall problem . It is shown with numerical experiments that the proposed dynamic pricing and vehicle dispatching strategy can help ridesharing service providers achieve better system performance while facing spatial and temporal variations in ridesharing demand .
