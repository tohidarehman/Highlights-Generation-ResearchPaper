 Sketchy design models are used to examine the fundamental tradeoff in transit systems and to guide high level decisions . Traditionally passengers route choice is greatly simplified in such models . This study aims to understand whether this simplification would compromise

@highlight The impact of route choice modeling on transit system performances is examined.
@highlight Optimal user costs are affected by route choice modeling but agency costs are not.
@highlight The system design is often insensitive to route choice modeling.
@highlight Details of route choice are generally negligible yet notable exceptions exist.
