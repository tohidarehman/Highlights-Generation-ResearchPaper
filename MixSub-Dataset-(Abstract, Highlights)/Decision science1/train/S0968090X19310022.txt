 Although automatically collected human travel records can accurately capture the time and location of human movements they do not directly explain the hidden semantic structures behind the data e.g . activity types . This work proposes a probabilistic topic model adapted from Latent Dirichlet Allocation to discover representative and interpretable activity categorization from individual level spatiotemporal data in an unsupervised manner . Specifically the activity travel episodes of an individual user are treated as words in a document and each topic is a distribution over space and time that corresponds to certain type of activity . The model accounts for a mixture of discrete and continuous attributesthe location start time of day start day of week and duration of each activity episode . The proposed methodology is demonstrated using pseudonymized transit smart card data from London U.K . The results show that the model can successfully distinguish the three most basic types of activitieshome work and other . As the specified number of activity categories increases more specific subpatterns for home and work emerge and both the goodness of fit and predictive performance for travel behavior improve . This work makes it possible to enrich human mobility data with representative and interpretable activity patterns without relying on predefined activity categories or heuristic rules .

@highlight The paper develops a spatiotemporal topic model for human activity discovery.
@highlight Each topic is a distribution over space and time that corresponds to an activity.
@highlight The model accounts for a mixture of discrete and continuous travel attributes.
@highlight The model fits the data significantly better than heuristic approaches.
@highlight The number of topics controls the granularity of discovered activity patterns.
