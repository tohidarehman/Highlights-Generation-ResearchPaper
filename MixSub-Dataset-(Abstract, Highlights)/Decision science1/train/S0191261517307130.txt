 This study estimates and manages the stochastic traffic dynamics in a bi modal transportation system and gives hints on how increasing data availability in transport and cities can be utilized to estimate transport supply functions and manage transport demand simultaneously . In the bi modal system travelers mode choices are based on their perceptions of the two travel modes driving or public transit . Some travelers who have access to real time road traffic information may shift their mode based on the information received . For the roadway network the within day traffic evolution is modeled through a Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram where the flow dynamics exhibits a certain level of uncertainty . A non parametric approach is proposed to estimate the MFD . To improve traffic efficiency we develop an adaptive pricing mechanism coupled with the learned MFD . The adaptive pricing extends the study of Liu and Geroliminis to the time dependent case which can better accommodate temporal demand variations and achieve higher efficiency . Numerical studies are conducted on a one region theoretical city network to illustrate the dynamic evolution of traffic the MFD learning framework and the efficiency of the adaptive pricing mechanism .
