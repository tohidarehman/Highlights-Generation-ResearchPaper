 This paper analyses travelers preferences for the main attributes defining public bus transport services when evaluating connecting versus direct services in the island of Gran Canaria . The information is gathered through a Stated Preference experiment for bus users who make a transfer during their journey . In order to study the preference heterogeneity mixed logit and latent class models are estimated . The preference heterogeneity identified is different according to the estimated model . For Mixed Logit model it is defined by type of transfer interacting with the transfer waiting time and for mandatory trips interacting with in vehicle travel time . For Latent Class model this preference heterogeneity is identified by three classes where the perception of the modal attributes is different in each class and non compensatory behavior is identified . Moreover the transfer waiting time is significant in all three classes . Thus the results depend on the estimated model and a comparison is made with those results . The findings obtained seem to indicate that the improvement opportunities for transport systems should focus on the reduction in the transfer cost with the exception of individuals of class 2 and the improvement in the level of service .
