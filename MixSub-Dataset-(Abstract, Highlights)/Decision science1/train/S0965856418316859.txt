 The aim of this paper is to analyze the perceptions of key stakeholders to a set of policies designed to address urban logistics issues in two cities in Colombia . A ranking survey was conducted and analyzed unveiling levels of acceptance to the proposed policies for three types of stakeholders . Though some methodologies attempt to understand stakeholders perspectives towards urban freight policies often only a certain type of stakeholder is considered perceptions of Citizens are usually overlooked . The results suggest that stakeholders agree on the importance of having space to conduct freight operations in their urban areas . However different stakeholders perceive policies differently and local context plays a key role suggesting that decision makers must consider these aspects before transferring initiatives from other urban settings . When space for freight operations can not be provided the results show that Carriers prefer a Receiver led Consolidation program Receivers consider an Urban Consolidation Center as the best alternative and Citizens prefer Off hour deliveries . While all of the preferred alternatives call for a more active role played by the other stakeholders they also call for more sustainable practices and move away from traditional restrictive policies . The results from this study serve as a tool for planners and decision makers seeking input on the preferences of various stakeholders to and the potential acceptability of urban freight policies .
