 In the freeway network control problem the operation of a traffic network is optimized using only flow control . For special cases of the FNC problem in particular the case when all merging junctions are controlled there exist tight convex relaxations of the corresponding optimization problem . In practice many parameters of this optimization problem are not known with certainty in particular the fundamental diagram and predictions of future traffic demand . This uncertainty poses a challenge for control approaches that pursue a model and optimization based strategy . In this work we propose a robust counterpart to the FNC problem where we introduce uncertainty sets for both the fundamental diagram and future external traffic demands and seek to optimize the system operation minimizing the worst case cost . For a network with controlled merging junctions and assuming that certain technical conditions on the uncertainty sets are satisfied we show that the robust counterpart of the FNC problem can be reduced to a convex finite dimensional and deterministic optimization problem whose numerical solution is tractable .

@highlight A robust counterpart of the Freeway Network Control problem is proposed.
@highlight We take uncertainty in the fundamental diagram and future traffic demand into account.
@highlight Under certain conditions the robust problem admits a tractable convex reformulation.
@highlight We also propose a receding horizon control approach with robustness guarantees.
