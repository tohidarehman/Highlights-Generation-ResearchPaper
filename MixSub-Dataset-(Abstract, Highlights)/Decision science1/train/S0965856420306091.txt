 The need to transition towards more sustainable futures is evident . This paper explores the role of social enterprise in urban sustainability transitions . Using the UP Bike Share a university based bicycle sharing social enterprise as a case study this paper aims to bring a more explicit social entrepreneurship perspective towards sustainability transitions research as well as draw insights from social enterprise as a social innovation to challenge existing sociotechnical regimes . Existing operator models of bike sharing systems in other countries are predominantly for profit vendors publicly owned entities and non profit organizations . Emerging from civil society UP Bike Share on the other hand is a social enterprise that grew into a social movement with a well defined advocacy and became part of a bigger social movement of sustainability advocates . Where previous attempts to establish a bike sharing program by the local government international development institution and public transport agency in Metro Manila failed the UP Bike Share represents the first bike sharing system in the Philippines that was successfully piloted implemented and sustained . We then expound on three mechanisms by which UP Bike Share can achieve such transformation namely market formation insertion into the broader social movement and replication of innovation in other localities supporting wider sustainability goals . We end with agenda for future research .
