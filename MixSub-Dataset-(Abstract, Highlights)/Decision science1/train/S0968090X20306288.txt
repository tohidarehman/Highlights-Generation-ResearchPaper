 Disastrous events have been drastically increasing both in frequency and destructive capacity over the past few years . While advance notice events have received a great deal of attention in the literature of disaster management not much attention so far has been given to the no notice events mainly because of the scarcity of data . As an attempt to address this critical gap the current study proposes a disaggregate evacuation demand framework to understand evacuees travel behavior in case of no notice emergency events . The proposed framework comprises four main steps of evacuation decision evacuation planning tour formation and activity schedule update . This article is dedicated to the introduction of the framework structure and elaboration on the tour formation step . In this step we first estimate the total number of intermediate stops travel time and distance of the evacuation tours for those who decide to evacuate through a joint modeling structure and then determine the type of each intermediate stop . It is found that a broad range of factors including evacuees demographic profiles built environment attributes and characteristics of the disastrous event plays a significant role in peoples evacuation behavior during no notice emergency events . The findings of this study can assist responsible agencies in understanding evacuees complex behavior and consequently in devising effective strategies to alleviate economic damages and casualties resulted by such events .
