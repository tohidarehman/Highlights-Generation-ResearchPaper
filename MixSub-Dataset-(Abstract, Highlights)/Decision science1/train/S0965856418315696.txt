 Active modes take up an increasingly important place on the global policy making agenda . In the Netherlands a country that is well known for its high shares of walking and cycling the government aims at achieving a modal shift among 200 000 commuting car drivers towards using the bicycle . To this end policy measures need to be introduced . When the aim is to achieve a modal switch over an enduring period of time it is more relevant to know the likelihood of including or excluding a mode in the mode choice set compared to choosing a mode for a single trip . Therefore we investigate the formation of the experienced choice set where the aim is to identify determinants that influence the inclusion or exclusion of a mode in this set . We estimate discrete choice models based on survey data from the Netherlands Mobility Panel and a complementary survey where individuals were asked to report the frequency of using certain modes of transport for commuting trips over the course of half a year . This study shows that the experienced choice set for commuting is unimodal for the majority of the individuals and remains constant over time for most individuals . Reimbursement by the employer for using a certain mode is the most important determinant influencing the experienced choice set followed by ownership characteristics and urban density . We show that the mode choice set formation depends on more determinants than previously assumed .

@highlight The experienced mode choice set is identified based on historic observations.
@highlight This set is smaller than currently assumed often includes only one mode.
@highlight More determinants are relevant to identify the mode choice set than currently assumed.
@highlight Reimbursement for using a mode and accessibility to a mode are most important.
