 Reservoir simulator is widely known in the petroleum industry for analysing and predicting the fluid flow behaviour through porous media . Conventional mathematical approach which is the mostly used approach in reservoir simulation assumes several unrealistic assumptions . Introducing the memory formalism with classical mathematical approach can eliminate this shortcoming . Because the assumptions of fundamental laws used in reservoir simulation are reduced through incorporation of memory formalism . Memory based flow model accounts the time varying nature of rock fluid properties . To date flow models do not yet exist where all the possible reservoir properties are considered as a function of time and space . The present study shows a comprehensive workflow in developing a memory based reservoir simulator . The fundamentals of memory formalism and fractional calculus along with the use of fractional order derivative to formulate memory formalism are summarized . The proposed memory approach is validated using an application . A comparison of memory approach and multi continuum approach is shown to depict the significance of the memory formulation for anomalous diffusion . This research is expected to open a door for introducing non linear solvers in reservoir simulation study where cloud points solutions will be obtained instead of a single point solution . The outcome of this study will help engineers and researchers to develop more transparent simulator instead of creating a black box .
