 The traffic state in an urban transportation network is determined via spatio temporal traffic propagation . In early traffic forecasting studies time series models were adopted to accommodate autocorrelations between traffic states . The incorporation of spatial correlations into the forecasting of traffic states however involved a computational burden . Deep learning technologies were recently introduced to traffic forecasting in order to accommodate the spatio temporal dependencies among traffic states . In the present study we devised a novel graph based neural network that expanded the existing graph convolutional neural network . The proposed model allowed us to differentiate the intensity of connecting to neighbor roads unlike existing GCNs that give equal weight to each neighbor road . A plausible model architecture that mimicked real traffic propagation was established based on the graph convolution . The domain knowledge was efficiently incorporated into a neural network architecture . The present study also employed a generative adversarial framework to ensure that a forecasted traffic state could be as realistic as possible considering the joint probabilistic density of real traffic states . The forecasting performance of the proposed model surpassed that of the original GCN model and the estimated adjacency matrices revealed the hidden nature of real traffic propagation .
