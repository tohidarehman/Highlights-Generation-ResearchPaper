 Congestion recognition is the prerequisite for traffic control and management vehicle routing and many other applications in intelligent transportation systems . Different types of roads with traffic facilities provide multi source heterogeneous field traffic data which contain the fundamental information and distinct features for congestion recognition . To exploit these traffic big data in this paper we propose a machine learning based framework to tackle the congestion recognition problem . It can be divided in two parts a digraph based representation for hybrid urban traffic network and a Dirgraph Convolutional Neural Network based learning model . At first the representation incorporates the fundamental traffic variables with the correlation of different traffic flows and partially decouples the global network topology from local traffic information . And then to proceed with digraph based samples a new type of graph feature extraction method is introduced and the graph Fourier transform is defined accordingly . This distinguishes the proposed model from the conventional graph convolutional networks . Comprehensive experiments are conducted based on real traffic data . The results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework over the existing congestion recognition methods .
