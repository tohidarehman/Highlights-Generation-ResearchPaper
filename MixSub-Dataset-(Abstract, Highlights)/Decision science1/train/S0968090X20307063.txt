 In this paper we develop a new joint pattern recognition method that combines network motif based analysis with activity sequence based analysis . We use the advantages of both methods in creating groups of patterns that have within them distinct pattern homogeneity and across pattern heterogeneity . The first portion of the analysis here applies a more traditional approach to identify unique network motifs with 16 of them capturing 83.05 of the 2017 NHTS California workday data . Multivariate analysis of grouped motifs data shows different preference of motifs for students part time workers retirees telecommuters drivers women and younger adults . In the second portion of the analysis motifs are grouped into categories based on the number of locations a person visits in a day and their correlation with time use and travel is explored . Time use and travel are analyzed based on minute by minute time allocation pattern identification using sequence analysis and hierarchical clustering . The correlation between motifs group and sequence analysis finds substantial heterogeneity within the motif groups . The within motif group clusters of activity based sequences show typical commuting going to school and resting patterns . We also find seven patterns that are not typical but have similarities across motifs in their temporal footprint and the variety of activities in each sequence . The paper provides a summary of the analytical steps and findings as well as next steps .
