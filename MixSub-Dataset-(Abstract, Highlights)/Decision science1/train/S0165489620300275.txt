 Motivated by empirical evidence we develop an incentive contracting model under oligopolistic competition to study how incumbent firms adjust managerial incentives following deregulation policies that enhance competition . We show that firms elicit higher managerial effort by offering stronger incentives as an optimal response to entry as long as incumbent firms act as production leaders . Our model draws a link between an industry specific feature the time needed to build production capacity and the effect that product market competition has on executive compensation . We offer novel testable implications regarding how this industry specific feature shapes the incentive structure of executive pay .

@highlight Managerial firms in oligopoly offer stronger managerial incentives as Stackelberg leaders.
@highlight By contrast firms offer weaker managerial incentives as Cournot competitors.
@highlight Social welfare is higher under Stackelberg competition than under Cournot competition.
