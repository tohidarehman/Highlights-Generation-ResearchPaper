 Often serving as the backbone for public transport any serious metro incident will have a severe impact on passengers . In the aftermath of a disruption establishing alternative transport means to carry the affected metro passengers such as via substitute bus service is critical . After a particular routing and scheduling plan of SB service is determined the question is how to assemble the SB fleet which has different options . Few studies have addressed the issue of designing the contract with a bus company for the provision of SB including SB availability and service start time guarantee and pricing schemes under uncertain metro system recovery time . This paper attempts to fill this gap . We investigated both the bus companys profit in providing the SB service and the metro companys gain in passenger loss reduction after a metro disruption for setting up the SB service contract . Two payment schemes were considered fixed payment and linear payment . The objective is to design the SB service contract which defines the payment scheme and guaranteed SB service start time from both the perspective of the metro company and that of the bus company to explore feasible solutions . In addition the scenarios of collaborative decision between the bus and metro companies nonlinear passenger demand drop fleet size arrivals of new passengers and passengers waiting time are investigated .

@highlight Uncertain recovery time is considered in Substitute Bus SB deployment study.
@highlight Cost benefit analysis is conducted of both the metro and bus companies.
@highlight The bus companys profit from providing the SB service is examined.
@highlight The metro companys gain of calling for the SB service is evaluated.
@highlight Passenger optimal solution is proposed to determine payment rate and SB arrival time.
