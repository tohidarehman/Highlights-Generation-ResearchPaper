 We show that Bertrand competition arises in equilibrium in the downstream market of a vertically related industry with bottleneck . The upstream monopolist offers fixed fee discounts to the downstream firms in order to motivate them to set prices instead of quantities in the final good market . This is in sharp contrast with the bulk of the literature in which Cournot competition is the equilibrium mode of competition . Bertrand competition is beneficial for all firms but not for consumers and the society .

@highlight We consider a vertically related industry with upstream bottleneck.
@highlight The upstream supplier trades with the downstream firms via three part tariff contracts.
@highlight The upstream supplier motivates downstream firms to offer price instead of quantity contracts to final consumers via fixed fee discounts.
@highlight Bertrand competition arises as the equilibrium mode of competition.
@highlight Firms are better off but consumers and the society as a whole are worse off.
