 The potential to implement the concept of waterborne platooning in the European short sea transportation system is currently being explored . In the concept a platoon is referred to as a Vessel Train . A VT is composed of a fully manned lead vessel and a number of follower vessels . The lead vessel takes over the navigational and situational awareness responsibilities for the follower vessels . This enables automation of the navigational tasks on these follower vessels which in turn leads to a potential reduction in crew size and associated cost .

@highlight Demonstrates an assessment that is used to determine the viability of a waterborne platoon.
@highlight The max. follower vessel cost and the productivity changes are the main limiting indicators.
@highlight The economic viability conditions of Vessel Train transport system are presented in the case study.
@highlight 1 of vessels in the existing European short sea fleet are needed to join the platooning concept.
@highlight Benefits created by the VT implementation are not large enough to guarantee a successful application.
