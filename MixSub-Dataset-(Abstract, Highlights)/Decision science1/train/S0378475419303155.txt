 This paper studies a sampling based cooperative adaptive cruise control problem under communication delays and actuator lags . To deal with this problem a new sampled control framework for each following vehicle is established in which the time varying communication delays and actuator lags are involved . By the proposed framework an effective sampled control law for the CACC systems is given with the leaderpredecessor following communication topology . In order to guarantee inner vehicular stability the LyapunovKrasovskii function method is applied to obtain the sufficient condition for the existence of a controller by using state transformation . Furthermore additional string stability conditions are complemented by considering the upper bound of delays . A useful controller design algorithm is given to ensure inner stability and string stability simultaneously . A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of controller design methodology of CACC systems .

@highlight The sampled data CACC problem under various delays is considered.
@highlight To deal with time varying delays a platoon control framework is presented.
