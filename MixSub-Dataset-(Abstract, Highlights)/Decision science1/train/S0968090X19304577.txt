 The recent technological innovations in various ICT platforms have given rise to innovative mobility solutions . Such systems could potentially address some of the inherent shortcomings of a line schedule based public transport system . Previous studies either assumed that flexible on demand services are used as an exclusive door to door service or offered as a feeder connection to high capacity public transport services . However users may combine line schedule based public transport systems and on demand services so that their travel impedance is minimized . To this end we propose a multimodal route choice and assignment model that allows users combining Fixed and Flexible PT or use them as individual modes while demand for these services is endogenously determined . The model takes into account the dynamic demandsupply interaction using an iterative learning framework . Flexible public transport can be used to perform any part of the trip ranging from a first last mile service to an exclusive direct door to door connection . The developed model is implemented in an agent based simulation framework . The model is applied to a network centered around the city of Amsterdam The Netherlands . Scenarios where Fixed PT and Flexible PT are offered as mutually exclusive modes or can be combined into a single journey are analysed . Results indicate that Flexible PT is predominantly used for covering

@highlight Combined passenger route choice for fixed and flexible PT services.

@highlight Decrease in share of fixed services while increase in overall share of PT.
@highlight Level of service barely improves for fleet size 5 of the travel demand.
