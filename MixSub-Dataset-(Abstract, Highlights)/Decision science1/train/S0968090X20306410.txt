 Urban transportation systems are subject to a high level of variation and fluctuation in demand over the day . When this variation and fluctuation are observed in both time and space it is crucial to develop line plans that are responsive to demand . A multi period line planning approach that considers a changing demand during the planning horizon is proposed . If such systems are also subject to limitations of resources a dynamic transfer of resources from one line to another throughout the planning horizon should also be considered . A mathematical modelling framework is developed to solve the line planning problem with a cost oriented approach considering transfer of resources during a finite length planning horizon of multiple periods . We use real life public transportation network data for our computational results . We analyze whether or not multi period solutions outperform single period solutions in terms of feasibility and relevant costs . The importance of demand variation on multi period solutions is investigated . We evaluate the impact of resource transfer constraints on the effectiveness of solutions . We also study the effect of period lengths along with the problem parameters that are significant for and sensitive to the optimality of solutions .
