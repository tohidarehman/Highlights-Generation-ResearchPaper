 This article develops a deep reinforcement learning framework for dynamic pricing on managed lanes with multiple access locations and heterogeneity in travelers value of time origin and destination . This framework relaxes assumptions in the literature by considering multiple origins and destinations multiple access locations to the managed lane

@highlight Dynamic pricing formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process.
@highlight Deep reinforcement learning Deep RL algorithms used as solution methods.
@highlight Deep RL algorithms outperform feedback control heuristic on different objectives.
@highlight Policies trained using Deep RL algorithms transfer well to new input distributions.
@highlight Deep RL algorithms suitable for multi objective optimization using reward shaping.
