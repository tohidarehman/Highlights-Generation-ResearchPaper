 This paper proposes a new optimization model for the network design problem of the demand responsive customized bus . The proposed model consists of two phases inserting passenger requests dynamically in an interactive manner and optimizing the service network statically based on the overall demand . In the dynamic phase we propose a hierarchical decision making model to describe the interactive manner between operator and passengers . The CB network design problem is formulated in a mixed integer program with the objective of maximizing operators revenue . The CB passengers travel behavior is measured by a discrete choice model given the trip plan provided by the operator . A dynamic insertion method is developed to address the proposed model in the dynamic phase . For the network design problem in the static phase the service network is re optimized based on the confirmed passengers with strict time deviation constraints embedded in the static multi vehicle pickup and delivery problem . An exact solution method is developed based on the branch and bound algorithm . Numerical examples are conducted to verify the proposed models and solution algorithms .
