 By focusing on several critical speeds this paper proposes a simple and applicable method to seek the optimal speed for carriers . The results show that carriers will reduce ship speed if the saved fuel cost outweighs the incurred capital and operating costs . The measure of critical fuel prices at different critical speeds is powerful to examine the optimal speed . Meanwhile deploying extra ships and calling extra ports could be an optimal strategy for carriers in implementing slow steaming . The empirical result suggests that the optimal speeds for large ships will be higher than the ones for small ships .

@highlight A simplified method by focusing on several critical speeds to seek the optimal speed for carriers is provided.
@highlight The paper shows that slow steaming can definitely reduce fuel consumption and the resulting GHG emissions.
@highlight Adding ships and calling extra ports can be an optimal strategy for carriers in doing slow steaming.
@highlight The measure of critical fuel prices at different critical speeds is an efficient way to determine the optimal speed.
@highlight The optimal speed for large ships will be higher than the one for small ships.
