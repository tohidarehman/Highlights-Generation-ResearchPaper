 This paper proposes a bi modal bottleneck model with time varying scheduling preferences for investigating the two mode problem with bottleneck queuing and transit crowding . In the proposed model the activity scheduling utilities of commuters at home and at work vary by the time of day and two kinds of congestion externalities are considered . Commuters choose their travel modes and departure times from home to work during the morning commute to minimize their own generalized travel cost . The properties of the proposed bi modal bottleneck model are analytically explored . Particularly the relationship between the departure intervals of auto and bus commuters is revealed . The time varying charging schemes and step charging schemes for reducing the congestion externalities are also investigated . A critical condition for passenger shift from one mode to the other mode with congestion charging schemes is identified and the effects of congestion charging schemes with and without internalizing the bus related congestion externalities on the bottleneck system are compared .
