 The paper uses the most general version of a DixitStiglitz economy and the concept of oligopolistic equilibrium defined in previous work with firms maximizing profits in prices and quantities under a market share and a market size constraint . The purpose here is to take even more advantage of separability so as to partition the oligopolistic sector into groups . Weak separability simplifies quantity conjectures and homothetic separability simplifies price conjectures . Oligopolistic equilibria can in addition be approximated by introducing group expenditure conjectures . Finally the way different groups interact within the same industry is illustrated within the same framework .

@highlight We apply our concept of oligopolistic equilibrium to a DixitStiglitz economy.
@highlight Preference separability is used to partition the oligopolistic sector into groups.
@highlight Weak resp. homothetic separability simplifies quantity resp. price conjectures.
@highlight Oligopolistic equilibria are approximated by assuming group spending conjectures.
@highlight We also illustrate the way different groups interact within the same industry.
