 The macroscopic fundamental diagram can effectively reduce the spatial dimension involved in dynamic optimization of traffic performance for large scale networks . Solving the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equation takes center stage in yielding solutions to the optimal control problem . At the core of solving the HJB equation is the value function that represents choosing a sequence of actions to optimize the system performance . However this problem generally becomes intractable for possible discontinuities in the solution and the curse of dimensionality for systems with all but modest dimension . To address these challenges a neural network is used to approximate the value function to obtain the optimal controls through policy iteration . Furthermore a saturated operator is embedded in the neural network approximator to handle the difficulty caused by the control and state constraints . This policy iteration can be implemented as an iterative data driven technique that integrates with the model based optimal design based on real time observations . Numerical experiments are conducted to show that the neuro dynamic programming approach can achieve optimization goals while stabilizing the system by regulating the traffic state to the desired uncongested equilibrium .
