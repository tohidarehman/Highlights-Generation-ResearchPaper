 The use of smartphone applications to acquire real time and readily available journey planning information is becoming instinctive behavior by public transport users . Through the apps a passenger not only seeks a path from origin to destination but a satisfactory path that caters to the passengers preferences at the desired time of travel . Essentially apps attempt to provide a means of personalized PT service . As the implications of the Covid 19 pandemic take form and infiltrate human and environmental interactions passenger preference personalization will likely include avoiding risks of infection or contagious contact . The personal preferences are enabled by multiple attributes associated with alternative PT routes . For instance preferences can be connected to attributes of time cost and convenience .

@highlight Establish an adjusted design framework for optimal paths for public transport users considering their preferences at the requested time of travel.
@highlight Devise a novel lexicographical comparison methodology with a just noticeable difference JND consideration that captures human perception elements combined with preferences over different PT attributes.
@highlight Establish the theorem for the comparison method to satisfy the axiom of transitivity and develop a sorting algorithm and prove its correctness.
@highlight Case study using simulation on the Copenhagen PT network and the results of the case study imply a favorable potential for real life applications.
