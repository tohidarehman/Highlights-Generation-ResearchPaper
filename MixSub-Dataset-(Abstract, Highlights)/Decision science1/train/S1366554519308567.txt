 New trade in services such as online trade in trade in on e commerce platforms and omni channel trade in are emerging due to the development of e commerce . To offer these new trade in services firms need to determine the optimal product price and rebate and decide whether to pay the rebate with a gift card or cash . To address these challenges for firms our paper considers a firm selling a new product to new consumers and offering a trade in service to replacement consumers . In addition we develop theoretical models to examine the optimal decisions in the cases of G and C and explore the optimal payment for the rebate . We reveal that G payment is a better choice for the firm only if the used product residual value is relatively low and the market size ratio between replacement and new consumers is relatively low otherwise the firm should choose C payment . Interestingly replacement consumers preferred trade in rebate payment leads a lower trade in demand than G payment and C payment may be harmful . In the extension we consider a firm with online and offline sales channels and different types of replacement consumers who own different used products and find that our main results regarding the optimal rebate payment still hold . Moreover we find that in the context of a used product with a relatively medium residual value firms with online and offline sales channels are more likely to choose G than firms with one sales channel otherwise firms are more likely to choose C .
