 This paper studies the purchase subsidy design problem for human driven electric vehicles and autonomous electric vehicles . The proposed range and mode specific purchase subsidy aims to maximize the social benefits from vehicle electrification and automation . In this study we first classify electric vehicles into several classes based on electric driving ranges . Each EV class contains two driving modes i.e . human driving and automated driving . We provide a simplified model to estimate the greenhouse gas emission and the inconvenience costs of vehicle charging . The nested logit model is used to characterize users vehicle choice behaviors . A mixed integer nonlinear programming model is formulated for the purchase subsidy design problem . A customized branch and bound method is developed to seek a globally optimal solution to the formulated MINLP model . The numerical examples show that the developed solution method can effectively solve the proposed problem in a reasonable time . The local search strategy embedded in the customized B B method helps reduce 7 computation time on average . Some managerial insights obtained from the numerical experiments are discussed which can help the government agency to achieve a reasonable budget allocation between HDEVs and AEVs with different electric driving ranges .
