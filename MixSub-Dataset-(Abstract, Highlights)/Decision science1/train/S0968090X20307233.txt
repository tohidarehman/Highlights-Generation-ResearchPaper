 Two car households with one conventional and one battery electric vehicle have an opportunity to partially circumvent the range limitations of a modest range battery electric vehicle through flexible use . To investigate the extent to which real world households utilize this flexibility we used from 20 two car households in the Gothenburg area in Sweden GPS data from before and during an EV trial in which the households were asked to temporarily replace one of their two conventional cars with a short range EV for the duration of the trial . The actual household electric drive fraction i.e . the EV distance as a share of the total two car household driving distance varied between 30 and 70 with a household mean of 47 . On average this corresponds to 80 of the estimated potential household electric drive fraction during the trial . We quantify the flexibility in choosing the EV as the difference in distance between the potential and the minimum needed EV driving . For below range home to home non overlapping trips the households used 69 of that flexibility . For household trips that did overlap in time they used 56 of the flexibility . Thus the EV is the preferred vehicle but the preference is less obvious for overlapping trips . Our analysis implies an even more dominant role for the EV in weekend driving . Further although the pre trial data showed a large difference in the household shares of distances driven between a replaced first car and a replaced second car this difference disappears when an EV replaces either one .

@highlight In a trial a BEV replaced one of the conventional cars in 20 two car households.
@highlight Unique study with GPS data on both cars in the trial as well as pre trial period.
@highlight For below range single trips the BEV was used for over 2 3 of driving.
@highlight The replaced cas driving whether 1st or 2nd car was transcended.
