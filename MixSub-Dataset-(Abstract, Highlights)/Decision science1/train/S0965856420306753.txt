 Transportation gender and social exclusion have increasingly come together in scholarly pursuits and policy agendas in Latin America and the Caribbean . The recognition of the gender dimension of sustainable mobility has opened a space to consider the role of women especially of those facing poverty and exclusion in this global agenda . However research on the link between precarious occupations social exclusion and gender and the role that mobility plays both in enhancing and limiting development opportunities for highly vulnerable workers in the Global South is still limited . Based on Bogots 2015 Mobility Survey data from an application that matches domestic workers with employers and interviews conducted with domestic workers this paper investigates the case of Bogot Colombia to describe domestic workers daily commutes . More specifically it focuses on the long duration of their trips their patterns their inevitable connection to public transportation and the financial implications for their restricted family budget . Considering a legal provision that establishes a time window for switching between public transportation vehicles the paper also examines its effects on domestic workers commutes . By doing so the paper aims to address the situation not only of the massive group of female domestic workers traversing the city every day but also of other similarly situated social groups that could find in transportation a path towards greater social inclusion .

@highlight Massive numbers of domestic workers have the longest commutes of all workers in urban Bogot.
@highlight Domestic workers travel mostly between low and high income residential areas.
@highlight Domestic workers are captive users of public transportation.
@highlight The integrated time window to change between vehicles could be insufficient for many domestic workers.
@highlight Mobility solutions for domestic workers could extend to other similarly situated social groups.
