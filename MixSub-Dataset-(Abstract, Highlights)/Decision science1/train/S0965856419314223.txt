 In this paper we consider captive mode travelers in a multi modal network equilibrium problem . Specifically the dogit model is adopted to account for captive mode travelers in the modal split problem and the path size logit model is used to capture route overlapping effects in the traffic assignment problem . The dogit PSL MMNE model is formulated as an equivalent entropy based mathematical programming problem which admits solution existence and uniqueness . Three numerical examples are provided . The first example examines the effects of mode captivity and route overlapping on network performances and observes that accounting for captive mode travelers would produce different equilibrium states and hence the network performance indicators . The second example applies the dogit PSL MMNE model for evaluating the exclusive bus lane expansion plans in which a consistent synthetic proportional index is proposed . Numerical results show that considering mode captivity may produce substantial impacts on the odds of making different EBL line expansion decisions . The third example implements the dogit PSL MMNE model in the Seoul network to show the applicability of the dogit PSL MMNE model in a real size multi modal system .
