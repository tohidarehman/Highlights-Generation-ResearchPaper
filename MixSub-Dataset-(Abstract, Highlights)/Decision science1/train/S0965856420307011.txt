 In recent years the concept of carsharing is rapidly gaining popularity in China and the round trip carsharing has become a common mode . However few studies have revealed the role of round trip carsharing in users travel . In this study the round trip GPS data provided by a carsharing company in Beijing China is used to analyze the users usage patterns based on their trip chains . Through the extraction and analysis of trip information all trip chains are grouped into three clusters each of which has a different usage pattern . Then the consumption features and the shared car pick up and return time of these three patterns are discussed . Further the Bayes rule is used to predict the activity purpose and the proportion and spatial distribution of different purposes are analyzed . Results reveal that the carsharing program presents multiple usage patterns to meet the different travel needs of users . Price incentives like coupons discounts and packages can attract more shared car trips . Users demand for price incentives increases with longer travel distance and time . Also users usage of vehicles and parking spaces has obvious peak hours . The spatial distribution of user activities has distinctly different hotspots . This paper can be beneficial for operators to set a reasonable pricing plan and provide better services .

@highlight This study explores the multi dimensional features of the round trip carsharing usage pattern.
@highlight Stop time thresholds are determined by considering different rental time.
@highlight The impact of price incentives on carsharing usage is discussed.
@highlight Users usage of carsharing and parking spaces has obvious peak hours.
@highlight Hotspots in the spatial distribution of activities are identified.
