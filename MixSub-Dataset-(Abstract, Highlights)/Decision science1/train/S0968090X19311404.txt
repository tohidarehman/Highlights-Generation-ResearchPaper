 Safer and more efficient airport ground movements can be planned by routing and scheduling systems based on the 4 dimensional trajectory . In order to achieve the benefits envisioned in the planning stage an effective taxiing guidance system is indispensable . The Follow the Greens guidance concept provides an augmented means for 4DT based taxiing with pilot in the loop which is expected to guide the piloted aircraft by dynamically adjusting the lit position of green ground navigation lamps according to the assigned 4DTs . This paper presents a simulation study to investigate the feasibility of FtG based on a control theoretic modeling of the taxiing system . The 4DT conformance errors with different navigation lamp control strategies are investigated . The key performance indices including temporal constraint violation and fuel consumption are analysed . The results demonstrate that it is feasible to follow conflict free 4DTs through FtG if an appropriate lamp controller is available . The results also highlight the need to proactively handle the potential conformance errors in the routing and scheduling stage .

@highlight The feasibility of FtG taxiing guidance with conflict free 4DTs is demonstrated.
@highlight A PID ground lamp controller is devised to improve 4DT conformance.
@highlight 4DT conformance error is quantified based on a large set of pre planned 4DTs.
@highlight 4DT conformance error has a clear impact on temporal constraints and fuel consumption.
@highlight Minimal time separation in 4DT planning helps in absorbing 4DT conformance error.
