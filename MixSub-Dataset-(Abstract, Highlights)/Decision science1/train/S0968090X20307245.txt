 In recent years due to the increased availability of data and improvements in computing power application of machine learning techniques to various aviation safety problems for identifying isolating and reducing risk has gained momentum . Data collected from on board recorders in commercial aircraft contain thousands of parameters in the form of multivariate time series which are used to train the machine learning models . Among the phases of flight approach and landing phases result in the most accidents and incidents . The performance and trajectory of the aircraft during the approach phase is an indicator of its landing performance which in turn affects incident or accident probability such as runway excursions . Landing performance is commonly measured using metrics such as landing airspeed vertical speed location of touchdown point on runway etc . While current applications of machine learning to aviation focus on retrospective insights to implement corrective measures they offer limited value for real time risk identification or decision making as they are inherently reactive in nature . In this work a novel offline online framework is developed for building a global predictive model offline to predict landing performance metrics online . The framework leverages flight data from the approach phase between certain approach altitudes also called

@highlight Provides a novel online predictive model of aircraft landing performance using data collected on board an aircraft during the approach phase.
@highlight Demonstrates accurate prediction of the critical metrics further ahead in time than existing approaches and at a higher accuracy.
@highlight Introduces innovations in generating feature vectors and target labels using a flexible approach that can be easily replicated for other metrics of interest.
@highlight Significantly improves over previous similar work in literature both in terms of accuracy and applicability in an online setting.
