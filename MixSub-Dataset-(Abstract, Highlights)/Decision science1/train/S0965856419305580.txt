 To alleviate traffic congestion vehicle restriction policies have been widely used globally . However noncompliance behavior undermines the effectiveness and sustainability of such policies . This study focuses on investigating the characteristics of noncompliance behavior under two vehicle restriction policies namely one day per week and odd and even policies . On the basis of license plate recognition data that record the traffic condition under ODPW and OAE policies in Langfang China descriptive statistics are used to illustrate the characteristics of noncompliance with the policies . Furthermore a zero inflated model is used to determine the manner in which influencing factors affect noncompliance frequency . Results show that under the two policies holding a nonlocal license plate traveling a long distance daily in the urban restriction area and departing from a location far from the city center increase the probability of noncompliance behavior of individuals . However unrestricted travel rate which represents the frequency of vehicle trips on unrestricted days exhibits different influences on noncompliance behavior under the two policies . This study provides an in depth interpretation to noncompliance behavior under vehicle restriction policies and aids improve the long term effectiveness of the policies .
