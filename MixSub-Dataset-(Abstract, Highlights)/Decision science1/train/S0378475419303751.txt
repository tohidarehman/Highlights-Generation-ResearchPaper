 We propose a delayed predatorprey model with fear in the prey population . We consider that the growth rate of the prey population is suppressed due to the fear of predators . It is also considered that there is a time lag between the time of perceiving predator signals through chemical and or vocal cues and the changes in life history and behavioral responses in the prey population . We study boundedness persistence local and global behavior of the delayed system . Moreover the Hopf bifurcation analysis around the interior equilibrium with respect to the delay parameter is established . The stability and direction of Hopf bifurcation are also studied . It is observed that fear induced delay has both stabilizing and destabilizing effects depending on the magnitude of the delay parameter . We observe that for the gradual increase of the magnitude of delay the system dynamics switches multiple times between stable focus and limit cycle oscillations . However for a higher value of the delay parameter the system ultimately enters into the chaotic regime . The delay system also exhibits node cycle bi stability behavior between the interior equilibrium point and stable limit cycle . Numerical simulations are also performed to validate analytical findings .
