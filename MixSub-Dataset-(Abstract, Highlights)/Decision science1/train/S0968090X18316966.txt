 This paper presents a doubly dynamic day to day traffic assignment model with simultaneous route and departure time choices while incorporating incomplete and imperfect information as well as bounded rationality . Two SRDT choice models are proposed to incorporate imperfect travel information One based on multinomial Logit model and the other on sequential mixed multinomial nested Logit model . These two variants serving as base models are further extended with two features bounded rationality and information sharing . BR is considered by incorporating the indifference band into the random utility component of the MNL model forming a BR based DTD stochastic model . A macroscopic model of travel information sharing is integrated into the DTD dynamics to account for the impact of incomplete information on travelers SRDT choices . These DTD choice models are combined with within day dynamics following the Lighthill Whitham Richards fluid dynamic network loading model . Simulations on large scale networks illustrate the interactions between users adaptive decision making and network conditions with different levels of information availability and user behavior . Our findings highlight the need for modeling network transient and disequilibriated states which are often overlooked in equilibrium constrained network design and optimization . The MATLAB package and computational examples are available at
