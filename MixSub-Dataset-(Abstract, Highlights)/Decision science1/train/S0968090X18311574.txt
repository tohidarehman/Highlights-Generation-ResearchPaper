 The technological barriers to automated driving systems are being quickly overcome to deploy onroad vehicles that do not require a human driver onboard . ADS have opened up possibilities to improve mobility productivity logistics planning and energy consumption . However further enhancements in productivity and energy consumption are required to reach CO

@highlight Automated Driving Systems ADS affect optimum setup of propulsion system in battery electric heavy vehicles BEHV .
@highlight ADS makes BEHVs profitable in longer travel ranges.
@highlight ADS dedicated BEHVs have lower optimal speeds than vehicles with a human driver.
@highlight Driving slow is cheaper in ADS dedicated BEHVs than in conventional heavy vehicles.
@highlight Vehicle infrastructure optimization reduces the total cost of ownership of BEHVs.
