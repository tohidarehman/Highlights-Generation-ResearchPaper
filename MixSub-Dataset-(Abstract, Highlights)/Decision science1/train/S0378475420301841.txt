 In the past few decades evolutionary multi objective optimization has become a research hotspot in the field of evolutionary computing and a large number of multi objective evolutionary algorithms have been proposed . However MOEA is still faced with the problem that the diversity and convergence of non dominated solutions are difficult to balance . To address these problems an efficient multi objective optimization algorithm based on level swarm optimizer is proposed in this paper . In EMOSO a sorting method is introduced to balance the diversity and convergence of non dominated solutions in the whole population which is based on non dominated relationship and density estimation . Meanwhile a level based learning strategy is introduced to maintain the search for non dominated solutions . Finally DTLZ ZDT and WFG series problems are utilized to verify the performance of the proposed EMOSO . Experimental results and statistical analysis indicate that EMOSO has competitive performance compared with 6 popular MOEAs . The source code of EMOSO is provided at
