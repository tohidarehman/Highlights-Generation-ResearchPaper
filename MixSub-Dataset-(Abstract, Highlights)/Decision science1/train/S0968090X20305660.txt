 This study develops a new map matching algorithm targeting off line applications . The algorithm takes a holistic view of the entire GPS trajectory and finds its match by first dividing it into several segments . This segmentation is made possible through creating a multi layer road index system for the original road network . For each segment a global map matching strategy is employed to identify the best match . The algorithm is compared against three state of the art map matching algorithms from the literature . To get ground truth data we design and perform numerous test drives with predefined paths that have a total length of 234km . GPS trajectories recorded during the test drives are used to evaluate the algorithms . Our numerical experiments show the proposed algorithm improves match efficiency by up to two order of magnitude compared to the benchmark algorithms . Importantly it achieves this remarkable speedup with negligible losses in matching accuracy .
