 In this paper we investigate a new variant of last mile delivery that integrates the scheduling of static E commerce parcels and Online to Offline parcels . The O2O parcels such as flowers and cakes are often delivered intra city with a time window constraint . It is driven by the concept of delivery as a service which targets at building consolidated infrastructure and using the same fleet of vehicles to provide standardized delivery services for different types of merchants . We formulate it as an integration of Multi Depot Multi Trip Vehicle Routing Problem and Paired Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Window . To solve the mixed problem of MDMTVRP and PPDPTW we present its Mixed Integer Programming model to obtain the optimal solution for small scale instances . To solve large scale problems we propose a hybrid neighborhood search strategy to effectively combine the merits of ALNS and tabu search . We also present a two level pruning strategy that can significantly accelerate the local search procedure . We conduct extensive numeric experiments on multiple datasets and results showed that our hybrid approach achieved near optimal performance and established clear superiority over ALNS and tabu search .

@highlight Propose MD MT MPPDTW as a new problem variant towards delivery as a service.
@highlight Propose an MIP model that is solvable for MD MT MPPDTW.
@highlight Propose a hybrid meta heuristic to combine the merits of ALNS and Tabu search.
@highlight Propose a two level pruning strategy to significantly speedup the search procedure.
@highlight Conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
