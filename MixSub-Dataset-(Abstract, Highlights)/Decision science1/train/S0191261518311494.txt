 This paper studies the supply curve of ride hailing systems under different market conditions . The curve defines a relationship between the throughput of trips of the system and the cost of riders it serves . We first focus on isotropic markets by revisiting a matching failure identified recently that matches a requesting rider with an idle driver very far away . The failure will cause the supply curve of an e hailing market to be backward bending but it is proved that the backward bend does not arise in the street hailing market . By constructing a double ended queuing model we prove that the supply curve of an e hailing system with finite matching radius is always backward bending but a smaller matching radius leads to a weaker bend . We further reveal the possibility of completely avoiding the bend by adaptively adjusting the matching radius . We then turn to the anisotropic markets and identify another type of matching failure due to indiscriminate matching between drivers and riders which again causes a backward bending supply . Given the prevalence of such a matching failure in real world operations we discuss how to avoid it using price or rationing discrimination . A conceptualized two node network is constructed to facilitate the discussion .

@highlight This paper studies the supply curve of ride hailing systems the relationship between the throughput of trips of a system and the cost of its riders.
@highlight With finite matching radius the supply curve of an e hailing system is always backward bending. But a smaller matching radius leads to a weaker bend.
@highlight A smaller matching radius leads to a weaker bend and adapatively adjusting the matching radius can completely avoid the bend.
@highlight An indiscriminate matching failure is identified which can also cause backward bending supply.
@highlight Price and rationing discrimination to avoid such a matching failure are discussed.
