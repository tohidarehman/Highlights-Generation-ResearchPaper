 China Railway Express refers to the regular container trains transporting between China and European countries under the Belt and Road Initiative . This paper aims to conduct the systematic and in depth research on the importance ranking of logistics nodes across the complex CR express network from Chinas national plan of the BRI perspective with consideration of the connectivity between the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and the Silk Road Economic Belt . In doing so first it sets up the complex network in the CR express transport . Second based on the restraint coefficients in the theory of structural hole such as network scale efficiency grading and clustering co efficiency this paper applies the Multiple Attribute Decision Making model in association with algorithm development in calculating the importance of the CR express nodes including both inland nodes and seaport nodes . The paper has three fold contributions . In theory it confirms the accuracy and practicability of the structural hole theory in the importance ranking of nodes in the complex network . In practice it identifies important logistics nodes of CR express network across the BRI . Further the findings in the paper contribute to optimising the structure of CR express transport and improving its network stability .

@highlight This paper ranks the important logistics nodes across the complex China Railway Express CR express network from the Belt and Road Initiative perspective.
@highlight Moscow ranks the first in the nodes importance in the CR express transport network Guangzhou and Beihai rank the top two seaport nodes.
@highlight This paper confirms the accuracy and practicability of the structural hole theory in the importance ranking of nodes in the complex network.
@highlight This paper contributes to optimising the structure of CR express transport network and improving the network stability.
