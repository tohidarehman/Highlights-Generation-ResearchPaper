This is followed by purchase subsidies to narrow the difference in price of an EV and that of an internal combustion engine vehicle with 68 of respondents stating that they have a strong or at least a partial positive impact . Pilot trial demonstrations of EVs to expose potential buyers to EVs are also perceived to have a positive effect with 66 of respondents stating so . Tax incentives which like purchase subsidies narrow the gap between the total operating cost of an EV and that of a conventional vehicle are also perceived to have a positive impact by 65 of respondents . Other incentives that are perceived to have a positive influence include climate change and air quality policies consumer information schemes and differential taxation applied to various fuels and energy vectors .
