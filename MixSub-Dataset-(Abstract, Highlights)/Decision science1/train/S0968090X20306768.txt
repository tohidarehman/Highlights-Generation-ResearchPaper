 The rapid conceptual development and commercialization of connected automated vehicle has led to the problem of mixed traffic i.e . traffic mixed with CAVs and conventional human operated vehicles . The paper studies cooperative decision making for mixed traffic . Using discrete optimization a CDMMT mechanism is developed to facilitate ramp merging and to properly capture the cooperative and non cooperative behaviors in mixed traffic . The CDMMT mechanism can be described as a bi level optimization program in which state constrained optimal control based trajectory design problems are imbedded in a sequencing problem . A bi level dynamic programming based solution approach is developed to efficiently solve the problem . The proposed modeling mechanism and solution approach are generic to deterministic decisions and can guarantee system efficient solutions . A micro simulation environment is built for model validation and analysis of mixed traffic . The results show that compared to the scenario with 100 HVs ramp merging can be smoother in mixed traffic environment . At high CAV penetration the section throughput increases about 18 . With the proposed CDMMT mechanism traffic throughput can be further increased by 1015 . The proposed methods form the basis of traffic analysis and cooperative control at ramp merging sections under mixed traffic environment .
