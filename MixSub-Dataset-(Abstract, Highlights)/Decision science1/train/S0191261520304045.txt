 Transit demand and traffic conditions present relevant differences between peak and off peak periods e.g . flows trip lengths congestion raising a relevant strategic design choice regarding the potential use of vehicles with different sizes . Here we first revisit the optimal design using a single line single fleet model showing that buses should always run full at the peak but not always at the off peak . Then we develop a two fleet strategy where one fleet operates the whole day and the other during the peak period only . This strategy includes holding during the peak by imposing equal cycle times for both fleets . The two fleet operation has slightly lower total costs than one fleet but exhibits very different effects on users and on operators costs across periods . A sensitivity analysis reveals the role played by various elements and shows that results are robust . Optimal one and two fleet designs are both better than optimizing each period independently revealing economies of time scope .

@highlight A two fleet strategy for public transport is developed to serve peak and off peak periods with vehicles of smaller size running during the off peak and both fleets running during the peak.
@highlight This strategy is compared with a single fleet serving both periods with vehicle size given by either peak or off peak conditions.
@highlight The two fleet strategy with holding at the peak for small buses is shown to exhibit slightly lower total costs users and operators than the single fleet strategy.
@highlight The numerical analysis is subject to various sensitivity analyses and results are robust.
@highlight Behind the slight difference in total costs there are large differences between peak and off peak costs for peak and off peak users and operators.
