 This paper presents a car following control strategy of connected automated vehicles to stabilize a mixed vehicular platoon consisting of CAVs and human driven vehicles . This study first establishes a string stability criterion for a mixed vehicular platoon . Specifically a mixed vehicular platoon is decomposed into subsystems that are all possible sequential subsets of the platoon . String stability is then defined as the head to tail string stability for all subsystems the magnitude of a disturbance is not amplified from the first vehicle to the last vehicle of each subsystem . Based on this definition distributed frequency domain based CAV control is proposed to increase the number of head to tail string stable subsystems and consequently dampen stop and go disturbances drastically . Specifically an H infinity control problem is formulated where the maximum disturbance damping ratios in each subsystem is minimized within the predominant acceleration frequency boundaries of human driven vehicles . Simulation experiments embedded with real human driven vehicle trajectories were conducted and results show that the proposed control can effectively dampen stop and go disturbances .
