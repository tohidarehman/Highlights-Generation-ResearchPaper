 A cooperative advertising program is an incentive scheme in which a manufacturer shares its retailers local advertising costs . Such programs have received increasing academic attention in the past two decades . However the local media company as the agent of local advertising has been ignored by previous literature . Another practical aspect being ignored is that the manufacturer only shares the retailers local media advertising cost the retailers in store advertising cost is not subsidized .
