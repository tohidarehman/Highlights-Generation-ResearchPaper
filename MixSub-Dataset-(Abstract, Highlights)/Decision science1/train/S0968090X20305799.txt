 Dedicated Lanes have been proposed as a potential scenario for the deployment of Automated and or Connected Vehicles on the road network . However evidence based knowledge regarding the impacts of different design configurations utilization policies and the design of their access egress on traffic safety and efficiency is limited . In order to develop an adequate design for DLs first a conceptual framework describing the relations and interrelations between these factors and traffic safety and efficiency is needed . Therefore the main aim of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework accounting for the factors that could affect the safety and efficiency of DLs . This conceptual framework is underpinned based on relevant literature on how the deployment of C AVs driver behaviour and DL design and operation affect traffic safety and efficiency . Based on the conceptual framework the knowledge gaps on DL design for C AVs were identified and a research agenda including prioritization of the research needs is proposed .

@highlight A conceptual framework for dedicated lane design for automated vehicles is presented.
@highlight The conceptual framework is underpinned based on examples of relevant literature.
@highlight The knowledge gaps were identified and a research agenda is proposed.
@highlight Future research should take into account the driver behaviour in designing DLs.
