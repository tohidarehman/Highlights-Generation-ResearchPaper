 The rapid proliferation of smart personal technologies has given birth to smart Transportation Demand Management systems that can give personalized incentives to users . This personalization capacity builds on accurate modeling of user behaviors however in practice a users behavior data is often limited and his preferences in the discrete choice making process may change or evolve . In this paper we propose a new online updating model that can accurately and efficiently estimate an individuals preferences from his discrete choices . Our model is built on the concept of canonical structure where a set of canonical models are identified as the common preference patterns shared by the whole population and a membership vector is also identified for each individual to capture the degrees of the resemblance of his preferences to those common preference patterns . To allow preference to vary in the choice making process a time varying model can be integrated with the canonical structure . In the current study we use a simple cubic polynomial model with a single variant and show the detailed formulation of the integrated model . An online updating strategy is also proposed such that it is possible to update the parameters partially in practice . The proposed model is suitable for modeling a heterogeneous population with insufficient data from each individual . Both simulation studies and a real world application are taken in the current study . The results show that comparing with other frequently used models the model we proposed has the highest accuracy in preference learning and behavior prediction .

@highlight We develop a model to learn an individuals preference in sequential choices.
@highlight The proposed approach is able to capture preference changes.
@highlight The proposed approach permits learning from limited data.
@highlight An online updating strategy is proposed to effectively update the estimates.
