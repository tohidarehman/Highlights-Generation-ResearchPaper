 This paper addresses an integrated relief network design problem for pharmaceutical items . The proposed bi objective model accounts for perishability of pharmaceutical items mobility of relief facilities and benefits from a cooperative coverage mechanism in designing the network . A minmax robust model is developed to tackle the demand uncertainty . Several numerical experiments are conducted to explore the performance of the robust model . Also by conducting a real case study useful managerial insights are derived through performing several sensitivity analyses . The numerical results reveal that using the minmax robust model enhances the pharmaceutical relief networks effectiveness and efficiency considerably .
