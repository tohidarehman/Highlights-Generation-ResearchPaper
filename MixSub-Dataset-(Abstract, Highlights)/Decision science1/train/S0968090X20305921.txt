 This study examines the effects of a time varying congestion toll and a location dependent parking fee on the behavior of heterogeneous commuters and their commuting costs . To this end we develop a model of departure time and parking location choices by heterogeneous commuters and characterize its equilibrium . By comparing the equilibrium with and without pricing policies we obtain the following results imposing a parking fee and expanding parking capacity may concentrate the temporal distribution of traffic demand thereby exacerbating traffic congestion the expansion of parking capacity does not necessarily lead to a Pareto improvement when a parking fee is not imposed the social optimum is achieved by combining a parking fee with a congestion toll and the revenue obtained from pricing of roads and parking exactly equals the costs for optimal bottleneck and parking capacities respectively that is the self financing principle holds separately for bottleneck capacity and parking capacity .
