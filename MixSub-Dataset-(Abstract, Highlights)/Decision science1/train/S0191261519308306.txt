 Rapid growth fierce competition and repeated failures of bike sharing companies in the market highlight urgent needs for a systematic modeling framework to analyze optimal investment and management strategies of bike sharing companies under competition . The share of bike sharing market depends on how the competing companies deploy their bikes over time and space since travelers typically choose the nearest available bikes . Hence each individual company aims to maximize its profit through optimal investment and allocation rebalancing strategies in response to time varying demand as well as actions of the peer companies . In this paper we propose a game theoretical framework to model the competition between two bike sharing companies and a two stage multi period stochastic program is developed to model the decision process of each company . The effects of demand elasticity and uncertainty are also discussed . We then show existence of Nash equilibrium and insights into the solution for several special cases . For general cases an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the Nash equilibrium . Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model and to draw insights on the impacts of market competition .
