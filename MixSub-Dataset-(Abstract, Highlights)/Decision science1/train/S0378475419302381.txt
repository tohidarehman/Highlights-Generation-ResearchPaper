 In this study we extend our earlier work presented in the 22nd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation and propose a simple parametric pre factor the biodegradation potential

@highlight A pre factor
@highlight is proposed to describe contaminant biodegradation potential.
@highlight Specific biomass affinity
@highlight inversely correlates to contaminant half time.
@highlight approximates well the steady state contaminant biodegraded fractions.
