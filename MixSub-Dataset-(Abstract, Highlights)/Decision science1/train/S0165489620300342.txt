 Under spatial product differentiation and product design we identify conditions for either excessive or insufficient firm entry . We extend previous settings based on the Salop circular model to analyze the combined role of positive demand elasticity and endogenous targeted product design . First we show that given the number of firms the equilibrium level of targeted design is either excessive or insufficient depending on demand elasticity . Second with free entry we show that the degree of targeted product design increases with the relative market size and decreases with demand elasticity . Based on these effects the interplay between demand elasticity and market size yields novel welfare results . In particular we show that excessive entry always occurs for small demand elasticities but for large demand elasticities market size matters entry is insufficient in small and large market sizes but it is excessive in intermediate market sizes .

@highlight Targeted design and demand elasticity are considered in the Salop circular model.
@highlight Novel results arise on the issue of the excessive versus insufficient entry in spatial models.
@highlight Entry is always excessive with small demand elasticities.
@highlight With large demand elasticities entry is excessive for intermediate market sizes.
