 This paper investigates green credit manufacture subsidy and sales subsidy modes in a supply chain with a capital constrained green manufacturer and attempts to find the win win subsidy mode . We show that when the bank loan is infinite and the total subsidies of different modes are equal GC can bring the highest returns with respect to green degree market demand social welfare and environmental benefit . However under the finite loan scenario GC is the optimal choice for the government only when the credit line of the manufacturer is relatively high otherwise MS is the optimal subsidy mode .
