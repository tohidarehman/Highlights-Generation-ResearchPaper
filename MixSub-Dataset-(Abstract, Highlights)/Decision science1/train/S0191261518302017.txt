 We concern the modal choice of commuters in a transport system comprising a highway which is only used by autos in parallel to a transit line which is only used by buses . In the transport system the in vehicle congestion of passengers in bus carriages is treated as a negative externality cost of affecting the modal choice of commuters and commuters choose their travel modes according to the perceived travel costs of transport modes . We propose two trial and error operation schemes for the transport system without resorting to both the function of in vehicle congestion costs and the distribution of perceived travel cost errors . In the first operation scheme the manager determines the transit fare charged from bus users from period to period so as to minimize the system time cost of the transport system . The second operation scheme is established from the viewpoint of a private firm that operates the public transit line . The operator determines the transit fare and bus run frequency from period to period in order to maximize its operating profit . Moreover we demonstrate the effectiveness of the two operation schemes for optimizing the system time cost and the operating profit by both theoretical analyses and numerical examples .

@highlight This paper introduces an operating problem in a bimodal transport system.
@highlight In vehicle congestion cost functions are assumed to be unknown.
@highlight The distribution of perceived travel cost errors is also assumed to be unknown.
@highlight The paper proposes two convergent trial and error operation schemes for the problem.
@highlight The first scheme determines bus fares to minimize total system cost.
@highlight The second one determines both the bus fares and frequencies to maximize the operating profit.
