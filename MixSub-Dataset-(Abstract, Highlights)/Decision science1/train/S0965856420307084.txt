 E shopping for intangible services refers to searching and paying for services online but it requires e shoppers to travel to use these services . In theory e shoppers search space via the internet is less constrained by spatial attributes . As a result spatial attributes may barely affect the distance and duration of trips resulting from e shopping for intangible services . The present study used data from 714 valid face to face interviews in Beijing China to verify this hypothesis . The results showed that e shoppers were likely to travel farther after purchasing intangible services online . The effect of spatial attributes on the distance of a single trip was largely attenuated due to online purchases of these services and the effect on the duration was correspondingly weaker to a limited extent . Therefore spatial interventions aiming to moderate travel distances and durations may not be as effective in the age of online shopping .

@highlight E shopping for intangible services is likely a challenge for the transportation system.
@highlight The effect of spatial attributes on travel distance and duration is attenuated by online shopping.
@highlight Spatial interventions aiming to moderate travel distances and durations may not be as effective as before.
