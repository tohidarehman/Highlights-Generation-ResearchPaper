 The fundamental challenge of the origin destination matrix estimation problem is that it is severely under determined . In this paper we propose a new data driven OD estimation method for cases where a supply pattern in the form of speeds and flows is available . We show that with these input data we do not require an iterative dynamic network loading procedure that results in an equilibrium assignment nor do we need an assumption on the kind of equilibrium that emerges from this process . The minimal number of ingredients which
