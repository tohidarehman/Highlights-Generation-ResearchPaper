 Ramp metering is known to be an effective freeway control measure that ensures the overall efficiency and safety of a highway system by regulating the inflow traffic on ramps . Therefore agencies are required to frequently assess the performance of their ramp meters . However one major challenge for the agencies conducting ramp metering performance assessments is the lack of knowledge about data requirements . Data requirements consist of the information regarding the duration of data collection for accommodation time and for the evaluation time . In this paper a non parametric statistic approach is proposed that is robust to the underlying distribution of the random variable . Meaning that the accuracy of the model is insensitive to the data distribution . For validation purposes three active ramps along State Route 51 in the Phoenix Metropolitan area Arizona are selected as the case study . ADOT altered their ramp control strategy from fixed time to responsive control and is attempting to know the extent of data required for assessing its new ramp metering strategy . For this particular case study the results suggest that two months worth of data is the minimum data sufficient for a ramp metering assessment . The proposed assessment approach can be transferred to other ramp metering applications to help traffic engineers efficiently tune up ramp metering strategies .

@highlight Examine how much data is enough for before and after studies.
@highlight Proposed a non parametric statistic approach for ramp metering evaluation procedure.
@highlight Two month is the minimum data collection period for robust ramp metering evaluation.
@highlight Proposed a methodology that only considers a few assumptions.
