 Many studies about conducting activities while traveling start from the hypothesis that conducting onboard activities reduces the value of time . However surprisingly limited empirical evidence is provided for this hypothesis . The few studies that aim at providing this evidence face methodological problems in the sense that effects attributed to conducting onboard activities are confounded with differences between groups . This paper further develops and applies a solution for this problem proposed by

@highlight Evidence found for hypothesis that conducting onboard activities decreases VoT.
@highlight Conducting activities while traveling reduces VoT of commuters by 30 .
@highlight VoT reductions can be regarded as the monetary Value of Activities.
@highlight Within subjects experiments are essential to study impact activity context on VoT.
