 This study investigates a joint optimisation of routing and truck deployment for a small package shipping company . Bus tour based services are provided to collect express packages at customer bases . The objective of the optimisation problem is to minimise the average waiting time for packages stored at the customer bases . We first propose a mixed integer nonlinear programming model . The proposed formulation is linearised and made solvable by an off the shelf mixed integer linear programming solver . For solving larger instances of the problem we propose two optimisation approaches that can obtain near optimal solutions a local branching based method and a particle swarm optimisation based method . We conduct numerical experiments to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution methods . The results indicate that both methods can obtain optimal solutions quickly for most of the small scale instances . For medium size instances the local branching based method performs best and the PSO based method outperforms the others for large size instances .
