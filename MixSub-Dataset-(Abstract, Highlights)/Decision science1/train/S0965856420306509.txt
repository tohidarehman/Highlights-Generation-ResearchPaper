 Drawing upon Flyvbjerg s insight that planning is defined more by the political than the rational we examine the experience of parking reform as attempted by municipal officials in Vancouver British Columbia . The literature offers a broad consensus that minimum parking requirements represent a misguided and inefficient policy producing excess parking in the wrong places and reduced housing affordability . Yet minimum parking requirements remain a near universal fixture in municipal regulations . We examine the stubborn disconnect between Vancouvers parking standards and its strategic policies . Rather than reiterating normative debates we consider how ideas and institutions could shape officials hesitation in reform . We reveal the compromise that ensues under planning s duality of designing credible forward looking strategy while managing the political constraints created by policy path dependence . We find that Vancouvers laneway housing parking requirement represents a typology that could propagate across North America a transitional parking requirement of political compromise which we suggest has the potential to produce a workable reconciliation of theory and practice .
