 Parking pricing is considered a powerful tool for improving parking management and relieving traffic congestion in metropolitan areas . This study uses field collected panel data over four time periods before and after the implementation of a new parking pricing policy in Nanning to investigate the time varying effect of pricing on on street parking characteristics including parking duration and parking turnover . Results show that parking duration decreases as parking price increases with the relationship presenting a growing elasticity . The elasticity of parking turnover fluctuates due perhaps to the influence of vehicle ownership . KolmogorovSmirnov tests show that on street parking characteristics differ significantly before and after the implementation of a new parking pricing structure . Strategies that can improve parking services are also investigated based on the empirical data and modeling results .
