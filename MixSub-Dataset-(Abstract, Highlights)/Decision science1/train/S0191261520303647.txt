 This paper studies the effects of cooperation in a hub and spoke network with high speed rail and airline competition . The distinctive elements of our analysis are the consideration of per passenger airport and rail infrastructure fees mixed bundling pricing by partners and an airline duopoly in the international market . We show that partners fix the cheapest bundle price of the combined trip that non allied operators respond by decreasing the prices per link and that connecting traffic increases . Per passenger fees significantly affect the price differences following cooperation . An empirical application confirms that it is privately profitable and that welfare gains are in the range of 0.82.2 these can be higher for lower fees or lower cross price elasticity between modes .

@highlight Effects of rail air and air air cooperation on bundle and per link prices are studied.
@highlight Cooperation is beneficial to connecting passengers but detrimental for local ones.
@highlight Operators form a rail air agreement at the expense of passenger surplus decreases.
@highlight Air air cooperation provides total welfare levels higher than rail air cooperation.
