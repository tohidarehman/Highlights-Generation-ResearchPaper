 With the significant improvements in drone technology and the popularization of drones among their hobbyists the incidents of drones intruding airports have resulted in a large number of flight delays and temporary closure of runways . To minimize the interference of drones on normal operations in the airports a collision probability evaluation scheme based on collision course trajectories modeling is proposed in this work . Firstly a trajectory planning model of drones intruding restricted airspace is derived based on a given trajectory of the commercial aircraft and the collision course scenario of the drone . Subsequently according to the trajectories of the drone and CA a probabilistic model based on the stochastic kinematic model is developed to implement the collision risk evaluation . The proposed method is first comparatively demonstrated with the Monte Carlo simulation and several special cases with known drones trajectories . Subsequently the cases covering different drones initial positions positions updates and different collision zones are simulated and analyzed using the proposed collision course based model . The simulation results show that the established model can be employed to evaluate the collision probability even if the trajectory information of the intruding drone is limited .

@highlight The intruding drone trajectory is developed based on the collision course assumption.
@highlight The relative position prediction model is introduced by considering uncertainties.
@highlight Model validation by Monte Carlo simulation and in several cases.
@highlight Parametric test results demonstrate the sensitivity and adaptability of the model.
