 Over the last decades technological advances have allowed the capturing of travel behaviour at large scale . Despite the unprecedented volume and the variety of personal mobility data aggregate Origin Destination matrices are still the most widespread means to organise and represent travel demand . Nonetheless standard ODs can not adequately capture significant elements affecting travel behaviour such as trip interdependency and trip chaining therefore they are not particularly suitable for travel behaviour analysis at person level . The currently presented modelling framework enables the in depth study of personal mobility by firstly combining the trips present in OD matrices into home based trip chains and subsequently into sequences of activities . The above mentioned process is completed based on advanced graph theoretical and combinatorial optimisation concepts . The applicability of the methodology is meticulously verified through a large scale test case where a set of multi period purpose dependant ODs is converted into realistic activity schedules able to incorporate more than 99 of the inputted travel demand . The accurate and highly detailed results showcase the significant potential of the proposed methodology to support the comprehensive analysis of travel behaviour at person level .
