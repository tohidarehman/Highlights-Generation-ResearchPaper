 This paper provides a characterization of the families of uniquely topped total preorders on a finite set which are single peaked with respect to some tree shaped spectrum .

@highlight A recent characterization of tree betweenness and
@highlight An adapted Make Tree algorithm
@highlight Are deployed and combined to produce
@highlight A characterization of the domains of topped total preorders on a finite set which are single peaked with respect to some tree shaped spectrum.
