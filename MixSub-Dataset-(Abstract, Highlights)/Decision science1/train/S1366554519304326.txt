 Delivering commodities by ground vehicles to people in conflict zones risks the safety of humanitarian aid workers . Hundreds of aid workers are killed injured or kidnapped when delivering supplies on the road each year . We propose the humanitarian flying warehouse as a solution to these issues . The HFW is an airship that stays at high altitudes and uses unmanned aerial vehicles to deliver supplies . This innovation will enable safe and timely delivery to hard to reach populations in a manner that significantly exceeds the capacity of current practices . Crucially the HFW eliminates the motivations behind many delivery disruptions . These disruptions are caused by asymmetric commons dilemmas entities with different accessibility and power race to grab shared relief goods before others . The problem we address is the operation of HFW to make safe and timely delivery of critical items such as health supplies to the hard to reach populations . This study constitutes proof of concept for the HFW system in conflict zones through a multi objective mathematical model . The validity of the system is verified via comparative analysis with a ground based system in a realistic case study .
