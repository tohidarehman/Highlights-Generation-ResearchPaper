 The paper proposes a methodology for providing personalized predictive in vehicle crowding information to public transport travellers via mobile applications or at stop displays . Three crowding metrics are considered the probability of getting a seat on boarding the expected travel time standing and the excess perceived travel time compared to uncrowded conditions . The methodology combines prediction models of passenger loads and alighting counts based on lasso regularized regression and multivariate PLS regression a probabilistic seat allocation model and a bias correction step in order to predict the crowding metrics . Depending on data availability the prediction method can use a combination of historical passenger counts real time vehicle locations and real time passenger counts . We evaluate the prediction methodology in a real world case study for a bus line in Stockholm Sweden . The results indicate that personalized predictive crowding information that is robust to varying data availability can be provided sufficiently early to be useful to travellers . The methodology is of value for agencies and operators in order to increase the attractiveness and capacity utilization of public transport .

@highlight Personalized crowding metrics show different spatial patterns from passenger loads.
@highlight Predictive crowding information is robust to varying data availability.
@highlight Systematic historical load variations are useful to provide baseline predictions.
@highlight When available real time APC predictors always improve prediction performance.
@highlight Real time AVL can substantially improve predictions even without real time APC.
