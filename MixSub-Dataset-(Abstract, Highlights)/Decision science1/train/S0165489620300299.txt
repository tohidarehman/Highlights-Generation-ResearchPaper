 The OECDs recommendation that transfer prices between multinational enterprises and their subsidiaries be consistent with the Arms Length Principle for tax purposes does not restrict internal pricing policies . However we show that under imperfect competition firms may choose to keep one set of books as a way of softening competition in the external market . As a result firms profits are greater and the surplus is smaller than under vertical integration . In contrast when firms keep two sets of books competition intensifies in both markets relative to vertical integration .

@highlight Assume that transfer prices must conform the Arms Length Principle for tax purposes.
@highlight We study accounting policies under imperfect competition and vertical separation.
@highlight Under some conditions multinational firms keep one set of books.
@highlight When firms keep one set of books competition softens and welfare deteriorates.
