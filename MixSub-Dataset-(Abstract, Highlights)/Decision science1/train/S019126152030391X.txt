 Route choice is often modelled as a two step procedure in which travellers choose their routes from small sets of promising candidates . Many methods developed to identify such choice sets rely on assumptions about the mechanisms behind the route choice and require corresponding data sets . Furthermore existing approaches often involve considerable complexity or perform many repeated shortest path queries . This makes it difficult to apply these methods in comprehensive models with numerous origin destination pairs . In this paper we address these issues by developing an algorithm that efficiently identifies locally optimal routes . Such paths arise from travellers acting rationally on local scales whereas unknown factors may affect the routes on larger scales . Though methods identifying locally optimal routes are available already these algorithms rely on approximations and return only few heuristically chosen paths for specific origin destination pairs . This conflicts with the demands of route choice models where an exhaustive search for many origins and destinations would be necessary . We therefore extend existing algorithms to return all admissible paths between a large number of origin destination pairs . We test our algorithm and its applicability in route choice models on the road network of the Canadian province British Columbia and empirical data collected in this province .
