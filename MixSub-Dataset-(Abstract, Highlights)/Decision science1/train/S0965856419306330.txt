 Riversea intermodal transport is becoming increasingly popular for container repositioning in hinterland areas owing to its cost efficiency and low energy consumption . However bridge heights and water depths may restrict the sailing of container vessels on rivers which presents a challenge for the wider implementation of riversea intermodal transport . In this study we investigate the potential of foldable containers to improve empty container repositioning in riversea intermodal transport with consideration of bridge height and water depth constraints . A mathematical model is developed to minimize the total cost . Numerical experiments based on near practical instances on the Yangtze River in China are conducted to test the effectiveness of the model and the efficiency of foldable containers . The results show that introducing foldable containers into empty container repositioning along a river can utilize vessel space more effectively and decrease the total cost for container shipping companies . The joint impacts of bridge heights and foldable containers on the overall performance are analyzed to obtain managerial insights . Finally policies are suggested to facilitate the implementation of foldable containers for riversea intermodal transport .
