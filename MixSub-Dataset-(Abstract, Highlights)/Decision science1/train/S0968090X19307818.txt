 The development of technologies related to connected and automated vehicles allows for a new approach to collect vehicle trajectory . However trajectory data collected in this way represent only sampled traffic flow owing to low penetration rates of CAVs and privacy concerns and fail to provide a comprehensive picture of traffic flow . This study proposes a method to reconstruct vehicle trajectories in fully sampled traffic flow on freeways that consists of human driven vehicles and CAVs by using the mobile sensing data acquired from CAVs . The expected behavior of vehicles within the detection range of CAVs is determined based on the driving state classified by the Wiedemann model i.e . free driving emergency closing and following . If the actual behavior is different from the expected it is deemed to be influenced by the undetected HVs . Then new HVs are inserted based on the estimated local traffic density and speed of the freeway . The trajectories of the inserted HVs are further reconstructed by using the established update rules of cellular automation i.e . uniform motion acceleration deceleration randomization and position update . Last the proposed method was examined by simulation experiments under different traffic densities and PRs of CAVs . The results show that the trajectories of fully sampled mixed traffic flow can be reconstructed reasonably well not only under traffic conditions without explicit congestion but in congested environments .
