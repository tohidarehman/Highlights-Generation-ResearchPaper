 To tackle the logistics challenges faced by enterprises using unmanned aerial vehicles with human driven vans for parcel deliveries we introduce the two echelon vehicle routing problem with time windows and mobile satellites which when solved optimizes delivery routes for a fleet of van UAV combinations . Typically one van carries several UAVs . The first echelon involves time window driven parcel deliveries using vans from a distribution center to customers . The second echelon involves UAVs being dispatched from mobile satellite vans to serve customers with time windows and directly delivering parcels from the DC . When the first echelon vehicles park at customer locations and wait for second echelon vehicle departures and returns the first echelon vehicles are used as mobile satellites . We develop a vehicle flow formulation in which the mobile satellite synchronization constraints are included to ensure the echelon interaction . We provide an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic . Computational experiments evaluate the validity of the 2E VRP TM formulation and the effectiveness of the heuristic .
