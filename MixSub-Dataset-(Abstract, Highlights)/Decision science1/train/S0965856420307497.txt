 We explored the structure of public attitudes on whether self driving vehicles should be allowed on public roads through a four way typology of attitudes . We segmented participants based on a single item according to which participants allocated themselves to one of the four attitudinal groups and characterized the demographic and psychological profiles of the four groups in a paper and pencil survey in Tianjin China

@highlight We surveyed positive negative ambivalent and indifferent attitudes to whether SDVs are allowed on roads.
@highlight Nearly half of the participants were in the ambivalent group followed by the positive group.
@highlight Perceived benefit and risk ambivalence and interest in SDVs were not sufficient to describe the differences between the four groups.
@highlight The four groups clearly differed on behavioral intention and willingness to pay.
