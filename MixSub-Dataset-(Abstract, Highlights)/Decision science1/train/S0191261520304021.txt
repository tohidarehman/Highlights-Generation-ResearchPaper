 We consider a service network design problem for the tactical planning of parcel delivery in a city logistics setting . A logistics service provider seeks a repeatable plan to transport commodities from distribution centers on the periphery to inner city satellites . In a heterogeneous infrastructure autonomous vehicles in level 4 may only drive in feasible streets but need to be pulled elsewhere by manually operated vehicles in platoons . We formulate an integer program to determine the fleet mix schedule transportation services and decide on the routing or outsourcing of commodities . Platooning requires a high level of synchronization between vehicles which demands the time expanded networks to contain narrow time intervals . Thus we develop an algorithm based on the dynamic discretization discovery scheme which refines partially time expanded networks iteratively without having to enumerate the fully time expanded network a priori . We introduce valid inequalities and provide two enhanced versions of the algorithm that exploit linear relaxations of the problem . Further we propose heuristic ideas to speed up the search for high quality solutions . In a computational study we analyze the efficacy of the algorithm in different versions and observe improvements of computational performance in comparison to a commercial solver . Finally we solve a case study on a real world based network to obtain insights into the deployment of a mixed autonomous fleet in an existing heterogeneous infrastructure .
