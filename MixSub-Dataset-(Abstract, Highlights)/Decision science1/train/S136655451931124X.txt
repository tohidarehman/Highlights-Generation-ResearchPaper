 This paper investigates a barge evacuation planning problem that can arise during land reclamation projects . The problem was motivated by the issue faced in actual practice by the Hong Kong International Airport . In this problem a fleet of heterogeneous barges working at an offshore land reclamation site needs to be evacuated to coastal shelters prior to the arrival of a storm . Having no propulsion power of their own these barges must be towed by tug boats in order to be evacuated . The problem under consideration is very complicated since it involves a series of inter correlated assignment and scheduling decisions at different planning levels . To solve the problem this paper first formulates the problem as a nonlinear Mixed Integer Programming model . The model is then linearized . We further proved that the BEPP is NP hard in the strong sense . In view of the complexity of the problem a tailored heuristic method is proposed . Extensive numerical experiments and a case study are performed and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the solution method . Land reclamation projects have become increasingly popular in recent years and the proposed method is applicable to solving BEPPs arising in similar scenarios .
