 This study presents algorithms to determine the most reliable routes on stochastic and time dependent networks . The measure of reliability adopted is the probability of on time arrival at the destination given a threshold arrival time . We propose two distinct algorithms to determine optimal time adaptive strategy and optimal apriori path on stochastic and time dependent networks . First a decreasing order of time algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal strategy to the sink from all node and departure time combinations . Second a label correcting network pruning algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal path between the source and the sink for a given departure time . The correctness of both the proposed algorithms is proved and their computational complexity expressions are derived . The efficacy of the proposed procedures is demonstrated on large scale transportation networks . This work has the potential to facilitate wider application of stochastic and time dependent networks in reliability based modeling and analysis .
