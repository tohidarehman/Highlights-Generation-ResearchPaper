 Recently the employment of different types of incentives in transportation systems to form advanced transportation congestion management solutions has garnered significant attention . Instead of using presumed or fixed amount incentives this paper develops an integrated and personalized traveler information and incentive scheme to incentivize toward a more energy efficient travel and mobility decisions . We have developed a behavior research and empirical modeling system to quantify the personalized monetary incentives . Then it is integrated with a control optimizer for optimized incentive allocation . This scheme innovatively integrates behavioral modeling and optimization for travel incentive design . Through a demonstrative case study for a large scale transportation system in the Washington D.C. and Baltimore regions the capability of the proposed scheme is highlighted with significant system level energy savings reasonable insights on individual travel behavior responses as well as superior computational efficiency .
