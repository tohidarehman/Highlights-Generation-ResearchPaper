 Blockchain has the potential to render the transaction of information more secure and transparent . Nowadays transportation data are shared across multiple entities using heterogeneous mediums from paper collected data to smartphone . Most of this data are stored in central servers that are susceptible to hacks . In some cases shady actors who may have access to such sources share the mobility data with unwanted third parties . A multi layered Blockchain framework for Smart Mobility Data market is presented for addressing the associated privacy security management and scalability challenges . Each participant shares their encrypted data to the blockchain network and can transact information with other participants as long as both parties agree to the transaction rules issued by the owner of the data . Data ownership transparency auditability and access control are the core principles of the proposed blockchain for smart mobility data market . In a case study of real time mobility data sharing we demonstrate the performance of BSMD on a 370 nodes blockchain running on heterogeneous and geographically separated devices communicating on a physical network . We also demonstrate how BSMD ensures the cybersecurity and privacy of individual by safeguarding against spoofing and message interception attacks and providing information access management control .
