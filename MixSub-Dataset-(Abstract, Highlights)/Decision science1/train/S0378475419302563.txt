 Sight distance is a fundamental factor in the design of highways as it determines their operational and safety performance particularly in nighttime . Vehicles are increasingly being equipped with driving assistance systems such as adaptive frontlighting systems from which potential safety benefits can be derived . One of the main capabilities of adaptive headlights is controlling headlamp swiveling when driving on horizontal curves to light up a greater section of the roadway ahead . In this study the vehicle headlight beam was recreated to simulate swiveling systems that adapt the headlight beam to the highway geometry . Diverse horizontal spread angle values were assumed for the headlight lighting pattern . Based on horizontal curvature a total of 24 663 mathematical functions that control the headlight swiveling angle were simulated . Next headlight sight distance was estimated on a 3D virtual model of an in service highway under assumptions of fixed and swiveling headlamps . Two types of algorithms were proposed for the swiveling headlights one based on the trajectory curvature and another one predictive . The sets of HSD results were then analyzed and compared the effects of the swiveling headlights on HSD being quantified along the highway section studied . In addition the performance of diverse swiveling headlights was analyzed under different 3D highway alignment combinations . Finally the robustness of the proposed procedure was validated .
