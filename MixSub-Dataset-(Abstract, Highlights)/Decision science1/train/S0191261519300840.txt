 Train scheduling and maintenance planning compete for the resources in a railway network . A commonly used way is dealing with maintenance planning first and then train scheduling or vice versa . In this paper we propose a joint optimization model for the two problems in a railway network with double track where the upstream and downstream trains are independent and a maintenance task on a section can not be split or disrupted . In order to solve the model a heuristic algorithm using Lagrangian relaxation is developed . Due to the large number of constraints we use a dynamic constraint generation technique in the iterations of the sub gradient optimization procedure . We apply the model and algorithm to a practical problem in the Chinese railway network in which some additional trains are inserted into a fixed existing timetable and the maintenance plan on the involved high speed railway sections is adjusted . The computational results illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model and algorithm .
