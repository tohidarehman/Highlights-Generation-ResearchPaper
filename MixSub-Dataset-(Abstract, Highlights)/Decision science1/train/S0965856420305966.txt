 This paper assesses the ability of alternative fare system designs to change the modal share of public transport use as well as their corresponding impact on company revenues . Specifically we provide evidence for how switching from flat to distance fares or from integrated to non integrated tickets affects both the ridership and the financial situation of public transport companies . Secondly because distributional concerns are at the heart of the policy debate we evaluate the impact of the alternative fare schemes on equity . We distinguish between commuting and personal travel purposes . Focusing on the Metropolitan Region of Barcelona our analysis shows that different pricing structures have only a moderate effect on ridership while the potential for revenue changes is higher . Regarding equity our results reveal that the distributional profiles of alternative pricing strategies are quite homogeneous . However there appears to be a mild regressive effect when an integrated fare system is removed . Our results may help to guide policy decisions related to public transport pricing strategies .

@highlight Individuals are more sensitive to changes in quality than in prices.
@highlight Subsidies have a moderate progressive effect explained by the higher use of public transport by low income groups.
@highlight Changing the fare structure has a relatively small effect on modal split while the effect on revenue can be higher.
@highlight The distributional profiles of alternative pricing strategies are very similar.
@highlight Suppressing the integrated fare system has a regressive effect but of limited magnitude.
