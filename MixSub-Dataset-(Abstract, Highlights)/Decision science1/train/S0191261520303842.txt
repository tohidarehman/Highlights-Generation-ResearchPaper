 This paper explores the potential of a special instance of the Combination of Random Utility Models termed Combination of Nested Logit as kernel model in conjunction with several types of mixing distributions of tastes . Various model formulations are illustrated with their mathematical properties and several alternative kernel models are identified for comparison . An estimation exercise is presented on a real mode choice dataset from a stated preference survey on the intercity corridor between Naples and Milan in Italy . Results in terms of both in sample and out of sample goodness of fit on a 10 fold cross validation show that models with the proposed CoNL kernel outperform contrasted models .
