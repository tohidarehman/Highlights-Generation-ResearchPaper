 A dynamic ridesharing system is a platform that connects drivers who use their personal vehicles to travel with riders who are in need of transportation on a short notice . Since each driver rider may have several potential matches to achieve a high performance level the ridesharing operator needs to make the matching decisions based on a global view of the system that includes all active riders and drivers . Consequently the ride matching problem that needs to be solved can become computationally expensive especially when the system is operating over a large region or when it faces high demand levels during certain hours of the day . This paper develops a graph partitioning methodology based on the bipartite graph that arises in the one to one ride matching problem . The proposed method decomposes the original graph into multiple sub graphs with the goal of reducing the overall computational complexity of the problem as well as providing high quality solutions . We further show that this methodology can be extended to more complex ride matching problems in a dynamic ride sharing system . Using numerical experiments we showcase the advantages of the new partitioning method for different forms of ride matching problems . Moreover a sensitivity analysis is conducted to show the impact of different parameters on the quality of our solution .
