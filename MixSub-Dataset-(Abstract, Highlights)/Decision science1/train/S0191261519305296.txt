 Auctions are an important method for solving the logistics procurement problem in electronics markets . However current auction methods rarely consider the existence of quantity discounts . To fill this research gap we introduce quantity discounts into the procurement VickreyClarkGroves and truthful double auction mechanisms and apply them to the logistics services procurement market . For a market with only one customer we design a P VCG auction with quantity discounts and for a market with multiple customers we construct a model for maximizing social welfare and propose a trade reduction with a quantity discount double auction mechanisms . We prove that both auction mechanisms ensure incentive compatibility individual rationality balanced budget and asymptotical efficiency . Furthermore compared with traditional truthful double auctions the TR QD mechanism supports cooperative purchaseswhich allows more customers to enjoy discounts on large scale logistics servicesand bid time prioritywhich achieves the goal of meeting earlier requests earlier and improves auction efficiency . Numerical studies further show that the TR QD auction mechanism can achieve an increase in customers total value logistics companies total value social welfare and total trading volume .

@highlight We model the logistics service procurement auction problem with quantity discounts.
@highlight We design a procurement VCG mechanism with quantity discounts for the market with only one customer. We design a truthful double auction mechanism with quantity discounts and cooperative procurement for the market with multiple customers.
@highlight We introduce bid time priority to truthful double auction which achieves the goal of meeting earlier requests earlier and improves auction efficiency.
