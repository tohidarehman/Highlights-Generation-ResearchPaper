 Rapid urbanization and modern civilization require sound integration with public transportation systems . In the same time the volume and complexity of public transportation network are increasing making it harder to understand the public transportation dynamics . As a first step understanding the similarity among subway stations is imperative . In this paper we proposed a semantic framework inspired from natural language processing to interpret subway stations as compound words . Specifically we transplanted context and literal meaning of compound words into mobility and location attributes of stations . Using smart card data we trained stacked autoencoders with designed flow matrices as an embedding method to learn the mobility attributes . Subsequently to discover the location attributes we have applied affinity propagation clustering to classify 9 point of interest categories . Combined with urban planning knowledge we manage to comprehend the land use meanings of 9 POI clusters . The location semantics is chosen from those categories reflecting its urban land use pattern . By choose meaningful combination of mobility and location semantics for stations similarity case studies we summarized potential applications of this semantic framework .
