 This paper presents two algorithms to estimate traffic state in urban street networks with a mixed traffic stream of connected and unconnected vehicles and incorporates them in a real time and distributed traffic signal control methodology . The first algorithm integrates connected vehicles and loop detector data to estimate the trajectory of unconnected vehicles based on car following concepts . The second algorithm converts the temporal point vehicle detections to a spatial vehicle distribution on a link . The signal control methodology utilizes either algorithm to estimate traffic state on all network links at a time optimizes the signal timing parameters over a prediction period constituting several time steps implements the optimal decisions in the next time step and continues this process until the end of the study period . We applied the methodology to a real world case study network simulated in Vissim . The results show that both algorithms are effective under a wide range of CV market penetration rates in all tested demand patterns at 0 market penetration rate the proposed methodology reduced travel time by 2 to 10 and average delay by 7 to 20 compared to the existing signal timing parameters and traffic demand . At a 40 penetration rate the proposed algorithms reduced travel time by 27 to 33
