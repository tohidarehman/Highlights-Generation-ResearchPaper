 We consider a freight transportation network model in which we can send goods with or without bundling . When we choose the bundling option we can send multiple goods after grouping into a bundle at the cost of one unit good however bundling and unbundling also incur costs . The model was originally developed to solve the problem of relocating empty containers in hinterland transportation but it also has an application in multimodal freight transportation . We investigate the complexity of the problem and develop an efficient heuristic that uses a network flow algorithm .

@highlight Analyze the computational complexity of the FTNPB on an arbitrary network.
@highlight Develop an efficient heuristic for solving the FTNPB on an arbitrary network.
@highlight Carry out intensive computing experiments to test our heuristic.
@highlight Extend the model to the case where arbitrary number of flows can be bundled up to a given limit.
