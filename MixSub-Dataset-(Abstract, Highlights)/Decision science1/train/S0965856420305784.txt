We employ segmented multiple regression on timeseries data to show that there was a statistically significant increase in motorcycle ownership in Dhaka as a result of the motorcycle hailing services . The findings were also supported by a visual intervention analysis . By the end of 2018 there were 7.45 more motorcycles in Dhaka than there would have been if these app based e hailing services were not available .
