 Origin Destination matrix is a tableau of travel demand distributed between different zonal pairs . Essentially OD matrix provides two types of information the individual cell value represents travel demand between a specific OD pair and group of OD pairs provides insights into structural information in terms of distribution pattern of OD flows . Comparison of OD matrices should account both types of information . Limited studies in the past developed structural similarity measures and most studies still depend on traditional measures for OD matrices comparison . Traditional performance measures are based on cell by cell comparison and often neglect OD matrix structural information within their formulations .

@highlight OD matrix structure is defined as its skeletal framework.
@highlight The OD flows corresponding to the skeleton is termed as mass.
@highlight A holistic comparison of OD matrices should include its structure and mass.
@highlight Normalised Levenshtein distance for OD matrices NLOD is proposed for the structural comparison.
@highlight NLOD satisfies the mathematical properties of a distance measure.
