 The formation of barge networks on rivers and associated inland port systems is subject to a complex set of influencing factors and mechanisms . This paper aims to present a comprehensive comparative empirical analysis focusing on the container shipping network in the Yangtze and the Rhine . This analysis is supported by extensive datasets on both river basins incorporates the latest development on both rivers and is grounded on concepts and methods coming from transport geography and economic geography . We find that a large diversity might exist in how inland port systems and related gateway seaports are dealing with cargo flows and supply chains . In view of explaining this diversity we make a distinction between geographical nautical aspects macro economic factors and institutional governance factors . In particular we discuss the role of institutional and governance factors in barge network development by using the concepts of selection retention and variation .
