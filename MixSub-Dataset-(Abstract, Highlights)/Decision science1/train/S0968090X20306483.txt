 Recent research on airport ground movement introduced an Active Routing framework to support multi objective trajectory based operations . This results in edges in the airport taxiway graph having multiple costs such as taxi time fuel consumption and emissions . In such a graph multiple edges exist between two nodes reflecting different trade offs among the multiple costs . Aircraft will have to choose the most efficient edge from multiple edges in order to traverse from one node to another respecting various operational constraints . In this paper we introduce a multi objective routing and scheduling algorithm based on the enumerative approach that can be used to solve such a multi objective multi graph problem . Results using the proposed algorithm for a range of international airports are presented . Compared with other routing and scheduling algorithms the proposed algorithm can find a representative set of optimal or near optimal solutions in a single run when the sequence of aircraft is fixed . In order to accelerate the search heuristic functions and a preference based approach are introduced . We analyse the performance of different approaches and discuss how the structure of the multi graph affects computational complexity and quality of solutions .
