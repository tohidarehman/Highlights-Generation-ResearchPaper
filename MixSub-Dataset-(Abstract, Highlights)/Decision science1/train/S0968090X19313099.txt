 In conditionally automated driving drivers have difficulty in takeover transitions as they become increasingly decoupled from the operational level of driving . Factors influencing takeover performance such as takeover lead time and the engagement of non driving related tasks have been studied in the past . However despite the important role emotions play in human machine interaction and in manual driving little is known about how emotions influence drivers takeover performance . This study therefore examined the effects of emotional valence and arousal on drivers takeover timeliness and quality in conditionally automated driving . We conducted a driving simulation experiment with 32 participants . Movie clips were played for emotion induction . Participants with different levels of emotional valence and arousal were required to take over control from automated driving and their takeover time and quality were analyzed . Results indicate that positive valence led to better takeover quality in the form of a smaller maximum resulting acceleration and a smaller maximum resulting jerk . However high arousal did not yield an advantage in takeover time . This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating how emotional valence and arousal affect takeover performance . The benefits of positive emotions carry over from manual driving to conditionally automated driving while the benefits of arousal do not .

@highlight Positive valence leads to better takeover quality.
@highlight High arousal does not result in faster takeover time.
@highlight We cannot simply apply the findings in manual driving to automated driving.
