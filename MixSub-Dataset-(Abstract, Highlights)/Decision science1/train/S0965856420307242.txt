 Attitudes towards travel mode choice have been regarded as bi polar evaluations of travel options that remain stable across time and context . Intra personal attitudes can be variable becoming more or less salient and changing in strength or valence across decisional contexts . This study draws on theoretical underpinnings of attitudinal ambivalence which proposes that a person can hold two dimensional evaluations about one attitude object simultaneously . The present research aimed to explore attitudinal ambivalence in relation to travel modes and examine the variability of attitudes in different contexts . Thirty semi structured interviews explored above average mileage car users and non car users experiences of attitudinal ambivalence in relation to various transport modes and under which circumstances . Thematic analysis found support for attitudinal ambivalence and context dependent attitude variability in relation to travel mode evaluations . Discussions of an a priori questionnaire confirmed the malleability of transport relevant attitudes . Transport relevant attitudes are complex and ambivalent . Attitudinal ambivalence and context dependent attitude variability has implications for transport research design interventions targeting travel related attitudes and policies aimed to reduce single occupancy driving .

@highlight Semi structured in depth interviews explored attitudinal complexity of above average mileage car users and non car users.
@highlight Thematic analysis revealed attitudinal ambivalence and context dependent variability of transport relevant evaluations.
@highlight Identified specific situations in which ambivalence is salient.
@highlight Highlighted the complexity of aspects of transport convenience and inconvenience.
@highlight Findings suggest that specific survey questions may be prone to ambiguity.
