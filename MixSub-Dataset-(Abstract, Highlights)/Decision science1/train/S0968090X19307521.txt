 The ability to obtain accurate estimates of city wide urban traffic patterns is essential for the development of effective intelligent transportation systems and the efficient operation of smart mobility platforms . This paper focuses on the network wide traffic speed estimation using trajectory data generated by a city wide fleet of ride sourcing vehicles equipped with GPS capable smartphones . A cell based map matching technique is proposed to link vehicle trajectories with road geometries and to produce network wide spatio temporal speed matrices . Data limitations are addressed using the Schatten

@highlight Address efficient map matching of large scale GPS traces massive ride sourcing GPS traces.
@highlight Adopt Schatten p norm matrix completion algorithm to estimate missing traffic information at the urban network level.
@highlight Estimate traffic speed based on recovered speed matrix on a real world large scale network.
@highlight Monitor and visualize traffic dynamics via stochastic congestion maps.
@highlight Has the potential to be applied in proactive congestion identification and mitigation strategies.
