 While collecting data for estimating discrete choice models researchers often encounter missing information in observations . In addition endogeneity can occur whenever the error term is not independent of the observed variables . Both problems result in inconsistent estimators of the model parameters . The problems of missing information and endogeneity may occur in the same variable in the data if e.g . partially missing price information is correlated with another omitted variable . Extant approaches to correct for endogeneity in discrete choice models such as the control function method do not address the problem when the error term is correlated with a variable having missing information . Likewise approaches to address missing information such as the multiple imputation method can not handle endogeneity problems . To address this challenge we propose a novel hybrid algorithm by combining the methods of multiple imputation and the control function . We validate the algorithm in a Monte Carlo experiment and apply it to real data of heavy commercial vehicle parking from Singapore . In this case study we were able to substantially correct for price endogeneity in the presence of missing price information .
