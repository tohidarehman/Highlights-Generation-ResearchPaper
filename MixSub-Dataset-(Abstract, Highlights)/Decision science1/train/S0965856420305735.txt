 High speed railways are expanding rapidly over the world providing fast convenient and comfortable transport . It is therefore important to ensure that people are not excluded from high speed railway use due to relatively high ticket prices . We aim to develop a railway timetable according to passenger requirements that explicitly considers social equity by applying variable ticket prices to trains . Specifically we want to optimize ticket prices for trains operating during off peak hours to improve accessibility for low income passengers to improve social justice . A mixed integer linear programming model is formulated to solve our problem . In this timetabling based model we not only minimize the total general travel cost from a passenger perspective but also ensure that the revenue of the train company is no less than a specified value and that social equity is maintained at a specific level . To do this we consider the social equity constraint and the minimum revenue requirement constraint in addition to the traditional passenger centric train timetabling related constraints . Finally we test our model on both a hypothetical high speed railway network and the GuangzhouNanning and GuangzhouGuilin high speed railway network in China . The results demonstrate that the proposed optimization framework can provide a convenient timetable for passengers adequate revenue for train companies and enhance social equity to meet government targets .
