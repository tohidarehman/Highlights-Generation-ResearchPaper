 Much of traffic flow theory and highway design is based upon the fundamental relationship FR between speed flow and density . Traditionally the FR is assumed to be a static curve over time and space . This paper presents new empirical findings that show the FR in one lane of a freeway can actually change shape in a rapid and systematic response to conditions in the adjacent lanes . This paper demonstrates the dependencies for a general purpose freeway lane that is operating in the congested regime . The drivers become more conservative in response to slower speeds in either adjacent lane conversely they become less conservative in response to higher speeds in either adjacent lane . It is also shown that as drivers become more conservative the signals and waves move upstream slower . So this inter lane dependency has a direct impact on how fast signals propagate through the traffic stream . For the study site the empirical relationship between the wave speed and relative speed is close to linear . This interdependence between lanes is an important factor that it is absent from most traffic flow and car following models . Given these findings the discussion explores hypothetical examples showing how the inter lane dependencies can give rise to mechanisms for waves in adjacent lanes to synchronize as well as a mechanism for a queue spreading from one lane to another without any lane change maneuvers . Finally this work closes with an exploration of the possible physiological mechanisms that might be occurring in the drivers .

@highlight This work shows that the fundamental relationship can rapidly change shape.
@highlight The rapid change is a systematic response to conditions in adjacent lanes.
@highlight Drivers adopt larger spacing when faced with high relative speed between lanes.
@highlight This adjacent lane dependency is absent from most micro and macro models.
@highlight The new found dynamics provide mechanisms to sustain synchronized flow.
