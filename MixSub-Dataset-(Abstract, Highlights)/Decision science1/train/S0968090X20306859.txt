 Transport demand is highly dependent on supply especially for shared transport services where availability is often limited . As observed demand can not be higher than available supply historical transport data typically represents a biased or

@highlight Observability of mobility demand is inherently limited by supply.
@highlight Censored regression applied to mobility demand to mitigate bias.
@highlight Censored Gaussian Process formulated for time varying censorship.
@highlight Experiments with synthetic and real world data demonstrate solution approach.
@highlight Benefit of preserving the censored information is measured.
