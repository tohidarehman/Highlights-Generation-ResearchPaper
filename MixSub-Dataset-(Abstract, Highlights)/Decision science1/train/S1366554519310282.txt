We find that a system with internal competition obtains greater total profits higher effective CSR investment levels lower sales prices and a larger market share through no collaboration or only CSR investment collaboration than a system without internal competition . Through introducing competition between retailers only CSR investment cooperation achieves the same effective CSR investment level and total profits as CSR investment and pricing joint cooperation . We give some managerial insights into strategies for regional collaboration .
