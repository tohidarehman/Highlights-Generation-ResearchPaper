 Urban ride hailing demand prediction is a long term but challenging task for online car hailing system decision taxi scheduling and intelligent transportation construction . Accurate urban ride hailing demand prediction can improve vehicle utilization and scheduling reduce waiting time and traffic congestion . Existing traffic flow prediction approaches mainly utilize region based situation awareness image or station based graph representation to capture traffic spatial dynamic while we observe that combination of situation awareness image and graph representation are also critical for accurate forecasting . In this paper we propose the Multiple Spatio Temporal Information Fusion Networks a novel deep learning approach to better fuse multiple situation awareness information and graphs representation . MSTIF Net model integrates structures of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks Variational Auto Encoders and Sequence to Sequence Learning model to obtain the joint latent representation of urban ride hailing situation that contain both Euclidean spatial features and non Euclidean structural features and capture the spatio temporal dynamics . We evaluate the proposed model on two real world large scale urban traffic datasets and the experimental studies demonstrate MSTIF Net has achieved superior performance of urban ride Hailing demand prediction compared with some traditional state of art baseline models .

@highlight To the best of our knowledge it is the first exploration to fuse graph level representation and pixel level representation to obtain superior joint representation in ride hailing demand prediction.
@highlight We transfer hybrid GCN model from station based scenes to grid based scenes by modeling adjacency matrices without any additional data.
@highlight We conduct extensive experiments on two real world datasets and our proposed approach has achieved superior performance compared with traditional methods.
