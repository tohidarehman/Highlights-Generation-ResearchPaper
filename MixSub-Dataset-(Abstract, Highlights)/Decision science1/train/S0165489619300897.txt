 I study the problem of allocating objects among agents without using money . Agents can receive several objects and have dichotomous preferences meaning that they either consider objects to be acceptable or not . In this set up the egalitarian solution is more appealing than the competitive equilibrium with equal incomes because it is Lorenz dominant unique in utilities and group strategy proof . Both solutions are disjoint .
