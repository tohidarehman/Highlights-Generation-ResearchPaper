 This study focuses on single variable optimization approaches which determine the holding time of a vehicle when it is ready to depart from a bus stop . Up to now single variable optimization methods resort to rule based control logics to equalize the inter departure headways or adhere to the target headway values . One of them is the two headway based control logic which determines the holding time of a bus based on its headway with its preceding and following bus without addressing other implications such as overcrowding . To rectify this we introduce a new model for the single variable bus holding problem that considers the passenger demand and vehicle capacity limits . Then we reformulate this problem to an easier to solve program with the use of slack variables and introduce an analytic solution that can determine the holding time of a vehicle at the respective bus stop . Our analytic solution does not add a computational burden to the two headway based control logic and can be applied in real time . The operational benefit of our bus holding approach compared to other analytic solutions that do not consider the vehicle capacity is investigated using actual data from bus line 302 in Singapore .

@highlight Analytic solution for the single variable bus holding problem considering capacity limits.
@highlight The holding time of a vehicle can be determined in real time.
@highlight Significant reduction of stranded passengers in the expense of a slight regularity deterioration.
@highlight The service regularity performance is relatively insensitive to demand variations.
