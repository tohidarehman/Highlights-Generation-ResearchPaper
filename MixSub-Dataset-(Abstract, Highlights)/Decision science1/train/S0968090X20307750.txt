 This paper proposes to enhance the current tromboning paradigm with a four dimensional trajectory negotiation and synchronization process with the aim to maximise the number of neutral Continuous descent operations achieved by the arriving traffic in terminal maneuvering areas . An optimal control problem has been formulated and solved in order to generate a set of candidate CDO trajectories per aircraft while a mixed integer linear programming model has been built in order to optimally assign routes of the arrival procedure and required times of arrival to the arriving traffic when still in cruise . The assessment has been performed for Frankfurt am Main airport by using arrival traffic gathered from historical data . Results show that after assigning an RTA and a route to every arriving aircraft it is possible to maximize the number of aircraft performing CDOs while ensuring a safe time separation throughout the arrival procedure . For low traffic scenarios the totality of traffic can be successfully scheduled while for high traffic scenarios this is not the case and not all aircraft can be scheduled if neutral CDOs are flown . However by assuming different arbitrarily defined arrival times to the TMA or by considering more additional shortcuts in the trombone procedure it is possible to increase the number of aircraft scheduled . Besides improving current operations in the short mid term the methodology presented in this paper could become a technical enabler towards a fully deployed trajectory based operations environment .

@highlight A technical enabler towards a fully deployed trajectory based operations environment.
@highlight Arrival traffic is sequenced with 4D closed loop instructions in a tromboning.
@highlight The amount of CDOs is maximized and delay is minimized.
@highlight TMA entry time distribution greatly affects the number of neutral CDOs that can be flown.
