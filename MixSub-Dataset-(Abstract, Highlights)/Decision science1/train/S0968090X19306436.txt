 Cities around the world are turning to non motorized transport alternatives to help solve congestion and pollution issues . This paradigm shift demands on new infrastructure that serves and boosts local cycling rates . This creates the need for novel data sources tools and methods that allow us to identify and prioritize locations where to intervene via properly planned cycling infrastructure . Here we define potential demand as the total trips of the population that could be supported by bicycle paths . To that end we use information from a phone based travel demand and the trip distance distribution from bike apps . Next we use percolation theory to prioritize paths with high potential demand that benefit overall connectivity if a bike path would be added . We use Bogot as a case study to demonstrate our methods . The result is a data science framework that informs interventions and improvements to an urban cycling infrastructure .
