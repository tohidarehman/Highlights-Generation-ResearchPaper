 Local and global economies are for many nations highly dependent on the import and export of goods . These goods are shipped through global intermodal freight land water transportation systems that rely on truck rail and maritime networks and their IM terminals . These terminals are crucial to creating and maintaining efficient international trade routes . This paper considers port reliability and resilience as well as the role of ports in supporting a larger resilient maritime system . Specifically stochastic bi level game theoretic optimization models for assessing and improving the resiliency and reliability of the global port network are presented . Proposed models are devised for a set of independent ports with interacting investment problems for competitive but potentially cooperative environments . Uncertainties in traversal times and port throughput capacities are accounted for by adopting a stochastic optimization method using expected or max min functions to simultaneously hedge against the consequences of multiple possible future port related disaster events . Alternative centralized but stochastic formulations are also provided . This stochastic co opetitive methodology and alternative centralized methods fill an important gap in the maritime resiliency literature .
