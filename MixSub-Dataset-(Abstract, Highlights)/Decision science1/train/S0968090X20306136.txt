 This study provides a new method for better incorporating human factors in modeling car following behavior . As the primary decision maker and vehicle operator human driver is the vital component of the driving process . During the driving process an external stimulus may trigger short term psychological changes and these changes are considered as the endogenous cause of many abnormal driving behaviors which often lead to unsafe traffic disturbances and even crashes . In this paper we investigate the intrinsic long term driving characteristics and its short term changes after driver experiences an external stimulus . A long and short term driving model is proposed to incorporate such changes into car following driving behavior modelling . The long term driving characteristics are extracted through a cluster analysis and the changes after an external stimulus are identified and measured as the indicator of the short term driving characteristics . NGSIM data are used to demonstrate the existence of LSTD characteristics and the soundness of the LSTD model . Two classical car following models are integrated with the LSTD model and the integrated models show a promising performance as the errors decrease by 36.7 and 35.7 respectively .

@highlight The LSTD model is proposed to describe long and short term driving characteristics.
@highlight The long term characteristics are classified into three types via cluster analysis.
@highlight The short term characteristics are identified and divided into two types.
@highlight The six types of LSTD characteristics are incorporated into IDM and Gipps model.
@highlight Significant improvement is demonstrated by incorporating LSTD into CF models.
