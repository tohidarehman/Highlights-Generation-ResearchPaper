 Efforts devoted to mitigate the effects of road traffic congestion have been conducted since 1970s . Nowadays there is a need for prominent solutions capable of mining information from messy and multidimensional road traffic data sets with few modeling constraints . In that sense we propose a unique and versatile model to address different major challenges of traffic forecasting in an unsupervised manner . We formulate the road traffic forecasting problem as a latent variable model assuming that traffic data is not generated randomly but from a latent space with fewer dimensions containing the underlying characteristics of traffic . We solve the problem by proposing a variational autoencoder model to learn how traffic data are generated and inferred while validating it against three different real world traffic data sets . Under this framework we propose an online unsupervised imputation method for unobserved traffic data with missing values . Additionally taking advantage of the low dimension latent space learned we compress the traffic data before applying a prediction model obtaining improvements in the forecasting accuracy . Finally given that the model not only learns useful forecasting features but also meaningful characteristics we explore the latent space as a tool for model and data selection and traffic anomaly detection from the point of view of traffic modelers .

@highlight We learn a subspace that contains the underlying characteristics of traffic data.
@highlight A generative model imputes missing values online and unsupervised.
@highlight It reduces data dimensions to improve the efficiency and accuracy of forecasting systems.
@highlight Using the subspace we perform model and data selection and anomaly detection.
