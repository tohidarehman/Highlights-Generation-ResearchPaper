 The tourism industry is rapidly growing and the massification of certain areas is jeopardising the environment . Certain roads in protected areas or near tourist attractions are experiencing an increase in traffic volumes leading to higher pollution and noise levels and greater discomfort in the travel experience . To recommend measures intended to ensure a sustainable tourism industry without compromising the environment it is necessary to obtain further knowledge regarding tourists travel behaviour as it may differ from that of other travellers i.e . tourists might choose a route based on variables other than time and cost such as landscape or tourist attractions .
