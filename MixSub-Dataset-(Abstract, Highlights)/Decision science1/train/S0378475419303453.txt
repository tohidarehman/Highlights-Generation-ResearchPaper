 Nonlocal reactiondiffusion model is an important area to study the dynamics of the individuals which compete for resources . In this paper we consider a predatorprey model with herd behavior and nonlocal prey competition . We investigate the effects of nonlocal competition on dynamics of the system in the bounded region when the kernel function takes

@highlight The dynamics of the nonlocal predatorprey system is studied.
@highlight The conditions for Hopf and Turing bifurcations are derived.
@highlight Effect of the nonlocal competition term on the stability is analytically investigated.
@highlight Effect of the kernel function on the stability is numerically investigated.
