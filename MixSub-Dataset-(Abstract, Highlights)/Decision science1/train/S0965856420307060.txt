Formative mobility consists of past mobility experiences aquired mobility resources and socio economic characteristics . Motility is assessed through components of personal access skills and cognitive appropriation and cover neighborhood mobility qualities residential access qualities mobility skills travel self confidence openness to new people and places . Eudemonic well being is measured using the three aspects of the Self Determination Theory autonomy relatedness and competencies . A tailor made questionnaire was designed to collect the data . The proposed behavioral framework is validated with a structural equation model estimated based on a sample of 822 women in Israel . The results show i past mobility experiences and aquired travel resources are positively correlated with current perceived motility ii mobility skills travel self confidence openness to new people and places are associated with autonomy and environmental mastery ii openness to people and places is linked to a higher degree of self acceptance iii mobility skills are positively related to higher personal growth and purpose iv access mobility skills and openness to new people and places is linked to positive relations with others .
