 The existence of significant uncertainties in the models and systems required for trajectory prediction represents a major challenge for the Air traffic Management system . Weather can be considered as one of the most relevant sources of uncertainty . Understanding and managing the impact of these uncertainties is necessary to increase the predictability of the ATM system . State of the art probabilistic forecasts from Ensemble Prediction Systems are employed to characterize uncertainty in the wind and potential convective areas . A robust optimal control methodology to produce efficient and predictable aircraft trajectories in the presence of these uncertainties is presented . Aircraft motion is assumed to be at a constant altitude and variable speed considering BADA4 as the aircraft performance model . A set of Pareto optimal trajectories is obtained for different preferences among predictability convective risk and average cost index running a thorough parametric study on a North Atlantic crossing use case . Results show that the cost of reducing the arrival time window by 10 s. is between 100 and 200kg or 3 and 6min . depending on the cost index . They also show that reducing the exposure to convection by 50km is on the order of 5 and 10min . or 100 and 200kg . of average fuel consumption .
