 Dockless shared bicycles have become a popular mode of transportation for city dwellers in China . Despite its convenience the dockless feature also creates new challenges as users often park shared bicycles in a disorderly fashion which places a burden on both city management and business operations . In a randomized field experiment subjects receive general information via one of three interventions to improve orderly parking being informed about the social norm receiving a warning message or being offered a monetary incentive . The results suggest that the warning message and monetary incentive shift users behavior compared with the social norm intervention . Users who received warning messages were 18.0 more likely to park in an orderly fashion and users who received a monetary incentive were 25.2 more likely . This study demonstrates that behavioral incentives may be an effective tool to address a common issue with this form of transportation .
