 This paper presents an algorithm to find multimodal shortest hyperpaths in a transport system where transit arrival is random while real time information on vehicle arrivals is only available for some lines and modes . When the algorithm is queried there is a short horizon where real time information is accurate and past this the most reliable information for estimating the arrivals is to use a random distribution specific to the lines . This problem occurs frequently in emerging cities where the transit schedules are not maintained . A Combined Real Time Hypergraph is constructed to model the multimodal transport system where all the public transport modes have random arrivals and real time information on arrivals is available for some lines of some modes . In order to model the period of time when some lines have real time information the composition of the head nodes of hyperarcs changes over time . The algorithm is tested on a real life transport system where we change the number of lines with available real time information to assess the performance of the algorithm in different scenarios . We found that incrementing the number of lines with real time information does not impact the performance .

@highlight An hypergraph model for frequency based transit with real time information is presented.
@highlight In the presented model users can select which combination of modes are willing to board.
@highlight Boarding hyperarcs are time dependent to capture real time arrivals.
@highlight The algorithm has good results to be implemented in an ATIS.
