 Globally there are a wide variety of policies in place that could help contribute to deep greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the light duty vehicle sector . Most regions are impacted by a mix of such policies . However the transportation literature has devoted little attention to policy mixes especially in the light duty vehicles sector so here we review and draw insights from the broader mostly non transport literature . We identify several rationales for pursuing mixes of policies the three legs approach to transport decarbonization namely that different policies should address different GHG reduction areas the market failure perspective that a different policy is needed to correct each market failure the political process perspective that considers the real world need for a policy mix to be perceived as political acceptability and the systems perspective that policy needs to send signals to channel technological innovation and break the lock in of incumbent practices . Based on this review we develop a simple framework for examining policy interactions across multiple criteria namely GHG mitigation cost effectiveness political acceptability and transformative signal . We demonstrate this framework by setting hypotheses for interactions across six light duty vehicle policies in the case of British Columbia Canada including a carbon tax electric vehicle purchase incentives infrastructure deployment and three regulations . We conclude with a summary of important research gaps and implications for policy design as well as quantitative modeling .
