 Multi vehicle routing problem with soft time windows is an indispensable constituent in urban logistics distribution systems . Over the past decade numerous methods for MVRPSTW have been proposed but most are based on heuristic rules that require a large amount of computation time . With the current rapid increase of logistics demands traditional methods incur the dilemma between computational efficiency and solution quality . To efficiently solve the problem we propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm called the Multi Agent Attention Model that can solve routing problem instantly benefit from lengthy offline training . Specifically the vehicle routing problem is regarded as a vehicle tour generation process and an encoder decoder framework with attention layers is proposed to generate tours of multiple vehicles iteratively . Furthermore a multi agent reinforcement learning method with an unsupervised auxiliary network is developed for the model training . By evaluated on four synthetic networks with different scales the results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms Google OR Tools and traditional methods with little computation time . In addition we validate the robustness of the well trained model by varying the number of customers and the capacities of vehicles .
