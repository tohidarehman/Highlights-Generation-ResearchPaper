 Turning movement spillover is the result of a turning bay section not being able to accommodate all arriving vehicles so that the turning vehicle queue spills back and blocks other vehicles turning in different directions . We are not aware of any TMS estimation method that can remedy this situation or support relevant applications in real time . This research proposes a quasi real time algorithm for estimating TMS which includes triggering movement as well as duration estimation . The proposed method is based on data for connected vehicles including their trajectories and their desired turning directions . In addition a model that uses partial trajectory data is proposed . For each assumed TMS a simplified trajectory is developed by the construction of a piece wise linear curve . To minimize any deviation of the simplified trajectory from observation a TMS estimation can be made . This proposed method is effective and computationally efficient when tested against dynamic demand in two mainstream signal phase settings with varied sample sizes . Even though data for a higher number of vehicle samples is generally favorable the proposed model still makes a good estimate when only one trajectory is available .

@highlight A quasi real time estimator of turning movement spillover TMS using partial connect vehicle data is proposed. The estimator can identify the TMS triggering movements and estimate the TMS durations.
@highlight A nonlinear minimization problem was formulated to minimize the deviation of the theoretical trajectory from the observed trajectory.
@highlight The estimation algorithm is tested against dynamic demand and common signal settings. The results prove the accuracy and the computational efficiency.
