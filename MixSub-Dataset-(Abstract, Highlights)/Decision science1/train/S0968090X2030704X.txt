 In pavement management systems it is beneficial to consider the economies of scale stemming from the synchronization of repairs conducted on neighboring sections within a single work zone . However finding the globally optimal solution of the repair and work zone policy for a large scale pavement network along a long term planning horizon can be computationally cumbersome . In this study as a benchmark we first propose an exact solution algorithm based on dynamic programming . Then we second propose a computationally feasible methodology a time invariant simplified rule to determine desirable policies . The proposed methodology is applied to two numerical studies Case 1 for a small scale road pavement system to compare life cycle costs and computational times between the rule based methodology and the exact solution algorithm and Case 2 for a real scale road pavement system to discuss the effectiveness of the rule based methodology . In Case 1 the rule based methodology derives a near optimal solution with a significantly shorter computational time than the exact solution algorithm . Case 2 shows that the rule based methodology can find a superior policy to the aggregation of the optimal solutions independently found for each of decomposed sub systems in a feasible computational time . Through sensitivity analyses we find that the repair and work zone policies should vary depending on the deterioration process cost factors and weight between agency and user costs for societys view or available budget for the agencys perspective .
