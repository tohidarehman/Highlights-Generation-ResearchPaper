 The Four Types of Cyclists is a widely adopted typology developed by Portlands Bicycle Coordinator Roger Geller . No Way No How Interested but Concerned Enthused and Confident and Strong and Fearless have become ubiquitous in academic literature and practice . However the classification was subjectively developed and contains several known contradictions . This research aims to develop a data driven typology using near identical explanatory variables to those of the Four Types of Cyclists . The objective is to develop a typology with a similar functional purpose but derived using statistical methods . An online survey was distributed to a panel of Edmonton Canada residents to this effect and the use of video clips rather than descriptions is tested as a means to assess comfort on different types of cycling infrastructure . Cluster Correspondence Analysis is used to carry out the segmentations including variables of comfort cycling intent and cycling in the previous summer . The survey sample tends to segment into three categories as opposed to the four suggested by Geller Uncomfortable or Uninterested Cautious Majority and Very Comfortable Cyclists . The Four Types of Cyclists typology is also shown to generate heterogeneous comfort patterns within each cyclist type a limitation our empirically derived segmentations overcome .

@highlight The Four Types of Cyclists typology generates heterogeneous comfort patterns.
@highlight Our data driven segmentation yields more homogeneous comfort patterns.
@highlight Cyclists form three categories not four based on comfort intent frequency.
@highlight Types Uncomfortable or Uninterested Cautious Majority Very Comfortable Cyclists.
