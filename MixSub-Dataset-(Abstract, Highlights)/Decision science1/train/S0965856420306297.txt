 This research examines whether cities are getting more equally accessible and connected via high speed rail in China over the period from 2010 to 2015 . Existing studies mainly use network centralities to describe the spatial pattern of HSR network without measuring the spatial disparity of these centralities and most of them rely on the infrastructure network and thus fail to incorporate HSR service quality in the centrality measures . Using HSR timetable data we incorporate both scheduled travel time and daily frequency of each origin destination city pair into three centrality measures and further quantify their inequalities using Theils T index . We find that as the HSR network expands cities appear to be more equal in terms of accessibility but their disparities in connectivity and transitivity depend on the dimensions of comparison . In general although the difference between economic regions or between megalopolises has reduced small medium sized cities not belonging to any major city cluster are further lagged behind in HSR development . The difference between core and non core cities in the same megalopolises has decreased despite that non core cities are increasingly relying on core cities to access other regions .

@highlight Disparities among Chinese cities in centralities of HSR network are examined from 2010 to 2015.
@highlight Both scheduled travel time and service frequency are incorporated into centrality measures.
@highlight Inequality between economic regions or between megalopolises has reduced.
@highlight Small medium sized cities are further lagged behind in HSR development.
@highlight In major megalopolises non core cities are catching up but they rely more on core cities to access other regions.
