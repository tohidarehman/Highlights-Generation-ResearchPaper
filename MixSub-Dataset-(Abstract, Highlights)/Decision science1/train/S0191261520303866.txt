 Autonomous vehicles have the potential to transform the way people are transported . While driverless technology may mean fewer vehicles are required to transport people to and from their daily activities such changes may result in increased congestion or total miles traveled . In this study we solve the single household shared autonomous vehicle problem to identify cost optimal routings of vehicles throughout the day . Such a tool will be useful for consumers seeking to minimize cost and for regulators seeking to understand and predict how people may behave in different scenarios . We provide a thorough literature review and construct a mixed integer linear program to minimize the daily travel cost of a household attending a given set of activities . Since solution time is a determinant for applicability of such a model we present the model in a component wise fashion . This approach allows us to understand which features most affect the problem complexity and solution time . We note that modeling carpooling is the feature that most increases time to find an optimal solution and we therefore propose a novel modeling technique for carpooling two people . We illustrate the performance of our model by comparing it with other models from the literature and note that our model can solve significantly larger problem instances and in a time that is short enough to facilitate real time scheduling . We also highlight the utility of our model for regulators who can use it to analyze quickly produced optimal routes under different cost tax scenarios .
