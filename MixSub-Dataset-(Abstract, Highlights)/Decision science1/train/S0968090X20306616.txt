 Autonomous driving technologies are advancing rapidly and determining when consumers ride in driverless vehicles on a daily basis is becoming essential . Using choice experiments first we elicit consumers willingness to pay for autonomous driving systems in Japan along with their WTP for hybrid and electric engines . We found in this study that the Japanese consumers WTP is on average lower than the estimates for the US market and is not sufficient to enable autonomous vehicles to capture a meaningful share of the existing car market . Second compared with a previous study in the US we propose and discuss an expected social dilemma caused by the ethical problems that AVs will face known as the Trolley Problems . We find that social dilemma may occur because people tend not want to buy moral AVs . Third we explored the determinants of the WTP and social dilemma to find that the credibility of AVs is determined to be a critical factor for the social dilemma .

@highlight WTP in Japan for an auto driving system is estimated insufficient in car markets.
@highlight A social dilemma will occur people may not buy AVs that they consider moral.
@highlight Credibility regarding autonomous vehicles plays a key role in the social dilemma.
