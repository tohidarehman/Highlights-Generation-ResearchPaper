 Due to the confined span of parking location choice for human driven vehicles the spatiotemporal imbalance in parking space utilization has always been a challenging problem in many major cities leading to a substantial waste of precious land resources . However in the era of autonomous vehicles with parking autonomy there are more alternative parking options available as AV can park at more distant locations away from the trip makers destination . This paper aims to investigate the morning commute problem with consideration of AV commuters distant parking choices in a many to one network . Parking sharing scheme is explicitly considered wherein AV travellers can choose to park at city centre at public parking facilities and then lease their own parking space out park at home or park at a shared parking space . We first examine how AV commuters in different residential clusters prioritize their parking location choices as well as their willingness to share the vacant parking space . Then we investigate the travellers trip timing decisions and determine the resultant equilibrium travel pattern . Without other dynamic managing schemes the model results indicate that appropriate CBD parking supply together with differentiated parking charges subsidy can reduce the total queueing congestion significantly yet at the cost of higher total travel cost .

@highlight Morning commute problem with parking is studied in many to one network in an AV future.
@highlight Multiple parking options CBD parking home parking and shared parking are considered.
@highlight The behaviours of AV commuters as both parking users and suppliers are examined.
@highlight Parking prioritization of AV commuters is investigated.
@highlight Appropriate CBD parking provision and differentiated pricing alleviate total bottleneck congestion.
