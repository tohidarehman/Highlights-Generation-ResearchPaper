 A hybrid fare scheme is proposed in this paper that combines a fare reward scheme and a non rewarding uniform fare scheme by considering the heterogeneity in transit commuters scheduling flexibility . It aims at reducing peak hour congestion in the urban transit system with alternative options catering for various commuters . In the H FRS a commuter will be rewarded with a free ride during the periods preceding or following a given shoulder period after taking a certain number of paid rides during the central period in peak hours . In the H UFS a commuter needs to pay a different but uniform fare during peak hours . Commuters will have the opportunity to join either of the sub schemes according to their scheduling flexibility of departure time choice . The hybrid fare scheme determines the free fare intervals the rewarding ratio and the new fares for the sub schemes . Our results demonstrate that the proposed HFS is not only revenue preserving but also Pareto improving . Depending on the original fare an optimally designed hybrid fare scheme can achieve a reduction in total time costs by at least 25 with the optimal free fare interval .

@highlight The hybrid fare scheme HFS consists of a fare reward and a uniform fare scheme.
@highlight We capture the heterogeneity in commuters arrival time flexibility interval.
@highlight The optimal hybrid fare scheme can be achieved with multiple solutions.
@highlight Individual trip costs reduction depends on the degree of the heterogeneity.
@highlight All commuters are no worse off and the transit operator is revenue neutral.
