 With the introduction of connected and autonomous trucks truck platooning is expected to be more feasible and prevalent . The reported benefits of the truck platooning include regularizing traffic reducing congestion increasing highway safety and decreasing fuel consumption and emission . Truck platooning may however decrease pavement longevity because it would cause channelized load application and hinder the healing properties of asphalt concrete . This study proposes a centralized control strategy that converts the pavement related challenges of truck platooning into opportunities . This strategy leverages the auto pilot technologies in CATs by optimizing the lateral position of each platoon or group of platoons . The efficiency of the proposed control strategy was demonstrated in a case study . Results showed that pavement life cycle costs could be reduced up to 50 by controlling the lateral position of the platoons for each day .
