 This paper proposes a demand management method that optimizes the network performance by manipulating departure times within limited cooperation settings . The framework builds on the restricted flexibility of travellers departure times and exposes the impact of minimal changes in travellers schedule on the overall network performance . The test bed is based on the trip based Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram that relates the network space mean speed to the vehicle accumulation . Travellers in the trip based MFD model are characterized by their specific desired arrival times heterogeneous trip lengths and earliness and lateness scheduling penalties . The optimization problem on the other hand is formulated based on the accumulation based MFD model that relates the network production to the vehicle accumulation . The accumulation based MFD is an aggregated parsimonious model and does not consider individual traveller attributes which enables it to remain analytically tractable and makes it suitable for optimization purposes . The proposed demand management method is also incorporated into a day to day evolution model where travellers adapt based on their historical departure times experienced travel costs and individual characteristics . The results highlight that the accumulation based MFD can be efficiently used to develop travel demand management methods with realistic representation of traffic congestion within and across days .

@highlight We develop a demand management model that considers limited cooperation settings among travellers.
@highlight We incorporate the proposed management model into a day to day evolution model where people adapt to changing traffic conditions.
@highlight The results confirm that minor changes in travellers schedule can significantly improve the overall network performance.
