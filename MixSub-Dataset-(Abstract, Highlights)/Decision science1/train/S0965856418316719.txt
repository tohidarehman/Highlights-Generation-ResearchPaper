 Ever growing urban areas and global population movement towards urbanization lead to major concerns regarding urban logistics and last mile operations . In Latin America the problem becomes critical since volatile emerging economies and unstable political situations which are common in the region introduce additional limitations for strong logistics solutions . In the city of Quito traffic regulations only consider time schedule restrictions for vehicle mobility without any other policies that benefit urban goods movement . This is in part because there is a lack of knowledge on freight flows mainly related to the difficulties to retrieve data to that purpose . This paper proposes a freight trip generation analysis in Quito based on a methodology included in MITs Better Cities for Logistics Toolkit which defines specific zones observation and data collection campaigns . More precisely a procedure combining observation based and declarative data collection processes is proposed . First the opportunities of combining both observed and declared data to characterize freight trip generation are addressed on the basis of a literature review . Main issues of combining establishment based surveys and observations are addressed to generalize the proposed framework . Finally application implications in a transferability perspective to other Latin American countries are addressed .

@highlight Individual FTG rates can give a good characterization of the zone.
@highlight Zonal FTG rates can be obtained from individual FTG rates.
@highlight Number of employees was found to be the only representative variable for models.
@highlight Combining the stated methodologies lead to a suitable FTG framework for Latin America.
