 With the fast development of automated vehicle technologies scholars have proposed various innovative local traffic control schemes for more effective management of AV traffic especially at intersections . However due to computational intractability the investigation of network level AV control is still at the initial stage . This study proposes a space time routing framework applicable in dedicated AV zones . To relieve the computational load we establish a node based conflict point network to model realistic road networks and at each conflict point we record the space time occupations of AVs in continuous timelines . Then based on the conflict point network we develop two space time routing algorithms for each AV once it enters the dedicated AV zone to minimize its trip travel time while maintaining the non collision insurances these two algorithms can trade off between solution quality and computational load . Furthermore to enhance the network throughput for handling heavy traffic we develop a platoon strategy that forces AVs to pass through conflict points in platoons and we adopt Deep Q learning to optimize the platoon sizes at different spots dynamically . Numerical tests show that both proposed algorithms perform well in that they can execute the routing tasks with very limited computational time and the average vehicle delay approaches zero when the traffic is relatively mild . Meanwhile compared with the FCFS policy and the optimization based approach the platoon strategy can greatly reduce the average vehicle delay under congested scenarios and give a better balance between the optimality and real time performance .
