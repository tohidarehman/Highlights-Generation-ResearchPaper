 Mobility as a Service has received widespread attention over the past couple of years amongst scholars businesses policymakers and mainstream media . Most coverage is oriented towards its possible gains for traveling individuals and the travel industry while still lacking conceptual clarity and sufficient detail about its potential acceptance by the general public . This leads to varying perspectives on what MaaS precisely is and will be in the near future . In this study we reflect upon the relationship between MaaS use and private car ownership based on insights gained from a MaaS pilot study organized mid 2017 in Ghent . This exploratory pilot study targeted 100 car owning participants and explored how these motivated people can replace or significantly reduce car use in return for a monthly mobility budget which they could spend on MaaS services . The study reveals that most respondents were apt to explore MaaS services but a clear reduction of private car use remained difficult in a real life setting . Despite being highly motivated to reduce car use and being given incentives participants faced considerable difficulties in bypassing their personal car especially for leisure trips . By drawing parallels with a similar debate in the transport literature from a couple of decades ago we suggest that MaaS should be regarded as a complement rather than a substitution of private car use in the near future . The relationship between MaaS use and car ownership might in reality be more complex than generally acknowledged . In addressing these parallels the paper opens up new critical questions for MaaS research in the future .

@highlight Despite increased attention for MaaS well designed pilot studies are rare.
@highlight Results from an exploratory MaaS pilot study 100 participants are presented.
@highlight Findings suggest MaaS mainly complements car possession and car use.
@highlight Interrelation between MaaS and private car is bound to be complex.
