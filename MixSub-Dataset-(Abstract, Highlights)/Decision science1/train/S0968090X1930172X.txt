 Advances in communications technology have made the development of connected and automated vehicle applications that may potentially replace traditional gantry operated lane control signals possible . This paper develops the concept of a prototype CAV enabled LCS application and provides a preliminary assessment of the potential improvement it offers over traditional LCS . Real world data obtained from an LCS on I 66 in Northern Virginia was used to calibrate and validate a baseline simulation model . Further the current lane control scenarios utilized in the Northern Virginia LCS were identified and relevant data resulting from implementation of those scenarios were collected to model the LCS in a simulation environment . The performance of real world LCS was then compared to a prototype CAV enabled LCS application developed in this research . The CAV enabled LCS application consistently outperformed the traditional LCS with increased throughput and speeds . On average an increase of 18.4 9.6 and 12.8 in throughput was observed for three selected scenarios under the best case of a 1 sec headway . Furthermore the CAV enabled LCS application was also found to reduce volatility represented by variation in acceleration and deceleration regimes by an average of 25.6 and 49.6 . The reduction in turbulence in the traffic stream may indicate potential improved safety with the CAV system .
