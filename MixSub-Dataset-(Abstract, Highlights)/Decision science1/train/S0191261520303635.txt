 Studies of road pricing in which the Value of Time varies among travelers suggest that road pricing benefits travelers with high VOT and hurts travelers with low VOT . This happens because when a toll reduces congestion only high VOT travelers value the time saved more than the money cost . This paper uses a static traffic model with elastic demands to examine how the presence of a mixed traffic bus alternative which is cheaper but slower than driving alters that logic . When agents care only about the time and money costs of each alternative it turns out that Pareto improving toll increases are possible and absent a Pareto improvement the Full Cost of Travel rises only inside an intermediate interval of VOT while falling for sufficiently high and low VOT . But when agents have heterogeneous tastes for each mode the Full Cost of Travel falls for all agents with VOT higher than a certain level and below that level the direction of change depends on an agents taste .

@highlight Incorporates a mixed traffic bus alternative into a static traffic model with elastic demand.
@highlight Analyzes the distribution of welfare changes from an increase in road tolls under different assumptions.
@highlight A viable mixed traffic bus alternative lets travelers with low values of time benefit from a toll increase.
@highlight Shows via counterexample that correlation of income with value of time does not imply road pricing is necessarily regressive.
