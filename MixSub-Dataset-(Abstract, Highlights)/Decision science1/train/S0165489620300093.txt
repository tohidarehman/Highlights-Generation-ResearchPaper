 The existing literature has considered licensing of a patented cost reducing innovation either in a homogeneous good industry or in a differentiated goods industry . We consider a new model of patent licensing between producers of a homogeneous good when there is competition from producers of another brand in the market . We find that for drastic innovation the optimal intra brand patent licensing involves only fixed fee when the degree of inter brand differentiation is low and a two part tariff otherwise . For non drastic innovation the optimal intra brand patent licensing involves only royalty when the degree of inter brand differentiation is high a two part tariff when it is intermediate and finally a fixed fee alone when it is low . We also establish that the innovator has more incentive for innovation as an insider than an outsider of this market .

@highlight We consider the intra brand patent licensing with inter brand competition.
@highlight The optimal licensing depends on the degree of inter brand differentiation.
@highlight The innovator has more incentive for innovation as an insider than an outsider.
