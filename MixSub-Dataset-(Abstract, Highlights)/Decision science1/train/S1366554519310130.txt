 By considering different regulations on retailers recycle responsibly we study a dominant retailers collection decision under upstream competition . The equilibrium collection model and effort are derived under different regulations . We find that the lenient regulation in the emerging markets is more likely to induce a socially inefficient equilibrium and the strict regulation in the developed market induces a socially efficient equilibrium . The results suggest that the policymaker should motive the retailer to undertake more collection responsibility when the intensity of upstream competition is not too low .

@highlight Analyse dominant retailers incentives of undertaking used products collection in emerging markets with lenient regulation.
@highlight Study the optimal prices and return effort in reverse supply chain.
@highlight Examine forward and backward competitions in reverse supply chain.
@highlight Specify the condition under which policymakers in emerging markets should impose more collection responsibility on retailers.
