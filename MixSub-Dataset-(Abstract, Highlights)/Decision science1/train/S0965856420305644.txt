 Equity issues among travellers are critical in congestion pricing . Failure to treat equity can lead to low acceptability towards pricing . In this paper we develop congestion pricing schemes to improve both equity and traffic performance for multimodal networks . We consider the equity issue by the existence of heterogeneous population with respect to income level and value of time . An optimization framework is formulated for obtaining optimal toll schemes . We apply an aggregated network level traffic flow model to reproduce congestion dynamics and mode choice behavior . The gain and loss for VOT based user groups are investigated and discussed . We carry out simulation analysis over two pricing schemes a unified toll and a VOT based toll . In particular we allow during the optimization process the VOT based toll to obtain negative values for some users if it meets some system objectives . Our results confirm that significant differences in behavior and cost savings exist among groups which justifies the need for a VOT based pricing . It also demonstrates that properly designed VOT based tolls can improve the inequity in savings e.g . users whose VOT values are lower may receive larger travel cost savings . Furthermore a policy oriented discussion on the design and implementation of the proposed equitable pricing schemes is provided .
