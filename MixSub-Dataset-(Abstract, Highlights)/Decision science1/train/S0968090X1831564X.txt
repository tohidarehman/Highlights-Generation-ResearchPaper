 Express bus services are services that skip some of the stops along their routes to provide a faster ride for particularly demanded trips on a corridor . There is a growing literature on express services that focuses on route design and performance evaluation . In this work we study a simplified transit corridor where a regular service operates in tandem with an end to end express service . Assuming that passengers minimize their expected travel and waiting times we show that even if the system has enough aggregate capacity it may present a specific range of frequencies for the express service where it attracts more demand than it can actually fulfill . We call this range the danger zone of express services . When frequencies fall within the danger zone a queue of passengers will form at the station . Applying queuing theory we obtain expressions to estimate these queues and the associated waiting times expected travel times and social costs of the system . We show that even when the station has unlimited passenger capacity the performance of the system can be greatly affected in the danger zone . If the station has indeed limited capacity the scenario can be much worse if the queue grows to the point of saturating the station a vicious circle ensues that amplifies the negative effects of the danger zone .

@highlight We identify a new phenomenon we call the danger zone of express services.
@highlight Raising express service frequencies can damage the level of service in a corridor.
@highlight Under certain conditions this effect occurs in a specific range of frequencies.
@highlight The effect happens when the express draws in more demand than it can carry.
@highlight We use queuing theory to model and measure this effect on an idealized corridor.
