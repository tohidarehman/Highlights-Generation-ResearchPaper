 Pro cycling interventions and cycle hire schemes in particular are often assumed to primarily benefit the privileged . This framing has played out in academic research with many papers exploring the relationship between cycling and existing inequalities . A growing body of evidence suggests that cycle hire schemes tend to serve wealthy areas and young high income groups mirroring inequalities in other types of cycling uptake yet there has been little research into the direction of travel and whether such inequalities are growing or levelling up over time . This paper explores the uptake of the London Cycle Hire Scheme a large early and prominent scheme that had the explicit aim of normalising cycling . The method involved reproducible analysis of 73.4 million cycle high records spanning 8years from January 2012 to December 2019 using the geographic location of docking stations alongside official statistics to assess social and spatial inequalities in uptake .

@highlight New analysis of 8 years of data from the London Cycle Hire Scheme LCHS .
@highlight 73.4 million trips analysed showing spatial pattern of growth.
@highlight Expansion of the scheme into lower income areas explored.
@highlight Results show high growth rates in comparatively low income areas.
@highlight Our finding support further expansion of the LCHS into diverse areas.
