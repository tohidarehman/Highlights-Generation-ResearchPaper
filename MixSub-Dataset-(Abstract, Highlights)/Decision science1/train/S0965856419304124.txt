 A novel approach to dynamic switching service design based on a new queuing approximation formulation is introduced to systematically control conventional buses and enable provision of flexible on demand mobility services . This new approach guides smart vehicles in a service area that needs last mile transit services via either traditional buses which provide fixed route services or flexible route on demand mobility services . We also include dynamic pre positioning of idle vehicles in anticipation of new customer arrivals and relocation of vehicles to rebalance the use of vehicles in the system which can have a sizable effect on energy and environmental conservation . Using a New York City transit dataset the proposed strategy for non myopic switching between flexible route and fixed route service and re positioning of idle vehicles improves social welfare by up to 32 while the impact of the proposed strategy on vehicle miles traveled is shown to be as high as 53 over that of the current transit service .

@highlight A dynamic switching model between flexible route and fixed route modes is proposed.
@highlight We apply a policy on pre positioning of idle vehicles based on queuing system.
@highlight The design of a fleet based strategy by using two vehicle sizes is suggested.
@highlight The method can be used in shared autonomous vehicle fleets for the timing of decisions.
