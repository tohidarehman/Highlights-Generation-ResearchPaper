 This paper studies equilibrium indeterminacy in an extended version of the two sector endogenous growth model by Mino by allowing alternative specifications for leisure . When utility depends on pure leisure indeterminacy may only emerge if consumption and leisure are Edgeworth complements . We obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for indeterminacy from the arbitrage condition on the two assets of the economy consumption and human capital . When qualified leisure is considered indeterminacy does not arise .

@highlight The specification of leisure plays a crucial role.
@highlight With pure leisure indeterminacy may only arise if consumption and leisure are complements.
@highlight We interpret the necessary and sufficient conditions for indeterminacy.
@highlight With qualified leisure indeterminacy does not arise.
