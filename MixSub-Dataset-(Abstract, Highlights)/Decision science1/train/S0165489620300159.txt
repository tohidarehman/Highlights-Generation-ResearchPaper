 In a two sector economy we consider the endogenous determination of the level of competition in the imperfectly competitive sector under democratic non manipulated voting . In the context of the Salops circular model we identify conditions such that in addition to a competitive equilibrium an inefficient equilibrium is observed in which a majority of fully rational and informed citizens vote for an inefficiently low level of competition intensity . In particular we show that under reasonable conditions a coalition of middle class entrepreneurs who vote for a lower level of competition intensity defeats a coalition of extremes formed by high and low productivity entrepreneurs and pure consumers who vote for a higher level of competition intensity . In addition we show that the higher the degree of similarity among entrepreneurs the more inefficient the anticompetitive equilibrium .

@highlight The competition level is chosen by democratic voting in the Salop circular model.
@highlight An inefficient anticompetitive equilibrium trap can appear.
@highlight Anticompetitive middle class entrepreneurs can defeat a coalition of extremes.
