 Emergency vehicles play a crucial role in providing timely help for the general public in saving lives and avoiding property loss . However very few efforts have been made for EV prioritization on normal road segments such as the road section between intersections or highways between ramps . In this paper we propose an EV lane pre clearing strategy to prioritize EVs on such roads through cooperative driving with surrounding connected vehicles . The cooperative driving problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem aiming at guaranteeing the desired speed of EVs and minimizing the disturbances on CVs . To tackle this NP hard MINP problem we formulate the model in a bi level optimization manner to address these two objectives respectively . In the lower level problem CVs in front of the emergency vehicle will be divided into several blocks . For each block we developed an EV sorting algorithm to design optimal merging trajectories for CVs . With resultant sorting trajectories a constrained optimization problem is solved in the upper level to determine the initiation time distance to conduct the sorting trajectories . Case studies show that with the proposed algorithm emergency vehicles are able to drive at a desired speed while minimizing disturbances on normal traffic flows . We further reveal a linear relationship between the optimal solution and road density which could help to improve EV routing decision makings when high resolution data is not available .
