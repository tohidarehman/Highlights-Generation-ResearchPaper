 This paper examines the productivity of Norwegian container seaports and the extent to which the initially less productive seaports are converging diverging in productivity in relation to the initially more productive seaports . The rationale of the paper is that productivity assessment of Norwegian seaports is scarce in the literature and studies of convergence divergence in container seaports are missing in the literature on transportation . The methodology used is the stochastic frontier analysis based Malmquist productivity index

@highlight We explore productivity convergence of container seaports using SFA based Malmquist productivity index.
@highlight Norwegian and comparable seaports in the Nordic countries and the UK are examined.
@highlight Annual average total productivity is 9.7 but technical efficiency regressed by 3.2 .
@highlight Norwegian seaports are best performers with regard to scale efficiency change.
@highlight Convergences are found seaports with initially lower productivities progressed faster than those with initially higher.
@highlight Convergences exist seaports with initially lower productivities progressed faster than those with initially higher.
