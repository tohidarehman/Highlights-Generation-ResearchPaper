 This study investigates congestion pricing and capacity investment for an international network linking two countries airports and airlines . Under a Bertrand Nash supposition for airports and Cournot competition for airlines in a duopoly we characterize the locally optimal pricing rules for uniform and discriminatory charges levied by each country s airport . We clarify that the locally optimal pricing rules include a significant component resulting from the incentive to exploit the foreign airline which is not included in the optimal pricing rules set by a social global welfare maximizing authority . We evaluate the pricing rules of the two airport charges for a round trip . We clarify that the incentive to exploit the foreign airline is theoretically the only source of deviation from global welfare maximization regardless of the uniform or discriminatory charges pricing regimes . Furthermore we show that each airport s runway capacity investment could be globally efficient under globally optimal pricing rules whereas each airport tends to overinvest under locally optimal pricing rules .

@highlight Pricing and capacity for two internationally interlinked airports are examined.
@highlight Local welfare maximizing airports have incentives to exploit foreign carriers.
@highlight The incentive is the only source of deviation from global welfare maximization.
@highlight Each airport overinvests in runway capacity under locally optimal pricing rules.
