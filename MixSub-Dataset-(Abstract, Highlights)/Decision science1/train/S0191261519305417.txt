 The aim of this study is to analyze the stability of dynamic user equilibrium with fixed departure times in unidirectional networks . Specifically stochastic stability which is the concept of stability in evolutionary dynamics subjected to stochastic effects is herein considered . To achieve this a new approach is developed by synthesizing the three concepts the decomposition technique of DUE assignments the weakly acyclic game and the asymptotic analysis of the stationary distribution of perturbed dynamics . Specifically we first formulate a DUE assignment as a strategic game that deals with atomic users . We then prove that there exists an appropriate order of assigning users for ensuring equilibrium in a unidirectional network . With this property we establish the relationship between DUE games in unidirectional networks and weakly acyclic games . The convergence and stochastic stability of better response dynamics in the DUE games are then proved based on the theory of weakly acyclic games . Finally we observe the properties of the convergence and stability from numerical experiments . The results show that the strict improvement of users travel times by the applied evolutionary dynamics is important for ensuring the existence of a stochastically stable equilibrium in DUE games .
