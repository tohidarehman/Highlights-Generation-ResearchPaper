 This paper proposes a new dynamic user equilibrium traffic assignment model using reservoir based network reduction techniques and surrogate dynamic network loading models . A traffic network is decomposed into a reservoir structure and the DUE problem is formulated as a variational inequality with an embedded surrogate model for the path delay operator to describe traffic dynamics at the reservoir level . The surrogate model is further enhanced by the reproducing kernel Hilbert space and adaptive sampling to reduce approximation error and improve computational efficiency . To solve the proposed surrogate based DUE problem on reduced networks we develop a customized algorithm that integrates the kernel trick with the generalized projection framework . A pre computation scheme is proposed which calculates and stores the of kernel matrices and vectors could further reduce the computational burden . Numerical experiments of the proposed methods show significant reduction of the computational times by up to
