 This paper focuses on the export container cargos from Chongqing to Europe in the outbound transport network considering the two modes of maritime transport and the CSERE . It has three aims first to propose a method to calculate the international transport accessibility with the help of indicators of the convenience and connectivity of the outbound transport second to estimate the container cargo volume changes as the CSERE develops extending the linear expenditure system model and the multiregional input output model combined with the stochastic frontier analysis and the multifactor dynamic coefficient generation and third to evaluate the effects of the CSERE on the formation of the CILC by employing three indicators i.e . the international transport level the industry diversity and the CSERE contribution rate . Managerial and policy implications of promoting the CILC are drawn from the test results .

@highlight This paper applies discrete choice model incorporating transport time and freight cost to evaluate the opportunity and utility accessibility of international trade transportation.
@highlight The indicators of international trade transportation level industry diversity and Chongqing Sinkiang Europe Railway Express CSERE contribution rate evaluate impacts of CSERE in establishing Chongqing International Logistics Center CILC .
@highlight The paper analyzes convenience and connectivity of international trade transportation between Chongqing and Europe.
@highlight Managerial and policy implications to promote the CILC are drawn from the test results.
