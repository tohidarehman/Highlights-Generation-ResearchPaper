 This study aims at quantifying preference heterogeneity in transit service desired quality to better informing service quality improvements . The analysis is performed using a validated dataset elicited from 906 respondents through an online survey . An unlabelled Stated Preference experiment was utilized in a Latent class Choice Model and an Error Components interaction model . The results of the EC interaction model revealed preference heterogeneity due to differences in respondents socioeconomic and behavioural characteristics . While the results of the LCM untapped vital information that has not been reported previously in the transit service quality literature . Unlike the traditional user type classification our study classifies respondents into three segments Direct Trip Enthusiastic Cost Sensitive and Real time Information Supporter . Each segment exhibits different preferences for transit service attributes and their willingness to pay for service improvements is distinctly different . Further the LCM indicates that the heterogeneity of users preferences is not explicit in their usage pattern nor accessibility to different travel modes instead it is a bundle of various parameters .
