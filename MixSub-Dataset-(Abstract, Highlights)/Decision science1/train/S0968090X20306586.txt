 The mixed traffic flow has complex dynamics by nature . The kinematic differences between automobiles and motorcycles result to distinct driving behaviors . Traditional automobile based traffic flow theory is not always suitable for mixed traffic streams . The purpose of this study is to observe from actual data a clearance boundary called Safety Space drivers maintain from other vehicles and use it as a spatial filter to determine conflicts in mixed traffic flows . Image data are collected from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and microscopic characteristics such as vehicle type position velocity and trajectory are extracted through computer vision techniques . The Histogram of Oriented Gradients feature and the Support Vector Machine classifier are utilized for the vehicle detection while the Kalman Filter is employed for the derivation of vehicle trajectories . The Safety Space is then determined based on those trajectories . Validation data are collected at intersections in Taipei Taiwan Bangkok Thailand and Mumbai India . The vehicle detection and tracking are satisfactory and the Safety Space surrogate reveals risk zones caused by spatial proximity between vehicles .

@highlight Image traffic data are collected from the UAV and trajectories are extracted through object based detection and tracking.
@highlight The Safety Space boundary in proximity of the vehicle is observed from data.
@highlight This Safety Space forms the boundary of the comfort area drivers perceive as safe when traveling.
@highlight Invasions of the Safety Space by other vehicles potentially reveal traffic conflicts.
