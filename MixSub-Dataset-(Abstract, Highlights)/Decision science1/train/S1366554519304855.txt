 In this paper we propose a discrete model to investigate reliable location design with round trip transportation under imperfect information . The unique feature of this problem is that under each disruption scenario a customers outbound and inbound trips are different when she travels to obtain a service . The discrete model is formulated as a compact non linear integer programming problem and solved efficiently by a customized Lagrangian relaxation algorithm . Numerical experiments find that the discrete model performs well for small and medium scale problem instances . Sensitivity analyses reveal the impacts of several parameters on both the cost components and the optimal facility layouts .
