 This study aims to model two dimensional motion of an Ego Vehicle . Intelligent Driver Model is enhanced for this purpose . All the surrounding obstacles are considered as stimuli that elicit drivers reactions . A Virtual LiDAR sensor on the EV perceives the surrounding . Proximity and speed are used to compute longitudinal and lateral components of average relative velocity . A new formulation is presented to compute the effective gap considering all the surrounding obstacles . It is composed of four components front rear left and right . The former two affect longitudinal acceleration while the latter two influence lateral acceleration of the EV . A discretionary lane change model is also developed to account for the drivers deliberate lateral movements . A total of 13 model parameters are used of which eight are newly introduced . These model parameters are calibrated using 1050 human driven car trajectories from Next Generation SIMulation dataset . Taguchis fractional factorial design principle is used to optimize the parameters . Gray relational analysis indicated that the three newly introduced parameters to be the three most influential parameters . Validation using another 450 car trajectories resulted in a mean radial error of 3.97m over a horizon of 10s . The performance measures of two dimensional motion planning are found to be better than those reported in the literature . The developed human like AV IDM offers a
