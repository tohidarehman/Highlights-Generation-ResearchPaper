 User perception plays a critical role in pedestrian infrastructure usage . Indeed the perceptional influence varies across individuals and it is imperative to consider their response heterogeneity in modelling individual travel intentions . The present study develops a novel framework to understand the pedestrian perception and further identify their impact on future travel decisions . In this framework the individual pedestrian perception of an area is captured using a Level of Service index and the overall set of LOS is categorized using a clustering methodology . The future travel behavior is modelled using a single step estimation that incorporates the effect of both response heterogeneity and latent individual correlation . The proposed framework is utilized in estimating the LOS categorization and the future willingness to walk in the city of Coimbatore India . The results found a significant response heterogeneity among respondents in Coimbatore and consequently emphasized the need for incorporating these taste variations in the travel behavior models . An increase in LOS encouraged the respondents to walk and further walk longer . Moreover females were willing to pursue walking and or walk more distance compared with males . The positive ordinal interval for LOS A to C indicated an acceptability for this LOS range among pedestrians compared with LOS E to F having a negative range . In the individual assessment of LOS variables almost all study areas were found requiring an improvement with respect to the management of footpath vendors and footpath cleanliness .
