 In this paper we investigate the inland depot location problem of the inland transportation system . In inland container transportation empty containers are transported between depots and consignees shippers and empty containers should be repositioned after before inbound outbound full containers . We build a robust mathematical model that focuses on determining when and where consignees shippers are assigned to . In addition inter depots empty container repositioning is implemented considering demand uncertainty . This paper proposes a branch and price algorithm that is based on Lagrangian relaxation and column generation . We show the optimality condition of the pricing subproblem and construct a simpler formulation in this paper . Computational experiments are performed with test instances that mimic real life . Our results also show that considering time compatibility of full and empty container routes is closer to reality and increases the utilization of empty containers in depots . The proposed algorithm yields promising solutions compared with CPLEX .
