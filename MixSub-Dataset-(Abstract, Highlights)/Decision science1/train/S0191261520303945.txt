 This paper aims to optimize demand oriented train timetables under overtaking operations for a high speed rail corridor . With the application of the constructed space time network representation the timetabling and skip stopping decisions in response to passenger demand for heterogeneous train traffic are formulated into an integer linear programming model . Specifically we carefully assign the hour dependent origin to destination demand to the skip stop flexible timetable by using a group of tailored constraints that bind the origin station and destination station together . While solving the proposed model under the column generation based framework the biggest barrier is that the pricing subproblem can not be successfully solved through the standard dynamic programming algorithm because the dual price from the demand constraint is dependent upon two coupled stations . To dynamically eliminate the indivisibility attached to the demand oriented timetabling problem we propose a novel approach to replace the two station dependent dual variable with its single station dependent surrogate counterpart . A branch and price and cut procedure is also conducted to achieve the corresponding integer solutions where specific families of valid inequalities are selected to narrow the feasible solutions in the restricted master problem . Finally numerical experiments are implemented to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method .

@highlight Model the multiple type train timetabling problem under hour dependent OD passenger demand.
@highlight Employ a skip stop flexible pattern to accommodate both overtaking operations and OD based demand distributions.
@highlight Develop a surrogate dual variable column generation with branch and price and cut framework to eliminate the attached indivisibility.
