 In this paper a new multi class urban traffic model is proposed based on the features of a single class urban traffic model and the characteristics of a multi class freeway traffic model . The heterogeneous traffic flow is represented using the concept of Passenger Car Equivalent for congestion and free flow regimes separately . The proposed multi class urban traffic model is intended for model based control applications . The single class model and the proposed multi class traffic model are compared with microscopic simulation data obtained using the SUMO open source simulator . The two models are calibrated through optimal parameter estimation and their performance is evaluated and compared by taking into account the error index between the models and the simulation data . Simulation results show that the multi class model gives a significantly better fit .

@highlight The multi class S model describes the heterogeneous flow of vehicles.
@highlight The performance of multi class S model is compared with the single class S model using microsimulation as a reference.
@highlight The computation time of the macroscopic models does not depend on the number of vehicles.
