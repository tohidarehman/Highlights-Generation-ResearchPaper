 The distractive effects of mobile phones are well documented but the recent development of mobile phone apps that provide speed advisory warnings raises the possibility that this technology may be used to improve driver safety in older vehicles . We examined the effects of an intelligent speed advisory app on driving performance in a simulator . One hundred and four participants were allocated to complete the drive with the ISA app in one of five modes active audio visual active visual passive audio visual passive visual or control . Another 19 participants completed the study wearing eye tracking glasses . Participants drove a simulated 26.4km section of rural road which incorporated typical hazards and three speed compliance zones . The app led to good compliance with the posted speed limits particularly during the 60km h road segment where the control group drove at significantly higher speeds than the groups with the ISA app . No significant differences between the four versions of the ISA app were observed either for speed compliance or the number of speeding alerts received . Across the entire simulated drive there were relatively few glances at the app with an average glance duration of 190ms .

@highlight We examined the effects of an intelligent speed advisory app ISA on driving performance in a simulator.
@highlight The ISA app led to good speed compliance particularly in lower speed zones.
@highlight The ISA app did not lead to any negative effects on driving performance.
@highlight When properly configured ISA apps have a safety benefit and do not distract drivers.
