 Traffic engineers are making efforts to mitigate congestion and to improve efficiency at intersections . The symmetric intersection can increase the capacity of intersections and is economical practical efficient and convenient . The pedestrians crossing patterns tailored for SI has not yet been studied . This paper not only develops three pedestrian crossing patterns but also analyzes crossing patterns from the aspects of efficiency and safety . For efficiency delay models are proposed by considering through and diagonal pedestrian movements . For safety exposure conflicts and the number of potential traffic accidents are analyzed . Then delay and potential accidents are converted into money value respectively and the total cost is calculated . The case study results show that SI performs better in terms of increasing capacity and decreasing pedestrian delay compared with conventional intersection . Crossing pattern 1 is efficient but unsafe while the total delay and safety cost of pattern 3 is usually the highest . The sensitivity analysis indicates that cycle length has a negative impact on average pedestrian cost and if critical flow ratio increases the average pedestrian cost of pattern 1 and pattern 3 will increase and decrease respectively . Furthermore the best pedestrian pattern choice under different values of cost per accident and cost of pedestrian delay is also studied .
