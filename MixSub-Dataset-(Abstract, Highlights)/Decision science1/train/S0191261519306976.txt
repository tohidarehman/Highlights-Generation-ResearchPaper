 This study aims to determine the optimal deployment of charging stations for battery electric vehicles by maximizing the covered path flows taking into account the path deviation and nonlinear elastic demand referred to as DCSDE for short . Under the assumption that the travel demand between OD pairs follows a nonlinear inverse cost function with respect to the generalized travel cost a BCAP based model will be first formulated for DCSDE problem . A tailored branch and price approach is proposed to solve the model . The pricing problem to determine an optimal path of BEV is not easily solvable by available algorithms due to the path based nonlinear cost term in the objective function . We thus propose a customized two phase method for the pricing problem . The model framework and solution method can easily be extended to incorporate other practical requirements in the context of e mobility such as the maximal allowable number of stops for charging and the asymmetric round trip . The numerical experiments in a benchmark 25 node network and a real world California State road network are conducted to assess the efficiency of the proposed model and solution approach .
