 Transport poverty is a growing concern in many developed countries . However research on the determinants of transport poverty is relatively scant . We contribute to the debate on the determinants of transport poverty by presenting the first study to empirically examine the effects of ethnic diversity on transport poverty . Using 12 waves of longitudinal data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey covering the period 20052016 we find a positive association between ethnic diversity and transport poverty . This result is robust to endogeneity alternative ways of measuring ethnic diversity and transport poverty . We show that trust is an important channel through which ethnic diversity influences transport poverty . Thus policies aimed at fostering tolerance trust and inclusion in diverse communities are important to mitigate the negative effects of ethnic diversity on desirable socioeconomic outcomes .
