 Some creators in crowdfunding markets have recently employed deceptive advertising to overstate their product quality . We consider a model in which the policy maker would punish such false advertising when detecting it . Using a signaling framework we examine how deceptive advertising influences rational buyers purchase decisions and how the creator signals its quality via advertising as well as price . We show that the high quality creator finds it optimal to use price and advertising jointly to deter low quality creators mimicking behavior . Moreover whether the deceptive advertising occurs in a crowdfunding market depends on the degree of the policy makers regulation . Counterintuitively a stricter regulation on deceptive advertising might not always deter the low quality creator from mimicking . Moreover our results also indicate that allowing a moderate level of deceptive advertising might benefit consumers because the low type creators deceptive claim might motivate the high quality creator to cover more buyers .
