 With the rise of cross border e commerce the third party forwarding logistics service becomes increasingly popular . Different from the traditional third party logistics service the 3PFL company provides forwarding services cost effectively by consolidating orders from different e tailers platforms . The random arrivals of orders create a big challenge . Different from most of the existing studies a deep learning based one step integration optimal decision making approach S2SCL is proposed in this paper which intelligently integrates inventory optimization and demand forecasting process . The Seq2Seq based forecasting architecture which integrates CNN and LSTM network is able to model the system dynamics and dependency relations in varying demand for logistics services . Besides generating the point forecasting results the proposed approach can quantify demand uncertainty via a dynamic distribution and make optimal decision on logistics service capacity allocation . Through a case study analysis with real data obtained from a 3PFL company in Chinas Great Bay Area we compare the proposed S2SCL with two benchmark models including a one step statistics based integration approach ARIMA and a two step optimization based approach PSO ELM for two tasks point forecasting and optimal logistic service capacity allocation . Experimental results show that S2SCL outperforms the two benchmark models in both tasks significantly .
