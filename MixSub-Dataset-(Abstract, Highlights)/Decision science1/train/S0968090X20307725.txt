 Among several crucial objectives of the air transportation system minimization of fuel consumption has a profound impact on the economic viability of airline companies and their effect on the environment . Given that many large airports around the world are located in the heart of residential areas such as Chicagos OHare New Yorks JFK and Montreals Pierre Elliott Trudeau the Greenhouse Gas Emissions released by aircraft flying through such urban airports directly impacts the health of nearby residents . In this paper we propose a hybrid taxiing solution to reduce the airports impact on GGE where part of the taxiing operations is handled by tow trucks powered by renewable energy while some other aircraft continue using their engines to complete taxiing . The main contribution of the work presented in this paper is the inclusion of collision of conflict avoidance in the formulation of taxiing operations planning with an objective to minimize fuel consumption and to maximize the desired service quality . The conflict free taxing operations planning model is tested on Montreals Pierre Elliott Trudeau airport . Furthermore the detailed economic analysis on the adoption of electric powered tow trucks is provided .
