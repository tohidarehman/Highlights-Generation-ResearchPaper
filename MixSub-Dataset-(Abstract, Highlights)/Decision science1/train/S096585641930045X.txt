 The provision of sufficient job opportunities has traditionally been a primary objective for both local and central governments . In response to this concern we investigate spatial dependence of job opportunities among 30 Chinese provincial capital cities from 2002 to 2016 giving special attention to the spatial spillovers of the opening of the high speed rail . Using appropriate spatial panel data models our findings suggest the presence of significant spatial autocorrelation of job opportunities among PCCs . Whilst the HSR has been found to increase job opportunities at the national level which however is not confirmed at the regional level . The spatial spillover effects of the HSR are significant and positive only in the eastern northeastern region . These findings can help the central government to more fully understand spatial dependence of job opportunities better plan future HSR networks and efficiently allocate transportation resources encouraging cross regional collaboration to promote regional employment .
