 Public transit serves users with a broad range of physical capabilities and design needs . However information about the operational effects of diverse users interacting with the transit system is scarce . This paper examined the occurrence and effects of boarding and alighting passengers with mobility aids or with large items on bus stop dwell time in a fixed route bus service . On board video data from low floor public transit buses serving Ann Arbor Michigan were used from 199 bus stops with at least one passenger boarding or alighting with a mobility aid or encumbered with a large item and an additional 1642 bus stops without any mobility aids or encumbrances . A sequence of linear regression models examined the relationship between dwell time and the addition of variables representing passengers with mobility aids and encumbrances and use of the on vehicle access ramp beyond explanatory variables typically used in dwell time analysis . Accounting for passengers boarding alighting with mobility aids and encumbrances

@highlight Effect of passengers with mobility aids and encumbrances on dwell time was examined.
@highlight Video data on 1841 on route bus stops from a fixed route service were analyzed.
@highlight Variables on ramp use and encumbered passengers added to models of log dwell time.
@highlight Variance explanation in the regression models increased from 46 to 56 .
