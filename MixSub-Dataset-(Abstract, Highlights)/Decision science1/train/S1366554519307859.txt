 A multiple delivery points service that matches a vehicle to distribute goods from a merchant to multiple retailers is a novel and important business model in freight O2O platforms . Thus far the distribution matching strategy that does not consider the pricing strategy has found wide use in practice . In this study using mixed integer linear programming we propose an assignment matching strategy that jointly optimizes the matching and pricing strategies with optimal delivery routes to multiple retailers . Based on practical data from Zallsoon a famous freight O2O platform in China the results show that the proposed assignment matching strategy has the potential to improve the pickup distance by 7581.81 . Further the choice of pricing strategies could contribute 6093.33 in improvements to the transportation cost for cities with various order structures and promotion levels . Finally the high starting fare and low extra charge rate strategy is preferred for high tier cities whereas the step toll strategy is recommended for low tier cities .
