 In this paper we propose for the first time a closed form multiple discrete grouped extreme value model that accommodates grouped observations on consumptions rather than continuous consumptions . For example in a time use context respondents tend to report their activity durations in bins of time . Or when reporting annual mileages driven for each vehicle owned by a household it is unlikely that households will be able to provide an accurate continuous mileage value and so it is not uncommon to solicit mileages in grouped categories such as 04 999 miles 50009 999 miles 10 00014 999 miles and so on . Similarly when reporting expenditures on different types of commodities services individuals may round up or down to a convenient dollar value of multiples of 10 or 100 . In some other cases a product itself may be available only in specific package sizes . In this paper we use the so called linear outside good utility MDCEV structure of Bhat to show how the model can be used for grouped consumption observations . Of course this is also possible because the linear outside good utility does not need a continuous budget value and allows for unobserved budgets . We discuss an important identification issue associated with this linear outside good utility model and proceed to demonstrate applications of the proposed model to the case of weekend time use choices of individuals and vehicle type use choices of households .

@highlight A new multiple discrete grouped extreme value model is proposed.
@highlight A linear utility profile is used for the outside good for a closed form structure.
@highlight Identification issues with the proposed model are presented and discussed.
@highlight The model is shown to be quite robust to the grouping windows for consumption data.
@highlight The model is applied to a time use case study and a vehicle use case study.
