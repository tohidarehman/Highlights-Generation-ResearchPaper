 This paper presents the development of a multilevel optimization framework for the design and selection of departure routes and the distribution of aircraft movements among these routes while taking the sequence and separation requirements for aircraft on runways and along selected routes into account . The main aim of the framework is to minimize aircraft noise impact on communities around an airport and the associated fuel consumption . The proposed framework features two consecutive steps . In the first step for each given Standard Instrument Departure multi objective trajectory optimization is utilized to generate a comprehensive set of possible alternative routes . The obtained set is subsequently used as input for the optimization problem in the second step . In this step the selection of routes for each SID and the distribution of aircraft movements among these routes are optimized simultaneously . To ensure the feasibility of optimized solutions for an entire operational day the sequence and separation requirements for aircraft on runways and along selected routes are included in this second phase . In order to address these issues three novel techniques are developed and added to a previously developed multilevel optimization framework

@highlight The route design and flight allocation problems are considered in a linked manner.
@highlight Three novel techniques are developed and integrated into the proposed framework.
@highlight The reliability and efficiency of the proposed approach are evaluated.
@highlight The framework can offer conflict free solutions outperforming the reference case.
