 The paper studies a closed loop supply chain focusing on managing scheduling and routing problems to achieve economical and environmental sustainability . Generally a logistic based green supply chain is studied to help multiple stakeholders . Here we investigate the CLSC to reduce the total transportation cost including carbon emission from a heterogeneous fleet with limited capacity . The forward chain includes manufacturers depots distributors collectors and customers . In the reverse chain the distributors collect the returned items and sort into three groups through quality screening and send them to the secondary chain facilities which one is fitted . This investigation is contributed by all the demonstrating issues through considering customers demand an extensive emission display and the vulnerability of an expanded convey of vehicles . The proposed model addresses four distinct environmental policies viz . cap carbon tax cap and purchase and cap and sale for carbon emission regulations . The model is formulated in the framework of mixed integer non linear programming and an exact approach is employed to obtain the optimal solution . The theoretical results of the model are verified through numerical examples . A comprehensive analysis is presented to monitor the rate of return products and various fleet transporting parameters .

@highlight Considers a novel closed loop supply chain with heterogeneous fleet.
@highlight Develops and analyses carbon emission regulations mandated by Government.
@highlight Analyses the conflict between transportation cost and carbon emission cost.
@highlight Evaluates the performance of the multi objective model with a case study.
