 Road traffic congestion is the result of various phenomena often of random nature and not directly observable with empirical experiments . This makes it difficult to clearly understand the empirically observed traffic instabilities . The vehicles acceleration deceleration patterns are known to trigger instabilities in the traffic flow under congestion . It has been empirically observed that free flow pockets or voids may arise when there is a difference in the speeds and the spacing between the follower and the leader increases . During these moments the trajectory is dictated mainly by the characteristics of the vehicle and the behaviour of the driver and not by the interactions with the leader . Voids have been identified as triggers for instabilities in both macro and micro level which influence traffic externalities such as fuel consumption and emissions . In the literature such behaviour is usually reproduced by injecting noise to the results of car following models in order to create fluctuations in the instantaneous vehicles acceleration .
