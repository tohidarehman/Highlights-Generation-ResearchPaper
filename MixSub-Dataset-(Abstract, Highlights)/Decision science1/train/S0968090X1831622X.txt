 In the era of smart cities Internet of Things and Mobility as a Service private operators need to share data with public agencies to support data exchanges for living lab ecosystems more than ever before . However it is still problematic for private operators to share data with the public due to risks to competitive advantages . A privacy control algorithm is proposed to overcome this key obstacle for private operators sharing complex network oriented data objects . The algorithm is based on information theoretic k anonymity and using tour data as an example where an operators data is used in conjunction with performance measure accuracy controls to synthesize a set of alternative tours with diffused probabilities for sampling during a query . The algorithm is proven to converge sublinearly toward a constrained maximum entropy under certain asymptotic conditions with measurable gap . Computational experiments verify the applicability to multi vehicle fleet tour data they confirm that reverse engineered parameters from the diffused data result in controllable sampling error and tests conducted on a set of realistic routing records from travel data in Long Island NY demonstrate the use of the methodology from both the adversary and user perspectives .

@highlight A privacy control mechanism is proposed to allow mobility operators to share data.
@highlight An algorithm is proposed to generate a tour set and diffusion to maximize entropy.
@highlight The algorithm tests illustrate how to control the tour diffusion by accuracy tolerance.
@highlight The algorithm is illustrated in a case study of shared taxi tours from Long Island trips.
