 This paper proposes a methodology to characterize and evaluate the performance of the aircraft operation in complex systemized terminal manoeuvring area based on the study of its standard routes structure and their actual traffic .

@highlight Trajectory analysis could be used to determine the deviation of aircraft trajectories.
@highlight Predicting deviation patterns in the airspace helps to improve air traffic control.
@highlight Determining where when are conflicts produced help to release the airspace.
@highlight London s terminal airspace contains high adherence and low adherence routes.
