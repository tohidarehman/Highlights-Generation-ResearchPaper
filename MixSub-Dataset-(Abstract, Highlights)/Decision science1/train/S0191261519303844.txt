 Thanks to the development of mobile computing novel traffic data sources are emerging as the promising building blocks for more effective traffic control strategies . It is expected that the vehicle space time trajectories will become ubiquitously available in foreseeable future . Real time trajectory data will provide full spectrum pattern of traffic dynamics among multiple intersections . In this paper we present a new traffic control representation for multiple intersections . A new multi intersection phase is proposed to represent safe vehicle movements across a few tightly connected intersections . All the intersections are also viewed as one integral super intersection within which vehicles move according to their planned paths . Through scheduling the sequence and durations of MI phases over time the vehicles will be crossing intersections with minimal delays . This approach can provide more flexibilities for traffic control coordination than the traditional
