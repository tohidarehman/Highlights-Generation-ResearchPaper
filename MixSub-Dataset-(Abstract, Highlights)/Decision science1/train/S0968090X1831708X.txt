 Optimal cordon metering rates are obtained using Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams in combination with flow conservation laws . A model predictive control algorithm is also used so that time varying metering rates are generated based on their forecasted impacts . Our scalable algorithm can do this for an arbitrary number of cordoned neighborhoods within a city . Unlike its predecessors the proposed model accounts for the time varying constraining effects that cordon queues impose on a neighborhoods circulating traffic as those queues expand and recede over time . The model does so at every time step by approximating a neighborhoods street space occupied by cordon queues and re scaling the MFD to describe the state of circulating traffic that results . The model also differentiates between saturated and under saturated cordon metering operations . Computer simulations of an idealized network show that these enhancements can substantially improve the predictions of both the trip completion rates in a neighborhood and the rates that vehicles cross metered cordons . Optimal metering policies generated as a result are similarly shown to do a better job in reducing the Vehicle Hours Traveled on the network . The VHT reductions stemming from the proposed model and from its predecessors differed by as much as 14 .

@highlight Neighborhood MFDs are re scaled to account for effects of cordon queues.
@highlight Simulation experiments reveal that re scaled MFDs better predict traffic performance.
@highlight Cordon metering plans are found to be more effective as well.
