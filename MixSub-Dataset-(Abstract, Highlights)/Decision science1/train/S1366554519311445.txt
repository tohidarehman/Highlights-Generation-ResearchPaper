 Consumers are usually uncertain about the product value in the online channel . They may feel disappointed if the outcome is worse than their prior expectation . This paper explores the effect of consumer disappointment aversion on the online sellers decisions about pricing ordering and quick response where the seller can implement either a partial coverage strategy or a full coverage strategy . We identify conditions under which the seller should choose a partial coverage strategy to target only high value consumers . Furthermore we show that disappointment aversion has a significant impact on the employment of quick response . In particular when the degree of disappointment aversion is sufficiently high the seller who implements a no refund policy should not adopt quick response . Finally we find that the effect of consumers disappointment aversion on the sellers profit depends on the latters return policy . If the seller provides no refund to consumers disappointment aversion is always detrimental to the seller . However a seller who provides a full refund to consumers may benefit from disappointment aversion . Particularly it is profitable to adopt a full refund policy when disappointment aversion and salvage value exceed certain thresholds .
