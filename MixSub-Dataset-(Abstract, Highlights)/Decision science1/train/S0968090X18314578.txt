 The electrification of city bus systems is an increasing trend with many cities replacing their diesel buses with battery electric buses . Due to limited battery capacities and to random battery discharge rateswhich are affected by weather road and traffic conditionsBEBs often need daytime charging to support their operation for a whole day . The deployment of charging infrastructures as well as the number of stand by buses available has a significant effect on the operational efficiency of electric bus systems . In this work a stochastic integer program has been developed to jointly optimise charging station locations and bus fleet size under random bus charging demand considering time of use electricity tariffs . The stochastic program is first approximated by its sample average and is solved by a customised Lagrangian relaxation approach . The applicability of the model and solution algorithm is demonstrated by applications to a series of hypothetical grid networks and to a real world Melbourne City bus network . Managerial insights are also presented .
