 This manuscript is focused on transit smart card data and finds that the release of such trajectory information after simple anonymization creates high concern about breaching privacy . Trajectory data is large scale high dimensional and sparse in nature and thus requires an efficient privacy preserving data publishing algorithm with high data utility . This paper describes the investigation of the publication of non interactive sanitized trajectory data under a Differential Privacy definition . To this end a new prefix tree structure an incremental privacy budget allocation model and a spatial temporal dimensionality reduction model are proposed to enhance the sanitized data utility as well as to improve runtime efficiency . The developed algorithm is implemented and applied to real life metro smart card data from Shenzhen China which includes a total of 2.8 million individual travelers and over 220 million records . Numerical analysis finds that compared with previous work the proposed model outputs sanitized dataset with higher utilities and the algorithm is more efficient and scalable .

@highlight Quantitatively measure the privacy breach risks of transit smart card data.
@highlight A privacy preserving data publishing PPDP algorithm is proposed.
@highlight The proposed algorithm outperforms two previous models on data utility and runtime efficiency.
