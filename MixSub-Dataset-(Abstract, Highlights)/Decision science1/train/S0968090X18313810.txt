 The area based heterogeneous traffic has significant differences from the lane based homogeneous traffic . In area based traffic drivers generally ignore the lane markings and perceive the entire road space while progressing longitudinally . The traditional car following and lane changing models are not directly applicable to model such driving behaviour .

@highlight A novel microscopic modelling framework for area based non lane based heterogeneous traffic flow.
@highlight MNL model for the area selection of the vehicle movement.
@highlight Modified IDM model for the movement of the vehicle.
@highlight Model is throughly tested and applied on real trajectory data from India.
