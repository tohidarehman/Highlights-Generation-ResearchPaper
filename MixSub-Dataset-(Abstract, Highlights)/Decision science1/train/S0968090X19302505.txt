 This paper considers a last mile delivery system in which a delivery truck operates in coordination with a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles . Deploying UAVs from the truck enables customers located further from the depot to receive drone based deliveries . The problem is first formulated as a mixed integer linear program . However owing to the computational complexity of this problem only trivially sized problems may be solved directly via the MILP . Thus a heuristic solution approach that consists of solving a sequence of three subproblems is proposed . Extensive numerical testing demonstrates that this approach effectively solves problems of practical size within reasonable runtimes . Additional analysis quantifies the potential time savings associated with employing multiple UAVs . The analysis also reveals that additional UAVs may have diminishing marginal returns . An analysis of five different endurance models demonstrates the effects of these models on UAV assignments . The model and heuristic also support anticipated future systems that feature automation for UAV launch and retrieval .

@highlight A new extension to the ying sidekick TSP is presented.
@highlight This problem assigns one truck and multiple heterogeneous drones to deliver parcels.
@highlight Queueing of drone launch and retrieval activities is included in the formulation.
@highlight A three phase heuristic solves problems with 100 customers and 4 drones.
@highlight Numerical analysis provides insights into system behaviors and heuristic performance.
