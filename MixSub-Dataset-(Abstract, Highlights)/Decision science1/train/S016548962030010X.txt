 Discrimination against born and unborn females is a well documented phenomenon in countries such as India China Taiwan or Korea . Empirical studies support both additive and substitutive relationships between prenatal and postnatal discriminatory practices against females . We introduce a theoretical evolutionary model that endogenizes the preference for sons in a society and consequently can explain why one type of relationship or the other emerges in a society .

@highlight We propose an evolutionary model of prenatal and postnatal sex discrimination.
@highlight The model assumes that societal son preference is endogenous.
@highlight We analyze the effect of gaining access to sex selective abortion technologies.
@highlight We characterize the type of relationship substitutive or additive in each society.
@highlight A rise in societal son preference is necessary to obtain an additive relationship.
