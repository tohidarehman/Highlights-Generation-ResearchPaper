 Lane change prediction can reduce traffic accidents and improve traffic flow . To predict lane changes variables which describe lane changes are needed . Recent studies used different classifiers and different inputs for lane change classification and prediction . Here different methods are used to extract the relevant input variables from a data set which was generated from a naturalistic driving study in the urban area of Chemnitz Germany . First variables which show different characteristics for left and no lane changes were chosen . The variables contained driver attributes environment attributes and vehicle attributes . Second different combinations of these input variables were analyzed with the principal component analysis . In the end the best combinations were used to classify left lane changes with an Echo State Network and a feedforward neural network . The Echo State Network achieved high area under the curve values true positive rates and low false positive rates for the classification with a majority of the input combinations . The feedforward neural network predictions were inferior of those to the Echo State Network .
