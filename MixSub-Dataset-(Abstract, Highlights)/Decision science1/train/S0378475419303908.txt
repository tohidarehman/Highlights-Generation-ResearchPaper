 Wavelets provide sparse representations of integral and differential operators through a multiresolution approximation . This property is well suited for adaptive implementation of numerical techniques which is a common topic among researchers nowadays . The current state of the wavelet theory also allows flexible construction of transforms customized to certain applications which is an important feature considering that the generalization of wavelet techniques to a large class of real world numerical simulations is still limited . In this paper it is proposed an adaptive wavelet finite element method for achieving operator orthogonality between approximation spaces a property which eliminates coupling among levels of resolution a common shortcoming of adaptive methods . The resulting method is easily extended to any given finite element application and requires less computation power when compared to other adaptive techniques . These features are showcased by comparing the proposed technique to the popular
