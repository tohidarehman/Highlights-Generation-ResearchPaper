 This paper proposes a new hyperpath based dynamic trucking equilibrium assignment model . Unlike existing freight assignment models we focus on the interactions between individual truck operators that solely compete for loads advertised on an online freight exchange . The competitors are assumed to follow optimal bidding and routing strategies represented using a hyperpath to maximize their expected profit . The proposed DTE model predicts system wide truck flows identifies efficiency improvements gained by network wide visibility and lays the foundation for building a system optimal model . We rewrite the DTE conditions as a variational inequality problem and discuss the analytical properties of the formulation including solution existence . A heuristic solution algorithm is developed to solve the VIP which consists of three modules a dynamic network loading procedure for mapping hyperpath flows onto the freight network a column generation scheme for creating hyperpaths as needed and a method of successive average for equilibrating profits on existing hyperpaths . The model and the solution algorithm are validated by numerical experiments constructed from empirical data collected in China . The results show that the DTE solutions outperform with wide margin the benchmark solutions that either ignore inter truck interactions or operate trucks according to suboptimal routing and bidding decisions .
