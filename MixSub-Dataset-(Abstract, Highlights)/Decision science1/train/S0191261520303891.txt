 This paper introduces the heterogeneous multicrew scheduling and routing problem in road restoration . The MCSRP consists of identifying the schedule and route of heterogeneous crews that must perform the restoration of damaged nodes used in the paths to connect a source node to demand nodes in a network affected by extreme events . The objective is to minimize the accessibility time defined as the time that the demand nodes remain unconnected from the source node . The main contributions of the paper include three novel mathematical formulations that differ in the way of modeling the scheduling decisions and the synchronization of the crews and the development of valid inequalities based on some particular properties of the problem . Additionally we prove that the MCSRP is NP hard . Extensive numerical experiments with randomly generated instances and a case study based on floods and landslides disasters in Rio de Janeiro Brazil are performed to assess the efficiency and applicability of our approach . In particular we show that the valid inequalities significantly improve the solvability of the mathematical models . In terms of managerial implications our results suggest that the incorporation of multiple crews helps to reduce the worst case accessibility times across the demand nodes thus providing more equitable solutions .

@highlight The heterogeneous multicrew scheduling and routing problem in road restoration is introduced.
@highlight Three mathematical formulations and valid inequalities are developed.
@highlight Valid inequalities are based on the dominance of the paths between nodes in the damaged network.
@highlight The approach is validated through real world instances based on floods and landslides in Rio de Janeiro Brazil.
