 As every user knows buses tend to bunch . To alleviate this problem transit agencies introduce slack into their schedules and then hold buses back to schedule at pre established control points along their routes . Unfortunately this practice retards buses and only works with low frequency systems i.e . when the headways are long . For higher frequency systems which effectively operate without a schedule headway based control strategies show promise but unfortunately they also retard buses . To alleviate bus retardation in all its forms transit signal priority is commonly used . Curiously however the potential of TSP to enhance bus control practices has not been explored in detail .

@highlight Design a form of conditional signal priority CSP to enhance bus control.
@highlight Evaluate CSP for both forms of bus service schedule based and headway based.
@highlight Find that CSP improves reliability considerably.
@highlight Find that CSP is better for traffic because it sends fewer priority requests.
