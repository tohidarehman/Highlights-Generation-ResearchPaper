 We examine the cash holding decisions of global shipping firms in response to a change in geopolitical risk . Our results show that shipping companies significantly increase their cash reserves after GPR rises . The positive impact of GPR is more pronounced for firms with greater financial constraints . A further analysis shows that GPR positively and significantly affects dry bulk and container firms but has an insignificant impact on tanker and logistics firms . We also find that GPR positively affects the corporate cash decisions of Asian listed shipping companies but not those of other globally listed shipping companies . This study calls for policymakers to implement appropriate monetary and fiscal policies .
