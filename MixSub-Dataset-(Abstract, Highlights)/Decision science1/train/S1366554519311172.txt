 The cordon based large truck restriction regulation makes large truck based cargo movement process interrupted because large trucks are deterred from moving into some specified areas within given time periods . As a result cargoes carried by a large truck need to be transferred from the large truck to small ones at a freight distribution center for the last few miles . This study aims to analyze the multiple equilibrium behaviors for auto travellers and one freight carrier under the CBLTRR . A link flow based generalized Nash equilibrium model is first developed to characterize mixed routing behaviors of these two types of users . In the model auto travellers follow first Wardropian principle to find their individual shortest paths while the freight carrier minimizes its total freight cost . We then proceed to explore the existence and uniqueness of pure strategy equilibrium and reduction to variational inequality . When the pure strategy equilibrium does not exist or is intractable we propose an approach to construct a mixed equilibrium with restricted action space . The restricted action space is formed based on recurring best responses of two types of users which could reflect their actual interactive decisions of a non cooperative traffic pattern evolution . A solution algorithm is developed to find those equilibriums . The developed models and solution algorithms are evaluated and their potential applications are illustrated through numerical experiments .
