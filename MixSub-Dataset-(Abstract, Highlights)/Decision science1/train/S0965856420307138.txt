 Origin Destination matrices obtained from smartcard data are very valuable because they contain vast amounts of information and can be obtained at a very low cost . However they can only account for trips paid by smartcard . Trips paid by other means as well as non paid trips must be incorporated using additional information . This paper discusses the biases that are introduced due to fare evasion and presents a sequential method to estimate correction factors due to partial evasion in some trip stages as well as total fare evasion in all trip stages using external information regarding trips not registered in the smartcard database . We apply this method to the case of Santiago Chile where partial evasion and total evasion are relevant fare evasion situations . Information from the Santiago Metro Origin Destination survey and from external fare evasion measurements is used . The results indicate a 5 partial evasion rate for bus trip stages prior to Metro trip stages and a 37 total fare evasion rate for bus only trips . This paper is a contribution towards establishing new methods to feasibly obtain OD matrices through the adequate merging of automatically collected data with complementary traditional measurements and survey instruments .

@highlight This paper presents a methodology to correct OD matrices obtained from smartcard data which in presence of fare evasion are incomplete and may be biased.
@highlight We distinguish partial fare evasion only one trip stage from complete trip fare evasion.
@highlight The application shows that complete trip fare evasion is more relevant than partial fare evasion in Santiago de Chile.
@highlight This is a first step of a work that can be enriched considering other types of fare evasion and other data sources.
