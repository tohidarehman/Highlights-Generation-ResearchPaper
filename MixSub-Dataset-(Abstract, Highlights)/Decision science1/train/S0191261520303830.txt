 In discrete choice modeling model misspecifications may lead to limited predictability and biased parameter estimates . In this paper we propose a new approach for estimating choice models in which we divide the systematic part of the utility specification into a knowledge driven part and a data driven one which learns a new representation from available explanatory variables . Our formulation increases the predictive power of standard DCM without sacrificing their interpretability . We show the effectiveness of our formulation by augmenting the utility specification of the Multinomial Logit and the Nested Logit models with a new non linear representation arising from a Neural Network leading to new choice models referred to as the
