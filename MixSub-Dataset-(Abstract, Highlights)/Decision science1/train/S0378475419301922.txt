 In this paper an appropriate control technique is investigated to reduce vibration and noise in switched reluctance motors . Vibrations are mainly caused by radial force acting on salient poles of the motor . In order to determine this force a no linear model for switched reluctance motor is developed based on finite element calculation of inductance and natural frequencies of stator . Thus the force component at a frequency close to natural frequency of stator should be reduced . In this context a method of two steps commutation is also applied . To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method the electro mechanical acoustic developed model makes possible to define theoretical spectrum of vibration and noise with conventional and proposed method . The simulation results showed that the proposed method performs better in terms of vibration and noise reduction .
