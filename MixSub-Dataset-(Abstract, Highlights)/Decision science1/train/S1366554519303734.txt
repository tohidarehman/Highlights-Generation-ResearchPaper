 The rise of e commerce has increased the demands placed on pickup and delivery operations as well as customer expectations regarding the quality of services provided by those operations . One strategy a logistics provider can employ for meeting these increases in demands and expectations is to complement and coordinate its fleet operations with those of for hire third party logistics providers . Herein we study an optimization problem for coordinating these operations the time dependent profitable pickup and delivery problem with time windows . In this problem the logistics provider has the opportunity to use its fleet of capacitated vehicles to transport shipment requests for a profit from pickup to delivery locations . Owing to demographic and market trends we focus on an urban setting wherein road congestion is a factor . As a result the problem explicitly recognizes that travel times may be time dependent . The logistics provider seeks to maximize its profits from serving transportation requests which we compute as the difference between the profits associated with transported requests and transportation costs . To solve this problem we propose an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm . The results of our extensive computational study show that the proposed algorithm can find high quality solutions quickly on instances with up to 75 transportation requests . Furthermore we study its impact on profits when explicitly recognizing traffic congestion during planning operations .

@highlight We discuss the time dependent profitable pickup and delivery problem.
@highlight We introduce an ALNS heuristic to solve this problem.
@highlight To reduce computation time a simple and approximate route evaluation is employed.
@highlight We show that large size instances can be solved within a relatively short CPU time.
@highlight This study discuss the effect of considering the time dependency in the planning.
