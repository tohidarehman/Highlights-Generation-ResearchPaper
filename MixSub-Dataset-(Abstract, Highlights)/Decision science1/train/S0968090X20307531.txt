 In this paper a novel transport planning model system is formulated built on the concepts of network multi modality integrity and instant calibration . In the proposed formulation activity travel pattern choice elements including the choices of activity activity sequence mode departure time and parking location are all unified into a time dependent ATPs generator . The proposed model accounts for the dynamicity of the network including time of day and congestion effects in a joint structure for transport supply and demand . Moreover the proposed TPMS explicitly formulates an operating capacitated public transport system . To allow visiting locations multiple times and to alleviate the complexity of the proposed model a novel multi visit vehicle routing problem is proposed which does not enumerate the node and link visits . In order to calibrate the model based on the major travel attributes of the travel survey data a set of splitting ratios are introduced to distribute trips on the network . The model uses the splitting ratios to integrate the ATPs generator and the traffic assignment model in a unified TPMS structure . The effectiveness of the proposed structure is demonstrated through numerical examples provided .
