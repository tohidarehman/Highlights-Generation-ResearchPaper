 We study blood supply network optimization considering disasters where only a small number of historical observations exist . A two stage distributionally robust optimization model is proposed in which uncertain distributions of blood demand are described by a moment based ambiguous set to optimize blood inventory prepositioning and relief activities together . To solve this intractable DRO with integer recourse an approximate way is developed to transform it into a semidefinite program . A case study based on the Longmenshan Fault in China validates that our approach outperforms typical benchmarks including deterministic stochastic and robust programming . Sensitivity analysis provides helpful managerial insights .
