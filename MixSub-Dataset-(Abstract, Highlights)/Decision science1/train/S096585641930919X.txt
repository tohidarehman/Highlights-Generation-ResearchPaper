 Understanding the impact of weather on travel behavior provides insight into building a reliable and resilient transport system . This study uses a survey on residents and subway ridership data from 2014 to 2018 in Beijing to explore the relationship between weather and travel behavior . The results indicate that extreme weather events can affect recreational travel greatly reduce travel demand and change travel modes as well . The respondents are inclined to choose subway or cars rather than buses and bicycles under inclement weather days . The analysis of subway ridership confirms that weekends trips are more sensitive to weather conditions . Monthly temperature change shows a bigger effect on ridership than daily temperature change . A one degree increase in effective temperature increases ridership by about 0.5 on weekends while heavy rain reduces ridership by about 8 . Wind speed and air pollution show significantly negative but small effects on ridership on weekends . Besides there is a non linear relationship between temperature and ridership on weekends . These findings suggest that subway is less vulnerable to inclement weather and can be complementary to other travel modes . However prevention measures are necessary for the subway system to face threats from heavy rain .

@highlight The respondents tend to choose subway and cars under extreme weather.
@highlight Weather variables show almost negligible effects on subway ridership at weekdays.
@highlight Monthly temperature variation shows stronger effect than daily variation on subway.
@highlight A nonlinear relationship exists between temperature and subway ridership on weekends.
