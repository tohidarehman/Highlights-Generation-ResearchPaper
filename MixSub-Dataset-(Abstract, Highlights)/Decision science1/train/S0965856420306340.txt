 Detailed ridership analytics requires refined data on transit ridership to understand factors affecting ridership . However detailed data for stop based boarding and alighting information are not readily available for the entire bus system . Transit agencies usually resort to compiling ridership data on a sample of buses operating on the various routes . We propose an approach to infer stop level ridership for transit systems that only compile route level ridership information . A joint model structure of binary logit and fractional split model is proposed to estimate stop level ridership data sourced from route level ridership . The model is developed for the Greater Orlando region with ridership data for 8 quadrimesters from May 2014 through December 2016 . In the presence of repeated data measures panel version of the joint econometric models for boarding and alighting are estimated . The development of such an analytical framework will allow bus systems with only route level ridership data to generate stop level ridership data . The model results offer intuitive results and clearly supports our hypothesis that it is feasible to generate stop level ridership with route level ridership data . For transit agencies with ridership data at the stop level the proposed model can also be employed to understand how various stops along a route interact with one another toward affecting route level ridership contributions .

@highlight The study relates route level transit ridership to stop level ridership.
@highlight A panel joint model of binary logit and fractional split model is proposed.
@highlight Stops with ridership vs. no ridership are examined by using binary logit model.
@highlight Fractional split model is used to identify the proportion of route level ridership.
@highlight The result shows the feasibility of getting stop level data with route level data.
