 We analyze the optimal control of disease prevention and treatment in a basic SIS model . We develop a simple macroeconomic setup in which the social planner determines how to optimally intervene through income taxation in order to minimize the social cost inclusive of infection and economic costs of the spread of an epidemic disease . The disease lowers economic production and thus income by reducing the size of the labor force employed in productive activities tightening thus the economys overall resources constraint . We consider a framework in which the planner uses the collected tax revenue to intervene in either prevention or treatment . Both optimal prevention and treatment policies allow the economy to achieve a disease free equilibrium in the long run but their associated costs are substantially different along the transitional dynamic path . By quantifying the social costs associated with prevention and treatment we determine which policy is most cost effective under different circumstances showing that prevention is desirable whenever the infectivity rate is low .

@highlight We analyze a macroeconomicepidemiological model with health economy feedback effects.
@highlight We compare the effectiveness of health policy in the form of treatment and prevention.
@highlight Both policies allow to achieve disease eradication but they imply different costs.
@highlight We show that prevention treatment is most desirable when the infectivity rate is low high .
