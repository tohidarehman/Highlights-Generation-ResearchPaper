 This study analyzes carpool in morning commute using a bottleneck model that allocates a fraction of the bottleneck capacity to a high occupancy vehicle or a high occupancy toll lane . Commuters are homogeneous cost minimizers who participate carpool through a platform either as solo driver carpool driver or carpool rider . At user equilibrium no commuter can unilaterally lower her cost by switching to a different departure time carpool role or road facility . Because a rider can use the in vehicle time more productively than her driver she enjoys a cost benefit that grows with the journey time . Therefore the driver must be compensated more when travel delay due to congestion is longer . This requirement is fulfilled through a time dependent carpool ratio that determines how much a driver is paid . We characterize and numerically obtain the UE solutions for this dynamic carpool problem . Results of numerical experiments show that the HOV lane promotes carpool and boosts welfare . The larger capacity the HOV lane is allocated the greater benefit it offers to the system . In addition an HOT lane can bring additional welfare gains with a modest level of toll .

@highlight An HOV lane promotes carpool and boosts welfare.
@highlight The larger is the capacity of the HOV lane the greater benefits does it offer.
@highlight An HOT lane brings additional welfare gains with a modest level of toll.
