 The efficiency of automated container terminals primarily depends on the synchronization of automated guided vehicles and automated cranes . Accordingly we study the integrated rail mounted yard crane and AGV scheduling problem as a multi robot coordination and scheduling problem in this paper . Based on a discretized virtualized network we propose a multi commodity network flow model with two sets of flow balance constraints for cranes and AGVs . In addition two side constraints are introduced to deal with inter robot constraints to reflect the complex interactions among terminal agents accurately . The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers method is adopted in this study as a market driven approach to dualize the hard side constraints therefore the original problem is decomposed into a set of crane specific and vehicle specific subtasks . The cost effective solutions can be obtained by iteratively adjusting both the primal and dual costs of each subtask . We also compare the computational performance of the proposed solution framework with that of the resource constrained project scheduling problem model using commercial solvers . Comparison results indicate that our proposed approach could efficiently find solutions within 2 optimality gaps . Illustrative and real world instances show that the proposed approach effectively serves the accurate coordination of AGVs and cranes in automated terminals .
