 Travel mode identification is among the key problems in transportation research . With the gradual and rapid adoption of GPS enabled smart devices in modern society this task greatly benefits from the massive volume of GPS trajectories generated . However existing identification approaches heavily rely on manual annotation of these trajectories with their accurate travel mode information which is both economically inefficient and error prone . In this work we propose a novel semi supervised deep ensemble learning approach for travel mode identification to use a minimal number of annotated data for the task . The proposed approach accepts GPS trajectories of arbitrary lengths and extracts their latent information with a tailor made feature engineering process . We devise a new deep neural network architecture to establish the mapping from this latent information domain to the final travel mode domain . An ensemble is accordingly constructed to develop proxy labels for unannotated data based on the rare annotated ones so that both types of data contribute to the learning process . Comprehensive case studies are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed approach which notably outperforms existing ones with partially labeled training data . Furthermore we investigate its robustness to noisy data and the effectiveness of its constituting components .
