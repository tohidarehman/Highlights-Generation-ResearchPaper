 Bi modal or 3D MFD relates the accumulation of cars buses to total production at the network level . The current work provides a detailed discussion of extended MFD based models namely accumulation based and trip based models that accounts for bi modal flows through 3D MFD . In addition delay accumulation based models also known as exit flow models in classical traffic flow theory are revisited . Fundamental modeling differences between different MFD based models are illustrated using a benchmark test case . A new FIFO based entry flow function is also proposed in order to address the inconsistencies of the conventional entry flow function in the context of the 3D MFD case . A novel weak internal FIFO discipline is proposed to circumnavigate the violation of internal FIFO order during network unloading in the delay accumulation based model . MFD based models are verified using the solutions of micro simulations performed on an idealized grid network . The importance of separating the 3D MFD into partial car and bus 3D MFDs is highlighted . Moreover it is also shown that partial bus 3D MFD should be further split when dedicated bus lanes are present in the network to account for unequal mean speeds between different bus lanes .
