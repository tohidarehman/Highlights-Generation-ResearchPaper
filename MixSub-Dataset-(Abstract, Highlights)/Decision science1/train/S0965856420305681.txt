 This study used a survey technique to investigate factors that motivate the adoption and the usage frequency of ride sourcing among students in a Malaysia public university . Two of the most broadly used machine learning techniques Random Forest technique and Bayesian network analysis were applied in this study . Random Forest was employed to establish the relationship between ride sourcing usage frequency and students socio demographic related factors built environment considerations and attitudes towards ride sourcing specific factors . Random Forest identified 10 most important factors influencing university students use of ride sourcing for different travel purposes including study related shopping and leisure travel . These important predictors were found to be indicators of the target variables in Bayesian network analysis . Bayesian network analysis identified the students age safety perception and neighbourhood facilities in a walkable distance as the most important predictors of the use of ride sourcing among students to get to school shopping and leisure respectively .

@highlight We have identified significant factors influencing the ride sourcing usage frequency.
@highlight We have used Random Forest technique to select the most important factors.
@highlight We have used Bayesian Network method to predict the use frequency of ride sourcing.
