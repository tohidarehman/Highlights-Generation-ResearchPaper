 In this paper we study a single vehicle routing problem with stochastic service times stochastic time dependent travel times and soft time windows where the travel times may be interdependent . The objective is to minimize the expected route duration plus penalties for late arrivals . The stochasticity is modeled using a set of scenarios based on historical data . This approach enables the spatial and temporal interdependencies in the road network to be captured . We introduce a specialized branch and bound algorithm and a successful adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for the problem . In a numerical experiment based on real historical travel time data we demonstrate the applicability of both methods to problem instances of up to 40 customers and 40 scenarios . These dimensions are safe upper bounds for instances originating from the field service operation domain . The resulting routes are tested on realistic scenarios that were not included in the problem input to demonstrate the merits of using historical data . Compared with solutions that ignore the time dependency and or stochasticity of the parameters our solutions are consistently superior .
