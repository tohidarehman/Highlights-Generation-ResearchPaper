 Vehicle to vehicle communication enabled cooperation of multiple connected vehicles improves the safety and efficiency of our transportation systems . However the joining and leaving of vehicles and unreliability of wireless communication channels will cause the switching of communication topology among vehicles thus affecting the performance of multi vehicle systems . To address this issue a distributed model predictive control method is proposed for multi vehicle system control under switching communication topologies . First an open loop optimization problem is formulated within which neighbor deviation and self deviation penalties and constraints are incorporated to ensure stability . Then a DMPC algorithm is designed for multi vehicle systems subject to switching communication topologies . For the closed loop system the convergence of predicted terminal states is proved based on the neighbor deviation constraint . After that closed loop system stability is analysed based on a common Lyapunov function defined using a joint neighbor set . It is proved that asymptotic stability of the closed loop system can be achieved through a sufficient condition on the weight matrices of the open loop optimization problem . Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DMPC controller .
