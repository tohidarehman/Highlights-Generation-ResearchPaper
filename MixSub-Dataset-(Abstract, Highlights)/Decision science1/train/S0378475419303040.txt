 A numerical simulation study of heat transfer analysis is considered with perforated insert using a different angle of perforation in a circular pipe . In our simulation we have used 0 5 10 15 16 17 20 30 40 50 60 65 68and 70angles of perforation respectively in a perforated axial insert considering the non isothermal laminar flow . The inserts are used perpendicular to the fluid flow inside a pipe . A uniform heat flux around the circular tube is assumed for our simulations . The temperature and pressure distribution are measured for a different angle of perforation . The relation between heat transfer rate and wall temperature is observed and found that the heat transfer rate increases inversely with the wall temperature . The effect of Nusselt number and friction factor are the diagnosis for all including angles and Reynolds numbers . The Thermal Performance Evaluation Criterion is also analyzed in this study .

@highlight A numerical study of heat transfer analysis is considered with different angle of perforated insert.
@highlight A computational model based on non isothermal laminar flow to describe the heat transfer characteristics.
@highlight At the 65angle the Nusselt number and thermal PEC tend to be higher than all other angles.
@highlight The fluid temperature varies inversely up to a saturated level with the gradual increase of high Reynolds number.
