 Wireless communication is being used as an enabling technology with traditional fixed traffic control systems in this transitional era toward Intelligent Transportation Systems . Unfortunately major security concerns have arisen with respect to ever increasing complexity and interconnectivity and a noticeable lack of attention for security in these systems . Addressing concerns is a colossal challenge as it requires thorough development and formal analysis of a system model with respect to security . To tackle this challenge we present a novel formal attack modeling and impact analysis methodology based on the Link Queue Model of traffic flow inside a double ring road network which is equivalent to a grid network with homogeneous links . We develop attack models as functions of tampered traffic control settings with outputs equivalent to mobility impacts on the traffic network . Further for a given attack model we define and identify vulnerable states states that are critical to protect because they lead to negative impacts under the given attack model . Using our methodology we found that for certain vulnerable states after only a few cycles of tampered control settings an attacker could cause a real impact of 1.5x speed up in gridlock state convergence or 37 99 drop in the asymptotic average flow rate . These results imply potentially drastic financial costs for cities and all involved drivers if similar attacks were performed on a real traffic control system .
