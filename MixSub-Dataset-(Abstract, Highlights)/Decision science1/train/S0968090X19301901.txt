 Autonomous Vehicles may become widely diffused as a road transport technology around the world . However two conditions of successful adoption of AVs are that they must be synchronously shared to avoid negative transport network and environmental consequences and that high levels of public acceptance of the technology must exist . The implications of these two conditions are that travellers must accept sharing rides with unfamiliar others in Shared Autonomous Vehicles . Two factors that have been identified as being positive influencers of acceptance are comfort and trust . The present paper undertakes a novel examination as to how comfort and trust ratings are affected by specific attributes of the ride experience of travelling in a fully automated real world shared vehicle . To this end 55 participants experienced riding in an SAV shuttle under experimental conditions at a test facility . Each experimental run involved two unrelated participants accompanied by a safety operative and a researcher undertaking four trips in the SAV during which two conditions were presented for each of the independent variables of direction of face and maximum vehicle speed . Order of presentation was varied between pairs of participants . After each run participants rated the dependent variables trust and comfort . Expected and evaluative ratings were also obtained during pre experimental orientation and debriefing sessions . Statistically significant relationships

@highlight Novel contribution analysing user trust and comfort in a shared autonomous vehicle.
@highlight Statistically significant relation between trust and speed and direction of face.
@highlight Strong correlation between comfort and trust.
@highlight Car drivers in particular showed increased favourability after the experience.
