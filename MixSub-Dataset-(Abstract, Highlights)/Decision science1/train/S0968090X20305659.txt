 This study addresses the problem of calibrating utility maximizing nested logit activity based travel demand model systems . After estimation it is common practice to use aggregate measurements to calibrate the estimated model systems parameters prior to their application in transportation planning policy making and operations . However calibration of activity based model systems has received much less attention . Existing calibration approaches are myopic heuristics in the sense that they do not consider the fundamental inter dependencies among choice models and do not have a systematic way to adjust model parameters . Also other purely simulation based approaches do not perform well in large scale applications . In this study we focus on utility maximizing nested logit activity based model systems and calibrating aggregate statistics such as activity shares mode shares time dependent mode specific OD flows and time dependent mode specific sensor counts . We formulate the calibration problem as a simulation based optimization problem and propose a stochastic gradient based solution procedure to solve it .

@highlight We formulate the ABM calibration problem as a simulation based optimization problem.
