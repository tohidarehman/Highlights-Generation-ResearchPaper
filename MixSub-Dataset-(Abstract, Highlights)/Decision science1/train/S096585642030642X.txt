 Government sectors often provide guarantees in build operate transfer roads to attract private investments . Since a fiscal burden would be incurred from the contingent liability of issuing a guarantee charging a fee for the guarantee is considered an effective remedy for management of contingent liabilities in practice . This study incorporates the charge mechanism for minimum traffic guarantee into consideration and proposes a method to choose the optimal concession contract variables with a paid MTG . We find that the government sector will specify a lower toll and a higher capacity for a BOT road with a paid MTG . As a result the society suffers a social welfare loss when providing a paid MTG . Meanwhile both the charging fee of an MTG and the guaranteed traffic volume would increase the loss of social welfare which means the incentive mechanism of private participation and the management of contingent liabilities are all at the expense of social welfare . Moreover since the welfare loss is magnified under a high marginal social cost condition the government should set the charging fee and guaranteed traffic volume according to the marginal social cost level . In addition to obtain more insights this paper has made two extensions to further investigate the effects of a paid MTG

@highlight To manage contingent liabilities government sets a charging mechanism of guarantee.
@highlight Optimal BOT contract is investigated under a paid MTG program.
@highlight A paid MTG program is at the expense of the social welfare.
@highlight The impact of guarantee program on welfare loss is amplified by marginal social cost.
@highlight The risk averse attitude would lower service quality and decrease social welfare.
