 In air traffic management research aircraft performance models are often used to generate and analyze aircraft trajectories . Although a crucial part of the aircraft performance model the aerodynamic property of aircraft is rarely available for public research purposes as it is protected by aircraft manufacturers for commercial reasons . In many studies a simplified quadratic drag polar model is assumed to compute the drag of an aircraft based on the required lift . In this paper using surveillance data we take on the challenge of estimating the drag polar coefficients based on a novel stochastic total energy model that employs Bayesian computing . The method is based on a stochastic hierarchical modeling approach which is made possible given accurate open aircraft surveillance data and additional analytical models from the literature . Using this proposed method the drag polar models for 20 of the most common aircraft types are estimated and summarized . By combining additional data from the literature we propose additional methods allowing aircraft total drag to be calculated under other configurations such as when flaps and landing gears are deployed . We also include additional models allowing the calculation of wave drag caused by compressibility at high Mach number . Though uncertainties exist it has been found that the estimated drag polars agree with existing models as well as CFD simulation results . The trajectory data performance models and results related to this study are shared publicly .
