 In the shipping industry forwarders can purchase a one stop service from an ocean shipping company or a dual ocean inland service from an OS company and an individual inland shipping company . Additionally the OS company can strategically decide whether or not to enter the downstream market for cargo canvassing which will form a co opetition relationship with incumbent forwarders . We investigate a strategy matrix based on the following two questions What kind of shipping service should be purchased by the forwarder Is it beneficial for OS company to enter the market We find that when the forwarders cargo canvassing effort level is low a dual service purchasing strategy will benefit both the stakeholders while market entry is a self interested behavior and hurts the forwarder . Enhancing the cargo canvassing effort level may help the forwarder to overcome this dilemma . However with an increasing level of effort there is a mutual inhibition of dual service purchasing and market entry which hurts both the stakeholders profits simultaneously . Interestingly we show that a win win situation exists when the forwarder adopts a dual service purchasing strategy without market entry . Furthermore we verify that this win win situation is Pareto optimized .

@highlight Dual service purchasing and market entry problems are investigated.
@highlight Dual service purchasing benefits the stakeholders.
@highlight The market entry is a self interest behavior and hurts the forwarder.
@highlight Mutual inhibition exists under the high effort level of cargo canvassing.
@highlight Win win strategy and Pareto optimization are identified and interpreted.
