 This paper investigates the effect of carbon tariffs on global emission control . We propose a global supply chain model consisting of a retailer in an emission regulated country and supplier in a non emission regulated country . The equilibrium solutions are obtained and the effects of a carbon tariff on global emission control are studied . Through analytical study and numerical study we find that a carbon tariff does not necessarily reduce global emissions under certain circumstances . The paper discusses insights and the carbon tariff policy implications from this finding .

@highlight The effect of carbon tariffs on global carbon emission control is examined.
@highlight Two specific strategic responses of supply chain managers are explicitly considered.
@highlight Charging a carbon tariff does not necessarily reduce global emissions.
@highlight Managerial implications for policymaking are presented via a numerical study.
