 A cooperative game with transferable utility is a situation in which players can generate worth by cooperating and obtain a certain payoff via a sharing rule . In this paper we assume that the cooperation between players is restricted by an acyclic graph . We introduce new sharing rule for this type of game . We also offer an axiomatization of this sharing rule based mainly on linearity and a consistency axiom . For unanimity games this sharing rule identifies the center of the graph .

@highlight We introduce a new sharing rule for cooperative games on acyclic graphs.
@highlight Its characterization revolves around associated consistency along with other axioms.
@highlight All axioms are proved to be logically independent.
@highlight This sharing rule offers new results for cooperative games on acyclic graphs.
@highlight The results are widely opposed to those of the Myerson value.
