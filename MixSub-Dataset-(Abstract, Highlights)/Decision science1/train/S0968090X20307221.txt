 The present study investigates the determinants of the volatility of passenger demand for paratransit services and explores the feasibility of a data driven model for medium term forecast of the daily demand . Medium term demand forecasting is a significant insight to optimise resource allocation and reduce operations costs . Using operational data from the reservation platform of the paratransit services in Toulouse France and enriching them with exogenous information the study derives statistical and deep learning models for medium term forecast . These models include a seasonal ARIMAX model with rolling forecast a Random Forest Regressor a LSTM neural network with exogenous information and a CNN neural network with independent variables . The seasonal ARIMAX model yields the best performance suggesting that when linear relationships are considered econometric models and deep learning models do not have significant differences in their performance . All the models show limited ability to grasp unique events with multi day impacts such as strikes . Albeit a highly volatile demand and limited knowledge ahead of the forecast these models suggest the volume of early reservations is a good proxy for the daily demand .

@highlight Daily demand of demand responsive paratransit services is highly volatile.
@highlight Weather conditions do not seem significant to explain the variability of the daily demand.
@highlight The volume of reservations 7days ahead and the type of day are significant proxy for forecasting daily demand.
@highlight Statistical models with exogenous information provide similar accuracy with deep learning models such as LSTM and CNN.
