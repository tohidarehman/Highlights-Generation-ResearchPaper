 We introduce a class of numerical schemes for optimal stochastic control problems based on a novel Markov chain approximation which uses in turn a piecewise constant policy approximation EulerMaruyama time stepping and a Gau Hermite approximation of the Gauian increments . We provide lower error bounds of order arbitrarily close to 1 2 in time and 1 3 in space for Lipschitz viscosity solutions coupling probabilistic arguments with regularization techniques as introduced by Krylov . The corresponding order of the upper bounds is 1 4 in time and 1 5 in space . For sufficiently regular solutions the order is 1 in both time and space for both bounds . Finally we propose techniques for further improving the accuracy of the individual components of the approximation .
