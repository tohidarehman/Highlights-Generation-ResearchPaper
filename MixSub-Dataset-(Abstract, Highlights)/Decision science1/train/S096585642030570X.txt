 On road freight transportation predominates in in the Metropolitan Region of So Paulo railways and other means of transportation do not have the same importance being is responsible for around a large quantity greenhouse gases emissions . This manuscript presents an assessment of urban road freight in the MRSP based on primary metrics carried out by the Municipalitys survey in 2016 on light and heavy duty vehicles . Origin and destination freight activity indicators provide a baseline for assessing trends in efficiency and operational performance . These descriptive and key performance indicators come directly and indirectly from the O and D company vehicle survey and identify space and temporal distributions of main freight transport sources by vehicle and commodity types . This paper addresses the need to use the vehicle survey to understand road freight activity and transportation in MRSP and with successive editions of the freight survey it will be possible to track the development of the commoditys transport content to reveal a chronological development in freight logistics and emissions . As the metropolitan region sprawls it is important to track these metrics in order to define and evaluate sound measures and policies to improve life and air quality . Assumptions and analyses of freight road transport in So Paulo find significant new perspectives to handle several issues in order to assess and improve vehicle utilization fuel efficiency and CO
