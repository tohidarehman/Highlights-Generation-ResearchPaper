 We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Cournot equilibrium for a class of demand functions when firms are identical and produce under constant returns to scale . We focus on inelastic and convex demand yielding non concave profit functions . We show that equilibrium is unique stable and yields well behaved comparative statics . The model can yield huge welfare losses non downward sloping Laffer curves and tax reforms that are never Pareto improving . In the Appendix we generalize our results on existence and uniqueness to more general inverse demand functions and non identical firms .
