 In this paper we present a noncooperative sequential bargaining game with transferable utility . Instead of assuming exogenous protocol or random proposer recognition we provide a mechanism in which the protocol is generated endogenously . Besides a partial breakdown probability is considered rather than a discount factor when the proposal is rejected by some player . We show that for each partial breakdown probability stationary subgame perfect equilibria exist if the characteristic function game is totally balanced . Moreover the outcomes of stationary subgame perfect equilibria in our model coincide with the core allocations .

@highlight We introduce a bargaining game with endogenous protocol and partial breakdown.
@highlight Our mechanism implements the core in stationary subgame perfect equilibria.
@highlight Our mechanism can also be extended to implement the coalition structure core.
@highlight The existence of no delay stationary subgame perfect equilibria for general cases is discussed.
@highlight Some related studies and comparisons are involved.
