 This study examines the relationship between transport logistics foreign direct investment and economic growth in developing countries over the period 20002016 . A global panel data comprising of 46 developing countries were collected and divided into three sub panels European and Central Asian countries Middle East North African and Sub Saharan countries and East Asian Pacific and South Asian countries . Using GMM estimators we found that all underlying variables influence each other in the long run . The direction of causal relationship between the variables tended to vary across panels with different levels of significance . The results arising out of empirical analysis imply that transport and logistics infrastructure do contribute to FDI attractiveness and sustainable economic growth . These results would be of particular interest to policymakers working in developing countries and help them design and develop modern transportation and logistics coupled with interlinked technological factors which could possibly be used for sustainable economic development and which in turn would attract FDI .

@highlight We study the dynamic linkages among transport logistics FDI and economic growth.
@highlight Empirical investigation considers 46 developing countries between 2000 and 2016.
@highlight The 46 countries have been divided into three sub groups.
@highlight We use the GMM estimators for econometric investigation.
@highlight Positive and significant causal relationships are found between the variables.
