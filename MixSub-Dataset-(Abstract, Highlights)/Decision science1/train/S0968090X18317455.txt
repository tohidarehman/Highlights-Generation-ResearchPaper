 Reducing the number of transfers and improving the operating speed are key factors in enhancing the competitiveness of urban rail transit systems . This paper proposes an integrated optimization with tactical cross line planning and an operational express train mode to fully utilize line capacities and reduce the total trip time without additional operating costs and investments . In this paper a new mixed integer non linear programming model is proposed for systemically exploring the benefits of cross line express trains to achieve both passenger travel time and operation cost savings in this model the frequencies stopping patterns and operation zones of cross line express trains and local trains are simultaneously optimized . The characteristics of same line trips and cross line trips under various stopping patterns are investigated . Additionally a genetic algorithm is developed based on the MINLP model . Finally the effectiveness of the proposed model and heuristic algorithm is verified through a set of real life instances based on the Beijing URT network . The results show that the number of transfers can be reduced by 78 with a 3.34 savings of travel time and a 4.66 savings of operating costs when the cross line express operating mode is properly adjusted .

@highlight Transfer routes choice and in vehicle time saver under the variable stopping patterns and turn back stations for cross line trains.
@highlight Frequency setting requirements on both lines caused by headway constraints between cross line trains and local trains running on the same track.
@highlight The established model ISPOM can be applied to most real world URT networks to quantify the effectiveness of the cross line express operation mode in practice due to no requirements on overtaking facilities equipped.
