 In recent years there has been a tremendous change in the landscape of mobility offerings with the introduction with the introduction of Uber and Lyft companies collectively known as Transportation Network Companies otherwise known as ridesourcing companies . Due to the nascency of these companies there is a small but rapidly growing body of literature on the impacts these TNCs are having on traditional forms of shared ride modes however most of the emerging literature centers on the relationships between TNC and only one other shared mode of transportation . This research attempts to contribute to the literature by examining the relationship between TNCs and multiple shared ride modes simultaneously . To this end a joint modeling framework was used to study New York City ridership data for TNCs taxi services bikesharing and the subway from January 2015 to June 2017 . The goal of the research presented is two fold explore the dynamic relationships between TNCs and other modes of shared ridership as well as to build a predictive model for the daily ridership usage for each modal offering and total daily ridership usage . To accomplish these tasks we first used a
