 This article captures the implications of technology supportive of high level autonomous vehicles eclipsing the capacity of regulators to respond . To date policy makers and industry actors have avoided confronting the impending gap a consequence of the fact that current levels of vehicle autonomy are sufficiently low that accountability for decision making affecting the operation of vehicles still resides with the driver . However as automotive firms achieve higher levels of vehicle autonomy and control shifts to the vehicle itself and the infrastructure supporting it the preponderance of responsibility will transfer to different actors automotive firms autonomous vehicle programmers and policy makers . This article explains and quantifies the challenges that will arise as that process unfolds . It does this by introducing four ethics and value based foundations that can be used to guide programming of decisions to be made by autonomous vehicles . The purpose is

@highlight We simulate autonomous vehicles actions based on four ethics or value orientations.
@highlight The results demonstrate the challenges of regulating autonomous vehicle decisions.
@highlight Failure to regulate could derail proliferation of high level autonomous vehicles.
