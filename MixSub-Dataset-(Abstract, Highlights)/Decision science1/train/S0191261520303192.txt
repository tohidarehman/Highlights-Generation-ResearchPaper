 This paper solves the problem of optimizing a surcharge reward scheme and analyzes equilibrium properties incorporating commuters departure time choice to relieve crowding and queuing congestion in mass transit systems . The surcharge reward scheme incentivizes commuters to switch departure times from a pre specified central period to shoulder periods . We formulate a bilevel model to design and optimize the surcharge reward scheme . The upper level problem minimizes the total equilibrium costs by determining the refundable surcharges the rewards and the corresponding central charging period . The lower level problem determines the equilibrium of commuters departure times with respect to generalized travel costs . Equilibrium properties are analyzed and a sequential iterative solution algorithm is developed . We found that the existence of an optimal solution depends on the scheme design and there exists a lower bound on the surcharge to achieve the system optimum . Numerical studies are conducted on a commuting rail line in Copenhagen . The proposed algorithm converges efficiently and the fare incentive scheme can simultaneously reduce the individual trip costs total crowding costs and total queuing time costs . The performance of the scheme increases with the rewards and surcharges up to a point and beyond which it stays unchanged .
