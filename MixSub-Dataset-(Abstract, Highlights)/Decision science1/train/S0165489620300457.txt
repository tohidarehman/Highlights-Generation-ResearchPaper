 This note shows that the egalitarian Dutta and Ray solution for transferable utility games is self antidual on the class of exact partition games . By applying a careful antiduality analysis we derive several new axiomatic characterizations . Moreover we point out an error in earlier work on antiduality and repair and strengthen several related characterizations on the class of convex games .
