 This paper examines the representation and explicit description of social welfare orders on infinite utility streams . It is assumed that the social welfare orders under investigation satisfy upper asymptotic Pareto and anonymity axioms . We prove that there exists no real valued representation of such social welfare orders . In addition we establish that the existence of a social welfare order satisfying the anonymity and upper asymptotic Pareto axioms implies the existence of a non Ramsey set which is a non constructive object . Thus we conclude that the social welfare orders under study do not admit explicit description .

@highlight We introduce a novel version of the Pareto ordering called upper asymptotic Pareto UAP which is weaker than infinite Pareto.
@highlight We prove that UAP is stronger than lower asymptotic Pareto.
@highlight No social welfare order SWO satisfying Anonymity AN and UAP admits a real valued representation for any non trivial domain Y .
@highlight Every SWO satisfying AN and UAP is non constructive in nature for all nontrivial domains Y .
