This paper aims to provide a 50th anniversary review of the bottleneck model research since its inception . A bibliometric analysis approach is adopted for identifying the distribution of all journal publications influential papers top contributing authors and leading topics in the past half century . The literature is classified according to recurring themes into travel behavior analysis demand side strategies supply side strategies and joint strategies of demand and supply sides . For each theme typical extended models developed to date are surveyed . Some potential directions for further studies are discussed .
