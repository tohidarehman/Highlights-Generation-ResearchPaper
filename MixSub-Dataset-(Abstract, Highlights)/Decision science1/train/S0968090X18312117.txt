 Multi day activity travel patterns help create potential vehicle usage profiles that contain vehicle operations and battery status under different scenarios with varying location based charging opportunities based on travel needs and charging availability behaviors . Utilizing a multi day data sampling method analyses of scenarios are designed to provide insights on bounds of potential BEV market under different charging opportunities including level 2 activity charging and level 3 trip charging . Single day data results tend to overestimate travelers BEV feasibility assuming that multi day sample data provides accurate estimations . Facility utilization can be improved without affecting travelers charging demand under correct pricing scheme for most cost sensitive users . Smart grid charging strategy can greatly reduce the total number of operating chargers during the same time in a day and BEV users charging behaviors have minor impact on this improvement . Our numerical results indicate that an appropriate number of chargers installed in shopping and leisure locations should be more profitable and have higher charger utilization rate since those chargers help cover BEV users trips .

@highlight We perform a multi day scenario analysis on potential uses feasibility and charging requirements of Battery Electric Vehicles BEVs . It is shown that single day analysis overestimates BEV feasibilities compared to multi day analysis.
@highlight We employ detailed activity based charging behaviors and assumptions and derive managerial policy and planning insights of charging stations deployment.
@highlight Four different charging demand management strategies immediate charging optimal charging factional average charging and fractional optimal charging are studied and results indicate that these charging strategies reduces infrastructure requirements.
