 The problem of operating exclusive bus corridors that have segments with bidirectional lanes is treated . On these lanes only one direction of movement is allowed when a bus is present . Such construct requires less road space which is a scarce resource in dense urban areas and thus may be the only feasible alternative for the installation of exclusive bus corridors . The system model includes limits on bus passenger capacity . The control method for real time operation integrates bus headway corrections and bus priority through signalized intersections while enforcing mutual exclusion of opposing buses on the bidirectional lanes . Effectively the control avoids bus bunching over the entire corridor and coordinates the passage of opposing buses on bidirectional lanes . The objective is to minimize the total waiting time of passengers both onboard and at stops . Simulation results indicate the applicability of the integrated holding and priority bidirectional lane control method .

@highlight May represent in many cases the only feasible way for system deployment.
