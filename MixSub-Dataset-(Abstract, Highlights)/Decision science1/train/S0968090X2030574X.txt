 This study develops a novel mixed integer non linear program to control the trajectory of mixed connected automated vehicles and connected human driven vehicles through signalized intersections . The trajectory of CAVs is continuously optimized via a central methodology while a new white phase is introduced to enforce CHVs to follow their immediate front vehicle . The movement of CHVs is incorporated in the optimization framework utilizing a customized linear car following model . During the white phase CAVs lead groups of CHVs through an intersection . The proposed formulation determines the optimal signal indication for each lane group in each time step . We have developed a receding horizon control framework to solve the problem . The case study results indicate that the proposed methodology successfully controls the mixed CAV CHV traffic under various CAV market penetration rates and different demand levels . The results reveal that a higher CAV market penetration rate induces more frequent white phase indication compared to green red signals . The proposed program reduces the total delay by 19.6 96.2 compared to a fully actuated signal control optimized by a state of practice traffic signal timing optimization software .
