 Peakcar is characterised by slower rates of growth levelling off or a reduction in car travel . Researchers have paid much attention to this topic recently . However a consensus on possible explanations of the phenomenon remains elusive . Questions remain whether the drivers of travel demand are changing and projection methods need to be revised or the peakcar is purely an external effect and car travel continues to increase when such effects are nullified . The study investigates these issues focusing on Brisbane using six versions of the South East Queensland Household Travel Survey data . Three different analytical methods were employed . First four pooled regression models were estimated to examine the effects of time on travel behaviour controlling for different socio demographics and built environment factors . Second five multiple linear regression models were estimated using 2003 2006 2009 2012 and 2018 datasets to identify behavioural differences between different groups in a specific point in time . Third differences in coefficients as generated in the second stage were estimated to understand whether the behavioural patterns are changing . The findings suggest that car travel in Brisbane a reached a peak in 2003 b experienced a decline throughout 20032012 and c exhibited a levelling off throughout 20122018 . The factors contributed to the peakcar phenomenon in Brisbane are both external and a significant change in the coefficients of some internal factors over the periods .
