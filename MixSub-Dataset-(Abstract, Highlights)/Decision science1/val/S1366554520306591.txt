 Previous studies in blood supply chain network design often follow a commonly used approach in protecting the chain against disruptions considering the effects of disruptions on the designing phase . However in many real world situations disruptions can not be adequately measured in advance . Moreover using disruptions in the designing phase through the common two stage stochastic programming models impose high costs on the network since they can not be updated based on unpredicted disruptions . This paper proposes an updatable two phase approach which deals with disruptions in the operational phase not in the strategic design phase . In the first step called the
