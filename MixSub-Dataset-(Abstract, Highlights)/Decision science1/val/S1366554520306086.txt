 This paper develops a low carbon supply chain consisting of a capital constrained manufacturer and a capital abundant retailer where bank loans and early payment are investigated . Under each power structure there always exists a financing equilibrium i.e . early payment . Compared with bank loans early payment could produce lower carbon emissions and higher social welfare in the retailer led power structure but it damages environment and social welfare and leads to the conflict between profitability and environmental goals in the manufacturer led case . Finally impacts of power structure on financing mechanism carbon emissions and performance are analyzed to provide more managerial implications .

@highlight Financing mechanism of supply chain is analyzed under the cap and trade regulation.
@highlight Impacts of power structure on financing choice profit and environment are studied.
@highlight Financing equilibrium between bank loans and early payment is derived.
@highlight Early payment could outperform bank loans for both firms.
