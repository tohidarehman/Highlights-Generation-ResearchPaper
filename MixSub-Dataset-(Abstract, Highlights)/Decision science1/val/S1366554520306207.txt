 The paper discusses a containers drayage by trucks which is motivated by a real life application arising in the intermodal freight transportation . This problem considers not only classical assumptions of the intermodal transportation but also introduces the availability of containers as a new concept . For this purpose we first describe the industrial context and provide the mathematical optimization model which combines a set of known and new constraints . We then propose a solution approach based on variable neighborhood search algorithm combined with pairing and insertion heuristics as well as with variable neighborhood descent and tabu search methods . Optimization has then been embedded into a simulation model which designs the rail road terminal . To be more specific this optimization model can be used to evaluate several distribution policies which results in a set of routing decisions and can adopt the best policy in a distribution network with competing rail and road transport services . Finally we test the proposed model on real and generated instances characterizing several scenarios to highlight the performance and efficiency of our approach .

@highlight A new container drayage problem with availability constraints is investigated.
@highlight A mathematical mixed integer linear programming model is built.
@highlight A hybrid VNS approach based on VND and Tabu Search is developed.
@highlight The approach is embedded into a simulation to achieve more realistic results.
@highlight Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed approach.
