The research considers customer behaviors greenwashing threats and the different implications of anti greenwashing government enforcement strategies . The results reveal that greenwashing acts are not always performed with negative intent but benefit both green incumbents and total customer surplus if the market greenness gap is small . In addition a loose enforcement level contributes to higher social welfare in emerging markets .
