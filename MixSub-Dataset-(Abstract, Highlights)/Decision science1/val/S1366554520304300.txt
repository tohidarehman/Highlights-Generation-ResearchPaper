 Epidemic outbreaks are a special case of supply chain risks which is distinctively characterized by a long term disruption existence disruption propagations and high uncertainty . We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID 19 on the global SCs . First we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks . Second we demonstrate how simulation based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID 19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software . We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short term and long term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights . A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the models behavior and its value for decision makers . The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the timing of the closing and opening of the facilities at different echelons might become a major factor that determines the epidemic outbreak impact on the SC performance rather than an upstream disruption duration or the speed of epidemic propagation . Other important factors are lead time speed of epidemic propagation and the upstream and downstream disruption durations in the SC . The outcomes of this research can be used by decision makers to predict the operative and long term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and develop pandemic SC plans . Our approach can also help to identify the successful and wrong elements of risk mitigation preparedness and recovery policies in case of epidemic outbreaks . The paper is concluded by summarizing the most important insights and outlining future research agenda .
