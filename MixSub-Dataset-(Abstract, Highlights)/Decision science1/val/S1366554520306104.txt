 In this paper we present a complex network analysis of the air transport network using the air cargo instead of the passenger perspective . To the best of our knowledge this is the first work where a global cargo network comprising passenger airlines full cargo airlines and integrators capacity was studied . We used estimated yearly cargo capacity between airport pairs as input to the model . After assessing network characteristics of the sub networks representing different carrier types the full network was obtained as a super imposition of the individual sub networks . The resulting network has both small world and scale free characteristics . Its topological properties resulted in a higher flow imbalance and concentration with respect to its passenger counterpart with a smaller characteristic path length and diameter . This result is consistent with the larger catchment area of cargo airports which heavily rely on road feeder services for the ground leg . Finally we showed how different attack strategies result in hubs of hub and spoke systems or airports behaving as bridges between communities being attacked first . We believe this work to be of relevance both for academics and for practitioners in an era where due to the soaring of e commerce and next day delivery new players are entering the air cargo business and competition is constantly increasing .
