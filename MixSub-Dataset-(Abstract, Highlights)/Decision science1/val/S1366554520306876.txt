 An O2O channel has advantages over brick and mortar retailing and traditional e commerce in the local market as it facilitates grocery retailers to offer online retailing and offline home delivery . This paper studies how an O2O platform can attract physical grocery retailers through pricing and market expansion and customers by providing shopping convenience and home delivery . We analyze both when the O2O platform has self scheduling delivery capacity and when it does not . We find that two widely used pricing schemesrevenue sharing and fixed feeare equivalent . If the O2O platform does not itself have any self scheduling delivery capacity it outsources home delivery service to a delivery platform which may result in incentive misalignment . We find that it is not always necessary for the O2O platform to coordinate the decentralized system . Under some conditions the decentralized system will yield higher profit than the centralized system due to the risk protection effect . If coordination is needed we propose subsidy contracts for the O2O platform to align its and the delivery platforms objectives .
