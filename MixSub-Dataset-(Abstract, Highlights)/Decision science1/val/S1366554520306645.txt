 Recently companies in emerging markets have implemented green supply chain management practices to tackle environmental issues . Drawing upon socio technical systems theory this study develops a conceptual model suggesting a sequential effect between two distinct categories of GSCM practices namely behavioral and technical practices on performance . We employ structural equation modeling method to test hypotheses based on survey responses from 200 Chinese manufacturers . The categorization of behavioral and technical GSCM practices and research findings contribute to the GSCM literature . Statistical results demonstrate the complete mediation effect of technical GSCM practices on the relationship between behavioral GSCM practices and organizational performance . Such results recommend that companies in emerging markets should highlight behavioral GSCM practices first and then implement necessary technical GSCM practices to reap economic environmental and operational performance .

@highlight Green supply chain management GSCM are classified to behavioral and technical.
@highlight Socio Technical Systems theory is applied to examine GSCM impact on performance.
@highlight Behavioral and technical GSCM practices are positively related to performance.
@highlight Technical practices fully mediate effect of behavioral practices on performance.
