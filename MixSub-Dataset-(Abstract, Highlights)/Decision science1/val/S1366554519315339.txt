Motivated by the fact that SMA is important for SCOM the traditional social media has insufficiency and the blockchain technology supported social media platforms have emerged we explore whether and how the BSM would enhance social media analytics for SCOM . To be specific by reviewing papers published in leading SCOM journals we identify the applications and limitations of SMA for SCOM . Then we conduct real case studies to examine the shortcomings of the TSM platforms and reveal features of their BSM counterparts . We investigate how the blockchain technology would potentially improve the use of SMA for SCOM . Finally a future research agenda is proposed .
