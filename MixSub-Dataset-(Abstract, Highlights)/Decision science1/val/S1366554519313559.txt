 This study is motivated by international retailers cooperating with their suppliers to reduce carbon emissions across supply chains . Information sharing is a strategy often used in collaborative mechanisms and we investigate information sharing and study its effect on carbon emission reduction . We construct a formal Bayesian forecast updating model and find out that information sharing benefits the supplier but hurts the retailer . Demand information sharing has no impact on global emission reduction but significantly reduces the wasted emission i.e . emission from producing unwanted products . Upgrading manufacturing technology provides an incentive for the retailer to share information with a highly cost efficient supplier to achieve the reduction of global emission and wasted emission . Meanwhile consumers green awareness strengthens this effect . We extend the model to investigate the impact of additional ordering cost in QR mode and risk averse decision making behaviors assessing information sharings effects in these cases . We demonstrate that information sharing can amplify treatments positive effects and diminish the measures negative influences when applied in the supply chain . The information sharing mechanism does not always benefit the environment and supply chain contrary to the popular belief that collaborative contracts between retailers and suppliers are always advantageous .

@highlight Integrating the information sharing mechanism into the green supply chain.
@highlight Considering emission reduction rather than traditional side payment as the incentive for information sharing.
@highlight A case study for the fast fashion industry using real world data.
@highlight First study to combine green awareness and risk averse decision maker with information sharing.
@highlight Information sharings enhancement effect and the conditions that favour information sharing are discovered.
