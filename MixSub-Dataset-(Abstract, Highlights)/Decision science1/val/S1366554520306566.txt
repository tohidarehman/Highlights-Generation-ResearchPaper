 In this research a robust optimization approach is proposed to the problem of designing emergency response networks for marine oil spills given uncertainty in the location size and type of the spill . In this regard we formulate two robust models to optimize the allocation of response equipment while considering the underlying uncertainty in each oil spill scenario . An efficient Branch and Cut algorithm is then designed to improve the computational performance . The benefits of applying the robust formulations are illustrated and compared to the non robust model using a realistic case study from Newfoundland .
