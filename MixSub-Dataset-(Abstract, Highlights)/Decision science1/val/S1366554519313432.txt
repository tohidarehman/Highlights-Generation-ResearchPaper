 The rapid development of logistics has increased carbon emissions . Smart Logistics distribution system is a comprehensive logistics system supported by advanced information technology which aims to improve the operation efficiency of the logistics industry and reduce carbon emissions by optimizing resource allocation . Therefore it is of great significance to explore the effects of Smart Logistics policy on China s carbon emissions . This paper used the binary choice model to investigate the main factors influencing the establishment of Smart Logistics in Chinese cities and whether carbon emissions are the cause of the establishment of Smart Logistics . Secondly it analyzed the effect of SLP on carbon emissions using a difference in differences model . The results reveal that freight volume logistics employment and total social retail are important factors determining whether a city should establish Smart Logistics or not . Additionally the decision whether to establish Smart Logistics is an exogenous policy variable to carbon emissions . The implementation of SLP can restrain carbon emissions significantly with a continuous impact in the second year . Based on the findings of this paper a series of policy implications with respect to promote the development of Smart Logistics were proposed .
