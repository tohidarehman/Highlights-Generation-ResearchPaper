 The aim of this study is to analyse the productivity of airports operated by the General Directorate of State Airports Authority in Turkey for a period from 2014 to 2018 using a hybrid method called Weight Restricted EATWOS without Consideration of Satisficing Levels and to offer improvement suggestions . The productivity of the airports was also measured using both equally weighted EATWOS without consideration of satisficing levels and the model of input oriented DEA based on the assumption of constant returns to scale to compare the results obtained using the proposed model with those obtained using traditional methods .

@highlight In this study a hybrid model is proposed for analyzing the productivity of airports.
@highlight The main problems in DEA and or TFP were obviated.
@highlight The large airports should invest in cargo traffic to increase their productivity.
@highlight The small airports should invest in passenger traffic to increase their productivity.
