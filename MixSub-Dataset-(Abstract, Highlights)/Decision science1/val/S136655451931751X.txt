 This paper establishes a modeling framework that incorporates channel costs as a decision variable when smart supply chain technology can be invested in . A traditional manufacturer retailer supply chain is studied and the conditions under which the technology should be invested are identified . Issues of supply chain efficiency and coordination are addressed . A platform supply chain is also investigated and it is found that a platform may invest in reducing the channel cost even if it does not bear any part of this cost . In this case the percentage fee is found to be an important parameter .

@highlight Conditions under which SSC technology should be invested in are identified.
@highlight Channel coordination becomes a more serious issue with SSC technology investment.
@highlight Percentage fee is an important influencing parameter for platform supply chain.
@highlight Platform may have incentive to invest in SSC technology to reduce channel cost.
