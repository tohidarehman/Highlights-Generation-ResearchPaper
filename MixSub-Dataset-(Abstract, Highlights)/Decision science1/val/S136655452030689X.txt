 In emerging markets the growth of supply chain networks and logistics industry leads to a significant increase in energy consumption and induces high carbon emissions . To design a sustainable low carbon supply chain network we consider a carbon emission compliance green location inventory problem . It is characterized by uncertain demand and volatile carbon prices under a multi year emission regulation inspired from the carbon trading scheme in China . A two stage stochastic mathematical model is built and is solved with a three phase hierarchical metaheuristic on extensive numerical experiments which mimic the business context of a supply chain network operated in China . The results show to which extent the carbon trading emission compliance scheme with uncertainties in demand and carbon price impacts the strategic decisions . Besides carbon emissions and supply chain profits of the design solutions produced under alternative emission regulations are evaluated and discussed . We also underline the sensitivity of the amount of carbon emissions to the demand uncertainty and to the level and volatility of the carbon price in the carbon trading system . These results provide managerial insights for supply chain emitters and indicate that reasonable and stable carbon prices should be maintained by governments in emerging markets .
