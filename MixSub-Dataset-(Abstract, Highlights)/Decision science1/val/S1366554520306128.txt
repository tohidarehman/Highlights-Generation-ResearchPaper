 The corona virus outbreak has created serious disruptions to many business operations . Among them many service operations which require customers to travel and visit a place indoor become almost infeasible to run in a crowded city like Hong Kong . Motivated by a recent reported real case on an innovative service operation in Hong Kong we build analytical models to explore how logistics and technologies together can transform the static service operations to become the bring service near your home mobile service operations . We also highlight how the government may provide the subsidy to support the above mentioned mobile service operation to make it financially viable . We specifically show that the government may adopt the fixed cost subsidy scheme operations cost subsidy scheme or safety technology support scheme to help . We further uncover that the OCS scheme would bring a larger consumer surplus than the FCS scheme and is hence more preferable . In the extended models we first study the case when service fee can not be changed because of corona virus outbreak . We then explore the feasibility of adopting MSO in the long run as a financially self sustainable service operation and derive the analytical conditions under which MSO is a win win business model for both the service provider and consumers . Finally we study the optimal safety technology investment problem .
