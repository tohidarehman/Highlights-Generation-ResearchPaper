 The peak load of a bus route is essential to service frequency determination . From the supply side there exist ineffective predicted errors of peak load for the optimal number of trips . Whilst many studies were undertaken to model demand prediction and supply optimization separately little evidence is provided about how the predicted results of peak load affect supply optimization . We propose a prediction model for the peak load of bus routes built upon the idea of newsvendor model which explicitly combines demand prediction with supply optimization . A new cost based indicator is devised built upon the practical implication of peak load on bus schedule . We further devise a scaled Shepard interpolation algorithm to resolve discontinuities in the probability distribution of prediction errors arising from the new indicator while leveraging the potential efficacy of multi source data by adding a novel quasi attention mechanism . The real world application showed that our method can achieve high stability and accuracy and is more robust to predicted errors with higher capacity . Our method can also produce a larger number of better trip supply plans as compared to traditional methods while presenting stronger explanatory power in prioritizing the relative contribution of influential factors to peak load prediction .
