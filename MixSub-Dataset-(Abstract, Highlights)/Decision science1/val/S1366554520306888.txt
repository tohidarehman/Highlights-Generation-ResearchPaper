 This study proposes a data driven approach to understand traveling backward behavior while making a route choice in congested metros . First TB behavior during route choice in overcrowded metros is defined and analyzed . Second a hybrid model comprising three hierarchical Bayesian models is developed to describe the TB behavior . Third a novel sampling method based on Hamiltonian dynamics is introduced to estimate the model parameters . Finally a case study of Beijing metro is discussed to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model . The contributions of application of the proposed model to accurate demand assignment and passenger flow control for metro managers are demonstrated .
