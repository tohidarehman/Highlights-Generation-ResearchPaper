 Storage location and order picking are two interdependent problems arising in warehouse planning traditionally solved independently . We introduce and model the integrated storage location and order picking problem and four special cases with imposed routing policies . Experiments show that these models are difficult to solve even for small warehouses and few orders . Therefore we present a General Variable Neighborhood Search metaheuristic which is observed to be very efficient for those small instances . For larger warehouses and more pickings we show that our metaheuristic significantly improves solutions generated by common storage policies .

@highlight We integrate the storage location and order picking problems in ware house planning.
@highlight Non linear programming models are presented for the problem and four special cases.
@highlight A General Variable Neighborhood Search metaheuristic is developed to solve them.
@highlight We test our algorithms on generated instances similar from literature.
@highlight The integrated problem significantly improves solutions compared to common policies.
