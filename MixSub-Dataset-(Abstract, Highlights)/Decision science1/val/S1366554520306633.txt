 This study considers multiple depots heterogeneous trucks and multiple visiting in a static bike rebalancing optimization problem with malfunctioning bikes in free floating bike sharing system . An integer linear programming model is established for this problem and an effective greedy genetic heuristic is developed to solve it . Share A Bull shared bicycle system is used to test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm . Divvy bike sharing system is utilized to test a large scale instance in real life quantify the benefits of this comprehensive repositioning strategy compared with separate repositioning strategy and analyze some special properties of this comprehensive operation .
