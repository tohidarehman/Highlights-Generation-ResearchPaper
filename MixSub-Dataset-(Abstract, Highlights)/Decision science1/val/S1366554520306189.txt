 The disasters caused by epidemic outbreaks is different from other disasters due to two specific features their long term disruption and their increasing propagation . Not controlling such disasters brings about severe disruptions in the supply chains and communities and thereby irreparable losses will come into play . Coronavirus disease 2019 is one of these disasters that has caused severe disruptions across the world and in many supply chains particularly in the healthcare supply chain . Therefore this paper for the first time develops a practical decision support system based on physicians knowledge and fuzzy inference system in order to help with the demand management in the healthcare supply chain to reduce stress in the community to break down the COVID 19 propagation chain and generally to mitigate the epidemic outbreaks for healthcare supply chain disruptions . This approach first divides community residents into four groups based on the risk level of their immune system and by two indicators of age and pre existing diseases . Then these individuals are classified and are required to observe the regulations of their class . Finally the efficiency of the proposed approach was measured in the real world using the information from four users and the results showed the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach .

@highlight Developed a practical decision support system for COVID 19 healthcare supply chain.
@highlight Grouped people and provided an independent classification method for each group.
@highlight Evaluated the efficiency of the proposed approach using real world data.
