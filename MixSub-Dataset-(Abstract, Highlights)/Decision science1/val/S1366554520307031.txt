 Novel support and repair ships could technically perform comprehensive maintenance and repair work for damaged marine structures on a deep sea . This paper analyses competition in the repair market for marine structures between the shipyard mode and the support and repair ship mode by using game theory . First we present a game theoretical model of competition analysis and pricing strategy based on the lowest expense and derive a closed form to calculate the optimal pricing strategy market share and maximum profit by using partial differentiation with respect to prices . Furthermore a second game theoretical model of competition analysis and pricing strategy considering the choice preference of the repair decision maker is formulated . Based on the characteristics of this model we use the discretization method to decompose it into a finite number of sub models and design an iterative algorithm to efficiently address the sub models . Finally the calculation results prove the high value and attractive prospects for applying the support and repair ship mode in repairing marine structures at sea .
