 Emerging markets have witnessed the logistics volume surge along with economic growth which also brings environmental issues such as packaging waste . Therefore many responsible logistics service providers are observed to put efforts in developing sustainable logistics . Such efforts improve the LSPs brand image to expand the market potential and benefit the original equipment manufacturers who use the LSPs logistics service . In this paper we consider an OEM and a LSPs preferred outsourcing structures by incorporating the LSPs sustainable efforts and the competition with the OEM when it has the self branded business . The introduction of sustainable efforts alter the LSPs cost structure and eventually the supply chain parties preferences over the OEMs procurement outsourcing . For the OEM the bundled outsourcing does not necessarily yield a lower procurement cost than only outsourcing the logistics because the LSP possesses sufficient service pricing flexibility . Interestingly the LSP prefers the OEMs bundled outsourcing when the OEMs brand image advantage is either not significant or very significant . The driving force is the tradeoff between the profits from product sales and outsourcing services . Lastly we compare the environmental performances under alternative outsourcing structures showing the simultaneous improvement of the OEMs profits the LSPs profits and the environmental performance is achievable when the OEM outsources the bundled functions of procurement and logistics .

@highlight OEM with significant brand image advantage has cost saving under Turnkey.
@highlight LSP puts more sustainable efforts given OEMs insignificant brand image advantage.
@highlight The dual profit source structure inflects LSPs outsourcing preferences twice.
@highlight Turnkey could simultaneously improve profitability and environmental performance.
