 Freight forecasting is essential for managing planning operating and optimizing the use of resources . Multiple market factors contribute to the highly variable nature of freight flows which calls for adaptive and responsive forecasting models . This paper presents a demand forecasting methodology that supports freight operation planning over short to long term horizons . The method combines time series models and machine learning algorithms in a Reinforcement Learning framework applied over a rolling horizon . The objective is to develop an efficient method that reduces the prediction error by taking full advantage of the traditional time series models and machine learning models . In a case study applied to container shipment data for a US intermodal company the approach succeeded in reducing the forecast error margin . It also allowed predictions to closely follow recent trends and fluctuations in the market while minimizing the need for user intervention . The results indicate that the proposed approach is an effective method to predict freight demand . In addition to clustering and Reinforcement Learning a method for converting monthly forecasts to long term weekly forecasts was developed and tested . The results suggest that these monthly to weekly long term forecasts outperform the direct long term forecasts generated through typical time series approaches .
