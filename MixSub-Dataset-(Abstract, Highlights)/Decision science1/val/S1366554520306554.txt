 This study contributes to academic literature on bunkering for liner shipping with the application of dual fuel engines in providing fuel flexibility subjected to limited liquefied natural gas bunkering facilities along a subset of the major shipping lanes East of Suez . New LNG bunkering facilities have developed in recent years which is critical to the uptake of LNG as a bunker fuel while with the installation of dual fuel engines vessels operators will now have a choice regarding the main fuel for propulsion . An additional layer regarding the combinatorial aspect of different fuel types to utilize as well choice to bunker at LNG facilities enroute is incorporated subjected to maintaining weekly schedules by speed adjustments .

@highlight Fuel flexibility with Dual Fuel engines as fuel prices change intermittently.
@highlight Fuel flexibility may reduce need for excessive space sacrificed to LNG fuel tanks.
@highlight Multi fuel option might increase shipping sector resilience to high oil prices.
