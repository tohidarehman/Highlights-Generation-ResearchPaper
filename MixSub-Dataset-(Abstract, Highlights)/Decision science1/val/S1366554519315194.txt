A sub group analysis using industry and economy was also performed to study the relative strength of sustainability firm performance relationships in respective categories . The study confirms a positive association between the various aspects of sustainability and firm performance and finds that the strength of sustainability firm performance relationships grows over time . Findings also suggest a stronger relationship between sustainability firm performances in manufacturing industries than in service industries .
