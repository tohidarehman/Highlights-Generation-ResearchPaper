 This paper proposes a scenario based three stage hybrid robust and stochastic model that optimally designs the response network and distributes casualties effectively under uncertain combinational scenarios of primary and secondary disasters . Following the stochastic severity of combinational disasters the robust counterparts are derived against the ambiguous uncertainty of evacuee scales and transportation time respectively . A customized progressive hedging algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian relaxation is developed to solve the problem . We decompose the problem based on the scenario and iteratively solve the adaptively penalized sub problems with decision variables independent of stages . The results of an illustrative example show that incorporating secondary disaster scenarios can contribute to improving relief coverage . The proposed algorithm is competitive with some benchmarks .

@highlight We concern a joint planning of relief logistics and casualty distribution considering secondary disasters.
@highlight We propose a scenario based robust programming under the uncertainty of evacuee scales and transportation time.
@highlight We develop a customized progressive hedging algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian relaxation to solve the problem.
