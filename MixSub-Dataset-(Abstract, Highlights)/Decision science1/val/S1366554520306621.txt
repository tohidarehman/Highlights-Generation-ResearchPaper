 Cooperation is important in order to find efficient vehicle routing solutions for the growing transportation market . Increasingly platforms emerge as facilitators for this kind of collaborative transportation . However individual actors connected to a platform might refuse to share their information due to reasons of competition . Though the need for realistic information sharing models is widely acknowledged by transportation researchers and practitioners the precise value of such information is mostly unknown . We investigate the quality of solutions that can be obtained when different types and levels of carrier data are available . We consider an auction based Multi Agent System to solve large scale dynamic pickup and delivery problems and vary whether carriers positions or route plans are available and whether carriers are fully cooperative or more competitive in placing their bids by sharing or hiding their marginal costs . In total we evaluate 9 different information sharing policies . The availability of vehicle position and route plan information turns out to be important for decreasing total route costs and sharing marginal costs has a positive impact on service level . We provide detailed insights into trade offs of carriers confidentiality concerns and a range of system performance objectives under different circumstances . Based on these results platform providers can stimulate sharing of certain information to improve the total system efficiency .

@highlight We extensively review information sharing modeling in collaborative transportation.
@highlight Our multi agent approach explicitly models the information exchange between actors.
@highlight We assess the value of sharing different levels of carrier data for solution quality.
@highlight Interaction effects of reauctions emission fees capacity and urgency are analyzed.
@highlight Insights for operators into trade offs between privacy and solution quality are given.
