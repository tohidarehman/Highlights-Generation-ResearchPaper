 This study addresses the problem of reducing the energy consumption of the medium speed maglev system by optimizing the train speed profile . Auxiliary stopping areas the nonlinear resistance caused by the linear motor and the suspension energy consumption are considered in the formulation of the speed profile optimization problem . Next dynamic programming and mixed integer linear programming approaches that utilize these characteristics are proposed to solve the problem . The numerical results show that both approaches ensure MSM train safety and energy efficient operation . Furthermore the MILP approach could be used for emergency trajectory planning due to its shorter computational time .
