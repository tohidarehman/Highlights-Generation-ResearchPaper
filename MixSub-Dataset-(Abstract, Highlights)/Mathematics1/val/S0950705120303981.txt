 Epileptic seizure onset detection in electroencephalography signals is a challenging task due to the severe variation of seizures . Recently automatic seizure onset detection frameworks fail to fully consider both nonstationary and stochastic characteristics of EEGs in nature which may lead to information default and further produce suboptimal recognition performance consequently . In this work we propose a patient specific seizure onset detection method based on fully exploration of auxiliary supplementary spectraltemporal information in EEG signals . Specifically prior to feature extraction procedure EEG signals are firstly decomposed into 5 groups of coefficients at different levels based on the clinical interest . Representative feature in temporal domain which is a translation of the nonlinear property of EEG signals is then extracted by a combination of principal component analysis and common spatial pattern and multivariate multiscale sample entropy in parallel and dimensionally reduced by a tree based feature selection algorithm . Supplementary information in spectral domain is further explored by the proposed unified maximum mean discrepancy autoencoder . Finally an optimal combination of features above is identified and fed into a series of support vector machine classifiers with a decision fusion module for the intelligent recognition of epileptic EEGs . The proposed method achieves an average sensitivity latency and false detection rate of 97.2 1.10s and 0.64 h respectively on Children Hospital Boston Massachusetts Institute of Technology Scalp EEG Database . Competitive experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed unified multi level spectraltemporal feature learning framework in epileptic EEG recognition validating its effectiveness in the automatic patient specific seizure onset detection .
