 Human gait is a proven biometric trait with applications in security for authentication and disease diagnosis . However it is one sided to express and interpret gait data from a single point of view which can not reflect multi dimensional characteristics of gait changes . Moreover if the gait pattern observed from other views has pathological or abnormal behavior or has micro movement it is not easy to be detected and thus affects the recognition rate of gait . In addition the multi view fusion of gait knowledge can be challenging due to the close correlation between various visual angles . Owing to the above facts we propose a spiderweb graph neural network to solve the multi view gait recognition problem which connects the gait data of single view with that of other views concurrently and constructs an active graph convolutional neural network . The gait trajectory of each view is analyzed by the combination of a memory module and a capsule module which accomplishes the multi view feature fusion as well as the spatio temporal feature extraction of single view . The experimental results show that the SpiderNet is superior to fifteen state of the art methods such as random forest long short term memory and convolutional neural network and achieves 98.54 98.77 and 96.91 of the results on three challenging gait datasets SDUgait CASIA B and OU MVLP .
