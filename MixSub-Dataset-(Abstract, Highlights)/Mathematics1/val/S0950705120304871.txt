 In cancer research it is important to classify tissue samples in different classes . Gene selection purpose is to find the minimum number of genes that can predict sample classes with efficacy . This work is focused on the gene selection problem by introducing a new hybrid method . This new method combines a first step of gene filtering with an optimization algorithm in a second step to find the best subset of genes for the classification task . The first step uses the Analytic Hierarchy Process in which five ranking methods are used to select the most relevant genes in the dataset . In this way this gene filtering reduces the number of genes to manage . Regarding the second step the gene selection can be divided into two objectives minimizing the number of selected genes and maximizing the classification accuracy . Therefore we have used a multi objective optimization approach . More exactly an Artificial Bee Colony based on Dominance algorithm has been proposed for this second step . Our approach has been tested with eleven real cancer datasets and the results have been compared with several multi objective methods proposed in the scientific literature . Our results show a high accuracy in the classification task with a small subset of genes . Also to prove the relevance of our proposal a biological analysis has been developed on the genes selected . The conclusions of this biological analysis are positive because the selected genes are closely linked to the cancer dataset they belong to .

@highlight A new hybrid method for gene selection has been developed.
@highlight The method combines AHP based gene filtering SVM and ABCD algorithm.
@highlight The evaluation has been performed with 11 cancer datasets of 7 types of cancer.
@highlight Comparisons have been done with 7 multi objective methods from other authors.
@highlight The biological relevance has been evaluated showing the good results of the proposal.
