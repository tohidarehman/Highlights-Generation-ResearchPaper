 Infrared and visible image fusion aims to generate a composite image with salient thermal targets and texture information from infrared image and visible image . Existing advanced methods tend to consume high computational cost for a high quality fusion result . In this paper a simple yet effective method is proposed based on structural patch decomposition . A modified gamma function is proposed to weight the mean intensity component to keep the thermal target . An enhanced power function is used to weight the mean removed component to preserve the texture information . Different from general patch level fusion implemented via a sliding window we convert the explicit structural patch decomposition and fusion into an image level mean filtering via a detailed analysis on input images . By this means the computational cost of the proposed method can be largely reduced which is independent of the patch size . Furthermore we analyze the relationship of our method with classic filtering based image decomposition methods . Finally a multi scale implementation of the proposed method is developed to avoid the evident halo and spatial inconsistency artifacts . Extensive experimental results on the public dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain more texture information and outperform the state of the art fusion method qualitatively and quantitatively .
