 Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and shows a rising trend with the increase of aged . Currently existing intelligent AF detection methods have achieved good results in massive labeled data . However it is time consuming and undesirable to label ECG signals in real applications . Meanwhile due to distribution discrepancy by different testing conditions it is unsatisfied for directly applying trained model to other datasets . Inspired by the domain adaptation techniques this paper proposes a novel Domain Adaptive Residual Network to detect AF of unlabeled datasets with the aid of detection knowledge of labeled dataset . Firstly residual blocks are adopted to extract informative deep features from the ECG signals automatically . Then deep features are fed into feature classifier to acquire final detection result . Further the multi layer multi kernel maximum mean discrepancy is combined into the training process to reduce distribution discrepancy of different domains which imposes constraints on network parameters . Finally the proposed method was evaluated with the data from MIT BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database MIT BIH Arrhythmia Database and 2017 Physionet challenge dataset . The experimental results show that the proposed domain adaptive approach improves the accuracy by 4.50 on average and the F1 score by 4.28 on average using the knowledge of AFDB . Additionally comparison experiment shows that the proposed feature extractor and classifier achieved 98.97 98.75 and 98.84 for the sensitivity specificity and accuracy on the AFDB respectively . Consequently the proposed method is provided with high application potential as a valuable auxiliary tool for clinical AF detection .
