 Multi label learning is facing great challenges due to high dimensional feature space complex label correlations and noises in multi label data . Feature selection techniques have attracted considerable attention to address the problems . In this paper we design our method based on dual graph regularization i.e . feature graph regularization and label graph regularization . The feature graph regularization is used to preserve the geometric structure of features while label graph regularization intends to explore the correlations of labels . Furthermore the
