 Metabolite also known as intermediate metabolite refers to substances produced or consumed in the metabolic processes . There are growing evidences that metabolites play an important role in the study of diseases . Due to the traditional experiments it is time consuming and luxurious to find the associations between metabolite and disease we proposed a computational method called RCNMF to predict metabolite disease associations . Firstly we calculate the disease semantic similarity and the molecular fingerprint similarity of metabolite . The molecular fingerprint similarity of metabolite makes full use of the molecular structure internal information of metabolites . Then we modify the original metabolite disease associations matrix to replace some values of 0 with numbers between 0 and 1 . Finally we use the non negative matrix factorization algorithm to predict potential metabolite disease associations . We adopt the cross validation mechanism to verify the performance of our proposed method . The AUC values of based the Leave one out cross validation measurement and the Five fold cross validation measurement reach 0.9566 and 0.9430 respectively . What is more case studies of common diseases also illustrate the effectiveness of our method . Thus the superior experimental results show that our method can effectively predict the potential disease metabolites associations .

@highlight We develop a computational model called RCNMF to predict the metabolite disease association.
@highlight The molecular structure internal information of metabolite is used to compute the similarity of metabolites.
@highlight Our method achieves good performance by reducing the sparsity of the association between metabolites and disease.
