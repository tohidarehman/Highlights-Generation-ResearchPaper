 Diabetes mellitus is a widespread chronic disease and is one of the main causes of death worldwide . In order to improve the quality of life of people with diabetes and reduce the occurrence of complications it is fundamental to prevent glycemic levels from exceeding the physiologic range . With this purpose many works in recent years have been developed to forecast future glycemic trends using machine learning algorithms that exploit the reading of continuous glucose monitoring sensors which gather glycemic data from diabetic patients 24h a day . However their application is limited in practice by the fact that they usually require a large amount of training data and other heterogeneous features gathered from patients . For this reason in this work we present a novel neural network capable of predicting future glycemic levels using only the past glucose values as input while needing a small amount of training data . The model is a jump neural network with the addition of feedback connections from the output to the hidden layer and time delays for each of the input to hidden output to hidden and input to output connections . Experiments were conducted on a private and a public dataset . We evaluated performance in terms of RMSE and of adverse event detection . The proposed model outperforms other methods suited for time series forecasting as well as models for blood glucose level prediction present in the literature .

@highlight A novel net named Auto Regressive Time Delayed ARTiDe jump neural network is presented.
@highlight It is tested on blood glucose levels prediction using 24h of monitoring data.
@highlight The model exploits a univariate approach reducing the burden of data collection.
@highlight The model outperforms many multivariate approaches at the state of the art.
@highlight A thorough overview of glucose levels forecasting is provided.
