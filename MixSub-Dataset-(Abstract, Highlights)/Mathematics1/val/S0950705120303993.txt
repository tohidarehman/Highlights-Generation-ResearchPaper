 Person re identification refers to matching people across multiple camera views at different times and locations . The challenge is mainly about the huge variance of visual appearance of a specific pedestrian owing to pose variations illumination changes and various camera styles . In this paper an Attention Aware Scoring Learning framework is proposed to address these issues . The proposed AASL framework consists of two attention modules and a score learning head . Specifically the two modules Spatial Attention Grid and Channel Attention Grid embedded respectively in the shallow and deep layer in the convolutional neural network are put forward to help the network learn the most discriminative visual features . Furthermore an adaptive module termed score learning head is proposed to optimize the parameters of the attention modules . The present paper carries out extensive experiments on three large scale datasets including Market 1501 DukeMTMC reID and CUHK03 after which it is found that our Attention Aware Scoring Learning framework significantly outperforms the baseline model and achieves a competitive performance compared with the state of the art person re ID methods .
