 Dragonfly Algorithm is a recent swarm based optimization method that imitates the hunting and migration mechanisms of idealized dragonflies . Recently a binary DA has been proposed . During the algorithm iterative process the BDA updates its five main coefficients using random values . This updating mechanism can be improved to utilize the survival of the fittest principle by adopting different functions such as linear quadratic and sinusoidal . In this paper a novel BDA is proposed . The algorithm uses different strategies to update the values of its five main coefficients to tackle Feature Selection problems . Three versions of BDA have been proposed and compared against the original DA . The proposed algorithms are Linear BDA Quadratic BDA and Sinusoidal BDA . The algorithms are evaluated using 18 well known datasets . Thereafter they are compared in terms of classification accuracy the number of selected features and fitness value . The results show that Sinusoidal BDA outperforms other proposed methods in almost all datasets . Furthermore Sinusoidal BDA exceeds three swarm based methods in all the datasets in terms of classification accuracy and it excels in most datasets when compared in terms of the fitness function value . In a nutshell the proposed Sinusoidal BDA outperforms the comparable feature selection algorithms and the proposed updating mechanism has a high impact on the algorithm performance when tackling FS problems .
