 The support vector machine method has been widely used in gear fault diagnosis . SVM is essentially a convex hull based classifier . However using the CH to approximate the class region underestimates the true region which leads to unsatisfactory classification performance of SVM . The use of hyperdisk based classifiers for classification can effectively avoid the above problem . But the compactness or looseness of the HD model is not adjustable and the HD based classifier has poor robustness to outliers . Therefore to achieve better classification results in gear fault diagnosis a classifier based on extensible and displaceable hyperdisk is proposed . By introducing the extensibility factor the EDHD based classifier allows the compactness or looseness of the HD model to be adjusted to better approximate the class region . Besides by introducing the displaceability factor the EDHD based classifier can achieve higher robustness to outliers . Meanwhile to extract features from unstable and nonlinear signals a new entropy called multiscale fuzzy distribution entropy is proposed . Moreover empirical mode decomposition is used to preprocess the original signal before feature extraction and Laplacian Score is used for feature selection after feature extraction . Finally the EDHD and MFDE based gear fault diagnosis method is proposed . The results of gear fault diagnosis experiments fully prove the effectiveness of the proposed method .
