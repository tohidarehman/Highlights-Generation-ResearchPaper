 Community structure exists in most real world networks such as social networks smart grids and transportation networks . Established approaches for community detection usually depend on some user defined criteria . These criteria based methods usually involve some optimization procedures and need to specify some parameters which are thus time consuming and sensitive to parameters . In this paper inspired by the Mathew effect of human society we view a network as a social system and design a new algorithm called CDME . Relying on the new concept CDME has many desirable properties . It allows uncovering high quality communities driven by dynamic CDME is also parameter free . More importantly since CDME works in a local way and only needs to calculate the attractiveness of neighboring nodes which lend itself to handling large scale networks . Experiments on both synthetic and real world data sets have demonstrated that CDME has many benefits and outperforms many state of the art algorithms .

@highlight We consider the problem of community detection from a new viewpoint the Matthew effect.
@highlight The CDME algorithm has proven to be more efficient and can find high quality communities.
@highlight The CDME method does not need parameter settings.
@highlight The CDME algorithm can be applied to large scale networks.
