 Transient identification of condition monitoring data in nuclear reactor is important for system health assessment . Conventionally the operating transients are correlated with the pre designed ones by human operators during operations . However due to necessary conservatism and significant differences between the operating and pre designed transients it has been less effective to manually identify transients that usually contribute to different system degradation modes . This paper proposes a deep learning based unsupervised representation clustering method for automatic transient pattern recognition based on the on site condition monitoring data . Sample entropy is used as indicator for transient extraction and a pre training stage is implemented using an auto encoder architecture for learning high level features . An iterative representation clustering algorithm is further proposed to enhance the clustering effects where a novel distance metric learning strategy is integrated . Experiments on a real world nuclear reactor condition monitoring dataset validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method which provides a promising tool for transient identification in the real industrial scenarios . This study offers a new perspective in exploring unlabeled data with deep learning and the end to end implementation scheme facilitates applications in the real nuclear industry .
