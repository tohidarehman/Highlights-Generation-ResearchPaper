 Identifying the correct meaning of words in context or discovering new word senses is particularly useful for several tasks such as question answering information extraction information retrieval and text summarization . However specially in the context of user generated contents and on line communication new meanings are continuously crafted by speakers as the result of existing words being used in novel contexts . Consequently lexical semantics inventories and systems have difficulties to cope with semantic drifting problems . In this work we propose an approach to induce and disambiguate word senses of some target words in collections of short texts such as tweets through the use of fuzzy lexico semantic patterns that we define as sequences of Morpho semantic Components . We learn these patterns that we call
