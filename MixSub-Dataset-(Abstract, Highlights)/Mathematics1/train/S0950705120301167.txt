 Locating the propagation source is crucial for developing strategies to control the spreading process taking on complex networks . Gaussian estimator is one of the most effective methods for propagation source locating in networks with limited observers . However on general graphs due to GE makes an approximation that the actual diffusion tree in spreading process is assumed to be a breadth first search tree and thus ignores the effect of direction information recorded in observers . Therefore the accuracy of GE is affected . In this paper by utilizing the direction information in observers we define for the first time a novel direction induced search . Further a direction induced search based Gaussian estimator is proposed by combining DIS and the original GE . Experimental results on a series of synthetic and real networks show that the DISGE is feasible and effective in locating the propagation source with limited observers .
