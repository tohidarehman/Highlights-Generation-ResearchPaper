 In many machine learning tasks it is usually difficult to obtain enough labeled samples . Semi supervised learning that exploits unlabeled samples in addition to labeled ones has attracted a lot of research attentions . Traditional semi supervised methods may encounter uncertainty problems and information loss when dealing with those samples having ambiguous class belongingness . In this paper the uncertainties encountered in semi supervised learning are addressed using the theory of belief functions and semi supervised learning methods based on belief functions are proposed . The proposed methods label the unlabeled data with belief modeling . They can effectively use limited supervised information to facilitate the classification process . Experimental results based on benchmark data sets show that the proposed approaches can effectively exploit unlabeled data and perform better compared with prevailing approaches .

@highlight New disagreement based semi supervised learning approaches are proposed.
@highlight Uncertainty encountered in semi supervised learning is model with belief functions.
@highlight Better performances are obtained with the new proposed approaches.
