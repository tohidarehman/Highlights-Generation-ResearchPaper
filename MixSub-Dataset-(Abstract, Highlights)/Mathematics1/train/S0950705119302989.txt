 Discriminative dictionary learning plays a key role in sparse representation based classification . In this paper we propose a low rank graph preserving discriminative dictionary learning method for sparse representation based image recognition . Specifically we learn a common sub dictionary as well as several class specific sub dictionaries to explicitly capture the common information shared by all the classes and the class specific information belonging to the corresponding class . We also impose a low rank constraint on each sub dictionary to weaken the negative influence from noise contained in training samples . A discriminative graph preserving criterion and a discriminative reconstruction error term are used for exploiting discriminative information which can improve the discriminative ability of the learned dictionary effectively . In addition an incoherence term is also introduced into the proposed dictionary learning model to encourage the learned sub dictionaries to be as independent as possible . Experimental results on several image datasets verify the effectiveness and robustness of LRGPDDL .
