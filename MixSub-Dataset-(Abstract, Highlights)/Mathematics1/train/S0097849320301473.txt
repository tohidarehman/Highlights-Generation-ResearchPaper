 Appearance preservation aims to estimate reflectance functions to model the way real materials interact with light . These functions are especially useful in digital preservation of heritage and realistic rendering as they reproduce the appearance of real materials in virtual scenes . This work proposes an image based process that aims to preserve the appearance of surfaces whose reflectance properties are spatially variant . During image acquisition this process considers the whole environment as a source of light over the area to be preserved and assuming the environment is static it does not require controlled environments . To achieve this goal the scene geometry and relative camera positions are approximated from a set of HDR images taken inside the real scene using a combination of structure from motion and multi view stereo methods . Based on this data a set of unstructured lumigraphs is traced on demand inside the reconstructed scene . The color information retrieved from these lumigraphs is then used to estimate a linear combination of basis BRDFs for a grid of points in the surface area defining thus its SVBRDF . This paper details the proposed method and presents the results obtained using real and synthetic settings . It shows that considering the whole environment as a source of light is a viable approach to obtain reliable results and to enable more flexible acquisition setups .
