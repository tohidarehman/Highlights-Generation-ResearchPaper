 Fault classification methods are a long term research focus in both science society and engineering application . Generally every real world running mechanical system is exhibit personalized vibration behaviors and the corresponding fault samples of such systems are difficult to be obtained . Therefore extreme learning machine a typical fault classification method is failed to attain agreeable fault detection results . In this paper a personalized fault diagnosis method using finite element method simulation and ELM is proposed to detect faults in gears . The method includes three steps . Firstly The FEM model of gears with faults is constructed to obtain fault samples . Secondly to achieve ELM training process the meshing frequency components of each simulation signal is separated into sub signals and the corresponding time and timefrequency domains indicators are served as training samples . Finally the measured vibration signals of gear transmission systems are employed as testing samples of trained ELM to recognize its fault types . The classification accuracy ratios of gear states in a cracked teeth of driving gear a peeled teeth of driving gear a broken teeth of driving gear a peeled teeth of driving gear and a broken teeth of driven gear a broken teeth of driving gear and a broken teeth of driven gear are 85 90 92.5 90 and 85 respectively . It is expect that the proposed personalized fault diagnosis method can set up a bridge between fault classification methods and real world applications .
