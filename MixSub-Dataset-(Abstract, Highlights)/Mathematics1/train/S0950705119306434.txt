 Finding the best compromise between exploration and exploitation phases of a search algorithm is a hard task . The Gravitational Search Algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm based on the Newtons universal law of gravitation . Many studies show that GSA suffers from slow exploitation which generates premature convergence . This paper proposes a Hyperbolic Gravitational Search Algorithm able to find an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation . The main contributions of this work are the definition of suitable hyperbolic acceleration coefficients the dynamic regulation of the gravitational constant coefficient through hyperbolic function and the definition of a decreasing hyperbolic function for the best agents which attract the other agents . The proposed algorithm is compared with well known search algorithms on classical benchmark functions
