 Because of the intrinsic complexity and chaotic nature of wind speed time series an appropriate model for accurately forecasting the moving tendency is required . In this paper we propose an evolutionary dendritic neuron model to carry out wind speed forecasting . The model is trained via adaptive differential evolution with the linear population size reduction algorithm . Specifically a mutual information based approach and the false nearest neighbours method are used to calculate the time delay and embedding dimensions respectively . Then the phase space of the wind speed time series is reconstructed based on the time delay and embedding dimensions and the characteristics are analysed . The maximum Lyapunov exponent is applied to confirm the chaotic properties of the wind speed time series . Finally EDNM trained by L SHADE is used to predict the wind speed for Sotavento which is located near Galicia Spain . This study is the first to the best of our knowledge to use a dendritic neuron model to implement such real world prediction . Extensive experimental results show that the proposed EDNM can perform better than other state of the art models in terms of different assessment criteria . Therefore the proposed method has high potential for practical applications in electric power systems .
