 Companies typically have to make relevant decisions regarding their clients fidelity and retention on the basis of analytical models developed to predict both their churn probability and Net Promoter Score . Although the predictive capability of these models is important interpretability is a crucial factor to look for as well because the decisions to be made from their results have to be properly justified . In this paper a novel methodology to develop analytical models balancing predictive performance and interpretability is proposed with the aim of enabling a better decision making . It proceeds by fitting logistic regression models through a modified stepwise variable selection procedure which automatically selects input variables while keeping their business logic previously validated by an expert . In synergy with this procedure a new method for transforming independent variables in order to better deal with ordinal targets and avoiding some logistic regression issues with outliers and missing data is also proposed . The combination of these two proposals with some competitive machine learning methods earned the leading position in the NPS forecasting task of an international university talent challenge posed by a well known global bank . The application of the proposed methodology and the results it obtained at this challenge are described as a case study .
