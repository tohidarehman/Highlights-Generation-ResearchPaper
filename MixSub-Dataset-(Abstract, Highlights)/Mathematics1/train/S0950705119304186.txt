 Artificial bee colony is a swarm optimization algorithm that shows competitive performance for many optimization problems . However ABC often suffers from poor exploitation and slow convergence . To overcome this deficiency this paper introduces the explosion search mechanism of fireworks algorithm into ABC and proposes a fireworks explosion based artificial bee colony framework . More specifically the proposed FW ABC framework consists of two search stages namely bee search stage and fireworks explosion search stage . After three bee search operators a fireworks explosion search is implemented which is used to exploit the promising regions for finding better solutions . The proposed FW ABC framework is applied to six ABC algorithms and the experimental results show that FW ABC can significantly improve the performances of various existing ABC algorithms on CEC2014 benchmark functions . Moreover FW ABC algorithm also exhibits better performance compared with state of the art fireworks algorithms and other meta heuristic algorithms .
