 The high spread of Internet and social networks have completely changed the way that Group Decision Making methods are designed developed and implemented . Experts now operate in environments where a large amount of information is available and new ideas and participants can appear at any time this results in a dynamically changing decision environment . In this paper a novel group decision making method for dynamic contexts with a high number of decision alternatives is presented . As the main component of the proposal a perceptual computing scheme is used in order to extract information from the experts . In the process sentiment analysis is used when analyzing the debate texts in order to obtain information for selecting the best alternatives on each round . Moreover interval type 2 hesitant Fuzzy Ontologies are used in order to store the information related to alternatives . By combining interval type 2 and hesitant fuzzy sets imprecise information can be represented in a comfortable and intuitive way within the ontology .
