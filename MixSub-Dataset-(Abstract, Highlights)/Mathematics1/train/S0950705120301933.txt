 Chatbots have become the go to platform for users to receive answers to their queries . They are now being used by many businesses too to provide their customers with a virtual assistant to answer their queries . But when it comes to engaging with a user in a dialogue existing chatbots have several shortcomings with issues such as failing to provide a meaningful response to the user offering semantically incorrect information etc . This paper studies the working styles of existing chatbots in generating a response and then identifies their shortcomings from the viewpoint of engaging in a dialogue with a user . It then proposes a domain specific chatbot named IntelliBot which is a response generating dialogue based chatbot that uses multiple strategies to generate a response . IntelliBot was trained on two datasets namely the Cornell movie dialogue and a custom built insurance dataset so it has domain specific knowledge . The performance of IntelliBot was then validated and compared with three other chatbots from the literature namely RootyAI ChatterBot and DeepQA . The results demonstrate IntelliBots superiority in engaging with the user and providing a complete answer in the insurance domain .

@highlight Proposes IntelliBot which is a domain specific chatbot for the insurance sector.
@highlight Response generation is multi strategy reliant on template based knowledge based internet retrieval and generative based strategies.
@highlight In generative based strategy proposes a seq2seq model with attention mechanism in Recurrent Neural Networks RNN .
@highlight Compares the results of IntelliBot and demonstrates its superiority with three existing chatbots in the insurance domain.
