 In hospitals caregivers are trained to chronicle the subtle changes in the clinical conditions of a patient at regular intervals for enabling decision making . Caregivers text based clinical notes are a significant source of rich patient specific data that can facilitate effective clinical decision support despite which this treasure trove of data remains largely unexplored for supporting the prediction of clinical outcomes . The application of sophisticated data modeling and prediction algorithms with greater computational capacity have made disease prediction from raw clinical notes a relevant problem . In this paper we propose an approach based on vector space and topic modeling to structure the raw clinical data by capturing the semantic information in the nursing notes . Fuzzy similarity based data cleansing approach was used to merge anomalous and redundant patient data . Furthermore we utilize eight supervised multi label classification models to facilitate disease prediction . We present an exhaustive comparative study to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches using standard evaluation metrics . Experimental validation on MIMIC III an open database underscored the superior performance of the proposed
