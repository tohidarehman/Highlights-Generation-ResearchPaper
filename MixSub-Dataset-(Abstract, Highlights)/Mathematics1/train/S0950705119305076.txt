 There are many real world complex systems with multi type interacting entities that can be regarded as heterogeneous networks including human connections and biological evolutions . One of the main issues in such networks is to predict information diffusion such as shape growth and size of social events and evolutions in the future . While there exist a variety of works on this topic mainly using a threshold based approach they suffer from the local viewpoint on the network and sensitivity to the threshold parameters . In this paper information diffusion is considered through a latent representation learning of the heterogeneous networks to encode in a deep learning model . To this end we propose a novel meta path representation learning approach Heterogeneous Deep Diffusion to exploit meta paths as main entities in networks . At first the functional heterogeneous structures of the network are learned by a continuous latent representation through traversing meta paths with the aim of global end to end viewpoint . Then the well known deep learning architectures are employed on our generated features to predict diffusion processes in the network . The proposed approach enables us to apply it on different information diffusion tasks such as topic diffusion and cascade prediction . We demonstrate the proposed approach on benchmark network datasets through the well known evaluation measures . The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the earlier state of the art methods .
