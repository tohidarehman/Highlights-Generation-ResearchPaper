 It is very hard if not impossible to use analytical objective functions for optimization of personalized search due to the difficulties in mathematically describing qualitative problems . To solve such optimization problems interactive evolutionary algorithms which can make use of human preferences are highly desirable . However due to the lack of effective encoding methods interactive evolutionary algorithms have been limited to numerically encoded optimization problems . In practice however linguistic terms are the most natural expression of human preferences and they are also commonly used to describe items in personalized search or E commerce therefore language models better suit encoding and the optimization of personalized search is converted into a dynamic document matching problem . To optimize word described personalized search we propose a novel interactive estimation of distribution algorithm . This algorithm combines a language model based encoding approach a Dirichlet Multinomial compound distribution based preference expression and a Bayesian inference mechanism . The proposed algorithm is applied to two personalized search cases to demonstrate the capability of the algorithm in ensuring a more efficient and accurate search with less user fatigue .

@highlight The presented IEDA employs a language model to encode candidate searched items.
@highlight The language model introduces social intelligence and reduces information loss.
@highlight The IEDA adopts Dirichlet Multinomial distribution as its probabilistic model.
@highlight The probabilistic model is updated with Bayesian learning to track variable.
@highlight Then a faster personalized search can be expected.
