 With projection mapping we can control the appearance of real world objects by adding illumination . A projector can be used to control light reflected from an object where the reflected light depends not only on the projection but also on the reflectance and environmental light . Because the resulting colors are affected by the reflectance and environmental light the presentable color range of a projector is limited . The purpose of this work is to broaden this limited range by focusing on the perceived colors . Although our eyes capture reflected light to perceive the colors of an object the colors perceived by humans are not always the same as the actual colors and there are often significant differences between them because of the human visual system . To overcome the limitations of a projector based on human perception we intentionally generate this difference by inducing a visual illusion namely color constancy . In this work we designed an algorithm to determine the projected colors for presenting the desired colors perceptually by employing a color constancy effect . In addition we conducted a user study and confirmed that our algorithm can create a misperception regarding the color of illumination broaden the presentable color range of a projector and shift the perceptual colors in the desirable direction .

@highlight The presentable color range of a projector is limited.
@highlight We developed a projection method to perceptually broaden the range.
@highlight We employ one of the visual illusion color constancy.
@highlight Our method broadens the range compared to physically based method.
@highlight Our method can present colors that cannot be presented physically.
