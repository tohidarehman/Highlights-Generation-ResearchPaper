 Realistic and detailed liquid splashes require costly fine scale discretization . We present an efficient post processing approach for particle based methods to locally improve the behavior of splashes on coarser liquids . Our method first computes a splash volume over time from the intersections between an identified upsampling volume and colliding volumes . We then upsample particles inside cells of the splash volume these cells are pre computed using a likelihood score based on criteria favoring emerging particles . In addition to the advection scheme enhanced realism is achieved by applying a localized artificial pressure on upsampled particles in order to mimic surface tension in critical regions of splashes . Finally we propagate waves using a novel implicit model that couples the impact of upsampled particles on the coarser liquid by updating the velocity field at these locations . Our implicit wave model can produce detailed swirls by solely applying velocity updates directly on the underlying particles from the coarse liquid and prevents from using a high density of surface points . As a result our approach can generate localized and parameterizable high resolution splashes from solid liquid and liquid liquid interactions and thus can simulate a wide range of unique and customizable splashes on top of an animated coarse liquid .
