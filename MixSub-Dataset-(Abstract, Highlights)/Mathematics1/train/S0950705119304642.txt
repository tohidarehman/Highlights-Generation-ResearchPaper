 Double quantitative decision theoretic rough sets provide more comprehensive description methods for rough approximations of concepts which lay foundations for the development of attribute reduction and rule extraction of rough sets . Existing researches on concept approximations of Dq DTRS pay more attention to the equivalence class of each object in approximating a concept and calculate concept approximations from the whole data set in a batch . This makes the calculation of approximations time consuming in dynamic data sets . In this paper we first analyze the variations of equivalence classes decision classes conditional probability internal grade and external grade in dynamic data sets while objects vary sequentially or simultaneously over time . Then we propose the updating mechanisms for the concept approximations of two types of Dq DTRS models from incremental perspective in dynamic decision information systems with the sequential and batch variations of objects . Meanwhile we design incremental sequential insertion sequential deletion batch insertion batch deletion algorithms for two Dq DTRS models . Finally we present experimental comparisons showing the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed incremental approaches in calculating approximations and the stability of the incremental updating algorithms from the perspective of the runtime under different inserting and deleting ratios and parameter values .
