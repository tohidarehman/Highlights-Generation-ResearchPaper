 In order to propagate information through the social network how to find a seed set that can affect the maximum number of users is named as influence maximization problem . A lot of works have been done on this problem mainly including two aspects establishing a reasonable information diffusion model and putting forward the appropriate seeding strategy . However there are few models in the existing ones that consider the acceptance probability of candidate seed nodes in social networks . So in this paper we consider and solve this problem by introducing a more realistic model which is the proposed Realistic Independent Cascade model . Based on the RIC model many state of the art seeding algorithms perform not so well because there is no mechanism on dealing with the acceptance probability . So based on the RIC model we propose a new seeding strategy which is called R greedy . Furthermore M greedy algorithm is proposed to reduce the time complexity of R greedy . Then D greedy algorithm which not only increased the performance but also reduced the time complexity of R greedy is proposed by combining the advantages of R greedy and M greedy . Experiments on the real world networks and synthetic networks demonstrate that the proposed R greedy M greedy and D greedy algorithms outperforms state of the art algorithms .
