 Piecewise linear Morse theory and discrete Morse theory are used in shape analysis tasks to investigate the topological features of discretized spaces . In spite of their common origin in smooth Morse theory various notions of critical points have been given in the literature for the discrete setting making a clear understanding of the relationships occurring between them not obvious . This paper aims at providing equivalence results about critical points of the two discretized Morse theories . First of all we prove the equivalence of the existing notions of PL critical points . Next under an optimality condition called relative perfectness we show a dimension agnostic correspondence between the set of PL critical points and that of discrete critical simplices of the combinatorial approach . Finally we show how a relatively perfect discrete gradient vector field can be algorithmically built up to dimension 3 . This way we guarantee a formal and operative connection between critical sets in the PL and discrete theories .
