 Many sampling based preprocessing methods have been proposed to solve the problem of unbalanced dataset classification . The fundamental principle of these methods is rebalancing an unbalanced dataset by a concrete strategy . Herein we introduce a novel hybrid proposal named ant colony optimization resampling to overcome class imbalance classification . ACOR primarily includes two steps first it rebalances an imbalanced dataset by a specific oversampling algorithm next it finds an optimal subset from the balanced dataset by ant colony optimization . Unlike other oversampling techniques ACOR does not focus on the mechanics of generating new samples . The main advantage of ACOR is that existing oversampling algorithms can be fully utilized and an ideal training set can be obtained by ant colony optimization . Therefore ACOR can enhance the performance of existing oversampling algorithms . Experimental results on 18 real imbalanced datasets prove that ACOR yields significantly better results compared with four popular oversampling methods in terms of various assessment metrics such as AUC G mean and BACC .
