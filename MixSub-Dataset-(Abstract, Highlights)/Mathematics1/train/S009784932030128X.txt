 A binary descriptor indexing scheme based on Hamming distance called the Hamming tree for local shape queries is presented . A new binary clutter resistant descriptor named Quick Intersection Count Change Image is also introduced . This local shape descriptor is extremely small and fast to compare . Additionally a novel distance function called Weighted Hamming applicable to QUICCI images is proposed for retrieval applications . The effectiveness of the indexing scheme and QUICCI is demonstrated on 828 million QUICCI images derived from the SHREC2017 dataset while the clutter resistance of QUICCI is shown using the clutterbox experiment .

@highlight Proposed the Quick Intersection Count Change descriptor.
@highlight Proposed the Hamming Tree data structure.
@highlight Described efficient distance functions targeted at cluttered object recognition and shape retrieval.
