 Nonnegative matrix factorization has been a vital data representation technique and has demonstrated significant potential in the field of machine learning and data mining . Nonnegative matrix tri factorization is an extension of NMF and provides more degrees of freedom than NMF . In this paper we propose the correntropy based orthogonal nonnegative matrix tri factorization algorithm which is robust to noisy data contaminated by non Gaussian noise and outliers . Different from previous NMF algorithms CNMTF firstly applies correntropy to NMTF to measure the similarity and preserves double orthogonality conditions and dual graph regularization . We adopt the half quadratic technique to solve the optimization problem of CNMTF and derive the multiplicative update rules . The complexity issue of CNMTF is also presented . Furthermore the robustness of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and the relationships between CNMTF and several previous NMF based methods are discussed . Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CNMTF method has better performance on real world image and text datasets for clustering tasks compared with several state of the art methods .
