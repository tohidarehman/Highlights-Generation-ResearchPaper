 Persistence barcode is a topological summary for persistent homology to exhibit topological features with different persistence . Persistence rank function derived from persistence barcode organizes persistence Betti numbers in the form of an integer valued function . To obtain topological patterns of objects such as point clouds represented by finite dimensional vectors for machine learning classification tasks the vectorizing representations of barcodes is generated via decomposing PRF on a system of Haar basis . Theoretically the generated vectorizing representation is proved to have 1 Wasserstein stability . In practice to reduce training time and achieve better results a technique of dimensionality reduction through out of sample mapping in supervised manifold learning is used to generate a low dimensional vector . Experiments demonstrate that the representation is effective for capturing the topological patterns of data sets . Moreover the classification of porous structures has become an essential problem in the fields such as material science in recent decades . The proposed method is successfully applied to distinguish porous structures on a novel data set of porous models .
