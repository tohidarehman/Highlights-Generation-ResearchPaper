 Recommender system has been emerged as a personalization tool to solve the issue of information overload in an e commerce environment . Traditional collaborative filtering based recommender systems suggest items to users based on their overall ratings which are used to find out similar users . Multi criteria ratings are used to capture user preferences efficiently in multi criteria recommender systems and incorporation of various criteria ratings can lead to higher performance in MCRS . Usually user relies on the credibility of an item provided through his her social circle or similar users which is called a personal view on items from their close ones . However it is not generally sufficient to depend exclusively on the personal view of the user . Therefore public view that includes whole community can play a key role in the credibility of an item . In this paper we propose a MCRS based on the credibility score of an item which is an aggregated value of credibility scores on various criteria of an item . These credibility scores are computed based on personal and public views . However different users have different priorities to various criteria of an item . Therefore we use genetic algorithm to learn appropriate weights in the aggregation task of credibility score . The experiment results on Yahoo Movies and modified MovieLens dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed credibility score based MCRS in terms of coverage recall precision and f measure .
