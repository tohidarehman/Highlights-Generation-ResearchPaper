 Solving nonlinear equations systems is one of the most important challenges in numerical computation especially to find multiple roots in one run . In this paper a decomposition based differential evolution with reinitialization is proposed to tackle this challenging task . The main advantages of our method are an improved parameter free decomposition technique is exploited to partition the population into numerous sub populations to locate multiple roots of NESs to enhance the search ability of optimization algorithm a sub population control strategy is presented to control the number of solutions in the sub populations and the sub population reinitialization mechanism is proposed to enrich the population diversity . To evaluate the performance of our approach thirty NES problems with different characteristics are selected as the test suite . Moreover to further indicate the superiority of our method ten complex NESs with many roots are also tested . Experimental results show that the proposed approach can locate multiple roots in a single run . In addition it is able to obtain better results compared with other state of the art methods in terms of both root rate and success rate .

@highlight An improved differential evolution DDE R is proposed.
@highlight Forty nonlinear equations systems are used to test the performance of DDE R.
@highlight DDE R yields better results than the compared 10 algorithms.
