 Nowadays image processing and 3D shape analysis are an integral part of clinical practice and have the potentiality to support clinicians with advanced analysis and visualization techniques . The main contribution of the paper is the integration of these two approaches in order to increase the amount of information available and thus allow a more accurate analysis of each patient . Given a segmented anatomical district we propose a novel mapping of volumetric data onto the segmented surface . The grey levels of the image voxels are mapped through a volume surface correspondence map which defines a grey level texture on the segmented surface . The resulting texture mapping is coherent to the local morphology of the segmented anatomical structure and provides an enhanced visual representation of the anatomical district . The integration of volume based and surface based information in a unique 3D representation also supports the identification and characterization of morphological landmarks and pathology evaluations .
