 Random walk based sampling methods have been widely employed to characterize social networks . However existing random walk based sampling methods cause inaccuracies in estimating the degree structure and high sampling costs in estimating clique structures . In this paper we propose a dual random walk based sampling method called DRaWS by designing a dual residence of the random walker to estimate both the distributions of degree and clique size with low costs . The key idea behind DRaWS is that it leverages the many to one formation between many nodes and one clique in a large graph to shorten the sampling paths and thus reduce the sampling costs greatly while reflecting the different sampling probabilities of the two types of node structures . Meanwhile DRaWS employs the one to many representativeness between one node and many nodes in a clique to improve the quality of samples . Furthermore two re weighted estimators for DRaWSs process are proposed to estimate the two different node structures . Experimental evaluation driven by real graph datasets shows that DRaWS drastically cuts down the sampling costs of the state of the art methods while increasing the accuracy when estimating both the degree and clique structural properties .

@highlight This paper proposes propose a dual random walk based sampling process DRaWS the first of its kind with high accuracy and low cost to estimate the degree and clique structures simultaneously.
@highlight The sampling method proposed in this paper drastically reduces its sampling costs while significantly reducing sampling errors.
@highlight The paper proposes different re weighted estimators by theoretical analysis on the dual random walk based process to accurately estimate the degree and clique structures in large graphs with samples obtained by DRaWS.
@highlight Extensive experiments are carried out to present the accuracy and efficiency of the newly proposed method.
