 In the last few decades rough sets have evolved to become an essential technology for feature subset selection by way of reduct computation in categorical decision systems . In recent years with the proliferation of MapReduce for distributed parallel algorithms several scalable reduct computation algorithms have been developed in this field for large scale decision systems using MapReduce . The existing MapReduce based reduct computation approaches use horizontal partitioning of the dataset into the nodes of the cluster requiring a complicated shuffle and sort phase . In this work we propose an algorithm MR IQRA VP which is designed using vertical partitioning of the dataset with a simplified shuffle and sort phase of the MapReduce framework . MR IQRA VP is a distributed parallel implementation of the Improved Quick Reduct Algorithm and is implemented using iterative MapReduce framework of Apache Spark . We have done an extensive comparative study through experimentation on benchmark decision systems using existing horizontal partitioning based reduct computation algorithms . Through experimental analysis along with theoretical validation we have established that MR IQRA VP is suitable and scalable to datasets of larger size attribute space and moderate object space prevalent in the areas of Bioinformatics and Web mining .
