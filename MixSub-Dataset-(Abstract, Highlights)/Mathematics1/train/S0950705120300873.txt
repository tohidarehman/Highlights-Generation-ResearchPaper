 Air pollution poses a great threat to human health and people are paying more attention than ever to its prediction.Accurate prediction of AP helps people to plan for theiroutdoor activities and aids protecting human health . In this paper longshort term memory recurrent neural networks have been used topredict the future concentration of air pollutants in Macau . Additionally meteorological data and data on the concentration of APS have been utilized . Moreover in Macau some air qualitymonitoring stations have less observed data in quantity and at the same time some AQMSs recorded less observed data of certain types of APS . Therefore the transfer learning and pre trained neuralnetworks have been employed to assist AQMSs with less observed data tobuild a neural network with high prediction accuracy . The experimental sample covers a period longer than 12 year and includes daily measurements from several APS as well as other more classical meteorological values . Records from five stations four out of them are AQMSs and the remaining one is an automatic weather station have been prepared from the aforesaid period and eventually underwent to computational intelligence techniques to build and extract a prediction knowledge based system . As shownby experimentation LSTM RNNs initialized with transfer learning methods have higher prediction accuracy it incurred shortertraining time than randomly initialized recurrent neural networks .

@highlight Accurate prediction for air pollutant concentration for stations with fewer data.
@highlight The stations have even missing data and multiple nearby station data are processed.
@highlight Transfer learning to initialize conveniently recurrent neural networks.
@highlight Empirical analysis on a real sample more than 12 years for one day ahead prediction.
@highlight Values from air pollutants as well as classical meteorological data are computed.
