 Graph clustering assigns nodes into tightly connected groups known as communities and community detection algorithms traditionally focus on non attributed networks that only provide a partial representation of the underlying systems . Thus community detection in attributed networks becomes a hot topic since it provides an insight into the structure function relation of the underlying systems . However identifying community in attributed networks is highly non trivial since it simultaneously takes into consideration both topological structure and node attributes . Current algorithms detect communities by either incorporating attributes into structure of networks or directly fusing features of nodes and structure of networks which can not effectively handle the heterogeneity of structure and attributes hampering fully exploitation of them . To overcome these problems we propose a novel algorithm by joint nonnegative matrix factorization and graph optimization called

@highlight Dynamic integration of node attributes and topological structure is proposed.
@highlight NMFjGO is developed for community detection in attribute networks.
@highlight The proposed algorithms outperform state of the art methods without increasing the time complexity.
