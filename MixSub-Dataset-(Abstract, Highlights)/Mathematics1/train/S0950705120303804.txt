 As the essence of machine learning classification is widely used in real life however imbalanced data has brought great challenges to classification problems . This is because standard classifiers tend to favor the majority instances and ignore the minority instances . The new oversampling algorithms based on the improving majority weighted minority oversampling method assign weights through the Euclidean distances from majority instances to hard to learn minority instances and then guide the synthesis of minority samples according to the weights to address the offset of the classification hyperplanes . A SUWO has achieved better results than traditional oversampling algorithms when its parameters are well adjusted . However A SUWO may give minority training samples inappropriate weights in some irregularly distributed scenarios and make learning tasks even more harder . Additionally A SUWOs knn synthesizing method may not obtain wider and more effective instances . Therefore we propose an improving adaptive semi unsupervised weighted oversampling technique to address the imbalanced classification problems more effectively . The improvement of IA SUWO mainly focuses on the following two aspects

@highlight IA SUWO is proposed to address the imbalanced classification problems.
@highlight IA SUWO uses a new system based on the IMWMO method and the
@highlight  method to assign weights to minority instances.
@highlight IA SUWO uses a new method based on k information nearest neighbors to generate minority instances.
@highlight Results show that IA SUWO is superior to the 12 existing algorithms.
