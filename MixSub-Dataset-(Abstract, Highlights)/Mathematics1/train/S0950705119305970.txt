 Emotion intelligence plays an important role in building a successful humanmachine dialogue system . However the extreme difficulty of capturing emotional information of social text as well as the weakness of generative models for learning emotional expression limits the performance of existing dialogue system . Combining dictionary matching and machine learning this paper proposes a generative model which fuses the word and sentence level emotions to model the dialogue text and learn emotional expression . The model first obtains the emotional embedding of each word through dictionary matching then concatenates the emotional word embedding with its traditional word embedding and the finally formed vector is taken as the input of the encoder . In order to control the emotional feature of the generated response our model employs a BernoulliNB based classifier to extract the emotional feature of the post which is used as the attribute of the original text and subsequently adds it to the decoder . For further significantly improving the emotional expression of the response the model leverages a discriminator to constrain the latent variable which enables the latent variable to encode better the information of emotional feature of the post . With this model we can generate the dialogue text that is consistent with the original emotion . Experimental results on our

@highlight Emotional features of word and sentence level are fused into the dialogue model.
@highlight A structure with a latent variable and discriminator is proposed.
@highlight The latent variable is used to realize the global control of emotion.
@highlight Extensive experiments demonstrate the generated responses have good results.
