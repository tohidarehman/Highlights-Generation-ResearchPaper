 In recent decades various machine learning methods have been proposed to address classification problems . However most of them do not support incremental learning and therefore are neither scalable nor robust to dynamic problems that change over time . In this study a classification method was introduced based on the minimum description length principle which offered a very good trade off between model complexity and predictive power . The proposed method is lightweight multiclass and online . Moreover despite its probabilistic nature it can handle continuous features . Experiments conducted on real world datasets with different characteristics demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms established online classification methods and is robust to overfitting which is a desired characteristic for large dynamic and real world classification problems .
