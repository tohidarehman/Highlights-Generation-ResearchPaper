 Distant Supervised Relation Extraction is usually formulated as a problem about classifying a bag of sentences that contains two query entities into the predefined relation classes . Most existing methods consider those relation classes as distinct semantic categories while ignoring their potential connections to query entities . In this paper we propose to leverage this connection to improve the relation extraction accuracy . Our key ideas are twofold For sentences belonging to the same relation class the keywords to express the relation can vary according to the input query entities i.e . style shift . To account for this style shift the model can adjust its parameters in accordance with entity types . Some relation classes are semantically similar and the entity types appear in one relation may also appear in others . Therefore it can be trained across different relation classes and further enhance those classes with few samples i.e . long tail relations . To unify these two arguments we developed a novel

@highlight We utilize the class connection with entity types to boost Distant Supervised Relation Extraction.
@highlight We propose a dynamic parameter enhanced network to improve the prediction accuracy.
@highlight We propose a relation aware attention over entity types to select the discriminative entity types.
@highlight Extensive experiments show that our method gives new state of the art performance.
