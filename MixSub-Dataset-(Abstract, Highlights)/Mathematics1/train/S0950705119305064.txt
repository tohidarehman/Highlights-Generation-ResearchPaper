 In traditional machine learning conditional random fields is the mainstream probability model for sequence labeling problems . CRF considers the relation between adjacent labels other than decoding each label independently and better performance is expected to achieve . However there are few multi view learning methods involving CRF which can be directly used for sequence labeling tasks . In this paper we propose a novel multi view CRF model to label sequential data called MVCRF which well exploits two principles for multi view learning consensus and complementary . We first use different neural networks to extract features from multiple views . Then considering the consistency among the different views we introduce a joint representation space for the extracted features and minimize the distance between the two views for regularization . Meanwhile following the complementary principle the features of multiple views are integrated into the framework of CRF . We train MVCRF in an end to end fashion and evaluate it on two benchmark data sets . The experimental results illustrate that MVCRF obtains state of the art performance
