 Graph based semi supervised learning has been widely investigated in recent works considering its powerful ability to naturally incorporate the diverse types of information and measurements . However traditional graph based SSL methods have cubic complexities and leading to low scalability . In this paper we propose to perform graph based SSL on mixture distribution components named Mixture distribution based Graph Smoothing to address this challenge . Specifically the intrinsic distributions of data are captured by a mixture density estimation model . A novel mixture distribution based objective energy function is further proposed to incorporate few available annotations which ensures the model complexity is irrelevant to the number of raw instances . The energy function can be simplified and effectively solved by viewing the instances and mixture components as the point clouds . Experiments on large datasets demonstrate the remarkable performance improvements and scalability of the proposed model which proves the superiority of the MGS model .

@highlight We propose a novel scalable SSL which overcomes the limitations of existing methods.
@highlight We extend our method to a more general framework for anchor based scalable SSL.
@highlight The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model.
