 In this paper we present two effects of illusion based virtual shadows on a real surface for optical see through head mounted displays without devices that selectively reduce or intercept light rays from the real scene . The virtual shadows are based on the simultaneous brightness contrast illusion in which a central region surrounded by a lighter one is perceived as darker than one without such a lighter region . To display a virtual shadow a virtual object with a real image texture is placed around the shadow region as the lighter region to provide a sense of a darker area . We conducted two kinds of experiments to validate the feasibility of our method . The first experiment showed that users tend to perceive the virtual shadow part as darker than the surrounding area with the same physical luminance . The second experiment provided evidence that there are cases in which the virtual shadows can improve the reality of virtual objects .

@highlight Dark shadows can be represented even on optical see through head mounted displays.
@highlight Users actually perceive virtual shadows darker than without augmentations.
@highlight Virtual shadows can improve the photo reality of even transparent objects.
