 The phenomenon of rapidly developing academic venues poses a significant challenge for researchers how to recognize the ones that are not only in accordance with ones scholarly interests but also of high significance Often even a high quality paper is rejected because of a mismatch between the research area of the paper and the scope of the journal . Recommending appropriate scholarly venues to researchers empowers them to recognize and partake in important academic conferences and assists them in getting published in impactful journals . A venue recommendation system becomes helpful in this scenario particularly when exploring a new field or when further choices are required . We propose CNAVER A Content and Network based Academic VEnue Recommender system . It provides an integrated framework employing a rank based fusion of paper paper peer network model and venue venue peer network model . It only requires the title and abstract of a paper to provide venue recommendations thus assisting researchers even at the earliest stage of paper writing . It also addresses cold start issues such as the involvement of an inexperienced researcher and a novel venue along with the problems of data sparsity diversity and stability . Experiments on the DBLP dataset exhibit that our proposed approach outperforms several state of the art methods in terms of precision nDCG MRR accuracy
