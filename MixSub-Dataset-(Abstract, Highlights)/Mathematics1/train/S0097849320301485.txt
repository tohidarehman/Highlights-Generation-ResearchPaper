 This paper presents a novel path tracer algorithm for immersive visualization of Riemannian manifolds . To do this we introduce Riemannian illumination a generalization of classical Computer Graphics illumination models . In this context global light transport is expressed by extending the rendering equation to Riemannian manifolds . Using Monte Carlo integration to solve this equation results in the novel path tracer for Non Euclidean spaces . We discuss its basic principles as well as the general CPU algorithm . Additionally we discuss in detail how to implement a GPU version using the RTX pipeline . Finally we apply the algorithm to render photorealistic inside viewsof the flat torus Poincar sphere and the hyperbolic mirrored dodecahedron . These areexamples of Euclidean spherical and hyperbolic spaces the Thurston classical geometries .
