 Identity resolution of a person using various online social networks can enable an interested party to have a better and holistic understanding of formers behavior and personality . Major challenges in developing a reliable and scalable matching scheme for online identities include non availability of required information or having contradictory information for the same user across these networks . In this study we present a scheme for identity matching which utilizes important features extracted from contents generated by or shared with users across ones online social networks . With the help of natural language processing and text mining techniques we extract and process parts of speech symbols emoticons numbers and high frequency words in users posts tweets retweets and URLs . On the basis of experiments with ground truth TwitterFacebook real datasets this method achieved 91.2 percent accuracy in matching users identity across the users profiles . The main contribution of this paper is that this proposes a novel method for identity matching which utilizes only the publicly available content information of online social network users . This method can be used alone for identity matching or can be used along with other identity resolution frameworks to enhance their accuracy .

@highlight Propose a scheme which utilizes the contents of OSN users to match their identities.
@highlight Text Mining and NLP are used to extract the features from users contents.
@highlight On the basis of experiments we achieved accuracy of 91.2 percent in identity matching.
@highlight This scheme will enhance the accuracy of identity resolution frameworks.
