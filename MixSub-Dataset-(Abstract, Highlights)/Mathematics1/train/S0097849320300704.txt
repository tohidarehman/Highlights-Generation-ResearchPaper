 Piecewise planar 3D objects are very common in digital furniture manufacturing . In this paper we propose a novel method for automatic reconstruction of 3D objects with planar facets from unorganized point clouds . We formulate this problem into a point clustering problem where the key difficulty lies in consolidating co planar points into a cluster . In order to achieve this purpose the first step is to triangulate the input point cloud into a mesh that is a super set of the underlying manifold mesh surface . Then the hundreds of thousands of normal vectors of triangles after being mapped onto a Gauss sphere are capable of reporting reliable facing directions of the faces of the final 3D model . After grouping the points based on co planarity we fit each cluster with a planar facet and then assemble them into a piecewise planarization representation of the whole model . We further introduce an additional regularization term to meet the orthogonality requirement on a particular occasion and then transform this problem into a purely convex optimization problem . Our method is efficient and requires just a few parameters . Extensive experimental results show that it is able to handle point clouds with various levels of noise and yield a desirable piecewise planar 3D model with a clean and compact representation .

@highlight We propose a novel algorithmic pipeline for modeling piecewise planar shapes based on clustering. Our algorithm is computationally efficient and resistant to noise.
@highlight We give a set of strategies on extracting the polygonal representation of a facet and building the face adjacency graph which leads to the final compact planarization representation.
@highlight We also introduce a regularization technique to encourage the orthogonality between facing directions which is further transformed into a purely convex optimization problem.
