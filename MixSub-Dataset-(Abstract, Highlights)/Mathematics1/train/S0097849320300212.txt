 We present a novel spectrum preserving sparsification algorithm for visualizing big graph data . Although spectral methods have many advantages the high memory and computation costs due to the involved Laplacian eigenvalue problems could immediately hinder their applications in big graph analytics . In this paper we introduce a practically efficient nearly linear time spectral sparsification algorithm for tackling real world big graph data . Besides spectral sparsification we further propose a node reduction scheme based on intrinsic spectral graph properties to allow more aggressive level of detail simplification . To enable effective visual exploration of the resulting spectrally sparsified graphs we implement spectral clustering and edge bundling . Our framework does not depend on a particular graph layout and can be integrated into different graph drawing algorithms . We experiment with publicly available graph data of different sizes and characteristics to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach . To further verify our solution we quantitatively compare our method against different graph simplification solutions using a proxy quality metric and statistical properties of the graphs .
