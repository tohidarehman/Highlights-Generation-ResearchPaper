 The Local Binary Pattern is a very popular pattern descriptor for images that is widely used to classify repeated pixel arrangements in a query image . Several extensions of the LBP to surfaces exist for both geometric and colorimetric patterns . These methods mainly differ on the way they code the neighborhood of a point balancing the quality of the neighborhood approximation with the computational complexity . For instance using mesh topological neighborhoods as a surrogate for the LBP pixel neighborhood simplifies the computation but this approach is sensitive to irregular vertex distributions and or might require an accurate surface re sampling . On the contrary building an adaptive neighborhood representation based on geodesic disks is accurate and insensitive to surface bendings but it considerably increases the computational complexity . Our idea is to adopt the kd tree structure to directly store a surface described by a set of points and to build the LBP directly on the point cloud without considering any support mesh . Following the LBP paradigm we define a local descriptor at each point that is further used to define a global statistical Mean Point LBP descriptor . When used to compare shapes this descriptor reaches state of the art performances while keeping a low computational cost . Experiments on benchmarks and datasets from real world objects are provided altogether with the analysis of the algorithm parameters property and descriptor robustness .
