 Volume rendering techniques are essential to inspect volume data . In this work we consider volume rendering for unstructured meshes . We focus on the visualization of black oil reservoir simulation models represented by irregular hexahedral meshes with geometry distortions and discontinuities . We conduct an experimental study comparing three different strategies to compute the volume integration . The first strategy resamples the model in a regular grid the second linearizes the model geometry and the variation of the scalar field within a hexahedron cell the third uses an accurate evaluation of the scalar field at each sample . We compare performance and image quality delivered by each strategy by running a set of experiments with different models . We also investigate the gain in perception applying directional ambient occlusion shading effects . All strategies were entirely implemented on the graphics card .
