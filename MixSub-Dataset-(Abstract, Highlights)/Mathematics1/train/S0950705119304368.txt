 Unmanned aerial vehicle swarm autonomous cooperation method is the basis of UAV swarm intelligent decision making and cooperative engagement . Due to the complexity and antagonism of the mission environment usually UAV swarm works in a distributed architecture . However the process of situation awareness and the uncertainty of situation information have not been considered carefully by existing distributed cooperation methods . This paper proposes UAV swarm distributed cooperation method based on SA consensus and its information processing mechanism . Firstly combined with the characteristics of swarm cooperative engagement we analyze the essence of swarm distributed cooperation methods and propose swarm distributed cooperation method based on SA consensus which can be further classified into situation perception consensus and situation comprehension consensus . Then based on different types of consensus model of group decision making we regard the UAVs which have a certain autonomous intelligence as intelligent decision makers and establish the corresponding information processing mechanisms of proposed distributed cooperation methods . Finally theoretical analysis and case study are used to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method which is more suitable for complex and antagonistic mission environment .
