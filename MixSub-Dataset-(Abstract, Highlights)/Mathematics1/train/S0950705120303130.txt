 Despite advances in Machine Learning algorithms the clinical viability of ML based decision support systems to predict the prognosis of hepatitis remains limited . However an appropriate feature selection could improve its reliability . Differently from conventional feature reduction methods we hypothesised that applying feature reduction first and then augmenting the reduced feature space could improve classification performance further . Thus a novel two stage Genetic Algorithm based feature transformation method which involves both feature reduction and augmentation was developed tested and validated . This 2 Tra GA was later coupled to ML based classifiers for a prognostic prediction . Clinical data with nineteen features on 320 patients with hepatitis obtained from the University of California Irvine ML repository were utilised . When tested on these data the GA based feature reduction resulted in a reduced set with fifteen features that led to the highest classification accuracy and reliability . Augmenting the reduced set by adding transformed features via an interpolation method further improved the classification performance . Additionally the performance of this novel hybrid algorithm was evaluated against classifiers alike and published studies . Applying feature reduction then augmenting only such relevant features improved classification performance and computational efficiency also over conventional wrapper based feature selection methods . Thus a novel hybrid DSS to improve the reliability of the prediction of prognosis for hepatitis is proposed . Findings also support the application of the proposed hybrid method to improve clinical decision making .
