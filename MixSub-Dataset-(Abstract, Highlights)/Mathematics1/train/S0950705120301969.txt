 Activity recognition on mobile device sensor data has been an active research area in mobile and pervasive computing for several years . While the majority of the proposed techniques are based on supervised learning semi supervised approaches are being considered to reduce the size of the training set required to initialize the model . These approaches usually apply self training or active learning to incrementally refine the model but their effectiveness seems to be limited to a restricted set of physical activities . We claim that the context which surrounds the user combined with common knowledge about the relationship between context and human activities could be effective in significantly increasing the set of recognized activities including those that are difficult to discriminate only considering inertial sensors and the highly context dependent ones . In this paper we propose CAVIAR a novel hybrid semi supervised and knowledge based system for real time activity recognition . Our method applies semantic reasoning on context data to refine the predictions of an incremental classifier . The recognition model is continuously updated using active learning . Results on a real dataset obtained from 26 subjects show the effectiveness of our approach in increasing the recognition rate extending the number of recognizable activities and most importantly reducing the number of queries triggered by active learning . In order to evaluate the impact of context reasoning we also compare CAVIAR with a purely statistical version considering features computed on context data as part of the machine learning process .

@highlight We propose a novel context aware and semi supervised activity recognition method.
@highlight Results show that context reasoning improves semi supervised activity recognition.
@highlight We show that knowledge based reasoning outperforms purely data driven approaches.
