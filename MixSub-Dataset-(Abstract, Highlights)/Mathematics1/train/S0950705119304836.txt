 The rise in the Internet of Things and other sensor networks has created many vertically distributed and high velocity data streams that require specialized algorithms for true distributed data mining . This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Distributed Stream Miner that learns relationships between the features of separate data streams with minimal data transmission to central locations . Experimental evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in classification accuracy over previously proposed distributed stream mining approaches while minimizing data transmission and computational costs . HDSMs potential for dynamically trading off accuracy with computational resource costs is also demonstrated .
