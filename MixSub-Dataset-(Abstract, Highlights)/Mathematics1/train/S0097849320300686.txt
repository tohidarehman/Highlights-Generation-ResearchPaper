 Gears play a pivotal role in machine design . This paper proposes an algorithm to simplify the shapes of planar gears . This is achieved via iterative conjugation using precise algebraic sweeps . The notion of shape simplification is introduced in a mathematically rigorous manner and it is shown that the conjugation process converges yielding a pair of meshing gears that follow the desired motion . Simplified gear shapes may lead to improved mechanical characteristics and reduction in manufacturing costs . The generality of algebraic sweeps allows precise design of gears with freeform shapes and non uniform motion transmission . Moreover the computational framework proposed in this paper is versatile with applications beyond gear design . A variety of examples from an implementation of our algorithm that offers topological guarantees are presented which demonstrate the robustness and efficacy of our approach .
