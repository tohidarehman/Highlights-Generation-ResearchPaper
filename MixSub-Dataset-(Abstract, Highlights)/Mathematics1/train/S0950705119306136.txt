 This paper addresses a methodology for decision support under multiple and correlated decision criteria . Nonadditive robust ordinal regression aims to build capacities that fit the decision makers explicit preferences and pairwise rankings of some alternatives . The capacities provide great flexibility to model decision problems accounting for interactions among the decision criteria . The feasible set of capacities helps identifying all the necessary and possible dominance relations among all the decision alternatives . In this paper we enhance the NAROR method by identifying optimal capacities through entropy maximisation . We formulate suitable optimisation problems and provide avenues for capacity simplification based on k interactivity . We also consider the situation of large number of sparse constraints for which we formulate a linear program based on Renyi entropy . We deal with preferences inconsistency by using multiple goal linear programming technique . The results show that the k interactivity is an efficient way to reduce the complexity of capacities while preserving their expressiveness and representation ability and that optimal capacities can be found by standard mathematical programming techniques .
