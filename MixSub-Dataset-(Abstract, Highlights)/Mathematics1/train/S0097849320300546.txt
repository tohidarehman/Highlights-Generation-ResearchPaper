 Organ cancer have a high mortality rate . In order to help doctors diagnose and treat organ lesion an automatic medical image segmentation model is urgently needed as manually segmentation is time consuming and error prone . However automatic segmentation of target organ from medical images is a challenging task because of organs uneven and irregular shapes . In this paper we propose an attention based nested segmentation network named ANU Net . Our proposed network has a deep supervised encoder decoder architecture and a redesigned dense skip connection . ANU Net introduces attention mechanism between nested convolutional blocks so that the features extracted at different levels can be merged with a task related selection . Besides we redesign a hybrid loss function combining with three kinds of losses to make full use of full resolution feature information . We evaluated proposed model on MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge Dataset and ISBI 2019 Combined Healthy Abdominal Organ Segmentation Challenge . ANU Net achieved very competitive performance for four kinds of medical image segmentation tasks .

@highlight We propose a UNet based nested segmentation network for medical image segmentation.
@highlight Nested UNet architecture integrates features at different levels to improve performance.
@highlight Attention mechanism is to focus on target organ while suppressing irrelevant tissue.
@highlight Deep supervision is introduced to perform network pruning operations during testing.
