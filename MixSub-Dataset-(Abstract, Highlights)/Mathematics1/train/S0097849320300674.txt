 In this paper we present a simple and intuitive approach for designing a new class of space filling shapes that we call Generalized Abeille Tiles . GATs are generalizations of Abeille vaults introduced by the French engineer and architect Joseph Abeille in late 1600s . Our approach is based on two principles . The first principle is the correspondence between structures proposed by Abeille and the symmetries exhibited by woven fabrics . We leverage this correspondence to develop a theoretical framework for GATs beginning with the theory of bi axial 2 fold woven fabrics . The second principle is the use of Voronoi decomposition with higher dimensional Voronoi sites . By configuring these new Voronoi sites based on weave symmetries we provide a method for constructing GATs . Subsequently we conduct a comparative structural analysis of GATs as individual shapes as well as tiled assemblies for three different fabric patterns using plain and twill weave patterns . Our analysis reveals interesting relationship between the choice of fabric symmetries and the corresponding distribution of stresses under loads normal to the tiled assemblies .

@highlight We have introduced the concept of Generalized Abeille Tiles GATs that are generalizations of Abeille vaults introduced by architect Joseph Abeille.
@highlight We have developed to develop a theoretical framework for GATs that leverages the theory of bi axial 2 fold woven fabrics.
@highlight We provide algorithms for constructing GATs by using 2D and 3D Voronoi decomposition with higher dimensional Voronoi sites curves and surfaces based on bi axial woven fabrics.
@highlight We present a comparative structural analysis of GATs as individual shapes as well as tiled assemblies for three different fabric patterns using plain and twill weave patterns.
