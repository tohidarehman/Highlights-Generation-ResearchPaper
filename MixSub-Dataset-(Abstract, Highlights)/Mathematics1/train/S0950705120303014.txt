 Group decision making problems require consensus reaching processes however these can be time consuming and costly . As experts change their evaluations after exchanging opinions and being influenced by others these influences are spread across the various expert trust relationships . Because of the experts knowledge limits the evaluations on the alternatives and the trust relationships are generally described using probabilistic linguistic terms . Therefore to simplify the decision making process and avoid decision bias this paper proposes a particle swarm optimization method that incorporates a trust relationship based social network for GDM under a probabilistic linguistic environment . Each expert is regarded as a particle that moves toward the final evaluation and reaches the threshold . A fitness function is built to measure the consensus levels and the updated function is improved by the trust relationships to derive the new evaluations . A numerical example is then given to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach and comparisons given to further elucidate its novelty and validity .
