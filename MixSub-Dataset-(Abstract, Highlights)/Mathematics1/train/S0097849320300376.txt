 Evaluating and optimizing the design of built and yet to be built environments with respect to human occupancy and behavior is both greatly beneficial and challenging . Crowd simulation can provide the computational means to analyze a design through the movement of virtual occupants . A range of analytic information can be computed from the simulated movement of the agents that offer insights on the design . Crowd simulation and the related analysis can be part of interactive or offline design optimization pipelines . Unfortunately large scale crowd simulations are prohibitively expensive especially when used within iterative design and optimization loops where hundreds of simulations often need to be computed at interactive rates . We propose a machine learning framework that aims to solve this problem by learning the relationship between a building design and the evaluation metrics extracted from expensive simulations . We train an offline regression neural network using a synthetic training set that we generate for this purpose . Once the network is trained it can evaluate new designs efficiently and approximate the corresponding analytic information with high accuracy . The proposed framework can also be used to find an optimized layout . We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on a variety of real world case studies .
