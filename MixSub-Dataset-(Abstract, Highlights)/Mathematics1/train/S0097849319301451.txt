 The bidirectional scattering distribution function describes how light is scattered on a surface . Microfacet based BSDF models assume that surfaces are a collection of randomly oriented microfacets describe the distribution probabilities of these microfacets and plausibly approximate their reflective properties using parameterized expressions . Traditional analytic microfacet models such as CookTorrance and the OrenNayar ignore the effects of diffraction . The CookTorrance diffraction model combines the traditional CookTorrance model with diffraction effects to better approximate the measured reflectance . However the effects of diffuse diffraction are ignored in this two layer microfacet reflectance model . In this paper We propose a two layer microfacet reflectance model that combines the effects of specular diffraction with those of diffuse diffraction . The upper layer of our model is the CookTorrance microfacet model with diffraction while the lower layer is the OrenNayar microfacet model that considers the effects of diffuse diffraction . Our model yields a better approximation than the CTD model especially for plastic like multi layer materials . In contrast to previous models where the effects of diffraction can not be controlled those of our model can be easily manipulated by the coefficient of diffraction roughness . The proposed OND model is based on three techniques precomputation convolution computation and the GaussNewton method .
