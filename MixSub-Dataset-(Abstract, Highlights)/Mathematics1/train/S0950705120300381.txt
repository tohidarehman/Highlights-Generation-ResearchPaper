 With consideration of uncertainty in the distributed manufacturing systems this paper addresses a multi objective fuzzy distributed hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with fuzzy processing times and fuzzy due dates . To optimize the fuzzy total tardiness and robustness simultaneously a cooperative coevolution algorithm with problem specific strategies is proposed by reasonably combining the estimation of distribution algorithm and the iterated greedy search . In the EDA mode search a problem specific probability model is established to reduce the solution space and a sample mechanism is proposed to generate new individuals . To enhance exploitation a specific local search is designed to improve performance of non dominated solutions . Moreover destruction and reconstruction methods in the IG mode search are employed for further exploiting better solutions . To balance exploration and exploitation capabilities a cooperation scheme for mode switching is designed based on the information entropy and the diversity of elite solutions . The effect of the key parameters on the performances of the proposed algorithm is investigated by Taguchi design of experiment method . Comparative results and statistical analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving the problem .
