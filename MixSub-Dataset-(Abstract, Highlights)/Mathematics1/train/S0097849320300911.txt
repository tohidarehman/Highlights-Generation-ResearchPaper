 Predicting the dressing fit of a ready made garment for different individuals is a challenging problem in online garment sales . At present the main solution involves physics based virtual garment simulation which has limitations in terms of a lack of sufficient reality and high computational costs . In this study we developed a novel example based method to guarantee the high reality and efficiency of garment dressing fit prediction using two methods . First highly reliable examples were captured with the assistance of a robotic mannequin thereby ensuring the authenticity of the sample data . Second a mapping was established between the body garment ease allowance and garment deformations using a convolutional neural network based network in order to address the problem of dressing fit prediction for ready made garments on different individuals . This method can also be extended to predicting the dressing fit for ready made garments with similar styles . Experiments showed our virtual clothes try on system obtained acceptable precision with a good sense of reality and it can potentially be used in many applications such as three dimensional garment design and online clothes retail .

@highlight Generating highly reliable body garment paired data by digitalizing the garment on a shape changing robotic mannequin with the method of physically simulating the twin virtual garment with the guidance of vision.
@highlight The paired data of a template garment are generalized to be suitable to garments with similar style by scaling the template garment body ease allowance i.e. the extra measurement added to the body measurement for different sized human bodies.
@highlight Deformation characters of a garment template are transformed to daily garments to predict their dressing effects on different persons by training a CNN based network which can obtain plausible results.
