 Domain adaptation aims to transfer auxiliary knowledge from a source domain to enhance the learning performance on a target domain . Recent studies have suggested that deep networks are able to achieve promising results for domain adaptation problems . However deep neural networks can not reveal the underlying geometric information from input data . Indeed such geometric information is very useful for describing the relationship between the samples from source and target domains . In this paper we propose a novel learning algorithm named GKE which stands for Geometric Knowledge Embedding . In GKE we use a graph based model to explore the underlying geometric structure of the input source and target data based on their similarities . Concretely we develop a graph convolutional network to learn discriminative representations based on the constructed graph . To obtain effective transferable representations we match source and target domains by reducing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between their learned representations . Extensive experiments on real world data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing domain adaption methods .

@highlight We exploit the geometric information of the source and target data to learn discriminative representations. In this sense the features of each sample and its neighbors are both considered during the learning procedure.
@highlight We introduce MMD into the graph convolutional network to explore geometric knowledge for learning transferable embeddings.
@highlight GCN has not been applied to domain adaptation problems before and this makes our proposed method a decent supplement to existing domain adaptation approaches.
@highlight We conduct comprehensive experiments on four real world applications including object recognition image classification and text categorization to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
