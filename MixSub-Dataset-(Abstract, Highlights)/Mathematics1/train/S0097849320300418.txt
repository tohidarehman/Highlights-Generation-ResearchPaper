 We present a novel topology driven method for enhancing the navigation behavior of agents in virtual environments and crowds . In agent based crowd simulations each agent combines multiple navigation algorithms for path planning collision avoidance and more . This may lead to undesired motion whenever the algorithms disagree on how an agent should pass an obstacle or another agent .

@highlight An agent in a crowd simulation typically uses multiple navigation algorithms.
@highlight We convert the output of each navigation algorithm to a topological strategy.
@highlight We let an agent systematically detect and resolve conflicts between its strategies.
@highlight Thus we synchronize an agents algorithms and bridge conceptual gaps between them.
@highlight Conflict resolution helps improve the behavior of agents and of the overall crowd.
