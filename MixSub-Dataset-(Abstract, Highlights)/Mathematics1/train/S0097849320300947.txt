 Computerized Tomography and more recently Magnetic Resonance Imaging have become the state of the art techniques for morpho volumetric analysis of abdominal cavities . Due to its constant motility the colon is an organ difficult to analyze . Unfortunately CTs radiative nature makes it only indicated for patients with important disorders . Lately acquisition techniques that rely on the use of MRI have matured enough to enable the analysis of colon data . This allows gathering data of patients without preparation and incorporating data of patients with non life threatening diseases and healthy subjects to databases . In this paper we present an end to end framework that comprises all the steps to extract colon content and morphology data coupled with a web based visualization tool that facilitates the visual exploration of such data . We also introduce the set of tools for the extraction of morphological data and a detailed description of a specifically designed interactive tool that facilitates a visual comparison of numerical variables within a set of patients as well as a detailed inspection of an individual . Our prototype was evaluated by domain experts which showed that our visual approach may reduce the costly process of colon data analysis . As a result physicians have been able to get new insights on the effects of diets and also to obtain a better understanding on the motility of the colon .
