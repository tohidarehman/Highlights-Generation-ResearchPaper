 From the autonomous car driving to medical diagnosis the requirement of the task of image segmentation is everywhere . Segmentation of an image is one of the indispensable tasks in computer vision . This task is comparatively complicated than other vision tasks as it needs low level spatial information . Basically image segmentation can be of two types semantic segmentation and instance segmentation . The combined version of these two basic tasks is known as panoptic segmentation . In the recent era the success of deep convolutional neural networks has influenced the field of segmentation greatly and gave us various successful models to date . In this survey we are going to take a glance at the evolution of both semantic and instance segmentation work based on CNN . We have also specified comparative architectural details of some state of the art models and discuss their training details to present a lucid understanding of hyper parameter tuning of those models . We have also drawn a comparison among the performance of those models on different datasets . Lastly we have given a glimpse of some state of the art panoptic segmentation models .
