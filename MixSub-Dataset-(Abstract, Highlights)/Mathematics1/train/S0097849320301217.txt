 New low cost Virtual Reality technology is enabling large numbers of engineers and designers to be outfitted with VR tools . This in turn is making feasible new tools such as immersive collaborative design environments that reflect the collaborative environment of drafting tables while still providing all the power of modern computer based design tools . However before such an environment can be fully realized basic issues surrounding collaboration in VR such as cybersickness and disorientation must be more fully addressed . This work presents the results of an experimental study conducted to characterize the trade offs between different styles of transitioning collaborators to a shared view in an immersive virtual environment . The experimental task consisted of asking participants to identify in which quadrant of the car specific components were located . Quadrant identification was performed after a participants virtual location was transitioned to a shared view location focused on the component to identify . The study was conducted with 45 participants who provided 1890 transition response datapoints . Analysis of these results suggests that in many cases collaborators are willing to experience some mild cybersickness in order to reduce their disorientation and improve both confidence and accuracy of component location identification . The results also support the recommendation that the best practice is to provide support for multiple transition styles and allow collaborators to select their preference .
