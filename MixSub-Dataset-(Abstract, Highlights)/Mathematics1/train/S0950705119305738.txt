 Multiple kernel learning for feature selection utilizes kernels to explore complex properties of features and performs better in embedded methods . However the kernels in MKL FS are generally limited to be positive definite . In fact indefinite kernels often emerge in actual applications and can achieve better empirical performance . But due to the non convexity of indefinite kernels existing MKL FS methods are usually inapplicable and the corresponding research is also relatively little . In this paper we propose a novel multiple indefinite kernel feature selection method based on the primal framework of indefinite kernel support vector machine which applies an indefinite base kernel for each feature and then exerts an

@highlight We propose a novel multiple indefinite kernel feature selection MIK FS method.
@highlight We utilize a sampling method to select landmark points for large scale problems.
@highlight We extend MIK FS to multi class feature selection scenarios.
@highlight Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our methods.
