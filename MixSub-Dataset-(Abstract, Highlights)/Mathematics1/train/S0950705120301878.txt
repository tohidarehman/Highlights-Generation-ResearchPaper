However the prime objective of any RS is to generate recommendation of items where items having higher preferences should be placed at higher positions in the recommendation list . Further the integration of user and item features i.e .

@highlight A novel preference relation based collaborative filtering model is proposed.
@highlight The proposed model can capture both second and higher order user item interactions.
@highlight Side information is integrated using matrix co factorization framework.
@highlight The proposed model is evaluated using standard ranking measures like NDCG and MAP.
@highlight The proposed model is compared with the current state of the art related methods.
