 Crime linkage is a challenging task in crime analysis which is to find serial crimes committed by the same offenders . It can be regarded as a binary classification task detecting serial case pairs . However most case pairs in the real world are nonserial so there is a serious class imbalance in the crime linkage . In this paper we propose a novel random forest based on the information granule . The approach does not resample the minority class or the majority class but concentrates on indistinguishable case pairs at the classification boundary . The information granule is used to identify case pairs that are difficult to distinguish in the dataset and constructs a nearly balanced dataset in the uncertainty region to deal with the imbalanced problem . In the proposed approach random trees come from the original dataset and the above mentioned nearly balanced dataset . A real world robbery dataset and some public imbalanced datasets are employed to measure the performance of the approach . The results show that the proposed approach is effective in dealing with class imbalances and it can be extended to combine with other methods solving class imbalances .
