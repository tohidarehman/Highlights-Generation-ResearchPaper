 Ceramic 3D printing has gained rapid development in recent years . Especially desktop ceramic 3D printers get more and more popular for designers artists and makers to work with clays . As a highly viscous pseudoplastic liquid the printing material clay produces featured aesthetics and also indicates several manufacturing constraints . There are barely customized modeling tools for ceramic printing . Targeting for ceramic printing we present a user interactive modeling and fabricating framework using sweeping lines as the design tool . We integrate the ceramic printing constraints like self supporting and collision free in the modeling stage . Then we propose a customized method for generating the printing file with the guarantee that the extruder traces a single continuous path without starts and stops . To fulfill this goal we compute an adaptive zig zag path along the sweeping surface . During the fabrication our continuous path avoids the potential collision between the printing head and the physical model . Moreover we optimize the extrusion amount along with the extruder movement such that overlap between neighboring layers is appropriate in terms of both model stability and cost effectiveness . We demonstrate the fabrication process and physical results to validate our method .
