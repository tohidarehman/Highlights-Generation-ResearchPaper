 Flexible job shop scheduling has been widely researched due to its application in many types of fields . However constraints including setup time and transportation time should be considered simultaneously among the realistic requirements . Moreover the energy consumptions during the machine processing and staying at the idle time should also be taken into account for green production . To address this issue first we modeled the problem by utilizing an integer programming method wherein the energy consumption and makespan objectives are optimized simultaneously . Afterward an improved Jaya algorithm was proposed to solve the problem . In the proposed algorithm each solution is represented by a two dimensional vector . Consequently several problem specific local search operators are developed to perform exploitation tasks . To enhance the exploration ability a SA based heuristic is embedded in the algorithm . Meanwhile to verify the performance of the proposed IJaya algorithm 30 instances with different scales were generated and used for simulation tests . Six efficient algorithms were selected for detailed comparisons . The simulation results confirmed that the proposed algorithm can solve the considered problem with high efficiency .
