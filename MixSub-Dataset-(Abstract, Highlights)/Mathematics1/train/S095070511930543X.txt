 This work proposes a robust loss function based on expectile penalty which includes and generalizes the existing loss functions . Then some important properties of RE loss are demonstrated such as asymmetry nonconvexity smoothness boundedness and asymptotic approximation behaviors . From the viewpoints of correntropy we analyze that the proposed RE loss can be viewed as a correntropy induced loss by a reproducing piecewise kernel . Furthermore a sparse version of RE loss is developed to improve sparsity by introducing a

@highlight Propose an analogous to correntropy induced loss RE loss .
