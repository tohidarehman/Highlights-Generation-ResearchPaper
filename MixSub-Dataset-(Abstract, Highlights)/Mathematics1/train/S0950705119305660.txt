 Echo State Network is a specific class of recurrent neural networks which displays very rich dynamics owing to its reservoir based hidden neurons . ESN has been viewed as a powerful approach to model real valued time series processes . In order to integrate with deep learning theory Deep Belief Echo State Network is employed to address the slow convergence in Deep Belief Network . In DBESN the DBN part is employed for feature learning in an unsupervised fashion and the ESN part is utilized as a regression layer of DBN . However the ESN input layer is still not working in an unsupervised status in DBESN . Moreover ESNs input dimension increases dramatically because of the DBN layer in DBESN . Namely the DBN layer in DBESN makes the ESN more difficult to construct the input scaling parameters . For purpose of constructing an optimal input weights matrix and input scaling parameters in the ESN layer of DBESN a novel Sensitivity Analysis Input Scaling Auto Encoder algorithm is employed in this paper through an unsupervised pre training process . Initially the output weights matrix of ESN layer is pre trained by total input data set . Then the pre trained output weights matrix is injected into the input weights matrix of the ESN layer to ensure the specificity of AE . Finally the input scaling parameters of ESN layer are tuned based on a sensitivity analysis algorithm . Two multivariable sequence tasks and one univariate sequence benchmark are applied to demonstrate the advantage and superiority of SAIS AE . Extensive experimental results show that our SAIS AE DBESN model can effectively improve the performance of DBESN .
