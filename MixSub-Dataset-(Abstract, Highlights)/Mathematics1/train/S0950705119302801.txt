 Missing data imputation is a very important data cleaning task for machine learning and data mining with incomplete data . This paper proposes two novel methods for missing data imputation named kEMI and kEMI

@highlight Two novel missing data imputation techniques are proposed.
@highlight These novel imputation techniques handle both numerical and categorical features.
@highlight Experimental comparison based on eleven publicly datasets two evaluation criteria.
@highlight Missing scores are estimated by learning local and global similarities.
@highlight Top estimations are fused to obtain the final estimation.
