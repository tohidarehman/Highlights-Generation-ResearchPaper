 The arrhythmia is an important group of cardiovascular disease . Electrocardiogram is commonly used for detecting arrhythmias . Computer aided diagnosis system can diagnose ECG automatically without the limitations of visual inspection . In order to improve the performance of ECG heartbeat classification this paper proposes a novel automatic classification system . Based on convolutional neural network and long short term memory network a deep structure with multiple input layers is proposed . Four input layers are constructed based on different regions of a heartbeat and RR interval features . The first three inputs are convolved using different strides . The three outputs of CNN are then concatenated and go through an LSTM network . Two fully connected layers follow and the output is concatenated with the fourth input . Eventually the last fully connected layer outputs the predicted label . The proposed system was evaluated by two division schemes of the MIT BIH arrhythmia database . Class oriented scheme achieved an overall accuracy of 99.26 and subject oriented scheme obtained an accuracy of 94.20 . The comparison with previous works showed the excellent performance of the novel network . The combination of automatic features and handcraft features was demonstrated to be helpful in heartbeat classification . Hence the system can be used for clinical application .
