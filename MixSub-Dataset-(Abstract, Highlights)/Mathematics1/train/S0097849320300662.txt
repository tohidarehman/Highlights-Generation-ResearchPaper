 The face centered cubic grid is a space filling grid one of the alternatives to the traditional cubic one . We show that there are five Hamiltonian cycles connecting the faces of a voxel in the FCC grid . Each of the five cycles can be used to trace the boundary of a class of objects in the grid constructed by iteratively attaching voxels so that each new voxel shares exactly one face with the set of already attached voxels .

@highlight Each of the five cycles can be used to trace the boundary of tree like objects in the FCC grid.
@highlight This has applications in mesh visualization compression and transmission.
