 We present co skeletons a new method that computes consistent curve skeletons for 3D shapes from a given family . We compute co skeletons in terms of sampling density and semantic relevance while preserving the desired characteristics of traditional per shape curve skeletonization approaches . We take the curve skeletons extracted by traditional approaches for all shapes from a family as input and compute semantic correlation information of individual skeleton branches to guide an edge pruning process via skeleton based descriptors clustering and a voting algorithm . Our approach achieves more concise and family consistent skeletons when compared to traditional per shape methods . We show the utility of our method by using co skeletons for shape segmentation and shape blending on real world data .
