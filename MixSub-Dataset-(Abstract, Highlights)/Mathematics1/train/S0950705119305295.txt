 This paper presents a novel optimization algorithm called Equilibrium Optimizer inspired by control volume mass balance models used to estimate both dynamic and equilibrium states . In EO each particle with its concentration acts as a search agent . The search agents randomly update their concentration with respect to best so far solutions namely equilibrium candidates to finally reach to the equilibrium state . A well defined generation rate term is proved to invigorate EOs ability in exploration exploitation and local minima avoidance . The proposed algorithm is benchmarked with 58 unimodal multimodal and composition functions and three engineering application problems . Results of EO are compared to three categories of existing optimization methods including the most well known meta heuristics including Genetic Algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization recently developed algorithms including Grey Wolf Optimizer Gravitational Search Algorithm and Salp Swarm Algorithm and high performance optimizers including CMA ES SHADE and LSHADE SPACMA . Using average rank of Friedman test for all 58 mathematical functions EO is able to outperform PSO GWO GA GSA SSA and CMA ES by 60 69 94 96 77 and 64 respectively while it is outperformed by SHADE and LSHADE SPACMA by 24 and 27 respectively . The BonferroniDunnand Holms tests for all functions showed that EO is significantly a better algorithm than PSO GWO GA GSA SSA and CMA ES while its performance is statistically similar to SHADE and LSHADE SPACMA . The source code of EO is publicly availabe at
