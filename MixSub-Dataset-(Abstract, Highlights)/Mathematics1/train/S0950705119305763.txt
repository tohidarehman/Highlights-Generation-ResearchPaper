 In order to solve real life problems several metaheuristic optimization algorithms have been developed . The Moth Flame Optimization algorithm is a search algorithm based on a mechanism called transverse orientation . In this mechanism the moths tend to maintain a fixed angle with respect to the moon . MFO suffers from the degeneration of the global search capability and convergence speed . To overcome these imperfections an Improved Moth Flame Optimization algorithm is proposed . The main novelty of the proposed approach is the definition of a hybrid phase between exploration and exploitation . This phase is characterized by a fitness depended weight factor for updating the moths positions . IMFO is tested on selected benchmark functions CEC2014 test functions and 6 design problems and compared with recent well known optimization algorithms . The results show that IMFO achieves the best results with respect to the comparison algorithms in terms of search capability and convergence performances .
