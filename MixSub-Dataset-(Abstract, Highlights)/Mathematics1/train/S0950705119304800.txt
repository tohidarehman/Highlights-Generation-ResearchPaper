 Consensus based large group emergency decision making is a dynamic and iterative process in which some experts may show non cooperative behaviors because they have different knowledge backgrounds and represent different stakeholders . Non cooperative behaviors greatly affect the efficiency and results of decision making . Time is of the essence in an emergency situation and thus rational treatment of non cooperative behaviors is required . In addition in traditional group decision making the decision model is based on the premise that decision makers are independent . However with the development of online social networks the objective trust relationships between experts should be considered . Hence this paper proposes a consensus model that considers the experts trust relations based on social network analysis and preference risks based on interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers . The trust risk preference risk and an approach for analyzing and managing non cooperative behaviors are proposed . An illustrative example and a comparison are provided to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method .

@highlight A new consensus reaching framework based on SNA in LGEDM is proposed.
@highlight A novel mechanism for addressing non cooperative behaviors is proposed.
@highlight The decision risk is considered the trust risk and preference risk are proposed.
