 Over the years portfolio optimization remains an important decision making strategy for investment . The most familiar and widely used approach in the field of portfolio optimization is the meanvariance framework introduced by Markowitz . Following this pioneering work many researchers have extended this model to make it more practical and adapt to real life problems . In this study one of these extensions the cardinality constrained portfolio optimization problem is considered . Cardinality constraints transform the quadratic optimization model into the mixed integer quadratic programming problem which is proved to be NP Hard making it harder to obtain an optimal solution within a reasonable time by using exact solution methodologies . Hence the vast majority of the researchers have taken advantage of approximate algorithms to overcome arising computational difficulties . To develop an efficient solution approach for cardinality constrained portfolio optimization in this study a parallel variable neighborhood search algorithm combined with quadratic programming is proposed . While the variable neighborhood search algorithm decides the combination of assets to be held in the portfolio quadratic programming quickly calculates the proportions of assets . The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on five well known datasets and compared with other solution approaches in the literature . Obtained results confirm that the proposed solution approach is very efficient especially on the portfolios with low risk and highly competitive with state of the art algorithms .
