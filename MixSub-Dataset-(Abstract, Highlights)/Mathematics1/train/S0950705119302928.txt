 Various methods have been put forward to perform automatic social based event detection and description . Yet most of them do not capture the semantic meaning embedded in online social media data which are usually highly heterogeneous and unstructured and do not identify event relationships e.g . car accident temporally occurs

@highlight Performs semantic aware event detection description and linkage from social media data.
@highlight Represents heterogeneous data in generic model made of temporal spatial semantic dimensions.
@highlight Evaluates data similarity using combined temporal spatial and semantic similarity measures.
@highlight Detects events from similar social media objects using adapted unsupervised learning algorithm.
@highlight Describes events in generic model and identifies their directional metric topologic relations.
