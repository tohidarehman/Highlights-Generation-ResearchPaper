 As economic globalization large manufacturing enterprises build production centers in different places to maximize profit . Therefore scheduling problems among multiple production centers should be considered . This paper studies a distributed hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with makespan criterion which combines the characteristic of distributed flow shop scheduling and parallel machine scheduling . In the DHFSP a set of jobs are assigned into a set of identical factories to process . Each job needs to be through same route with a set of stages and each stage has several machines in parallel and at least one of stage has more than one machine . For solving the DHFSP this paper proposes two algorithms DNEH with smallest medium rule and multi neighborhood iterated greedy algorithm . The DNEH with smallest medium rule constructive heuristic first generates a seed sequence by decomposition and smallest medium rule and then uses a greedy iteration to assign jobs to factories . In the iterated greedy algorithm a multi search construction is proposed which applies the greedy insertion to the factory again after inserting a new job . Then a multi neighborhood local search is utilized to enhance local search ability . The proposed algorithms are evaluated by a comprehensive comparison and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are very competitive for solving the DHFSP .
