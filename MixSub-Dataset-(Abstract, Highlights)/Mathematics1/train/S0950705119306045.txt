 Epileptic seizure detection is traditionally performed by visual observation of Electroencephalogram signals . Owing to its onerous and time consuming nature seizure detection based on visual inspection hinders epilepsy diagnosis monitoring and large scale data analysis in epilepsy research . So there is a dire need of an automatic seizure detection scheme .

@highlight An automated epileptic seizure detection algorithm for EEG signals is proposed.
@highlight A novel signal processing technique namely CEEMDAN is employed.
@highlight We introduce adaptive boosting for computerized seizure diagnosis.
@highlight Efficacy of the method is confirmed by statistical and graphical analyses.
@highlight The performance of the proposed scheme compared to the existing ones is promising.
