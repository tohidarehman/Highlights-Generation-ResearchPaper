 Using topology in data analysis known as Topological Data Analysis is now a promising new area of data mining research . One of the important and foundational tools of TDA is the Mapper algorithm . During the past two decades this algorithm has proven its useful and robust abilities in extracting insights and meaningful information from high dimensional datasets . Nevertheless several alterations in the choices of parameters such as lens cover and clustering can be used to develop this algorithm . In this paper we propose the F Mapper algorithm based on the foundation of the Mapper algorithm to solve the problem of automating when dividing cover intervals with an arbitrary percentage of overlap . To clarify the efficiency of this enhanced algorithm experiments were carried out on three datasets including the Unit Circle Reaven and Miller Diabetes and NKI Breast Cancer . The experimental results will be analyzed and compared with those of the original method the Mapper algorithm through the output image and silhouette coefficient score in the evaluation of clustering .

@highlight The Mapper algorithm is optimized in choosing cover automatically with random percentage.
@highlight The F Mapper outputs are rather similar to those of the Mapper in the topological sense.
@highlight The F Mapper results are well clustered based on the silhouette coefficient score.
