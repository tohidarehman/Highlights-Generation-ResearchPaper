 We propose a new approach for real time Tone Mapping Operator dedicated to High Dynamic Range rendering of interactive 3D scenes . The proposed method considers the whole scene lighting in order to preserve the global coherency . This is the major contribution of our method . Indeed most of existing Tone Mapping Operators only consider the image rendered by the camera at the current frame and simulate the Human Visual System accommodation to bright and dark luminance . Consequently after an adaptation time the lighting design of the 3D scene is lost . For example two rooms with a high contrast can be perceived with the same luminance level after adaptation . To cope with this coherency issue we adapt an existing Tone Mapping Operator that combines a global Tone Mapping Operator which takes into account the High Dynamic Range of the whole scene and a viewport frame based Tone Mapping Operator that enhances the image contrast . Thus we preserve the global lighting coherency and enhance the contrast for each rendered image . Furthermore we present a subjective evaluation that shows that our method provides a better user experience than previous methods in the case of visualization on Head Mounted Display .
