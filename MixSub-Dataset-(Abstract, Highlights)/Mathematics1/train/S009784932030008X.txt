 Ray Triangle intersection is a fundamental computation in most ray tracing algorithms . The prohibitive cost of the ray triangle test algorithms limits the utilization of these algorithms in settings with low power budgets such as mobile systems . In this work we analyze the precision requirements for ray triangle intersection and observe that for most of the rays a low fixed point precision is sufficient and only for a small fraction of rays a high precision is required . Accordingly we propose a dual precision fixed point hardware accelerator for ray triangle intersection targeting low power systems where the higher precision is only activated for tests deemed critical by our algorithm . Towards this goal we develop a thresholding technique that autonomously switches between the lower and higher precisions where the lower precision unit is used for the majority of the tests resulting in significant benefits in power consumption . We evaluate our methodology on a representative set of scenes and our proposed methodology in hardware . Our methodology introduces negligible accuracy errors in ray triangle tests with an average of 0.25 misclassifications while offering 87 savings in energy consumption compared to a baseline floating point design and 27 savings compared to a high precision fixed point design .

@highlight We find that low precision arithmetic can classify most ray triangle intersection tests only few tests need high precision.
@highlight We analytically identify the optimal low precision and high precision requirements to minimize power consumption
@highlight We design and implement a dual precision fixed point ray triangle intersection accelerator with low and high precision units.
@highlight We formulate a thresholding method to assess the criticality of a test and activate the high precision unit if necessary.
@highlight We report significant improvements in power consumption and other design metrics using our methodology.
