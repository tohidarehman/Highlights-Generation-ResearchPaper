 Cryo electron tomography is an imaging technique that allows us to three dimensionally visualize both the structural details of macro molecular assemblies under near native conditions and its cellular context . Electrons strongly interact with biological samples limiting electron dose . The latter limits the signal to noise ratio and hence resolution of an individual tomogram to about 50 . Biological molecules can be obtained by averaging volumes each depicting copies of the molecule allowing for resolutions beyond 4 . To this end the ability to localize and classify components is crucial but challenging due to the low signal to noise ratio . Computational innovation is key to mine biological information from cryo electron tomography .
