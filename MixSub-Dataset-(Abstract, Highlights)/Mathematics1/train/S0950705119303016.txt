 The class imbalance problem in machine learning contains a skewed distribution of samples among different classes resulting in a learning bias toward the majority class . Interpolation based oversampling techniques solve this problem by yielding the synthetic minority samples to correct the imbalanced class distribution which has become one of the most popular types of solutions . However several non negligible drawbacks exist in them . This study identifies that the flaws of the over constraint low efficiency expansion and over generalization can occur when interpolating the synthetic samples for the inland minority samples borderline minority samples and trapped minority samples respectively . To overcome these flaws a Position characteristic Aware Interpolation Oversampling algorithm is proposed . PAIO first leverages a neighborhood based clustering algorithm to divide the minority samples into three types of samples with different position characteristics . It then carries out ad hoc interpolation oversampling for these three different types of minority samples so that the deficiencies can be addressed correspondingly . Moreover another drawback in interpolation base oversampling algorithms is the groundless populating for the categorical attributes of synthetic samples . To solve this problem we develop a Generalized Interpolation Creation way to fill the categorical attributes . Extensive experiments on a number of real world datasets demonstrate that the effectiveness of the proposed PAIO and GIC .
