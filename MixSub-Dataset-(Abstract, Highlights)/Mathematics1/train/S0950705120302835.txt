 Multivariate functional data refer to a population of multivariate functions generated by a system involving dynamic parameters depending on continuous variables . Outlier detection in such a context is a challenging problem because both the individual behavior of the parameters and the dynamic correlation between them are important . To address this problem recent work has focused on multivariate functional depth to identify the outliers in a given dataset . However most previous approaches fail when the outlyingness manifests itself in curve shape rather than curve magnitude . In this paper we propose identifying outliers in multivariate functional data by a method whereby different outlying features are captured based on mapping functions from differential geometry . In this regard we extract shape features reflecting the outlyingness of a curve with a high degree of interpretability . We conduct an experimental study on real and synthetic datasets and compare the proposed method with functional depth based methods . The results demonstrate that the proposed method combined with state of the art outlier detection algorithms can outperform the functional depth based methods . Moreover in contrast with the baseline methods it is efficient regardless of the proportion of outliers .

@highlight Functional curve shape features are proposed to detect outliers in multivariate functional data.
@highlight These functional features are combined with state of the art outlier detection algorithms.
@highlight Our proposal experimentally outperforms baseline methods in various outlier detection scenarios.
