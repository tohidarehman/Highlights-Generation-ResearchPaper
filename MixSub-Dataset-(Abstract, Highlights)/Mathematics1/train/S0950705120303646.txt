 Document level review sentiment classification aims to predict the sentiment category for given review documents written by users for products . Most of the existing methods focus on generating a good review document representation and classifying the review document directly . However on the one hand as document level review sentiment classification usually includes many sentiment categories and the difference between these sentiment categories is not obvious it may be difficult to obtain satisfying result by direct classification . On the other hand this once classification process with review representation may fail to well interpret how the results are achieved . In addition although some information such as user preference and product characteristics are incorporated when building models the interactive information between user and product are usually ignored . In this paper inspired by the deductive reasoning strategy of human doing multiple choice questions we are motivated to propose a Two Stage Sentiment Classification model to classify review documents in two stages

@highlight Two stage classification simulates process of human doing multiple choice questions.
@highlight User product interactive information judges the sentiment tendency of reviews.
@highlight Both performance and interpretability of the model are improved.
@highlight Model is more effective for more fine grained sentiment classification task.
