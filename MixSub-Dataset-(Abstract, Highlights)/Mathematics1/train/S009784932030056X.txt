 Mechanical puzzles have fascinated many people for a long time . While some puzzles require complex procedures to solve there are puzzles that can be solved easily if the solver understands the underlying mechanism . In this paper we focus on mechanical puzzles that can be solved by spin such that centrifugal force is applied to the internal mechanical core to unlock the locked state . While traditional centrifugal puzzles are limited to simple shapes we propose a computational design method to generalize such puzzles by embedding the mechanical core into 3D models . We parameterize the internal core mechanism and optimize the design under several design constraints and we generate a support structure that helps users solve puzzles easily because generalized puzzles can not always be spun steadily and easily due to complex surfaces and non flat contact areas . Additionally we embed multiple cores into a model . To solve a multi core puzzle the user must follow certain orders to unlock each locking mechanism . We fabricate a variety of designed puzzles and demonstrate whether they can be physically unlocked .

@highlight We propose a computational design method to generalize centrifugal puzzles.
@highlight We also propose a method to generate a support structure i.e. a key that allows a user to unlock the puzzles easily.
@highlight We demonstrate the proposed method by physically unlocking the 3D printed puzzles designed using our design system.
