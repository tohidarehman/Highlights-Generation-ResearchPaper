 This paper presents a measurement based FEM modeling and haptic rendering framework for objects with hyper elastic deformation property . A complete set of methods covering the whole process of the measurement based modeling rendering paradigm is newly designed and implemented with a special emphasis on haptic feedback realism . To this end we first build a data collection setup that accurately captures shape deformation and response forces during compressive deformation of cylindrical material samples . With this setup training and testing sets of data are collected from four silicone objects having various material profiles . Then an objective function incorporating both shape deformation and reactive forces is designed and used to identify material parameters based on training data and the genetic algorithm . For real time haptic rendering an optimization based FEM solver is adopted ensuring around 500Hz update rate . The whole procedure is evaluated through numerical and psychophysical experiments . The numerical rendering error is calculated based on the difference between simulated and actually measured deformation forces . The errors are also compared to the human perceptual threshold and found to be perceptually negligible . Overall realism of the feedback from the system is also assessed through the psychophysical experiment . A total of twelve participants rated similarity between real and modeled objects and the results reveal the rendering quality to be at a reasonable level of realism with positive user feedback .
