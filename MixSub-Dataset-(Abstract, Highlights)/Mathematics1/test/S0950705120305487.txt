 This paper proposes a sparse representation layer in the feature extraction stage of a convolutional neural network . Our goal is to add sparse transforms to a target network to improve its performance without introducing an extra calculation burden . First the proposed method was achieved by inserting the sparse representation layers into a target networks shallow layers and the network was trained end to end using a supervised learning algorithm . Second In the forward pass the network captured the features through the convolutional layers and sparse representation layers accomplished with wavelet and shearlet transforms . Thirdly in the backward pass the weights of the learned kernels of the network were updated through a back propagated error while the sparse representation layers were fixed and did not require updating . The proposed method was verified on five datasets with the task of image classification FOOD 101 CIFAR10 100 DTD Brodatz and ImageNet . The experimental results show that the proposed method leads to higher recognition accuracy in image classification and the additional computational cost is relatively small compared to the baseline CNN model .

@highlight This paper proposes the hybrid of a CNN model and sparse representation.
@highlight We combine the CNN with predefined filters of wavelet and shearlet transform.
@highlight The paper theoretically explains the work procedure of the proposed network model.
