 As a digital representation of building projects Building Information Modeling can accumulate large volumes of log data containing hidden knowledge for deep exploration . However such ever increasing logs are likely to suffer from high complexity inaccuracy and uncertainty which will inevitably raise challenges in uncovering latent and meaningful patterns . In order to yield satisfactory clustering quality and efficiency for better design process management a novel clustering based BIM event log mining approach is put forward in this paper . For one thing a hybrid clustering algorithm named adaptive efficient fuzzy Kohonen clustering network is developed with a modified learning rate to accelerate the convergence . For another a new clustering validity index only relying on boundary points is designed to reduce computational complexity . An experiment is conducted in a 4 GB realistic BIM design event log dataset to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method . It begins from extracting a set of features associated with designers engagement and efficiency and ends up retrieving inherent insights into the persons design behavioral patterns . Moreover the cluster analysis can significantly distinguish the design productivity at different time periods into the high medium and low level which presents a unique opportunity in understanding and assessing design productivity objectively . Practically our method can support data driven decision making for managers to strategically schedule personalized work for different designers aiming to boost design efficiency and smooth the design process .
