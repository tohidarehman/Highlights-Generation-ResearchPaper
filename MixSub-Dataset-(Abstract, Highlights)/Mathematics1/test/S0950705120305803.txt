 Knowledge and emotion play important roles in the process of crowd evacuation . Knowledge determines the moving direction of an individual and emotion determines the moving speed of an individual . However the existing works lack consideration of knowledge and emotion at the same time which results in unreasonable simulation of crowd evacuation . To solve this problem we propose a knowledge and emotion dual driven method for crowd evacuation simulation . First the knowledge representation and knowledge transmission are modeled to quantify the knowledge of evacuees . In this step the knowledge representation is modeled by differentiating the hazard source knowledge and the scenario knowledge and the factors affecting knowledge transmission are combined with the susceptible infected model to simulate the process of knowledge transmission . Second the emotion model is constructed to quantify the individual emotion in the evacuation process . In this paper the quantification of emotion takes into account two factors the influence of individual knowledge on emotion is quantified by using Siminovs psychology model the influence of emotional contagion among individuals is also considered . Then quantitative individual knowledge and emotion are combined with the reciprocal velocity obstacles model to build the knowledge and emotion dual driven crowd evacuation model . Finally we implement a 3D crowd simulation system based on the knowledge and emotion dual driven model to visualize the results of our theoretical analysis . The experimental results show that the proposed method can more realistically simulate crowd evacuation in an emergency situation .
