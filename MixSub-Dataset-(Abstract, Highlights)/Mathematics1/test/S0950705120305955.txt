 During a practical detection process insufficient defect data unbalanced defect types and the high cost of defect labeling can present problems . Therefore it often takes considerable time and labor to collect actual samples to improve the accuracy of defect classification and recognition . In this paper we propose a weak supervision machine vision detection method based on artificial defect simulation . First four typical mobile phone screen defects scratches floaters light stains and severe stains are simulated by the proposed synthesis algorithms and an artificial defect database is created . Next the artificial dataset is applied to a deep learning recognition algorithm and an initial model is trained . Then the collected actual defects are augmented due to the insufficient training quantity . The augmented actual defects are then applied as the training data and the initial model is retrained by fine tuning . Finally the well retrained model is used for defect recognition . The experimental results demonstrate that satisfactory performance is achieved with the proposed detection method .
