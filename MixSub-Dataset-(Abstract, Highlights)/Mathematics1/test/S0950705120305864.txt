 High utility itemsets are sets of items that have a high utility in a transaction database . Discovering high utility itemsets has many important applications in real life such as market basket analysis . Nonetheless mining these patterns is a time consuming process due to the huge search space and the high cost of utility computation . Most of previous work is devoted to search space pruning but pay little attention to utility computation . Factually not only search space pruning but also high utility itemset identification have to resort to the computation of various utilities . This paper proposes a novel algorithm named REX which extends the classic d

@highlight A k item utility machine can quickly identify high utility itemsets from the extension set of an itemset.
@highlight A switch strategy is superior to the strategy used in the d
@highlight HUP algorithm.
@highlight The Rex algorithm incorporating the proposed structure machine and strategy significantly outperforms state of the art algorithms.
