 There has contradictions in timeliness and diversity in the design schemes of complex product systems . The traditional solidified knowledge template for the knowledge reuse purpose can not meet the rapid design needs of complex products . This paper proposes a configurable knowledge ontology model and a corresponding design method for rapid derivation of complex products . Based on the combination of basic knowledge elements customized knowledge elements and assorted knowledge elements a knowledge structural body is constructed by unitizing knowledge ontology into units of knowledge . And a dynamic structured knowledge template configuration method based on physical form configuration and virtual form association is proposed . The knowledge configuration information is transmitted and parsed in XML form and the virtual form is established to associate and dynamically configure the corresponding physical form knowledge structure . Based on the structured knowledge model configuration template a rapid derivative design method for electronic equipment is proposed . The rapid derivation design process is divided into three stages requirement analysis index demonstration and scheme formation . By establishing seven knowledge attributes such as global local scope retrieval the required product knowledge elements rule knowledge elements and tools are dynamically configured to realize the dynamic processing of design parameters based on configuration knowledge elements and then form a corresponding design scheme . Finally a rapid derivation design system is developed and applied to electronic equipment which verifies the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed model and method .

@highlight A knowledge model of unitized ontology with configurability is proposed.
@highlight A dynamic structured knowledge template is proposed and its configuration method is provided.
@highlight The method of rapid design based on configurable product knowledge and the workflow are studied.
@highlight A prototype system of rapid design is developed and a radar technical system design is taken as an example to show the research findings.
