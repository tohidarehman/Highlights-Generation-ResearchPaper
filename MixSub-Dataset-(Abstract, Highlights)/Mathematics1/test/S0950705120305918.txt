 Credit risk assessment is usually regarded as an imbalanced classification task solved by static ensemble classifiers . However the dynamic ensemble selection strategy that can select different ensemble classifiers for each query sample is rarely used . Deficiency of the existing DES algorithm in dealing with imbalanced data is the major challenge . In this paper a novel combined DES model is developed for imbalanced learning problems . To handle the imbalanced data sets the synthetic minority over sampling technique is initially used to balance a training set before generating a candidate classifier pool then the weighting mechanism of DES MI is used to highlight the importance of minority instances when evaluating classifier competences . To further ensure the comprehensive evaluation and right selection of the ensemble classifier the meta learning framework of META DES is used to account for multiple criteria and the two step selection strategy of DES KNN is employed to perform a trade off between the competence and diversity of the classifiers . Our experiments on 15 imbalanced data sets from the KEEL repository show that the proposed model improves the performance of seven known and popular DES algorithms in terms of the area under the curve . Moreover the type I error rate of the proposed method is lower than that of XGBoost and LightGBM in a real P2P loan data set indicating the efficiency of the proposed method for credit risk assessment .
