 Tooth segmentation acts as a crucial and fundamental role in dentistry for doctors to make diagnosis and treatment plans . In this paper we propose a Two Stage Attention Segmentation Network on dental panoramic X ray images to address the issues suffered in the tooth boundary and tooth root segmentation task which are caused by the low contrast and uneven intensity distribution . We firstly adopt an attention model which is embedded with global and local attention modules to roughly localize the tooth region in the first stage . Without any interactive operator the attention model so constructed can automatically aggregate pixel wise contextual information and identify coarse tooth boundaries . To better obtain final boundary information we use a fully convolutional network as the second stage to further segment the real tooth area from the attention maps obtained from the first stage . The effectiveness of TSASNet is substantiated on the benchmark dataset containing 1 500 dental panoramic X ray images our proposed method achieves 96.94 of accuracy 92.72 of dice and 93.77 of recall significantly superior to the current state of the art methods .

@highlight A two stage strategy is exploited for tooth localization and segmentation in dental panoramic X ray images.
@highlight A novel attention model focuses on automatically catching the real tooth region.
@highlight Tooth structures and the tooth root topologies are obtained by a hierarchical segmentation architecture.
@highlight The proposed method significantly superior to the current state of the art methods.
