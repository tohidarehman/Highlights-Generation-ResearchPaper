 In this work deep learning based diagnostic procedure is developed for the identification of engine defects of 2 wheeler vehicle . The process starts with acquisition of vibration data . Second time domain signals are converted into angular domain . Third random distribution of angular domain signals is done to have training and test data . Further processing of training and test data is carried out using wavelet synchro squeezed transform to form timefrequency images . Then cost function of convolution neural network is modified by introducing a new entropy based regularization function in the existing cost function which can meaningfully reduce the activation in the hidden layer of CNN so as to make the learning really deep . Thereafter training of improved CNN is carried out using WSST images of training samples . In the next step WSST images of test data are applied to tuned CNN for the identification of defects . A comparison of proposed method has been carried by existing deep learning solutions and the method proposed in the state of artwork . The comparison shows that the proposed method is at least 3.8 more superior in terms of accuracy than the existing defect diagnosis methods while diagnosing defects of internal combustion engine of 2 wheeler vehicle .

@highlight An improved deep learning model is developed for the diagnosis of engine defects of 2 wheeler vehicle.
@highlight Entropy based divergence function is introduced in the existing cost function of CNN.
@highlight The proposed function measures diversion of average sparsity from desired sparsity.
@highlight Regularization amount of diversion is added to cost of misclassification.
@highlight The superiority of proposed method is validated by comparing the performance with existing state of art works.
