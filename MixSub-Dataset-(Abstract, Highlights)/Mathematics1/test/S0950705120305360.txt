 In wireless sensor networks sensor nodes located close to the base station or sink are more susceptible to energy loss leading to premature disconnection of the network or energy holes . This is due to the fact that all traffic is forwarded towards the sink increasing the workloads for these closer nodes . One solution for this issue is to shorten the hop distance a sensors data has to travel until reaching the sink by deploying additional relay nodes . This paper considers the problem of optimal relay node placement for maximizing the network lifetime of wireless sensor networks in three dimensional terrains . We first design a mathematical model of the problem and reformulate it as a mixed integer programming model to provide a basis for finding lower bound solutions . We divide the problem into two phases and show that the second phase can be solved exactly using an algorithm based on maximum flow and binary search . We then propose a local search algorithm for the first phase utilizing the exact algorithm to create full solutions . Experimental validation on 3D datasets has been carried out to demonstrate the performance of our algorithms .

@highlight We study The Optimal Relay Node Placement Problem ORP3D to maximize the network lifetime of wireless sensor networks in three dimensional terrains. The main idea of our approach is reducing sensor energy consumption by optimizing relay nodes placement.
@highlight We propose a mixed integer programming model as a basis to achieve lower bound solutions. However mixed integer linear programming solvers have exponential complexity and do not scale well to large instances.
@highlight We propose an approximate two phase relay node deployment strategy in 3D which includes 2 sub problems The optimal flow capacity problem OFC3D and the optimal sensor assignment problem OSA3D .
@highlight An exact maximum flow and binary search algorithm is proposed to solve OSA3D and a novel local search is proposed for OFC3D. The two algorithms are used in conjunction to generate full solutions to ORP3D.
@highlight We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm through various experimental scenarios and compare the results with lower bound solutions.
