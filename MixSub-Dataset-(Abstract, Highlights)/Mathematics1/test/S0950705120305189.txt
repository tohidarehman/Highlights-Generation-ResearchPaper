 Generalized zero shot classification is a challenging task to recognize test data which may come from seen or unseen classes . Existing methods suffer from the bias problem that the unseen images are easy to be misclassified to seen classes . Generating some fake unseen samples by Generative Adversarial Network has been a popular method . However these models are not easy to train . In this paper we proposed a method by learning domain invariant unseen features for generalized zero shot classification . Specifically we learn the support seen class set for each unseen class for transferring knowledge from source to target domain . The unseen samples of each class are generated based on the combinations of the samples from its support seen class set . In addition for dealing with the domain shift problem between source and target domains we learn domain invariant unseen features by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy distance of seen data generated unseen data and then project target data to the common space . For dealing with the bias problem we select some confident target unseen samples to augment training samples for training the classifier . In experiments we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms other state of the art methods .
