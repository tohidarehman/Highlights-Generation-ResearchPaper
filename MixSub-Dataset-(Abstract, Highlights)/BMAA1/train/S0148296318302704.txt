 Through two studies in two different nations this research examines the nationality of non celebrity spokespeople and answers the question how does the nationality of a citizen ambassador influence attitudes toward a product being advertised Merging meaning transfer and schema congruity theories the results show that the use of citizen ambassadors of a different nationality as the consumer leads to higher product attitudes but only if the product is of the same nationality as the consumer . Consumers low in identity salience experience these effects the most such that the citizen ambassador is more influential on perceptions of nationally representative foods in comparison to consumers high in identity salience . Moderate incongruity appears to be a more potent explanation for the effects of citizen ambassadors on product attitudes toward nationally representative products especially in online advertising .
