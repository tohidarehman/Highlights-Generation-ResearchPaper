 Timely GDP announcements seem to be a useful approach for communicating immediate macroeconomic conditions however inaccuracy might instead trigger financial market turmoil . This study examines the stock market response to GDP announcements in Japan and provides several insights into the trade off between timeliness and accuracy . First the effect of the initial GDP announcement on stock price is tenuous at best suggesting little useful information in the provisional estimates . Second the stock market responds keenly to the first revision but poorly to the second revision . Finally depending on the expenditure components of GDP the revisions cause over and under reactions and thus are different destabilizing factors in stock prices .
