 This paper examines the real effects of the financial crisis on private firms in the Netherlands . We find that investments of small and medium sized private enterprises declined significantly both during and after the financial crisis . We also find that investments become less dependent on internal finance than on external finance during the crisis period . However the impacts of the two financing sources on firm investment during the post crisis period do not differ . The findings of the study suggest that borrowing from banks remained critical in determining the investments of private SMEs during the financial crisis of 20082009 .
