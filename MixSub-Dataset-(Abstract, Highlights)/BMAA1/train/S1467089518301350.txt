This allows us to understand the differences between IIS and digitalization in accounting and to illuminate avenues for future research . The paper concludes with an overview of three main differences in how IIS and digitalization have influenced accounting and three concurrent avenues for future research on digitalization in accounting the elusive boundaries of accounting power relations and knowledge production for decision making .
