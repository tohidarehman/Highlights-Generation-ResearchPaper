 IT IS strategy is of central importance to practice and many well developed lines of research have contributed to our understanding of IT IS strategy . However throughout the last decade digitalization has fundamentally transformed the business world and put into question traditional strategy wisdom . As information technologies are the driver of this digital transformation we can expect an even more fundamental change in IT IS strategy thinking . To verify this expectation we undertook an in depth extensive review of the academic literature on this topic . Our review which is time framed to the years 20082018 distils five different directions in the development of IT IS strategy research . It also identifies a shift in how IT IS strategy is defined and investigated over this period . Moreover we present an emerging debate on how digitalization challenges traditional IT IS strategy wisdom . As this debate is still in its infancy we take it further by entering into the larger discussion on digitalization including digital innovation digital ecosystems and digital transformation . Building on this we derive at deeper insights on how IT IS strategy could should or should better not be understood in the digital age .

@highlight We investigate the IT IS strategy research activity from its inception until today.
@highlight We identify five research trends in recent IT IS strategy research.
@highlight We find shifts in how IT IS strategy is understood by scholars in the last decade.
@highlight We infer how IT IS strategy can should or should not be understood in the digital age.
