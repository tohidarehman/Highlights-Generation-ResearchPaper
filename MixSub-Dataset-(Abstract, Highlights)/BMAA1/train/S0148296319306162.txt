 Intellectual capital is among the most long lived topics in managerial literature . More recently the emergence of the open innovation paradigm has encouraged the understanding that firms should collaborate with other organizations to leverage their own R D capabilities . We propose that these two streams of managerial literature should join forces since the OI paradigm could be considered an approach to innovation with foundations in relational capital facilitated by an appropriate level of human and structural capital . Surprisingly only a few researchers have put IC and OI into relation . Therefore this paper has two main goals providing a theoretical model that synoptically presents how IC and OI overlap and testing the theoretical model by analyzing how firms IC affects OI related performance . We analyze a sample of 3744 Spanish firms . We find that the three IC constructs positively affect OI performance with relational and human capital subject to diminishing returns .

@highlight The open innovation OI paradigm has developed a large epistemic community.
@highlight We contend that OI has its foundations in the Intellectual Capital IC theory.
@highlight An OI IC integrative framework is proposed.
@highlight An analysis of data from 3744 manufacturing Spanish firms supports the framework.
