 Prior research suggests that disfluency leads to unfavorable product judgments and can be mitigated by debiasing techniques . We suggest a moderating role for the need for cognitive closure such that when information about a favorable brand is present disfluency leads to less favorable judgments for low NFCC consumers but not for high NFCC consumers . Moreover warnings about disfluency mitigate the negative effect for low NFCC consumers but backfire for high NFCC ones . Across five experiments we demonstrate these effects through individual trait differences and cognitive load manipulations of NFCC . We suggest that the backfiring effect among high NFCC consumers is due to shifts in attention away from brand reputation towards the experience of disfluency making disfluency the primary judgmental cue . Implications of the findings for consumer inference are discussed .

@highlight In the presence of a favorable brand reputation low NFCC individuals form less favorable judgments when the information is disfluent vs. fluent to read whereas high NFCC individuals form favorable judgments despite disfluent information.

@highlight In the presence of a bad brand reputation people form unfavorable judgments regardless of their NFCC.
