 A significant recent technological development concerns the automation of knowledge and service work as a result of advances in Artificial Intelligence and its sub fields . We use the term Intelligent Automation to describe this phenomenon . This development presents organisations with a new strategic opportunity to increase business value . However academic research contributions that examine these developments are spread across a wide range of scholarly disciplines resulting in a lack of consensus regarding key findings and implications . We conduct the first interdisciplinary literature review that systematically characterises the intellectual state and development of Intelligent Automation technologies in the knowledge and service sectors . Based on this review we provide three significant contributions . First we conceptualise Intelligent Automation and its associated technologies . Second we provide a business value based model of Intelligent Automation for knowledge and service work and identify twelve research gaps that hinder a complete understanding of the business value realisation process . Third we provide a research agenda to address these gaps .
