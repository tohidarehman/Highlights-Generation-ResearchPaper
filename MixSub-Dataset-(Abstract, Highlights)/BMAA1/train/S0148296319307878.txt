 Although there is an urgent need to find new antibiotics to fight growing antibiotic resistance the development of antibiotics is at its lowest level ever . This innovation drought in the antibiotics industry is a challenge for managers policy makers and public health authorities . Currently several strategies to incentivize antibiotic innovation are being considered but their effects are unknown . Using the theoretical lens of the entrepreneurial orientation framework and Monte Carlo based simulations on state of the art pharmaceutical industry data this study found that several incentives can increase the innovativeness of firms in this industry . However the results show that these effects vary between incentives between large and small firms and across different research and development stages . This study analyzed these findings in the light of the entrepreneurial orientation framework and presents implications for theory policy makers and managers .
