 We investigate the relationship between family management and innovation investment propensity in family firms through analyzing the effect of two innovation impulses demand pull and technology push . Extending the technology push demand pull framework to the context of family firms and adopting a direct measure of firms innovation investment propensity we test our hypotheses on a sample of 1093 Italian small and medium sized family firms . Our results show that both the demand pull and technology push innovation impulses moderate the relationship between family management and the firms propensity to invest in innovation reducing the negative effect exerted by family management on family firms innovation investment propensity . Moreover our evidence shows that family firms innovation investments are more sensitive to the demand pull than the technology push impulse . Overall our findings suggest to practitioners and policymakers that family firm innovation impulses are important contingencies that need to be taken into account when making innovation investment decisions .
