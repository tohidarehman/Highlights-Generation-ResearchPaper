 Many firms struggle to successfully translate corporate strategy into value added solutions for customers by integrating products and services . A particular hurdle is the intrinsic motivation of the people in charge . This study contributes to the microfoundations of servitization literature by exploring what motives and strategies drive decision makers to pursue product service integration . Given the fragmented state of the literature we follow an abductive approach . First applying a behavioral strategy lens we identify the theoretical building blocks to construct a conceptual framework . Next we collect data of 178 small Belgian firms to perform an exploratory quantitative analysis . Finally we develop theory based on the results . Specifically we find that the need for achievement and affiliation are both directly and positively associated with PSI . Also achievement driven people are likely to pursue PSI originating from a product leadership position . Finally the power motive is positively associated with operational excellence but not with PSI .

@highlight Servitization relates to both human motivation and firms value strategies.
@highlight Human motivation provides a plausible explanation for PSI strategy.
@highlight The achievement motive relates to PSI following product leadership.
@highlight The affiliation motive relates to PSI but not as an incorporated value strategy.
@highlight The power motive does not relate to PSI only to operational excellence.
