 How do configurations of humans and algorithms evolve as firms adopt artificial intelligence capabilities and what are the implications for work and organization We explored these questions through a two year long case study of an organization in the international maritime trade that introduced automated algorithmic support for data analysis and prediction work . Drawing on a humanmachine configuration perspective we found that humans and the algorithm were configured and reconfigured in multiple ways over time as the organization dealt with the introduction of algorithmic analysis . In contrast to replacing human work the emergent configurations required new roles and redistribution of extant expertise to augment and improve the accuracy of the algorithm . Our analysis suggests that the new configuration resembled a human in the loop pattern comprised of both the augmentation work of
