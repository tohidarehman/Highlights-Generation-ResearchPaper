 Mobile technologies have dramatically increased the number of work related interruptions especially after regular work hours . At the same time many employees have limited freedom to decide how and when they accomplish their work a condition that renders the explosion of interruptions especially problematic . This study proposes that perceived interruption overload negatively impacts work related technology usage via workers experiences of work life conflict a key source of stress and that this indirect effect is stronger for lower levels of worker control . Data were collected from 601 knowledge workers and analyzed through Conditional process analysis which integrates moderation and mediation analyses . The results supported our model . This study takes an important step toward elucidating the role of mobile technology in work life conflict and technostress and it illustrates the roles of perceived interruption overload as well as conflict and technostress in IT use .

@highlight Focus on mobile technology an important area that we need to better understand.
@highlight Explicating how and why interruption overload influences IT use mediation .
@highlight Explicating under what conditions interruption overload influences IT use moderation .
@highlight Full integration of mediation and moderation both in theory development and testing.
@highlight The research model is developed based on strong theory the demand control model.
@highlight Introduction of Conditional process analysis as an advanced form of mediation analysis to IS research.
