 Environmental issues are becoming more and more important in our everyday life . Data Envelopment Analysis is a tool developed for measuring relative operational efficiency . DEA can also be employed to estimate environmental efficiency where undesirable outputs like greenhouse gases exist . The classical DEA method identifies best practices among a given empirical data set . In many situations however it is advantageous to determine the worst practices and perform efficiency evaluation by comparing DMUs with the full inefficient frontier . This strategy requires that the conventional production possibility set is defined from a reverse perspective . In this paper presence of both desirable and undesirable outputs is assumed and a methodological framework for performing an unbiased efficiency analysis is proposed . The reverse production possibility set is defined and new models are presented regarding the full inefficient frontier . The operational environmental and overall reverse efficiencies are studied . The important notion of weak disposability is discussed and the effects of this assumption on the proposed models are investigated . The capability of the proposed method is examined using data from a real world application about paper production .
