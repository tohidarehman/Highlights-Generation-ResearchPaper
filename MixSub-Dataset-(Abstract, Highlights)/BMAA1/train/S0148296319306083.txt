 Firms report their innovative sustainability activities as a way to increase firm performance with a purpose . Managing effective sustainability to maintain its relevance and value to stakeholders through organizational ambidexterity is an important undertaking in a business environment that is increasingly concerned with corporate social responsibility . However the research that links effective sustainability and long term financial performance is inconclusive . This study uses content analysis and fsQCA to specify and model the pertinent conditions for innovative sustainability . The model shows that firms need to manage stakeholders with heterogeneous motives as a condition for effective sustainability in order to yield long term financial performance . The findings extend the organizational ambidexterity theory and operationalize stakeholders shared understanding as a measure for the stakeholder theory in the context of corporate social responsibility research .
