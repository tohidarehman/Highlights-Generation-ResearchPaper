 This article starts from the assumption that it is important for the evaluation of gender equality interventions in RTDI to consider its context regarding gender equality regime and evaluation culture because this context does influence effects and long term impacts of such activities . It aims to provide key characteristics for the differentiation of gender equality regimes and evaluation regimes to be considered when designing policy interventions or evaluating specific gender equality interventions in RTDI . After a literature review of relevant typologies for welfare state and gender equality regimes it was analysed to which extent the seven EFFORTI countries correspond to certain typologies based on the data basis of the context research performed in the EFFORTI project . For this context research international national and qualitative quantitative data regarding the relevant framework conditions were firstly collected for each of the EFFORTI countries and secondly compared in a cross country analysis . The research showed that when it comes to gender equality policies most EFFORTI countries can either be assigned to the Considering the different framework conditions is relevant when it comes to evaluation as different national contexts might require different policy and designs of activities but might also shape the interventions effects . This article therefore aims to provide support in this regard for future evaluations of gender policies .

@highlight Considering the different framework conditions of gender equality measures is relevant when it comes to evaluation.
@highlight Different national contexts require different policy and measure designs and shape the measures effects.
@highlight Countries analysed in the H2020 project EFFORTI can either be assigned to the
@highlight category or
@highlight in the typology of von Wahl 2005 with the latter type tending to provide less favourable conditions for women in the general labour market as well as women in RTDI.
