 This paper examines the adaptation of innovations to suit new fields and user communities . We argue that this early stage work to adapt a technology to a new context is essential for later diffusion particularly with complex technological innovationsa topic less examined in marketing . Through the case of grid computing a precursor to todays Cloud computing we examine the structure and process of this essential adaptation work for diffusion across boundaries and the enabling role of government funding . Grid computing was adapted via cross boundary collaborations by innovators and collaborators in other fields . Integrating the work of various actors and elements in the market systems tradition we provide a process model of co linking for cross field adaptation and diffusion . This contributes new insight into the diffusion of complex technologies with a focus on early non buyer roles enhancing later diffusion across boundaries and adaptation work occurring prior to traditional consumer adoption .

@highlight Early stage work to diffuse complex innovations has not been fully explored.
@highlight Diffusion may require multiples actors for adaptation across field boundaries.
@highlight Adaptation by multiple actors can enhance diffusion across field boundaries.
@highlight Cross boundary work can adapt the innovation to the demands of a new field.
@highlight Adaptation also requires demonstrating how the innovation fits into the new field.
