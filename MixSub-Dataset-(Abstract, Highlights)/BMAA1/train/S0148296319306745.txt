 The effective management of knowledge exchange is critical for open innovation in ecosystem contexts where organizations may partner with potential competitors . This study contributes to existing knowledge by detecting the conditions for knowledge transfer success between both coopetitive and non competitive ecosystem partners . The study uses a qualitative approach . Semi structured interviews were conducted with 20 stakeholders across multi industry ecosystems to compare the presence of knowledge transfer conditions between competitors and non competitors . Through fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis configurational recipes of conditions were identified revealing the distinct configurations required of either coopetitive or non competitive partnerships in the context of innovation ecosystems . The findings show the need for organizations to tailor knowledge exchange practices to the competitive nature of each relationship . Notable theoretical and practical implications are provided for ecosystem stakeholders that engage in coopetitive partnerships to develop innovations .
