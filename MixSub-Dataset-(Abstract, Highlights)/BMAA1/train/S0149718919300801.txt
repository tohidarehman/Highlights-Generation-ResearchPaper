 In the United States lack of proper handwashing is associated with respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses . Interventions to improve handwashing practices have led to an increase in handwashing knowledge and behavior and decreases in gastrointestinal illnesses . Most studies have evaluated their interventions in the context of reported handwashing rates by observation reduction of illnesses as well as reduced absences however none of these studies examined handwashing quality or knowledge as outcome measures . The objective of this paper is to present the results from a handwashing program with a special focus on the evaluation methods .
