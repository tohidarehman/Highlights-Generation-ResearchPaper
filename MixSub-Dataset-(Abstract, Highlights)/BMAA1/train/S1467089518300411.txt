 Despite the usefulness of computer assisted audit tools and techniques in increasing audit productivity and reducing costs their adoption by audit firms is low in developing countries . The aim of this study is to investigate whether organizational and environmental factors can help explain CAATTs adoption in less developed countries such as Malaysia . The research framework was developed based on the Technology Organization Environment framework . The results reveal that for environmental factors the complexity of clients accounting information systems and perceived level of support of professional accounting bodies affect CAATTs adoption . For organizational factors firm size top management commitment and employee IT competency were found to be significant factors . Moreover firm size partially moderates the influence of clients AIS complexity on CAATTs adoption . This paper contributes to existing adoption theory by extending our understanding of the impact of factors unique to CAATTs adoption .
