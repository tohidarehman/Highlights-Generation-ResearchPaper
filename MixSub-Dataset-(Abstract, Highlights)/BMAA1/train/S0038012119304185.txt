 This paper employs Network Data Envelopment Analysis to measure the municipality performance . The NDEA approach allows to have a more comprehensive evaluation of the municipality performance if compared to traditional DEA . The proposed NDEA model aims at shedding new light on the efficiency effectiveness relationship in the provision of social services by municipalities . Municipal efficiency and effectiveness are combined to generate a single performance measure which can be considered as a proxy measure of the value for money of municipality services . A sample including 103 major Italian municipalities is used as a case to implement the proposed model . Findings indicate that there is no trade off between the efficiency and effectiveness components of the overall municipal performance score but rather they appear to be preconditions of each other . Therefore higher level of performance can be achieved without conflicting one against the other . Furthermore only 6 municipalities achieve the highest performance level suggesting that there is still room for improving the performance of a great number of municipalities .
