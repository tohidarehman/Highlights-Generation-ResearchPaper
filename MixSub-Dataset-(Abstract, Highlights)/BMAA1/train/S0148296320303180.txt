 This study examines how paid search advertising affects conversion probability and selling duration on e marketplace platforms as well as how these effects are moderated by two advertiser characteristics transaction experience and organizational type . We develop a model that includes both conversion incidence and selling duration thus accounting for the correlation between the variables . The proposed model is calibrated using data on one million randomly selected used cars traded in an online marketplace . The results reveal that search ads increase conversion probability significantly by a remarkable 65.26 and shorten selling duration by 3.51days on average . The effect on conversion probability is greater for new advertisers than it is for their regular counterparts . By contrast the shortened selling duration is more pronounced for regular advertisers than it is for new advertisers . Finally we discuss the implications of these findings for marketplace sellers and platform companies .
