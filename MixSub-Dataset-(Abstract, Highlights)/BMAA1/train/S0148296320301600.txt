 Small and medium sized enterprises lag behind larger firms when it comes to digitalization . This has negative impacts on firm performance . Despite the economic importance of SMEs little is known about the antecedents consequences and challenges of SME digitalization . We have set three objectives to address this knowledge gap . Drawing on the resource based view we first investigate the impact of three main SME resources on digitalization information technology employee skills and digital strategy . Second we assess the impact digitalization has on financial performance . We then investigate whether digitalization mediates the effect of resources on performance . The results of a survey of 193 SMEs demonstrate how digitalization can impact SME performance with the three resources positively relating to digitalization . And in turn digitalization significantly relates to performance mediating the effect of information technology on performance . It however does not mediate the effect of digital strategy or employee skills on performance .
