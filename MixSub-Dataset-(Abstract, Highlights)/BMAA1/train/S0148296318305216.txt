 In this research we demonstrate that negative press about accidents caused by users can counterintuitively improve brand evaluations . In two studies we find an interaction between the brand diagnosticity of the user accident and the degree to which consumers identify with the brand . Following negative press about a user accident low brand identifiers decrease their brand liking and high brand identifiers increase their brand liking but only when the accident is brand diagnostic .

@highlight The paper studies consumer responses to usergenerated accidents involving brands.
@highlight The accident s brand diagnosticity interacts with the consumer s brand identification.
@highlight For low brand identifiers diagnostic user accidents decrease brand evaluations.
@highlight For high brand identifiers diagnostic user accidents increase brand evaluations.
@highlight The results highlight the importance of consumer identity and defensive responses.
