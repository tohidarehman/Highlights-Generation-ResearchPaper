 Funders are increasingly making strategic investments across multiple grantees aiming for their portfolio to improve targeted outcomes in a specific issue area . To this end funders might use multi site evaluation approaches to examine the impact of their collective investments . However it is important to recognize that each programand its own program evaluationmust be tailored to its setting population and local context to best meet the needs of its target population . Therefore multi site evaluations need to account for this complexity . This paper describes the S Texas project a large initiative of eight grantees implementing different integrated behavioral health models to improve physical and mental health outcomes along the Texas Mexico border . With over 4 200 MSE study participants the evaluation for S Texas used a partnership centered approach to both enhance the evidence base and build local organizational capacity . This paper describes this approach the process of tailoring evaluation practices to the grantees context and the challenge of balancing consistency at the grantee level for the portfolio multi site evaluation . Successes challenges and lessons learned related to study design data collection grantee partnership and capacity building are discussed .

@highlight Evaluators need to consider what methods are feasible and appropriate at program sites and the importance of tailoring approaches to the specific programs context and populations.
@highlight A common set of metrics across programs is critical for a successful portfolio level multi site evaluation.
@highlight Setting clear expectations of the roles between funder evaluator and grantee facilitates decision making processes.
@highlight Building the evaluation capacity of grantees can improve study rigor provide a sense of ownership and support the application of findings for future efforts and sustainability.
