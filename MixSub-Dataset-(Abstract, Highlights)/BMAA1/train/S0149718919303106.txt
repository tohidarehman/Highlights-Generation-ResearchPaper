 In the framework of 2030 Agenda sustainable agriculture plays a central role . In the field of international aid the participatory approaches to assessment research management and budgeting have been widely studied and applied in the last decades mostly because international aid initiatives in all their relevant phases from planning through implementation monitoring and evaluation are faced with the problem of identifying initiatives that could be successfully and sustainably implemented . The present paper investigates the use of a modified form of analytic hierarchy process namely the participatory analytic hierarchy process as a tool for choice criteria elicitation and resource allocation in the framework of an operational planning for agricultural development projects in the Dioceses of Goma Nord Kivu Democratic Republic of Congo . During our research we were able to make use of most frequent inconsistencies in pairwise comparison matrixes in order to stimulate the debate to adjust local preferences and to build consensus across the group . From an operational point of view the PAHP methodology was also suited for training the project team and for identifying a shared resource allocation pattern which matches the existing international guidelines for agricultural development in the region .

@highlight Inconsistent pairwise comparisons in PAHP can be used to foster participation.
@highlight AHP is a sound methodology for structuring participation in decision making.
@highlight Development practitioners holistic judgement skill can be trained with PAHP.
@highlight Participatory and structured need assessment matches international guidelines for agricultural development.
