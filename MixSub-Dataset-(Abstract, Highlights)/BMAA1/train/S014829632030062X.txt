 In this paper by using a large sample of foreign subsidiaries in Spain we examine what explains their divestment via sell offs . By integrating resource based theory with foreign divestment literature we examine the role that different subsidiary level resources and innovative capabilities play on its likelihood of being divested . We also argue and empirically show that the most influential subsidiary characteristics that determine divestment differ depending on whether the acquiring firm is a host country firm or a foreign firm . Our results suggest that foreign subsidiaries are less likely to be sold off when they are characterized by high levels of product innovation performance human capital or have introduced organizational innovations . Moreover subsidiaries with export market oriented capabilities were more likely to be divested to other foreign buyers whereas subsidiaries with domestic market oriented capabilities were more likely to be divested to domestic buyers .
