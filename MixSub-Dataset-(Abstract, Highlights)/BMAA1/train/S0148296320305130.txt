 Successful market shaping that leads to the creation transformation or maintenance of markets has primarily been conceptualized as resulting from the future oriented intentions of single market actors . Scholars have paid less attention to other forms of intentions or combination of actors despite their potential to also contribute to market shaping . Therefore this conceptual study draws on the philosophy of action and institutional theory to construct a broader definition of market shaping and advance extant knowledge . The proposed framework of intentionality in market shaping features two main dimensions temporality and membership . It thus reveals four theoretically distinct forms of intention in market shaping

@highlight Intentionality in market shaping consists of two dimensions temporal and membership.
@highlight Temporal consists of present future oriented dimensions.
@highlight Membership consists of individual shared oriented dimensions.
@highlight Intentions are dynamic and different forms may concurrently inform market shaping.
@highlight A broader definition of market shaping foregrounds the role of intentions.
