 Women need to receive accurate information on the proper use of contraceptive methods . The objective of our analysis was to evaluate the quality of CM counseling in health institutions of the public sector using the Lot Quality Assurance Sampling technique . We specifically analyzed whether health service providers informed CM users of all the side effects they might experience as specified under the Mexican health care regulations . Our results demonstrated that among the four CM analyzed the intrauterine device hormonal injection condom and subdermal implant only the users of the subdermal implant received complete information on side effects . Our findings thus indicate that the quality of family planning services in the institutions analyzed is deficient . We recommend that service providers be regularly trained in order to improve their performance and that LQAS methodology be adopted as an effective means of regularly monitoring the quality of health services in Mexico .

@highlight LQAS methodology was proved effective for analyzing family planning counseling.
@highlight Inadequate counseling was observed in the most used contraceptive methods.
@highlight Of all methods analyzed only the subdermic implant showed an adequate counseling.
