 This paper discusses what was learned about evaluation capacity building with community organizations who deliver services to individuals with neurological disorders . Evaluation specialists engaged by the Ontario Brain Institute Evaluation Support Program were paired with community organizations such as Dancing With Parkinsons . Some of the learning included relationship building is key for this model of capacity building community organizations often have had negative experiences with evaluation and the idea that evaluations can be friendly tools in implementing meaningful programs is one key mechanism by which such an initiative can work community organizations often need evaluation most to be able to demonstrate their value a strength of this initiative was that the focus was not just on creating products but mostly on developing a learning process in which capacities would remain evaluation tools and skills that organizations found useful were developing a theory of change and the concept of heterogeneous mechanisms .

@highlight Organizations often have had negative experiences with evaluation.The idea that evaluations can be friendly tools in implementing meaningful programs is a key mechanism for evaluation capacity building to work.

@highlight What program staff found useful was developing a theory of change reflecting on heterogeneous mechanisms and multiple pathways to impacts.
@highlight Community organizations often need evaluations to demonstrate their value but impact evaluations require more rigor expertise and time than what is usually afforded in ECB efforts.
