 Fellowship programs offer career development opportunities provide experiential training and can be used to recruit personnel to address specific challenges facing the public health workforce . Given the potential influence fellowships have on the future public health workforce it is important to understand and articulate the results of such programs and to identify areas of improvement to meet current workforce needs . The purpose of this literature review was to identify common practices used to evaluate nonclinical fellowship programs . After a search of the internet and selected databases we screened titles and abstracts using predetermined selection criteria . We then conducted a detailed review of selected papers to extract information about program characteristics and evaluation characteristics from 33 papers . We found a limited number of published papers on the evaluation of nonclinical fellowship programs and most focused on outcomes associated with fellows or alumni . The most useful papers for our purposes clearly described the evaluation framework that guided the evaluation .
