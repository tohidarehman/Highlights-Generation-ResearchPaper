 This paper has analyzed cost efficiency and its determinants in Middle Eastern and Northern African countries during the 20052012 period . Our results have shown that cost efficiency is positively related with economic performance but the level of concentration and market share has a negative influence on the former thus supporting the Quiet Life Hypothesis . We have also found support for the competition inefficiency hypothesis which may be explained by lower loyalty between customers and banks . At the individual level size shows the importance of economies of scale and the level of capital also produces a positive effect . The effects on market structure are more important in the crisis period than before it . Turning to country level variables inflation and GDP are positively related to total cost function . Therefore banking policies should promote profitability capitalization and growth while at the same time controlling excessive concentration and competition .

@highlight Market structure is a main determinant of efficiency in Mena countries.
@highlight The level of market concentration and market share negatively affect the efficiency.
@highlight The banks are more focused on efficiency in the crisis period.
@highlight Policy makers should adopt policies to increase the size but controlling the level of concentration and competition.
