 Museums are important cultural institutions having the mission of conserving interpreting researching and displaying heritage . The evaluation of their efficiency has been extensively investigated in the literature using different approaches and methods . In this paper we employ a generalised conditional efficiency model to assess the true efficiency of Italian museums i.e . the efficiency in the provision of museums service potential consistently dealing with the impact of the socio demographic and institutional environment in which museums operate . Results show that the operational environment matters . In particular conditional estimates suggest that higher income levels and larger hospitality sectors positively influence museums efficiency . Ownership matters museums service potential is higher for private institutions while among public institutions efficiency is generally lower for state owned museums .

@highlight Generalised conditional efficiency model measures the technical efficiency of museums.
@highlight We focus on outputs under the direct control of museums managers the so called service potential.
@highlight We use a generalised conditional efficiency model to assess the efficiency of a large sample of Italian museums.
@highlight Results show that both institutional features and operational environment matter for assessment museums service potential.
