 This paper reviews process evaluations associated with multilevel suicide prevention research trials . Process evaluations can provide important information about how multilevel suicide prevention models are implemented their mechanisms of impact and the context and elements of implementation that mediate effectiveness . Out of 42 papers identified only four met selection criteria for including a process evaluation . Of these four there was large variation in the level of detail provided and only two studies specifically focused on the process of implementing a multilevelsuicide prevention model . Future trials should include targeted process evaluation which can benefit a range of knowledge users .

@highlight Process evaluations of multilevel suicide prevention trials were extremely limited.
@highlight Reporting on evaluation of process in reviewed papers varied greatly.
@highlight Evaluation of process offered unique insights into multilevel model mechanisms.

@highlight This paper reviews process evaluations associated with multilevel suicide prevention research trials. Process evaluations can provide important information about how multilevel suicide prevention models are implemented their mechanisms of impact and the context and elements of implementation that mediate effectiveness. Out of 42 papers identified only four met selection criteria for including a process evaluation. Of these four there was large variation in the level of detail provided and only two studies specifically focused on the process of implementing a multilevelsuicide prevention model. Future trials should include targeted process evaluation which can benefit a range of knowledge users.
@highlight Keywords Process evaluation suicide prevention multilevel trials systems approach complex interventions
