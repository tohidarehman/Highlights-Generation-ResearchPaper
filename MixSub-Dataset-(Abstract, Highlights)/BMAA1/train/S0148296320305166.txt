 Charitable campaigns sometimes display information about others participation to influence the behavior of prospective donors . This research shows that the effect of others participation on charitable behavior is moderated by recipient resource scarcity i.e . the extent to which campaign recipients are perceived to lack financial and material resources . Results indicate that others participation has a positive effect on charitable behavior when recipient resource scarcity is high but a negative effect on charitable behavior when recipient resource scarcity is low . Results also provide evidence for an underlying psychological mechanism based on activation of agencycommunion motives in prospective donors . This research contributes to the literature by identifying recipient resource scarcity as a moderator and activation of agencycommunion motives as a mechanism underlying the effect of others participation on charitable behavior .

@highlight Others participation increases donations when recipient resource scarcity is high.
@highlight Others participation decreases donations when recipient resource scarcity is low.
