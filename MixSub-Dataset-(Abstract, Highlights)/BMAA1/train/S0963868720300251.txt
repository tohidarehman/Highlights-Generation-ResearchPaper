 Uncertainty and the pursuit of new ventures are intricately linked . Digital technologies open up new ways for uncertainty handling in the pursuit of novelty . In this paper we develop a process model that traces the dynamics among uncertainty digitally enabled tactics and organizational novelty . The model points to the potential of technologies that are evocative disposable and responsive for venturing in complex uncertainty ridden contexts . Our research builds on extant conceptualizations of complexity in innovation journeys in conjunction with perspectives on effectual entrepreneurial tactics . Empirically we investigate uncertainty handling through a longitudinal case study on an in house venture for the introduction of novel electronic services for patients in a major university hospital . Our research provides insight into the processes through which intrapreneurs handle uncertainty by leveraging the potential of digital technologies . The paper offers theoretical implications for the digital intrapreneurship literature .
