 The role of suppliers in firms innovation processes is well established . Yet understanding of the effect of supplier clusters and their characteristics on firms innovation outcomes is lacking . This paper focuses on two important characteristics of supplier clusterssupplier cluster proximity and supplier cluster heterogeneityand examines their impact on the speed to market of innovations and the type of innovations produced . Using a multi country dataset the study shows that supplier proximity improves speed to market of innovations and that greater heterogeneity among supplier clusters decreases the rate of radical innovations of firms . Through a nuanced view of supplier clusters this research contributes to the literature on clusters and innovations by highlighting the role of supplier clusters .

@highlight Supplier proximity improves speed to market of innovations.
@highlight Greater heterogeneity among supplier clusters decreases the rate of radical innovations of firms.
@highlight A nuanced view of supplier cluster characteristics provides richer understanding of their effect on innovation outcomes.
