 Drawing from self concept based theory of work motivation the present study sought to investigate the positive effect of perceived overqualification on employee outcomes via work engagement under the boundary conditions of empowering leadership and felt role clarity . We tested our hypotheses with a multi source and multi wave survey using a sample of 351 industrial employees from China . The results revealed a significant three way interaction effect on work engagement . Further work engagement was found to positively mediate the relationship between the above three way interaction effect and the employee outcomes of task performance and proactivity . The findings supported the studys theoretical reasoning that perceived overqualification was positively related to employees behavioral outcomes via work engagement in the workplace under the boundary conditions we examined . The theoretical and practical implications are discussed .
