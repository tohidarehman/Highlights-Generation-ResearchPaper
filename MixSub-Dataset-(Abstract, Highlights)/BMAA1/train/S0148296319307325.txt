 Trust is an essential concern in s commerce . Though existing research has studied the association between trust and purchasing intention the determinants of the formation of trust in s commerce remain largely unexplored . This study examines the determinants of trust in s commerce based on social presence and social support . Unlike most business research we applied a hybrid SEM ANN approach that can detect non linear and non compensatory relationships . Linear and compensatory models assume that a shortfall in one factor may be compensated by other factors . However consumer decision making processes are complicated and non compensatory and linear models tend to oversimplify these processes . Criterion sampling was used to gather 462 datasets of social commerce users using a mall intercept technique . Information support has the strongest effect followed by the social presence of interaction with the sellers income and social presence of others . The integrated model predicts 76.9 trust in s commerce . Theoretical and managerial contributions are discussed .
