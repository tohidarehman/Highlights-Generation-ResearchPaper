 To adapt to changing technological and market conditions firms perform open innovation activities . However not all firms manage to increase their adaptiveness through OI . Depending on the level of partner alignment different types of OI activities may thrive or fail . Drawing on social network theory this study investigates how firms should arrange partner alignment to realize the full potential of highly and weakly interactive OI activities and foster firms technology and market adaptiveness and ultimately innovation success . Using empirical tests on a multi industry data set gathered from 181 managers the results show that firms that perform highly interactive OI activities should strive for high partner alignment to enhance their technology and market adaptiveness . In contrast firms employing weakly interactive OI activities should avoid high partner alignment as such alignment lowers the positive impact of these OI activities on both technological and market adaptiveness and in turn decreases innovation success .

@highlight OI can enhance adaptiveness and innovation success depending on partner alignment.
@highlight High partner alignment is only beneficial in highly interactive OI activities.
@highlight Partner alignment in weakly interactive OI activities should be avoided.
@highlight Technology adaptiveness does not increase innovation success in the market.
@highlight Tensions in prior literature regarding partner alignment and OI effectiveness are resolved.
