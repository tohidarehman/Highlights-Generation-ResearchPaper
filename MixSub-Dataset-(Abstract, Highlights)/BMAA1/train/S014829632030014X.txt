 This article conceptualizes the diffusion of user innovations from a service ecosystem perspective . With the focus on sustainable innovations the service ecosystem is evaluated along with other systemic innovation concepts as a possible theoretical basis for explaining the first adoption and diffusion of user innovations . It is proposed that an ecosystem perspective contributes three assumptions that help to better understand the diffusion of sustainability oriented user innovations innovation diffusion is a multi level and actor phenomenon an actor to actor orientation integrates user innovators into the ecosystem the service perspective defines innovation diffusion as an evolving co created process . The assumptions are translated into policy implications and future research requirements for moving towards an innovation infrastructure that considers the role and contribution of users in sustainable innovation .

@highlight The service ecosystem helps to explain the non diffusion of user innovations.
@highlight Addressing sustainability challenges requires an innovation infrastructure inclusive of users.
@highlight User innovation diffusion relies on a multi actor contribution.
