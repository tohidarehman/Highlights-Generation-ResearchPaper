 Currently retail facilities play a significant role both economically and socially for their contributions to job creation and to reducing unemployment . In this paper economic environmental and social issues including unemployment job creation for the local workforce within their hometown the immigration of an unemployed workforce and the naturalization of non natives are addressed for a retailer . We explore the class of deteriorating products from the viewpoint of its economic and environmental features . Then a linear multi objective mathematical model is developed to determine an integrated replenishment and recruitment policy for the retailer in the direction of sustainability . Using data from the flower industry a numerical analysis is presented . The results indicate that if necessary facilities and infrastructures are provided to permanently settle qualified immigrants both social and economic indicators will be improved . We also determine that by concentrating on strategies such as job creation for natives through retail facilities with no increase in production capacity and by applying careful policies for immigration and naturalization social welfare can be improved .
