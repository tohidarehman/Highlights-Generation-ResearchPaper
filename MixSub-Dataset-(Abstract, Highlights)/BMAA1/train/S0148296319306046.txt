 In this paper we investigate the impact of psychological reactance produced by normative appeals on the intention to behave sustainably . Across four studies we demonstrate that freedom threat is an antecedent of psychological reactance to a pro environmental normative appeal . We further show that the impact of pro environmental normative appeals on behavioral intentions is serially mediated through freedom threat and counterarguing . Descriptive normative appeals produce lower psychological reactance which subsequently leads to higher behavioral intentions . Finally we provide evidence that the above relationships depend on self construal with descriptive normative appeals provoking lower psychological reactance than injunctive normative appeals only when the interdependent self is activated . We discuss implications for theory and practice .

@highlight Pro environmental normative appeals impact behavioral intentions.
@highlight This impact is serially mediated through freedom threat and counterarguing.
