 In 2015 Dancing With Parkinson s a Toronto based community organization participated in the Ontario Brain Institute s newly launched Evaluation Support Program . This paper reflects on that experience . In particular we identify the key lessons derived from the OBI initiative discuss how these lessons have informed DWP practice going forward and highlight what we consider to be the most valuable aspects of the Evaluation Support Program . While we now recognize the need to establish an evaluation culture within DWP we find that there are significant challenges associated with both building and sustaining evaluation capacity in the context of a small community based organization . Whereas DWP has built considerable strengths in terms of informal evaluation capacity on its own such capacity is insufficient to for example demonstrate DWP s impact to outside audiences or successfully scale up the program .
