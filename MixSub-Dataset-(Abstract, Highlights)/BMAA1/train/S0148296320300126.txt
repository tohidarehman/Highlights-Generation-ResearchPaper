The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor and GLOBE project were used as data sources . Cultural values regional affiliation and economic development levels were used to cluster the selected countries . Correlations between values and operating SEA were checked for the entire sample as well as for each of the three clusters . A positive correlation between Gender Egalitarianism and narrowly defined operating SEA and negative correlation between Uncertainty Avoidance and the aforementioned SEA was confirmed for all the countries while the linkage between Future Orientation In group Collectivism and operating SEA was partially verified . Research results suggest that culture is not sufficient to justify national differences in SE rates .
