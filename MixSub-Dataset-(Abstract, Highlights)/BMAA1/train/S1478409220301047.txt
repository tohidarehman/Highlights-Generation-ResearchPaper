 This paper investigates how companies can manage tensions between exploitative and exploratory innovation by developing an ambidextrous purchasing function . We identify four types of ambidexterity and discuss how these can be combined to complement each other . We present an in depth case study of a large firm which has implemented an ambidextrous purchasing function to contribute simultaneously to exploitative and exploratory innovation . We observe how the four types of ambidexterity were manifested and applied to balance purchasing s contribution to both exploratory and exploitative innovations . The case study shows how the different types of ambidexterity can be combined to mitigate tensions . Based on our case study findings we identify a two stage process of developing purchasing ambidexterity combining the four types of ambidexterity over time . Our findings enrich the understanding of how companies can develop an ambidextrous purchasing function to facilitate purchasing s contribution to exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation .

@highlight Purchasing ambidexterity is a concept investigating how purchasing can balance explorative and exploitative activities in innovation.
@highlight Purchasing ambidexterity is a combination of 4 types of ambidexterity structural sequential contextual and managerial .
@highlight Contextual and managerial ambidexterity support structural and sequential ambidexterity.
@highlight Our case has implemented structural and sequential ambidexterity prior to implement contextual and managerial ambidexterity.
@highlight A combined purchasing ambidexterity reduces tensions occurring within and across the four types of ambidexterity..
