 This paper investigates how Information Technology leveraging capability supports buyer supplier collaboration in New Product Development . IT leveraging capability is defined as the ability to effectively use IT functionalities to support IT enabled NPD activities . We consider three dimensions of this capability effective use of Project and Resource Management Systems effective use of Knowledge Management Systems and effective use of Cooperative Work Systems . We consider the dynamics between these three dimensions which have usually been treated as equal . Using an in depth case study approach we show that effective use of KMS and CWS are key dimensions to support collaboration creating a unique source of competitive advantage . On the other hand while effective use of PRMS does not help to create differentiation it is important to support the coordination of KMS and CWS . Furthermore the three dimensions have different intensities of contribution depending on the NPD stage and supplier involvement configuration .

@highlight We study 3 IT leveraging capability dimensions KM CW and PRM in collaborative NPD.
@highlight Co development is addressed by deploying it into NPD stages and collaboration types.
@highlight We show the dynamics of KM CW and PRM among them and on the NPD stages.
@highlight IT capability dimensions play different roles depending of the collaboration type.
