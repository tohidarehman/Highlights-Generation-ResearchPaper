 The emergence of a paid knowledge market provides knowledge contributors a way to get economic repay from their sharing but little is known about the determinants of sales of those paid knowledge content . To study this we identify three user generated signals the rating of content product followers of content producer and upvotes content producer gains which may influence consumers content quality perceptions and purchase decisions . Drawing on a panel data set of 6380 online live courses we propose a new perspective of signaling effect by distinguishing the influence of the flow and stock of signals . Hypotheses are tested using fixed effect regression and panel vector autoregression methodology . The result suggests a positive impact of ratings and followers on sales a negative impact of upvotes on sales and reveals the dynamic interactivity between the flow of signals and sales . These findings offer insights into signaling theory and knowledge product transactions .
