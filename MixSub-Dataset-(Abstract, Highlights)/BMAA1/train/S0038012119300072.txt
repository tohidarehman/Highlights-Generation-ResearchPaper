 Based on primary data of 453 drinkers in Thailand this study investigates the impact of pre commitment on alcohol consumption . It exploits the quasi experimental nature of a social marketing campaign in Thailand implemented in 2014 where all drinkers were able to publicly pledge temporary alcohol abstention and some but not all drinkers were provided with community based health promotion interventions conducted by local residents . This study argues that the campaign had a pre commitment device implicitly integrated into it failures to follow through with the commitment were associated with mental costs of social embarrassment and weaker relationships with one s local social networks . Using a joint estimation method where the decision to pre commit is explicitly endogenized this study suggests that pre commitment is effective in increasing the probabilities of temporary alcohol abstention and reduction .
