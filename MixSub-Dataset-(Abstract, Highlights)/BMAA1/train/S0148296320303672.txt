 Local employees have different perceptions of the career opportunities they can derive from firms internationalization when compared to the senior managers who manage this process . We argue that perceptions of internationalization related career advancement opportunities represent a perceived fit between employees and organizations . We examine this fit within a sample of 845 local employees from eleven Latin American countries . Our findings suggest that the degree of firm internationalization is negatively related to local employees anticipated career advancement opportunities . This relationship is positively moderated by perceived firm international competitiveness but not by the extent to which the employee has a global mindset . These results suggest that local employees may feel threatened by their firms internationalization as they perceive they may systematically be exposed to outside competition . This threat is attenuated by their firms capabilities but not by individual characteristics such as an employee s global mindset suggesting that firm characteristics are more influential in predicting local employees reactions to internationalization .
