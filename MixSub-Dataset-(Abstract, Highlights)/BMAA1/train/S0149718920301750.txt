 The prevalence of obesity remains high among school age children and continues to rise among adolescents in the United States . One strategy to address this challenge is to use peer rather than professional leaders to run weight management programs . Youth peer led lifestyle interventions have become increasingly common over the last few decades but there is a lack of review and synthesis of these programs . The purpose of this manuscript was to critically review and synthesize results and lessons learned from evaluated youth peer led lifestyle modification and weight management programs . We searched the PubMed MEDLINE database to identify articles published between March 2002 and December 2015 . We identified 29 interventions including children from kindergarten to 12th grade from different settings and racial ethnic and economic backgrounds . We first summarized descriptive information about the interventions and then compared outcomes based on intervention type peer leader characteristics and training and other related factors . Our review indicated that youth peer led interventions of varying structure and content can result in positive changes in behavioral influences diet physical activity body measures and other clinical outcomes . We used information from our analysis to formulate recommendations for design of future youth peer led lifestyle interventions .
