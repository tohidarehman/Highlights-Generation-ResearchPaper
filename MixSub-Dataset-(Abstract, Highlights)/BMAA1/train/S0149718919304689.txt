 Program evaluation is an important aspect of any organization . The ability to reflect on past performance and plan for the future is essential to an organizations health and future growth . This exploratory study is part of a larger program evaluation initiative that examined the efficacy of a regionally based organization that provided funding to community groups to alleviate poverty . The purpose of the study was to explore testimonials provided by participants of the organizations funded programs to determine if the participants were satisfied with the programs and the extent to which participants perceptions are congruent with the goals of the organization . Content analysis was used to examine 3494 testimonials from 77 different agencies . Three overall themes were determined from the analysis 1 Developing Social Networks 2 Learning Comes in Various Forms and 3 Developing Self Efficacy . Findings from the testimonials suggest that the benefits of the programs are highly social and that connections with others are important but also provide rich opportunities for learning new skills and knowledge as well as gaining confidence and a sense of control . The findings from this analysis support one goal of the organization which is to engage people living in poverty in meaningful ways .
