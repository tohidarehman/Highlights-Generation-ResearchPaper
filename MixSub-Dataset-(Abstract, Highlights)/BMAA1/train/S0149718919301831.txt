 Despite widespread availability of yoga in the Veterans Health Administration it remains unclear how to best evaluate yoga programs . This is particularly problematic for programs aimed at veterans with mental health concerns as evaluation typically focuses narrowly upon mental health symptom severity even though program participants may have other health related priorities . We analyzed responses to free text questions on 237 surveys completed by veterans with mental health concerns enrolled in a yoga program at six VA clinics in Louisiana to characterize veteran participants experiences with yoga . Qualitative analysis resulted in 15 domains reflecting veterans individual health related values and priorities . We use results to illustrate the potential for analysis of free text responses to reveal valuable insights into patient experiences demonstrating how these data can inform patient centered program evaluation . The approach we present is more accessible to those responsible for decision making about local programs than conventional methods of analyzing qualitive evaluation data .
