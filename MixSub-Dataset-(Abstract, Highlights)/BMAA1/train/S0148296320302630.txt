 Corporate political activity is an important area of research due to the high level of CPA in which many firms engage . Prior research has focused on the demand side of the political market . In this paper we consider how choices made by CEOs regarding their interaction with the supply side of the political market can have performance implications for the firm . In particular we argue that where CPA focuses less on supporting extreme ideologies these investments in CPA will be positively associated with higher performance and thus are more effective . Next relying on agency theory we argue that firms in which top managers are less likely to behave opportunistically will engage in such effective CPA . We test our theory on a panel of archival data generated by combining business data with political records and we find strong support for our arguments .
