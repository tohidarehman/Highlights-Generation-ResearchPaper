 In this study we examine an important predictor and outcome associated with well being for entrepreneurs access to resources and persistence . Drawing on social cognitive theory we contend that access to resources helps people feel confidence in abilities to be successful entrepreneurs resulting in greater well being during venture development . We push the model further by hypothesizing that well being is positively related to persistence in venture creation activities . Employing an experimental vignette based approach we test the model by asking 258 subjects to consider how prospective entrepreneurs respond to varying contexts of resource accessibility in terms of their self efficacy well being and persistence . Results of serial mediator regression analysis support the hypothesized model such that greater access to resources is associated with higher levels of multiple indicators of well being such as happiness life satisfaction and psychological well being through a self efficacy mechanism . We also find that entrepreneurial persistence increases through this mechanism .
