 The purpose of this paper is to introduce fuzzy sets Qualitative Comparative Analysis as the appropriate method in order to explore the causal configurations of capabilities related to future Multiple Project Management software which is expected to be used by eco label industry project managers as a testing tool in their forthcoming work . Results show that eight different configurations of MPM software capabilities affect the outcome encouraging the eco label industry actors interest of testing and using its features . We have also identified a necessary condition for the intention of testing and using the multiple project management software represented by a combination of high capability in the provision of a shared resource pool to all project managers high ability of leveling over allocated resources identified within projects and low capability of performing comparisons of target and real values for the assessment criteria of performance costs and time added to high capability of monitoring activities progress according to milestone deadlines .

@highlight Aim is to understand MPM software design suited to decision makers concerns in a multiple project environment.
@highlight Core elements for agile MPM software rapid change in project planning and active customer involvement.
@highlight Eco innovation methodologies and tools are being applied in companies to an increasing extent.
@highlight Multiple project management currently is a reality in software development environments.
