 Urban parks are often designed and renewed using standardized models that fail to incorporate the different functions and services required by the local communities served . Furthermore when the citizens are involved in co design the participation processes are seldom fully inclusive and the results are not representative of the entire local community . The paper starts from these considerations for developing an innovative participatory design method to renew urban parks . This method simultaneously uses multiple and alternative participation tools for adapting to the different technical skills of the citizens and to their inclinations . Furthermore it entails the analysis and interpretation of the expectations of the local community in light of the urban green network . The method uses the conceptual framework of the SWOT analysis and the Trochim s concept mapping for developing a card game playable face to face or online . The results of the card game are processed using the statistical analysis to identify the main design themes and to split the participants suggestions into different design alternatives . Successively the participants vote these alternatives for selecting the renewal design respondent to the local community s needs .
