 Several currencies have over time exhibited persistent deviations from covered interest rate parity resulting in non zero cross currency basis swap spreads . The links between these deviations and macroeconomic variables such as those in a standard monetary model however have attracted less interest . In this paper we initiate attempts to address this gap . First we present a simple model where we allow for deviations from CIP in a standard monetary framework . With this model we argue for the existence of levels relationships between cross currency basis swap spreads and the macroeconomic variables . In the empirical part we employ long panel techniques and show that tighter cross currency swap spreads are related to a rise in relative money supply for both European and non European currencies and to higher relative real output for non European currencies . We also perform error correction analysis which reveals that the mechanism governing the adjustment to equilibrium is not the same for European and non European currencies . However we show that a common theme between both groups is that when there is a move away from equilibrium it is the cross currency basis swap spreads that adjust to ensure a return to equilibrium .

@highlight Links between macroeconomic variables and covered interest parity deviations basis are examined.
@highlight Fewer deviations go with higher relative output for non European currencies.
@highlight Fewer deviations also go with higher relative money supply for both European and non European currencies.
@highlight Adjustment mechanism is different however the basis is the most adjusting variable across maturities and subpanels.
