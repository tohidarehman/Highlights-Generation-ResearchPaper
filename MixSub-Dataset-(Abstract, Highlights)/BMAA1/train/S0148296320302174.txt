 Strategic management researchers have long been fascinated with company performance in terms of underlying managerial cognition and its interpretation . This paper presents a methodology to examine the linkage between the cognition of individuals and company performance . We link cognitive maps with fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis and examined the role of standard and newly proposed consistency and coverage formulas in the evaluation of social science data . We investigate the effect of cognitive diversity within a company and between companies within an industry on company performance using experimental and real life data . The proposed method used a cognitive mapping approach to elicit strategy frames from individuals in management teams and operationalized their cognitive diversity by distance ratios between individual and group level cognitive maps . The results highlight the different opportunities of cognitive diversity to the enhancement of company performance in the market and confirm the usefulness of new fsQCA consistency and coverage measures .
