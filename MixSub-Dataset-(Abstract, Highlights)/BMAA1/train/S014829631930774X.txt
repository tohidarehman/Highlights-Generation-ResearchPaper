 A sharing based product service system is an economic arrangement that mutualizes access to products and product functions . This conceptual paper contributes towards deepening the theory on the value creation process in PSS by outlining six propositions which integrate and extend previous assumptions but were so far discussed unconnectedly in different streams of the literature . Proposition 1 claims that PSS can not deliver value in use it can only offer value in use propositions . Propositions 2 and 3 discuss the relevance of secured and easy access which are necessary conditions to translate value in use propositions into individualized value in use . Propositions 4 and 5 specify different tangible values and intangible values . Proposition 6 stresses that the community of customers cocreates value in use . These propositions highlight that managers can not fully control the process of their value in use propositions being transferred to value in use .
