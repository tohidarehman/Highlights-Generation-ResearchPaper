 This study measures the concentration of information and communication technology infrastructure and expenditure inequality in the disaggregated spatial unit of various locations in Australia . Using survey data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia a composite concentration index for ICT infrastructure is constructed for urban and rural households . In addition the Gini coefficient of ICT expenditure is computed to measure the concentration of affordability of ICT services . Findings demonstrate that the concentrations of ICT infrastructure and affosrdability are profound in the Greater Sydney and Greater Melbourne areas . Nevertheless results indicate that the remoteness of spatial units has a noteworthy impact on the concentration of ICT infrastructure . In addition canonical correlation analysis reveals that the association between the concentration of ICT infrastructure and inequality in the affordability of ICT services is statistically significant . These findings imply that policy makers should employ a holistic approach that will not only include technological and economic considerations but also examine place based context in designing an all inclusive ICT policy .

@highlight This study measures the concentration of ICT infrastructure and expenditure inequality in Australia using disaggregated spatial location units.
@highlight ICT infrastructure is highly concentrated in the largest economic hubs of Australia namely urban centres in Sydney and Melbourne.
@highlight The remoteness of spatial units has a noteworthy impact on the concentration of ICT infrastructure.
@highlight The association between the concentration of ICT infrastructure and inequality in affordability of ICT services are statistically significant.
@highlight Policy makers should employ a holistic approach that will not only include macroeconomic considerations but also examine place based context in designing an all inclusive ICT policy.
