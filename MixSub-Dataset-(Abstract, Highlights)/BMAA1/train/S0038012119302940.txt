 The goal of public enterprises is to increase the wealth and happiness of individuals . This target lets them make the investment to fulfill these expectations . However not all citizens in a country might have the same opportunities . This case requires comparing citizens who live in cities with regard to satisfaction levels . This study consists of two stages . In the first stage a composite index called the General Satisfaction Index which aims to explain the satisfaction levels of citizens living in cities is obtained by using the Benefit of the Doubt method . Contrary to the previous studies the satisfaction indicators based on the emotions and senses of citizens are used to construct a composite index . Satisfaction indicators contribution to GSI is ensured using the minimum weights . In the second stage of this study socioeconomic determinants of GSI are investigated in both countrywide and regions by using regularized regression methods . In the result of the regression analyze it is confirmed that there are different socioeconomic determinants of satisfaction levels for countrywide and each region . For this reason it is proposed that policymakers should follow different politicizes in each region to increase the satisfaction levels of citizens in the country .

@highlight A composite index explaining the satisfaction should construct by basing the senses and emotions of people.
@highlight The socioeconomic indicators are the determinant of satisfaction.
@highlight Regularized regression methods should be preferred when the dataset consists of variables highly correlated.
@highlight The determinants of satisfaction are different between regions in the same country.
