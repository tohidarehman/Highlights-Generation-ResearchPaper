 This study tests a structural model of self motivational antecedents and outcomes over the course of social entrepreneurship using data on 158 social entrepreneurs . The model antecedents stem from two categories of perceived variables self referent efficacy and perceived situational fit which can result in pathways toward three outcomes entrepreneurial goal striving aspiration and eudaimonic well being . Among the five tested antecedents experience mastery social assertiveness and autonomy have strong relationships with aspiration and eudaimonic well being . Effectual reward has significant but the least effects on entrepreneurial goal striving . Pro sociality measurements exhibit strong communality and cross variability among the other antecedents . The results show that pro sociality can not be determined as a discernible source of entrepreneurial motivation but has an antithetical role in volitional intention . This study sheds light on self motivational constructs that ultimately shape social entrepreneurs intention and orientation .
