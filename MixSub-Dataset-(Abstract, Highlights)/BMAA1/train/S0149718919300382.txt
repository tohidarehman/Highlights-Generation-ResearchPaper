 Addressing the lack of physical activity in rural adults is vital because of the role it plays in the risk for many chronic diseases . The purpose of the study was to explore the feasibility of conducting a 12 week intervention utilizing a Fitbit to increase PA behavior in inactive rural adults recruited from a primary care clinic . Semi structured interviews were conducted with study participants and a focus group was held with nurses from the primary care clinic . Data were analyzed using the process of immersion crystallization . Participants and nurses both felt the program had a positive impact on PA and that the program was needed in the community . Study participants most often reported their favorite part of the study was being able to track their activity as well as the goal setting . However study participants reported barriers to continued participation in PA related to a lack of time and ability to be active in cold weather . Further nursing staff reported barriers in regard to a lack of resources These barriers need to be examined further and addressed in order to implement a sustainable PA program that can be maintained through a primary care clinic .
