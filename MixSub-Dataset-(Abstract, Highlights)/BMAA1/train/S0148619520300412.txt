 This paper uses administrative panel micro data of Israeli firms between 2006 and 2015 to simulate corporate tax rates at Laffer Curve s peak . We first propose a theoretical model where three effects interact a mechanical effect a dynamic effect related to opening and closing firms and an efficiency effect related to profits . We run regressions for opening and closing firms and for profits as a function of the effective corporate tax rate together with a bunch of additional explanatory variables . Using the coefficients obtained from these regressions we estimate the tax rate at the Laffer Curve s peak between 26 and 38 percent which is within the range shown in the literature based on macro data . Concerning branches we found that food services is characterized by a low tax rate at the peak of the Laffer Curve while manufacturing is characterized by a high one .

@highlight The simulated tax rate at the peak of the Laffer curve is estimated in a range between 26 and 38 percent.
@highlight For food services we obtained a low corporate tax rate at the peak of the Laffer curve 14 percent while for manufacturing we obtained a high one 39 percent .
