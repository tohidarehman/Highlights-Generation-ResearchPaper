 Using a critical power lens and the concept of organisational hypocrisy we explore how actors across the supply chain have been able to pass risk and responsibility for environmental impacts down the supply chain in addition to associated economic costs . We use vignettes to relay farmers experiences and voices which remain seldom heard in both practice and research . We argue that the main effect of the hypocritical practice of passing the environmental buck is a removal of the farmers agency paradoxically coupled with an increase in their responsibilities . We see this approach by large corporations as a mechanism that helps to mask their increasing dependence on this group to achieve their environmental goals .
