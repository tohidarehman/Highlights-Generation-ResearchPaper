 Existing work suggests that consumers are most likely to share negative word of mouth about a dissatisfying experience when they blame the firm . The current work however shows that consumers are sometimes reticent to share such WOM because they believe it could cause them to appear incompetent . This occurs when consumers can generate counterfactuals in which they took some action to avoid the dissatisfying outcome a phenomenon we label retrospective purchase mutability . RPM causes consumers to accept some self blame for dissatisfying outcomes even those they perceive to be firm caused which leads them to believe that sharing information about the outcome could make them appear incompetent . The current work helps explain when firm caused dissatisfying experiences lead to negative WOM and when they may not . Theoretical and practical implications are discussed .

@highlight Consumers can blame themselves for clearly firm caused failures and dissatisfaction.
@highlight This occurs under conditions of high retrospective purchase mutability.
@highlight Self blame for firm caused failures increases concerns about appearing incompetent.
@highlight Self image concerns of appearing incompetent diminishes negative word of mouth.
