 Returning customer rates are a primary determinant of the success of a service thus both the motivations for and hindrances to return visits from customers are extensively investigated . Accordingly this study aims to estimate the probability of customers return visits to airline services using a machine learning approach on the received feedback comments and satisfaction ratings regarding the previous usage of the service . By considering the sentimental features in the comments with seven classifiers the results show an accuracy of 83.42 for predicting the customers return visits . Moreover a higher word count of feedback written by the customers can lead to a higher degree of prediction accuracy . Based on these results both the implications and limitations to customer preferences are presented .
