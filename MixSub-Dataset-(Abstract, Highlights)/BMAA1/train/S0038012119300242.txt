 With growing investments in the state key laboratories of China it is essential to assess the efficiency of the administrative departments regarding managing the SKLs of China . However few studies have been conducted about the evaluation of the performance of Chinese administrative departments in managing SKLs . To fill this gap this paper investigates the performance within 22 SKL administrative departments in China based on a data envelopment analysis cross efficiency prospect aggregation approach incorporating the risk preference of decision maker . The empirical results show the major findings serious imbalance exists regarding the investment of 22 SKL administrative departments there are great differences among the performance of 22 SKL administrative departments some SKL administrative departments face an insufficient situation regarding the outputs different risk attitudes of decision maker have the significant impact on the evaluation results of the 22 SKL administrative departments . Based on these findings we provide several policy suggestions for the development of SKLs in China .

@highlight Cross efficiency aggregation methods generally fail to capture the risk behavior.
@highlight We propose a cross efficiency prospect CP function to reflect the risk attitude.
@highlight This paper establishes a weighting model to derive the optimal aggregated weights.
@highlight A CP aggregation method is developed based on the CP function and weighting model.
@highlight An application of state key laboratories in China is presented using the CP method.
