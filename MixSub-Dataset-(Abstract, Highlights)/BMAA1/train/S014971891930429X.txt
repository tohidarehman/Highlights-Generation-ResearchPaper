 To conduct a system wide assessment using social network analysis to examine how 14 important issues are addressed through education training and programming at a university . Evaluators conducted interviews with campus departments responsible for educating training on the 14 issues . Interviews revealed which programs were offered that addressed the 14 issues and data on audience characteristics date of delivery and which issues were covered in each program were collected . SNA was used to calculate degree and create visualization graphs illustrating patterns of content coverage across all 52 programs . The average degree was 19.38 meaning programs overlapped in topic area with nearly 20 other programs on average . Most programs were attended by audiences of 500 people or less . Diversity and inclusion represented the topic area with the most programs whereas suicide and bullying hazing had the least number of programs . Degree was negatively correlated with attendance numbers indicating the more a program overlapped in content with other programs the smaller the audience . This study supports the use of network analysis in conducting systemic evaluations of programs offered at a university complementing the work of ongoing local level program evaluations .
