 This paper investigates the literary corpus on the role of Artificial Intelligence in the construction of sustainable business models . It provides a quantitative overview of the academic literature that constitutes the field . The paper discusses the relationships between AI and rapid developments in machine learning and sustainable development . Specifically the aim is to understand whether this branch of computer science can influence production and consumption patterns to achieve sustainable resource management according to Sustainable Development Goals outlined in the UN 2030 Agenda . Moreover the paper aims to highlight the role of Knowledge Management Systems in the cultural drift toward the spread of AI for SBMs . Despite the importance of the topic there is no comprehensive review of the AI and SBM literature in light of SDGs . Based on a database containing 73 publications in English with publication dates from 1990 to 2019 a bibliometric analysis is conducted . The findings show that the innovation challenge involves ethical social economic and legal aspects . Thus considering that the development potential of AI is linked to the UN 2030 Agenda for SD especially to SDG 12 our results also outline the framework of the existing literature on AI and SDGs especially SDG 12 including AIs association with the cultural drift in the SBMs . The paper highlights the key contributions which are i a comprehensive review of the key underlying relationship between AI and SBMs offering a holistic view as needed ii identifying a research gap regarding KMS through AI and iii the implications of AI concerning SDG 12 . Academic and managerial implications are also discussed regarding KMS in the SBMs where the AI can represent the vehicle to meet the SDGs allowing for the identification of the cultural change required by enterprises to achieve sustainable goals . Thus business companies academic research practitioners and state policy should focus on the further development of the use of AI in SBMs .
