 Recurrence of child maltreatment is a significant concern causing substantial individual family and societal cost . Variable based approaches to identifying targets for intervention may not reflect the reality that families may experience multiple co occurring risks . An alternative approach was tested using baseline data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well being I and II to develop Latent Class Analysis models of family risk classes using variables derived from prior studies of re reporting . The samples were collected approximately 10 years apart offering a chance to test how the approach might be impacted by demographic or policy shifts . The association between baseline classes and later re reports was tested using both samples . A two class model of high versus low presence of baseline risk resulted that was strongly associated with later likelihood of re report and results were relatively stable across the two studies . Person centered approaches may hold promise in the early identification of families that require a more comprehensive array of supports to prevent re reports of maltreatment .

@highlight Preventing repeat maltreatment reports is a key but elusive goal for child welfare.
@highlight Families reported for maltreatment often have multiple and comorbid needs.
@highlight Latent Class Analyses identified classes with practical differences in recidivism.
@highlight Person level modeling approaches hold promise for identifying high risk families.
