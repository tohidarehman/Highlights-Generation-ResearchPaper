 Information provision is fundamental to improving retirement planning intentions and behavior but little is known about the role of message format or the process underlying message effectiveness . Equally sparse are insights about when financial information messages are more likely to improve retirement planning intentions and which consumers are more prone to act on their stated intentions . This paper answers these questions through a longitudinal study of a sample of 736 U.S. consumers . While message format has only a limited effect on message effectiveness receipt of a message improves consumers intention to plan for retirement . This effect is mediated by the willingness to learn more about retirement planning and retirement self efficacy . Financial information messages are more likely to improve retirement planning intentions when consumers perceived financial security is low and when such messages are congruent with consumers construal level . Finally consumers with more self control display a stronger association between their intentions and actual behavior .
