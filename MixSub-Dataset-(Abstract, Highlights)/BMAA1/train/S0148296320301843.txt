 Value co creation for service innovations involves integrating inputs from multiple actors within service ecosystems . Traditionally value co creation has been considered in light of business to consumer interactions . The emergence of digital information platforms allowing consumer to consumer communications is changing how service ecosystems establish and create value for service innovations . In this paper we develop a Digital Information Flow Continuum that includes B2C external provider and consumer co created and C2C digital communications . Using Service Dominant Logic we assess the impact digital information flow elements have on the perceptions and usage likelihood for telemedicine services . We use structural equation modeling to analyze online survey results from 827 health consumers collected as part of a healthcare organizations TM launch . The results demonstrate that the Digital Information Flow Continuum impacts the acceptance of the TM innovation directly and indirectly through value perceptions of comparable service quality relative to alternatives and ease of access to care .
