 Across various customer experiences Augmented Reality is emerging as a strategic experience design tool . This study contributes to an emerging body of research on the use of AR in the early stages of customers purchase journeys . Extending previous research we propose that AR enables a unique form of customer creativity that is distinct from prior conceptualizations of creativity through its association with customer engagement . Specifically we propose a sequential process of creative customer engagement in which AR enabled customer creativity stems from heightened customer engagement and in turn offers a source of intrinsic satisfaction for customers . In an experiment with a customer facing AR application we empirically demonstrate this sequential mediation process connecting the use of AR with customer engagement customer creativity and anticipated satisfaction . We also identify an important boundary condition based on a customers assessment orientation suggesting a novel behavioral effect in the context of regulatory mode theory .
