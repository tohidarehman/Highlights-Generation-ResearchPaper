 Despite the growing interest in the effect of actor engagement on performance outcomes empirical work adopting a holistic view is scarce . This study aims to empirically assess the impact of engagement behaviors on a shops performance within an e market ecosystem . Specifically the study investigates how actors level of engagement in online reviewing relates to a shops future performance using a rich panel dataset within the Etsy ecosystem . The results indicate that in these environments higher positive engagement behaviors dont affect performance as positive reviews are expected . Engagement behaviors entailing negative reviewing also have a non significant effect on performance as they offer important feedback to the shop which offsets damaging effects . However when the volume of either low positive engagement or disengagement behaviors increases performance deteriorates as these behaviors signal mediocre quality or non credible reviewing behavior . The article concludes with implications for research and practice .
