 This article conceptualises the problem of selecting teaching content that supports the practice of programme evaluation . Knowledge for evaluation practice falls within one of three categories of knowledge that are defined by the different roles they play in supporting practice . First core knowledge relates to the defining activity of evaluation practice i.e . that it informs the intellectual task of the determination of a programmes value . Second accessory knowledge informs activities that support and facilitate the concretisation of the previous activity in a delivery context . Third and finally supplementary knowledge informs activities that may on occasion occur during evaluation practice but without relating to the determination of value either inherently or in a support role . The selection of knowledge for the teaching of evaluation must match the knowledge needed for the pursuit of effective evaluation practice core accessory and supplementary knowledge . The specifics of these three needs ultimately depend on the characteristics of a given practice . The selection of content for the teaching of evaluation should ideally address these specific needs with the best knowledge available regardless of its disciplinary origins .

@highlight Evaluation knowledge is made of core accessory and supplementary knowledge.
@highlight Evaluation practice has needs for the three types of knowledge.
@highlight Evaluation and other disciplines can be sources for all three knowledge types.
@highlight Evaluation teaching should select the best available knowledge for the relevant needs.
