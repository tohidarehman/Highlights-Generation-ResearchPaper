 The purpose of this study was to explicate a conceptual framework for the prevention of human trafficking from the perspective of those most impacted human trafficking survivors . In doing so establishing an empirical foundation for human trafficking prevention research . To achieve this aim researchers employed Group Concept Mapping . GCM is an integrated mixed method research design that analyzes qualitative data via quantitative approaches namely multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses . All participants identified as human trafficking survivors from one of four states in the United States . Results indicate that survivors in this sample conceptualize prevention via a 10 cluster solution . Furthermore survivors rated the cluster on Education and Awareness as the most Important as well as the most Feasible . This paper will review extant literature related to human trafficking explicate results from this study and discuss pragmatic prevention implications related to findings .

@highlight Human trafficking prevention is of critical importance in social sciences and yet there remains a significant dearth in the emperical literature.
@highlight A final 10 cluster solution provides a burgeoning prevention framework built upon rigorous multi level mixed methods analyses. .
@highlight This study is the first of its kind including survivors of human trafficking in conceptualizing human trafficking prevention and data organization.
@highlight This study meets national and international calls for research which is empirically sound in the field of human trafficking.
@highlight This study supports the anti human trafficking movement in the inclusion of survivors bringing valuable insight experience and knowledge to research and practice.
