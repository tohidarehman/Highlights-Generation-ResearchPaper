 The present article follows two objectives . First to apply a recently developed spatial interaction model and discuss its power in explaining social developments . Second to obtain information on internal migration s determinants in Russia by taking into account that its eastern and western regions differ in many respects . Two alternative panel specifications are considered labelled spatial interaction specification with exogenous spatial lags and gravity type specification with network effects . While both specifications are designed to capture the impacts of neighbouring regions in migration dynamics they differ with respect to the implementation of fixed effects . It is argued that neighbourhood impacts manifest themselves either as spillover effects which amplify a variable s impact or competition effects which attenuate them . The results show that variables indeed differ from each other in these respects demonstrating how migration patterns are subject to events beyond the directly involved regions and that these are furthermore influenced by the distances between regions . In addition the results provide further evidence that migration determinants differ for Eastern and Western Russia .

@highlight This paper shows in detail how to apply the recently developed spatial interaction specification with exogenous spatial lags.
@highlight The paper suggests a taxonomy for interpreting network effects.
@highlight The original econometric specification is tested against restricted versions and a gravity type specification with network effects.
@highlight The results show that migration in Russia can be better understood when western European and eastern Asian regions are considered separately.
@highlight A comparison of results reveals that caution is needed when interpreting as some variables react sensitively to changing specifications.
