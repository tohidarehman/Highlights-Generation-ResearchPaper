 The present research focuses on luxury consumption in a workplace setting a social environment integral to consumers everyday life and theorizes that interpersonal inferences based upon luxury consumption cues will depend upon relative status in the workplace . Across five studies we show that luxury consumption by higher status consumers has negative effects on observers reactions due to inferences of lack of warmth whereas luxury consumption by lower status consumers has positive effects on observers reactions due to inferences of competence . We further explore how this reversal and the underlying inferential mechanism are altered by observer characteristics and signal characteristics . Together our findings demonstrate how the mixed signals of luxury consumption are interpreted in the workplace with implications for consumers marketers and the workplace itself .

@highlight Luxury consumption provides mixed signals as a function of workplace status.
@highlight Higher status luxury consumers e.g. CEOs managers are seen as lower in warmth.
@highlight Lower status luxury consumers e.g. employees are seen as higher in competence.
@highlight These signals based on luxury consumption influence workplace attitudes.
@highlight Signals also vary for loud quiet luxury and by investor employee observers.
