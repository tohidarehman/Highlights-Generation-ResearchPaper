 Community based participatory research and developmental evaluation have emerged over recent decades as separate approaches for addressing complex social issues . Current literature offers little with respect to the use of CBPR and DE in combination although the two approaches are complementary . Through the current paper we outline how CBPR and DE were used to develop a model of supportive housing for teen families . More specifically we describe the structures and processes that contributed to this development including our partnership approach pooled resources regular opportunities for collaboration and reflection integration of multiple data sources ongoing feedback and knowledge dissemination and adjustments to program practices . We end by providing insights into the lessons that we learned through this project . Through this paper we describe how researchers and community partners can collaboratively use CBPR and DE to develop a program model in complex community settings . Insights are offered that will be important for researchers evaluators and practitioners seeking to develop programming in response to complex community issues .
