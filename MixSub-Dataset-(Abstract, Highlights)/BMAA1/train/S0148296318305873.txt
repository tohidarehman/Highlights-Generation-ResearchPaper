 Building on the institution based view and agency theory this paper studies the relationship between institutional development family ownership family leadership and firm profitability in emerging markets . We propose that national institutional development reduces agency costs and improves the profitability of emerging market firms but that this effect varies for family vs. nonfamily firms . We also consider the heterogeneity among family firms by comparing family led vs. nonfamily led family firms . Using data for 503 Indian firms from 2003 to 2012 we find that although institutional development tends to increase the profitability of domestic firms the greatest beneficiaries are family firms . Furthermore we find that family firms that are family led tend to perform better than those that are nonfamily led even when institutional improvements are considered .
