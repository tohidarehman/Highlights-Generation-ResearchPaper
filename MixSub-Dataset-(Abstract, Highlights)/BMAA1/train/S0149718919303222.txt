 The contexts in which evaluators develop and apply their expertise are increasingly complex evaluator education needs to provide robust opportunities to support and assess the progressive lifelong development of relevant knowledge and skills . This mixed methods case study begins to address the dearth of empirical evidence assessing the impacts and learner experiences of competency based approaches to evaluator education . A decade in the making doctoral evaluation course based on the Canadian Evaluation Societys Competencies for Canadian Evaluation Practice created an opportune study setting . We applied a systems perspective to Stufflebeams Context Input Process and Product model to frame the case study analysis and presentation of the complex impacts generated by pre post course competency self assessments and reflections integrated with an end of course focus group . Seven insights shed new light on the effective course design and implementation features for developing intended and unintended evaluator competencies . We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical practical and methodological implications for effective competency based evaluator education .
