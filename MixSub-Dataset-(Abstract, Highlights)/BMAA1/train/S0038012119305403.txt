 In austerity times the general interest to reduce costs and improve efficiency levels often resulted into local cuts to public expenditure and profound reorganizations of existing service networks especially in sectors like healthcare . In Italy a recent reform prescribed the reconfiguration of time dependent hospital networks with the aim of improving patients accessibility conditions . In order to evaluate the impacts determined by this reorganization we perform a spatial analysis in which we consider the distance from the closest facility as an accessibility measure . Results obtained from the spatial analysis confirm that users effectively benefit from the reorganization process but also that further improvements are possible especially for the worst served ones . To this end we also propose solving a mathematical programming model aiming at redistributing the capacities i.e . the supply of beds among the hospitals of the network seeking to maximize users accessibility . The realized computational experiments show that averagely better and even more equitable accessibility conditions could be obtained by containing the deriving reorganization costs .

@highlight A capacity reorganization problem of an existing hospital network is addressed.
@highlight The aim is to improve users accessibility while containing reorganization costs.
@highlight A bi objective mathematical programming model is proposed.
@highlight Different reorganization cost functions are considered.
@highlight An adequate redistribution of capacities is proven to improve users accessibility.
