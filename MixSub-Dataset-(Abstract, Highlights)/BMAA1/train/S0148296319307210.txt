 Research shows that CSR certification motives span from being symbolic to substantive . Prior studies have mainly focused on the differences between firms that hold and do not hold CSR certificates . This study explores if the extent of CSR certification is related to different business logic amongst firms who hold CSR certificates . The study utilizes full sample data from the Swedish commercial real estate industry to analyze the variance in motives and performance among firms with CSR certificates . The results indicate that firms that have a substantive CSR commitment have a business logic that entails a holistic and long term perspective on both financial and CSR performance . However substantive CSR commitment comes with greater staffing costs and lower financial returns as opposed to those of firms that obtain CSR certificates based on symbolic motives .
