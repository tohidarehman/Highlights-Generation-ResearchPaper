 China s transport sector has been attracting great attention for its excessive energy consumption and ever increasing pollution emissions . Thus reducing energy intensity is one of the top priorities of China s ongoing transport upgrade . In this paper by establishing a panel data regression model derived from the CobbDouglas cost function we focus on investigating the impacts of energy price and transport productivity on transport energy intensity at the national and regional levels . The study uses the provincial panel data for 20052016 to perform regression analysis . The results show that energy price has a significantly negative effect on transport energy intensity in the whole China and the eastern region whereas it has no significant impacts in the central and western China . Improvements in transport productivity can effectively decrease transport energy intensity in the whole China and the three major regions . Applying an extended data envelopment analysis approach we decompose transport productivity into four components and further differentiate their impacts in different regions . The results indicate that these four components have substantially different impacts in each region . These results provide some valuable insights for policymakers and enterprise entities aiming to adopt measures to reduce energy intensity and achieve sustainable development in China s transport sector .

@highlight Theregional heterogeneousimpacts of energy price and productivity on transport energy intensity in China are examined.
@highlight The transport productivity change is further decomposed intofour components.
@highlight Energy price has a significantly negative effect on transport energy intensity in eastern region.
@highlight The impacts of four components of transport productivity change on energy intensity vary by region.
