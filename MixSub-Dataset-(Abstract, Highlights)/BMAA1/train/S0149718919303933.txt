 In realist evaluation where researchers aim to make program theories explicit they can encounter competing explanations as to how programs work . Managing explanatory tensions from different sources of evidence in multi stakeholder projects can challenge external evaluators especially when access to pertinent data like client records is mediated by program stakeholders . In this article we consider two central questions how can program stakeholder motives shape a realist evaluation project and how might realist evaluators respond to stakeholders belief motive explanations including those about program effectiveness based on factors such as supererogatory commitment or trying together in good faith Drawing on our realist evaluation of a service reform initiative involving multiple agencies we describe stakeholder motives at key phases highlighting a need for tactics and skills that help to manage explanatory tensions . In conclusion the relevance of stakeholders belief motive explanations in realist evaluation is clarified and discussed .
