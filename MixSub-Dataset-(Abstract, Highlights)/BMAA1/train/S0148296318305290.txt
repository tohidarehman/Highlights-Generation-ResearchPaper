 This research contributes to broadening understanding of online retailing across electronic channels and e channel touchpoints from a consumer perspective . Based on the multichannel retailing approach and theoretical considerations the authors suggest an enhanced perspective on the online retailing environment and validate this multichannel e commerce perspective by conducting both an online survey and an experimental study . The results indicate that online retailing can be classified into four e commerce categories that entail individual e channel touchpoints emphasizing the need for a more differentiated consideration of the online channel . This work advances marketing research and practice by illustrating that both technology related quality and context related situational benefit affect consumers utilization of e channels . Further findings show that retailers can enhance consumers shopping experiences by providing alternative e channel touchpoints that contribute differently to the online customer journey .
