 Models for the distribution of relief supplies often assume immediate availability of relief items upon the occurrence of a natural disaster . However such an assumption does not always apply in realistic settings . In some cases at least it is necessary to assemble relief items into kits before distributing them among the affected population . This paper presents a rolling horizon methodology that considers dynamic parameters such as demand capacities and demand priorities for the problem of distributing relief supplies after the occurrence of a natural disaster by including such assembling activities before the delivery .
