 Consistent with the rapid growth of the Chinese economy and its commercial real estate market evaluating CRE investments in China is becoming an important application area where a multi criteria expert decision system can make a significant contribution . We used a multi criteria expert decision system to evaluate ten actual CRE investments in China . Based on thirty one industry experts we identified key decision factors to consider when evaluating different CRE investment projects and determined their importance weights . We then evaluated whether or not the ten CRE investment projects were considered to be successful taking into account the unique characteristics of each CRE investment project . We finally compared the evaluations for the ten cases with their actual performance using four different performance indicators . The results showed that the evaluations had at least 87.5 accuracy across four different performance indicators . As probably one of the first systematic and in depth scholarly studies to evaluate CRE investment projects in China this study contributes to a better understanding of such evaluations and helps CRE investors evaluate CRE investment projects in a more informed fashion .
