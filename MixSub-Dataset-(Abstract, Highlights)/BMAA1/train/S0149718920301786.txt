 Combining physical activity and academic content is a promising way to improve health and academic learning in schoolchildren . This paper examined the continuation of physically active lessons in five Norwegian elementary schools two years after a 10 month intervention period which consisted of weekly minimum 2 x 45 min of PAL . Data were collected through semi structured interviews with nine teachers and five school leaders . The Level of Use instrument was used to assess how the teachers integrated PAL into the school day . Two years after the intervention period seven of nine teachers conducted PAL regularly on average one lesson per week . Teachers implementation progress varied from struggling with logistics to stable routine and creative adaption . Perceived benefits for the children active leadership and ongoing implementation support seem important for continuation . Introduction of PAL as a school development project systematic planning from the onset and a gradual introduction of PAL can be an effective strategy for continuation and long term sustainability . In addition the Level of Use instrument was useful to better understand which support mechanisms are needed at different stages in the implementation of PAL .
