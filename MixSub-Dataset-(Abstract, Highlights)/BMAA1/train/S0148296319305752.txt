 Through acquisitions firms can access resources and capabilities they can not develop on their own . Post acquisition a key managerial challenge is balancing the need for integration to transfer capabilities with the need for autonomy to preserve knowledge based capabilities . Drawing on extensive qualitative data I find that this balancing involves managerial perceptions and actions that unfold in a reciprocal and dynamic process resulting in capability transfer . I identify two distinct trajectories of capability transfer one driven by the acquiring managers perceptions of valuable capabilities in the target and one driven by the target managers desire to shield their capabilities from deterioration . This study contributes to the post acquisition integration literature by conceptualizing the role played by target and acquiring firm managers in the dynamic reciprocal and sequential process of post acquisition capability transfer .

@highlight Capability transfer takes place through interaction between the target and acquiring firm.
@highlight Capability transfer can be driven by either the target or acquiring firm.
@highlight The acquiring firms ability to access resources in the target firm is a relative capacity.
