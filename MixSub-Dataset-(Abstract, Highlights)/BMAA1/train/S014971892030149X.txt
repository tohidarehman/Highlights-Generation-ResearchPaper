 Job skills training is a cost effective strategy for improving employment among individuals who have low income and employment barriers but few U.S. government sponsored employment program participants have received such training . To better understand long term gains from job skills training this study compared employment and earnings trajectories between program participants who received job skills training and those who received basic services only . Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 we estimated 33 year employment and earnings trajectories among U.S. baby boomer cohorts while accounting for baseline group heterogeneity using inverse propensity score weighting . We found increases in employment rates over the life course especially among Black women . Job skills training also increased earnings by up to 69.6 compared to basic services only . Despite the long term gains in employment and earnings job skills training participation is not sufficient to address gender as well as racial and ethnic gaps in full time employment . Findings reinforce the importance of incorporating job skills training as an essential service element of government sponsored employment programs to improve long term labor market outcomes among Americans with economic disadvantages .
