 Supply chain flexibility has become an important competitive weapon for companies in the current dynamic environment . This paper explores the influence of ambidexterity on supply chain flexibility and theorizes the moderating effect of information technology competence on that relationship . Whereas prior research focuses on the positive results of SCF for business performance little empirical research has studied its facilitators leaving the gap this study seeks to fill . We draw on resource orchestration theory to develop our research model . According to this theory a firm can exploit the full potential of its resources and capabilities only when these are deployed in a complementary manner . This study proposes that ambidexterity impacts SCF positively and that its effect is amplified when the firm possesses IT competence . In order to test our hypotheses we have employed a hierarchical regression methodology and put into service data collected from manufacturing enterprises . The study confirms that ambidexterity as the ability to explore and exploit SC resources enables their orchestration making SC resources flexible and a high IT competence facilitates that orchestration .

@highlight Supply chain ambidexterity positively affects supply chain flexibility.
@highlight The relationship between ambidexterity and supply chain flexibility is amplified when information technology competence is high.
@highlight ROT is adequate for understanding the complementariety of ambidexterity and IT competence on developing SCF.
@highlight The study proves that ambidexterity enables the orchestration of SC resources and IT competence facilitates that orchestration.
