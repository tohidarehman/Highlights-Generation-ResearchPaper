 While capital structure is usually presented in the context of a choice between debt and equity even within these choices we observe different sources of capital especially related to debt . Recent studies have arrived at differing conclusions regarding the reliance upon different sources for capital and regarding the importance of those sources . We find that the complexity of capital structure is related to the need for external capital access to debt markets and the capacity for additional borrowing . Each of these determinants has a unique impact on capital structure complexity however access to capital markets serves as a mitigating factor in capital structure complexity for those firms with a financial deficit .

@highlight Traditional theories of capital structure CS explain a choice between debt and equity.
@highlight These theories do not explain use of different sources of capital especially debt.
@highlight We find CS complexity is related to the need for access to and capacity for borrowing.
