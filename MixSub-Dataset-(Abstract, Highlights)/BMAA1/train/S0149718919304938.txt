 Cluster randomized control trials have unique challenges compared to single site trials with regards to conduct of the trial and it is important to understand these barriers . The aim of this scoping review was to describe the current literature surrounding the implementation of the cRCTs in hospitals . The search strategy was designed to identify literature relevant to conduct of cRCTs with hospitals as the unit of randomization . Data was extracted and was mapped using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research as a codebook which contains 39 constructs organized into five domains . Twenty two articles met inclusion criteria and were included . 18 of 39 constructs of the CFIR were identified in coding spanning four of the five domains . Barriers to the conduct of the trial were rarely reported as the main outcome of the study and few details were included in the identified literature . The review can provide guidance to future researchers planning cRCTs in hospitals . It also identified a large gap in reporting of conduct of these trials demonstrating the need for a research agenda that further explores the barriers and facilitators with the aim of garnering knowledge for improved guidance in the implementation .

@highlight Conduct of cluster randomized controlled trials present challenges.
@highlight Literature was searched to identify relevant aspects of the conduct and implementation.
@highlight The literature was able to be mapped to the Consolidated Framework for Implantation Research as a coding framework.
@highlight A large gap in reporting of the barriers and enablers to conduct of these trials exist.
