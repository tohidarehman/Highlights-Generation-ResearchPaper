 Medical devices have attained increasing importance in diagnosis and treatment in the healthcare system in recent years due to technological advancements . Along with this progress the IoT property in these devices reduces the supply time which is very critical in increasing their up periods . Often certain medical devices used in treatment require a major portion of the investment . Such huge capital goods are generally irreversible investments . Depending on the strategic view and irreversibility medical device assessment requires a sophisticated evaluation method called real options . However there are many ambiguities during the investment period and while gathering the data for the evaluation . Interval type 2 fuzzy logic fits like a glove for such vague conditions and lack of data . In this study an interval type 2 fuzzy set integrated real option analysis is offered for medical treatment device evaluation . Possibilistic mean value and possibilistic variance of interval type 2 fuzzy sets are found for the purpose of the real options analysis . This offered method is applied to a real case in a healthcare system . Sensitivity analysis provides many different viewpoints . At the end of the procedure the institution decides whether to perform the investment now or one year later .
