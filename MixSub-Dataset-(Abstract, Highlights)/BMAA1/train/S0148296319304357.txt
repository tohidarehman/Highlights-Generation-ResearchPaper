 Product images are an important element of web design . Although many studies have been conducted on web design the effect of the background of a product image has been ignored . This study investigates the influence of the background complexity of a product image on consumer attention information processing and purchase intention using eye tracking and questionnaire methods . Furthermore it considers the moderating effects of consumer cognitive style . The results show that product images with higher background complexity attract greater attention but most of that attention is focused on the background . Product images with moderate background complexity best promote consumer processing of product information thereby increasing purchase intention . In addition consumer cognitive style moderates the effect of background complexity on that person s attention to the product textual description . Specifically consumers with a field dependent cognitive style are more susceptible to being influenced by background complexity .

@highlight Higher background complexity distracts more attention away from the focal product.
@highlight Moderate background complexity can best promote product information processing.
@highlight Moderate background complexity can best facilitate consumer purchase intention.
@highlight Cognitive style moderates the effects of background complexity on attention to product text.
