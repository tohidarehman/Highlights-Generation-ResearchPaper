 Little is known about the effects of lean manufacturing practices on the process innovation performance of manufacturing organisations . This research aims to fill this gap and explore the aforementioned interdependency . A research framework consisting of 22 measurement scales and three pairs of hypotheses was developed based on an extensive literature review . A large scale self administered questionnaire was distributed among appropriately selected industrial experts . Datasets obtained from 340 usable responses were analysed through confirmatory factor analysis descriptive statistics correlations and multiple linear regression models . The findings suggest that both technical and human lean practices have a moderate to strong positive impact on the input and occurrence of incremental and radical process innovation in manufacturing organisations . In turn as an output of process innovation this appears to enhance companies operational performance . Thereby the results dispel the scholarly and managerial misconception that LM and innovation are difficult to coexist .
