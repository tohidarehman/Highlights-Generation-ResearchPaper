 Although corporate governance literature recognizes the influence of acquired social ties between CEOs and directors innate social ties are hardly explored . To extend this literature this study examines how CEOboard surname ties influence agency costs . Drawing on social identity theory we first develop the argument that CEOboard surname ties result in increased agency costs . We then employ agency theory to examine the boundary conditions under which such directors are less likely to act as group members of surname ties . Specifically we consider three key governance tools as such conditions namely monitoring by shareholders aligning directors interests with firm value and aligning supervisors interests with firm value . We find empirical support for our arguments by using a sample of 16 926 listed firms and 165 287 directors in China from 2005 to 2015 . We discuss the contributions to corporate governance literature and elucidate the practical implications of our findings .
