 This work analyses how risk transference to the private partner affects the success of public private partnerships . For this purpose a broad sample from the World Bank database of 6 022 PPP infrastructure projects in 59 developing countries in the period 1997 to 2016 is analysed . Using multilevel logistic models our results show that PPPs success is more likely when the private partner takes more risk and the economic and institutional environments are better . Another interesting finding is that an excessive transference of risks to the private party when certain institutional features show good records could prejudice PPPs performance .
