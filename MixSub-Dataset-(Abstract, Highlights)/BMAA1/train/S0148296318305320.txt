 Faced with growing pressures to become more environmentally sustainable many companies are exploring innovative ways to incorporate green practices into their business processes . We focus on employees and their pro environmental behaviours in the workplace . Drawing on gamification and persuasive design principles we utilized five design cycles to develop and test a system that tracks employees electricity usage on their computer related equipment engages them through a mobile application using a garden metaphor and encourages them to reduce their energy consumption . The results of the design cycles built on each other demonstrating that the system decreases employees electricity consumption and increases their motivation to continue engaging in pro environmental behaviours . Possible extensions to the system were also explored . Reflecting on our experiences seven guidelines emerged related to gamification design and the wider field of design science research . Limitations and future research directions for gamification and environmental sustainability research are discussed .

@highlight Feedback through a gamified app helps employees decrease their use of electricity.
@highlight Two weeks of monitoring and feedback can create habit change.
@highlight App usage results in sharing tips and spillover to other sustainability areas.
@highlight Iterative design cycles result in revised design principles.
