 Over the last two decades application of Data envelopment analysis in transportation problems have gained considerable research attention . This paper presents a literature review and classification of the applications of DEA in transportation systems . First by classifying 40 papers from 2007 to 2018 the origins of DEA in transportation problems have been reviewed . Then the development and an overall view of DEA applications in TSs have been presented . We have classified the applications of DEA into six different contexts . In each context published papers have deeply been analyzed . Content of analysis includes Number of published papers during the time target journals countries keyword frequency most cited papers map of most co cited publications . More important we reported the inputs and outputs variables used in each paper . Further a review of the selected papers and gaps future research directions have been given within each cluster . The results show that DEA is one of the most useful approach in evaluating TSs for policy makers . On the other hand DEA can help the decision makers in transportation especially regarding environmental factors sustainable development and eco design . Finally we proposed subjects for future researches including guidance for new studies in the field of DEA applications in TSs .
