 This manuscript focuses on the sustainability of a European Union project funded by the Alpine Space Programme . This project aims to develop an innovative care model based on community nurses to support municipalities in promoting active and healthy ageing . Adopting the Directional Distance Function our work sets out to propose a specific score able to identify all those municipalities that are inefficient in supporting the ageing process through the coordination of socio economic interventions . According to the estimated scores policy makers can make more rational use of the available resources implementing the innovative treatments where it is most necessary . In this way the achievements of this European Union project can be maintained for the sake of the next generation avoiding its collapse as soon as funding shifts to new programmes .
