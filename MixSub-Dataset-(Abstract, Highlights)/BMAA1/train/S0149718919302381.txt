 Transit oriented development is an integration of transportation systems with land use and has been given priority in sustainability strategies . However most of the existing studies on TOD emphasize the economic and environmental perspectives of sustainability paying little attention to social equity . Moreover despite governments worldwide are gradually trying to address unsustainable issues associated with dramatic urbanization through a framework of TOD development the improvement of land use planning necessary to achieve variegated sustainability within a safe trajectory is not being targeted or achieved . This paper aims to establish a framework of TOD planning in China s context that could be applied beyond the concept to planning experts and policymakers on how to integrate land use planning with TOD to achieve sustainability . We further applied an empirical study of Jiaomei China to demonstrate the application of the designed framework . The study provided a new framework for understanding sustainable transportation development with land use management as applied to the urban planning process and for exploring new paths in practice toward sustainability .
