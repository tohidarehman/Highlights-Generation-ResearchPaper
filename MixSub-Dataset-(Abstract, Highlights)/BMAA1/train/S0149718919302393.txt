 Gender equality and gender mainstreaming in research is one of the six European Research Area priorities . Integrating the gender dimension in research content and teaching is one of its three objectives . It is arguably the objective where least progress has been made . In this article we contribute to the evidence base by applying the EFFORTI evaluation framework to three empirical case study interventions that aim to integrate the gender dimension in tertiary education and research content . Comparison is based on an evaluation of the design of the intervention those factors that have enabled hindered its implementation as well as an assessment of outcomes and impacts . The findings of the case studies highlight the importance of design specifically regarding resources legal status and the definition and operationalisation of the gender concept . Implementation hinges on top level institutional commitment and mainstreaming gender studies with support of a central unit and crucially gender competence . A lack of recognition and status of gender studies and subsequent innovations was seen to hamper implementation . Outcomes and impacts included an increased awareness and interest in gender increased gender competence a push towards gender equality regarding representation and organisational change as well as an improved accreditation process and more and better research .
