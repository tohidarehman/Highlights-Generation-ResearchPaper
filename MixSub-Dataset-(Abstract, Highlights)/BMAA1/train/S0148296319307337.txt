 Gamification has become a popular technique in marketing . Many companies believe that gamification can potentially increase the engagement awareness and loyalty of consumers with respect to the brand . However there is current dearth of empirical evidence supporting these beliefs beyond the pervasive hype . In this study we investigated the relationships between gamification brand engagement and brand equity among consumers of two online gamified brand communities . The results showed that achievement and social interaction related gamification features were positively associated with all three forms of brand engagement . Immersion related gamification features were only positively associated with social brand engagement . Additionally brand engagement was further positively associated with brand equity . The results imply that gamification can positively affect brand engagement and further increase brand equity and that gamification appears to be an effective technique for brand management .
