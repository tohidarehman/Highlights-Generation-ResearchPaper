 This study aims to explore the moderating effect of the number of images and videos on the relationship between text length in crowdfunding campaign descriptions and crowdfunding outcomes . We use data from 13 622 technology campaigns on the Kickstarter website to test our hypotheses . The findings indicate that an increased number of images and videos improves fundraising performance but weakens the positive effect of description length on the fundraising performance of technology campaigns . In other words on the Kickstarter website we find an overshadowing effect between multimedia . The term overshadowing effect proposed in this paper suggests that redundant media can obscure the effect of other media in working memory . This study is among the first to explore the interaction between multimedia types from the theoretical perspective of cognitive load .
