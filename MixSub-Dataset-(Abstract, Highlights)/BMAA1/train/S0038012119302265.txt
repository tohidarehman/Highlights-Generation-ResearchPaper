 Among all natural disasters flood stands as a recurrently happening disaster . It holds the aptitude to disrupt the organizations and to cause absenteeism of the workforce in industries . As the workforce is directly involve in the functioning of industries work force absenteeism can cause reduced production and inoperability which outcomes in financial losses of industrial sectors . This research objects to estimate inoperability of industries due to distraction of workers by incorporating Dynamic Inoperability Input Output Model . Economic losses are determined from inoperability . Industrial area which is selected for the research includes local industries in Peshawar Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pakistan . Various industries are chosen and are ordered according to inoperability and economic losses . Industries having highest financial damages are Agriculture Sugar mills and Marble industry . These three industries hold liable for 40.6 of the overall financial losses of fifteen industries . Industries suffering from highest inoperability include Sugar mills Agriculture and Marble industry . A risk analysis frame work has also been developed to help industrial sectors to recover after a disaster . Besides data of three different floods has also been taken for the above mentioned critical sectors to plot probability distributions for predicting economic losses of most frequent floods . Furthermore this research methodology has been applied to flooding but it can be applied to any other disaster everywhere .

@highlight Natural disasters like floods cause inoperability in industries.
@highlight Dynamic Inoperability Input Output Model can be used to estimate disruptions in disasters like floods.
@highlight Industries can be ranked on the basis of inoperability and economic losses to point out critical industries.
@highlight Allocating budget to critical sectors after flooding reduces economic losses.
