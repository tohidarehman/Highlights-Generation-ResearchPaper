 In the field of sensory marketing implicit consumer information processing plays an important role because a large proportion of sensory stimuli is perceived unconsciously . Current consumer research calls for integrative models that consider both unconscious and conscious processes . This paper introduces the implicit sensory association test a novel response latency measurement approach for implicit sensory perception . The ISAT provides a counterpart to the recently developed measurement approach for explicit sensory perception based on the sensory perception item set . Thus the ISAT enables the measurement of all five sensory dimensions . In three studies we provide empirical evidence that the ISAT measures are valid and reliable show highly significant relationships with essential marketing related outcome variables and can give valuable insights in addition to explicit measures finding both positive and negative relationships between implicit and explicit sensory perception .

@highlight The ISAT enables the measurement of implicit sensory perception for all five senses.
@highlight The ISAT provides variables that are comparable to their explicit counterparts.
@highlight Implicit and explicit sensory perception can correlate positively and negatively.
@highlight The ISAT variables positively correlate with key outcome variables of marketing.
