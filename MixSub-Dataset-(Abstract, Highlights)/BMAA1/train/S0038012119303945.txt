 We study the development of social capital through adult civic engagement in relation to social capital exposure having occurred during childhood based on experiences outside the family at primary school . We assume that the types of classmates in attendance at a child s school would have influenced her his social capital . To identify the types of classmates we take advantage of the heterogeneity in the ability levels of British primary school classes during the 1960s . At that time some schools were practicing a method of streaming whereas others were not . Using British National Child Development data we construct a single score of civic engagement and evaluate the effect on adult civic engagement of attending homogeneous ability classes versus nonhomogeneous ability classes and being in high average or low ability classes when enrolled in streamed schools . Our results show that children who were grouped in homogeneous ability classes developed a lower interest in civic engagement than their peers who attended mixed ability classes . Moreover among children who attended streamed schools a lower attitude toward civic engagement was observed among low ability students . Thus streaming appears to be detrimental to social capital development especially for low ability individuals .

@highlight Civic engagement decreases with the age.
@highlight Streaming appears to be detrimental to social capital development.
@highlight Streaming according to students ability levels can have social effects in the long run.
@highlight Homogenous grouping of average and high ability children increases their civic engagement in the long run.
@highlight Single ability groups develop norms of behavior that are different from nonstreamed groups.
