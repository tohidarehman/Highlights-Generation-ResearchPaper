 Prior research concerning anticipated emotions identified the influence of negative anticipated emotions on the regulation of effortful behaviors but few studies were able to demonstrate the role of positive anticipated emotions . We address this gap by examining the influence of not only NAEs but also PAEs on behavioral intentions in the context of climate change and the roles of perceived behavioral control and behavioral engagement in this relationship . Using a sample of 516 respondents and structural equation modeling we find that perceived behavioral control partially mediates the influence of AEs on behavioral intentions . Moreover pro environmental behavioral engagement moderates the relationship between AEs and behavioral intentions such that the effects of PAEs on behavioral intentions are stronger in the engaged groups and the effects of NAEs on behavioral intentions are stronger in the low non engaged group . Highly engaged individuals use both PAEs and NAEs to regulate their future behaviors .
