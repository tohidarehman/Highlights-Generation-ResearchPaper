 Enhancing the spatial accessibility of population to fire services is a key strategy to help improve emergency response minimise property loss and reduce injuries and deaths . Given its significance for fire service policy and strategic planning we draw on small area population forecasts fire station locations and the road network and employ the enhanced two step floating catchment method to compute the levels of spatial accessibility of population to fire services in relation to current and future population growth in Brisbane Australia . Results show that lower levels of spatial accessibility to fire services exist in the most populated areas compared to those that are least populated . Further we reveal that some areas are more likely to suffer a reduction in spatial accessibility than others . Spatial accessibility of population to fire services over the period to 2036 is likely to reduce as a consequence of rising demand for service . The identification of locales that experience lower levels of accessibility to fire services will enable fire services agencies to strategically plan infrastructure investment and help enhance the operational efficiency of emergency response .

@highlight Accessibility to fire services varies by both space and time.
@highlight A lower level of fire service accessibility exists in the most populated areas.
@highlight Mapped accessibility levels identified optimum locations for fire stations.
