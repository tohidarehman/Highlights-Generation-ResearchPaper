In the qualitative section a variety of EA evaluation indicators were identified by a systematic literature review approach then in the quantitative section the survey data were collected by a questionnaire prepared based on the qualitative part and then exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were performed . This research presents an EA evaluation model that has seven main quality attributes including alignment and integrity quality of EA products and services security maintainability and portability reliability reusability and scalability and 30 indicators that address all aspects of enterprise architecture . Through this model organizations can evaluate the quality of implemented EA or AS IS status of EA and take steps to improve it .

@highlight Enterprise Architecture EA evaluation indicators have been identified through Systematic literature review and also classified and quantitative analysis has been done in order to create a comprehensive and validated model for EA quality evaluation.
@highlight EA has seven quality attributes including alignment and integrity quality of EA products and services maintainability and portability scalability security reliability and reusability.
@highlight The seven main attributes of EA are evaluated by 30 indicators altogether that can be served as a guide for studying the EA As Is status of an organization.
