 We propose a theoretical framework which allows us to obtain a tractable equation for empirical implementation that relates the growth rate of public investment per capita by the central planner to variables typically associated with traditional public investment allocation criteria . Panel data for the Ecuadorian provinces over the period 20082015 are used . The results suggest that the central planner managed to deal with the traditional equity efficiency trade off as well as the decongestion of some public services such as public transport and education . Additional evidence was also found that might raise suspicions regarding distributive politics .

@highlight The empirical strategy is based on a theoretical model.
@highlight A social welfare function is maximized to obtain the optimal provincial levels of public investment.
@highlight The central planner deviates from the optimal investment levels.
@highlight Results suggest that the government was able to cope with the equity efficiency trade off.
@highlight Evidence on distributive politics was also found.
