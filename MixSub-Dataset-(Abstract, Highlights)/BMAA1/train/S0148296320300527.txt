 To address research gaps this study develops a conceptual framework that integrates the personal values of Schwartz and the theory of planned behavior and aims to examine tourists visiting intentions towards eco friendly destinations . The authors collected data from 503 Chinese tourists . The majority of the hypotheses were accepted . The results show that resultant self transcendence and resultant conservation values have positive relationships with three TPB anchors i.e . attitude subjective norms and perceived behavioral control . Contrarily the authors found an insignificant relationship between value of resultant conservation and perceived behavioral control . Furthermore TPB factors exert positive effects on tourists visiting intentions . Moreover environmental consciousness positively moderates relationships between Schwartz personal values and attitude . The findings offer strong theoretical and practical implications .
