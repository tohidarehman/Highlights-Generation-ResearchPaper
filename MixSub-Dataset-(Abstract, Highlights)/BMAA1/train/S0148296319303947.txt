 Through three experimental studies this paper sheds light on how expressing hope during responses to organizational crises affects individuals negative behavioural intentions . The first experiment shows that a message framed with a higher level of hopefulness leadsdue to reduced feelings of uncertainty and perceived inappropriatenessto fewer negative behavioural intentions than one framed with a lower level of hopefulness and that the effects are stronger post crisis than in the midst of a crisis . The results of the second experiment indicate that organizations should be cautious when expressing a higher level of hopefulness when a crisis is perceived to be highly severe as it may lead to more negative behavioural intentions because a higher level of hopeful framing is then perceived to be inappropriate . The third experiment supports the conclusion that a message framed with a higher level of hopefulness used by an organization with a favourable pre crisis reputation leads to higher perceived crisis severity which in turn leads to higher perceived uncertainty resulting in more negative behavioural intentions . For companies with an unfavourable pre crisis reputation no difference is found between the uses of a lower or higher level of hopefulness .
