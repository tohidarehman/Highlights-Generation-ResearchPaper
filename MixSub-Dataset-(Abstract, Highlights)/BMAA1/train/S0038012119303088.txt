 Improving the entrepreneurial ecosystem plays an important role in the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries and achieving the coordinated development of economy and environment among cities is important for improving the quality and efficiency of the entrepreneurial ecosystem . Using the panel data of 286 prefecture level cities in China from 2003 to 2016 this study adopts the global reference super efficiency slack based measure model considering undesirable output to measure China s urban ecological efficiency . In addition the spatial lag model is used to investigate the impacts of industrial structure advancement and rationalization on ecological efficiency and the impacts of the heterogeneity of industrial structure and economic development under the distortion of resource dependence on ecological efficiency . The results show that every one unit increase in the advancement of industrial structure will lead to a 0.0741 unit increase in ecological efficiency but the high dependence on natural resources will inhibit the promoting effect of industrial structure advancement on ecological efficiency and such an inhibiting effect will weaken with the improvement of economic development level moreover the influence coefficient of industrial structure rationalization on ecological efficiency is not significant nor is it affected by the natural resource dependence and the level of economic development . This paper hereby proposes that in the process of promoting green entrepreneurial activity at present the Chinese government should give full play to the role of industrial structure advancement on improving ecological efficiency actively break through the constraints restricting the impact of industrial structure rationalization reduce excessive dependence on resource industries improve the level of regional economic development and strive to transform resource intensive industries to technology intensive industries to support the sustainable development of a green entrepreneurship ecosystem .

@highlight Industrial structure IS advancement significantly affects ecological efficiency.
@highlight No correlation exists between IS rationalization and ecological efficiency.
@highlight Higher dependence on natural resources distorts IS advancement.
@highlight Heterogeneity exists in the impact of IS rationalization on ecological efficiency.
