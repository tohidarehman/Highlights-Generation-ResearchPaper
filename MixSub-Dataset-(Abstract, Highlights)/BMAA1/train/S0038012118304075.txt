 Although significant progress has been made in China s basic research in recent years there remains a wide gap between research in China and that from developed countries . How to optimize the allocative efficiency of research resources is of great importance for increasing research output . In this paper using the fixed effect stochastic frontier model based on the translog production function we estimate output and substitution elasticities of research and development inputs at universities in China s provincial level during 20092016 . We find that the R D technical efficiency of China s universities after a rapid growth has tended to become relatively stable . Improvements of internationalization degree and exogenous R D capabilities are conducive to promoting R D technical efficiency whereas expenditures from government grants inhibit the promotion of R D technical efficiency the effects of R D capital deepening and internet penetration are not evident . The output elasticity of R D capital is much higher than that of R D personnel suggesting that R D capital is the main driving force of research output . The substitution elasticity between R D capital and personnel has experienced a change from substitution to complementary since 2014 . To realize sustained growth of research output we should increase R D input with positive output elasticity or reduce R D input with negative output elasticity making the necessary trade offs according to the substitution relationship between the two R D inputs .
