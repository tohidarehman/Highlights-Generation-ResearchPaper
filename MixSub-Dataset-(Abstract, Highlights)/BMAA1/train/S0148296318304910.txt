 Racial diversity is considered an integral part of the business world . The extant literature has focused on the effect of racial diversity on a firm s financial performance and presented mixed findings . Building on the institutional logics lens and using a sample of 204 firms belonging to 9 industries and spread across 21 countries for a period of six years we explore the impact of workforce racial diversity on the Corporate Social Responsibility Performance of a firm . In addition we also investigate the contingency effects of a firm s absorptive capacity and slack resources on the proposed relationship . Using a seemingly unrelated regression model and accounting for endogeneity we find that racial diversity has an inverted U shaped relationship with a firm s financial and social performance and has a U shaped relationship with its environmental performance . We also find significant moderating effects . Thus we contribute to the theory and practice in the field .
