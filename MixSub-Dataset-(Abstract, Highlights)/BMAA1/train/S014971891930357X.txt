 The need for conducting evaluations which reflect of the influence of context on complex programs is increasingly recognized in the field of evaluation . Better data visualization techniques for connecting context with program evaluation data are needed . We share our experience developing a mixed methods timeline to visualize complexity and context with evaluation data . Mixed methods timelines provide a meaningful way to show change over time in both a visually stimulating and accessible format for evaluation audiences . This paper provides an innovative example of using mixed methods timelines to integrate evaluation data with key program activities and milestones while also showing internal and external contextual influences in one cohesive visual . We present methods and best practices for collecting contextual data and for incorporating a variety of data sources into such a visual . We discuss several strategies to collect and organize context related data including qualitative interviews program materials narrative reports and member checking with stakeholders and staff . Gathering multiple perspectives is essential to better capture the multi layered elements of program activities and context .
