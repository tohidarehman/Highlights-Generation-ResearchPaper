 Surprise is a neutral amplifier of emotions and used by marketers to elevate customer affect from satisfaction to delight . The dark side of surprise however is that it can turn something mildly unpleasant into something very unpleasant . In this paper we argue that cash rewards may undermine intrinsic motivation since cash is an item of trade and adding a surprise element to the reward may amplify the inherently negative affect . We show that compared to an expected cash reward a surprise cash reward degrades evaluations of the focal brand among the more intrinsically engaged consumers . However the negative effect of surprise reduces if consumers feel that rewards signal communality rather than a transaction and if we change the rewards format from cash to a gift card .
