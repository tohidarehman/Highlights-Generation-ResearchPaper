 The growing proportion of senior citizens and the importance of encouraging active well ageing behaviours explain the increasing efforts carried out by governments to develop exercise programmes particularly targeted to this group . The complexity associated with the running of these programmes and the resources committed make their quality assessment essential . The aim of the current paper is to validate and refine the use of the EFQM model in this context . A programme of a medium sized municipality of the Centre region of Portugal was used as a case study to evaluate the adequacy and relevance of the EFQM model and to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current programme based on the data collected from service users instructors municipal leaders and programme partners . High levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty together with the clarity of programme mission and strategy emerged as main areas of strength . On the other hand insufficient attention to the measurement of people satisfaction as well as the leaders failure of to show appreciation for the efforts developed by the programme instructors are key areas for improvement .
