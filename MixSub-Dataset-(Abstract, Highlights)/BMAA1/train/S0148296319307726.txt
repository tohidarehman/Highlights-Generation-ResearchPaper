 This study investigates a cross cultural comparison between Germany and Norway regarding users self disclosure of personal information on social network sites . More specifically the study considers three antecedents of privacy namely concerns attitudes and intentions and evaluates their potential effects on self disclosure considering Facebook as the SNS of choice . The study employs a deductive research approach and develops a conceptual model based on the theoretical analysis . Data is collected via an online survey of users in Germany and Norway . The results show that privacy intention is the only antecedent that has a significant direct influence on users self disclosure of information . By contrast neither privacy concerns nor privacy attitude have a statistically significant influence on self disclosure . Additionally there are statistically significant differences between the German and Norwegian samples in privacy concepts and reported self disclosure . The results support the creation of more transparent privacy policies by SNS providers to improve targeted marketing .
