 A study involving over 2000 stoma care nurses in the development of best practice guidelines for the assessment of peristomal body profiles patient engagement and patient follow up was conducted in 2018 . The study was designed to develop guidelines for stoma care treatment and product selection and to decrease the evidence to implementation gap . The project built on research evidence from a literature review of 77 articles . The results of the literature review were then used to inform a series of Delphi surveys sent out to stoma care nurses through Association and industry list serves in 11 languages . The Delphi surveys were followed by a face2face professionally facilitated discussions among nurse research experts . The project concluded with a facilitated consensus dialogue among 960 stoma care nurses from 25 countries resulting in an implementation plan to ensure the guidelines become a normal part of routine patient care . The study resulted in a set of medical practice guidelines for stoma care nurses designed to improve patient outcomes and patient quality of life that were accepted and adopted into routine medical practice across 25 countries . This article describes the study and how the process used coined the Modified Delphi Process by the process designer led to faster implementation than is generally experienced in the medical community .
