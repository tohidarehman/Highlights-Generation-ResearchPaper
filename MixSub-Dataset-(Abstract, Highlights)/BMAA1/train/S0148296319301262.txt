 Using forecasts is a prerequisite for good decision making but often decision makers ignore the forecasts outcomes and rely on their personal assessment . This usually leads to worse decisions . But forecasts can also be defective . Thus it is crucial that decision makers do not rely blindly on forecasts but scrutinize critically the results . The question is under which circumstances decision makers follow or ignore forecasts . Therefore we conducted a laboratory experiment where decision makers have the choice between two alternatives . The forecast provided gives an advice . But it is manipulated so that it is only partly reliable . Results show that participants do not act optimally . Many decision makers follow the manipulated forecast if for example their performance is dominated by the forecast or if they perceive competition . Hence gamifying such research may impact the results that can be to some extent reinforced . However the general meaning is not distorted .

@highlight Experience has no significant influence on the decision making quality.
@highlight Competition improves the decision making process.
@highlight Gamification is useful for the data collection in research.
@highlight Gamification elements may distort the results of research.
