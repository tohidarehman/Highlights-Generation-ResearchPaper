 Corporate social irresponsibility covers a diverse spectrum of wrongdoings ranging from tax evasion to bad working conditions in supply chains . If consumers conclude that a company is responsible for a CSI incident one commonly used regulatory behavior are boycotts . However pressure is mounting that partial responsibility for certain CSI incidents should also lie with customers due to how their consumption demands help drive irresponsible company conduct .

The study at hand focuses on how the novel construct of consumer culpability impacts consumers boycott attitude and which role CSI type specific consumer benefits play . Findings are based on a sample of consumers unaided recall of over 500 unique CSI incidents of 460 companies that were categorized in a stakeholder based typology .
