 Successful gamified systems engage players by eliciting their positive and negative emotions . However prior literature provides little guidance on how to create emotional experiences through gamified design . This paper reviews work in psychology and neuroscience to examine the interactive processes of cognition and emotion and connect them to gamification . More specifically it draws upon a model of the cognitive structure of emotions and the mechanicsdynamicsemotions framework for gamification to advance a cognitiveemotional view of gamification .

@highlight Gamification design should consider positive as well as negative emotions.
@highlight Cognitions and emotions interact to support the instrumental outcomes of gamification.
@highlight Neuroscience can inform gamification design through a cognitive emotional view.
