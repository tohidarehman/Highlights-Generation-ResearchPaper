 This study is based on a longitudinal in depth case study conducted in a Portuguese public sector organization where the accountants adopted a strategic business partner role and promoted the implementation of two new accounting information systems under the context of increasing business competition . Given their role we examined how the implementation processes of such AIS were influenced by the accountants power strategies adopting an organizational power narrative inquiry grounded on the four power dimensions proposed in Hardys framework power over resources power over decision making processes power over meanings and power of the system . As a result this study contributes to the literature available on AIS by discussing the strategic business partner role of accountants in a specific case and by offering new insights into AIS research under the topic of accounting change through the exercise of power . Our research also contributes to the literature on organizational power by providing theoretical developments to Hardys power framework .
