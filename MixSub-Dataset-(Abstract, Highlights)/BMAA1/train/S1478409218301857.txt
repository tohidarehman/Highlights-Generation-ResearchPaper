 The competitive advantage purchasing provides has been debated for decades . For a novel perspective we derive a theoretical framework grounded in the knowledge based view in order to examine how purchasing knowledge and purchasing integration impact cost and strategic performance . The derived hypotheses are tested based on extensive secondary data from a large European multinational utility company . The 179 studied purchasing internal client relationships contain real contracted savings data and internal client ratings of purchasing knowledge purchasing integration and strategic purchasing performance . We show that purchasing knowledge is a major antecedent for both savings and strategic purchasing performance . This effect is further amplified by purchasing integration . With this study we extend the understanding of the purchasing knowledgeperformance link . We conclude that purchasing knowledge becomes particularly valuable when combined with other functions processes through purchasing integration . This causal chain is also supported through general knowledge based view theory . Moreover we provide numerical evidence of the value of knowledge creation and integration processes to purchasing professionals in our managerial implications based on results obtained from actual purchasing savings data .
