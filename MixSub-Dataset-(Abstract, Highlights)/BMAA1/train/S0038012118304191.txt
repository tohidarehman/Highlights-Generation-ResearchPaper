 In the last decade emergency department overcrowding has become a national crisis for the US healthcare system . Increasing mortality rates decreasing quality of care financial losses due to walkouts and ambulance diversion are some of the consequences of ED overcrowding . Given the increasing demand in terms of ambulance utilization being able to assign service requests to EDs efficiently becomes a key function of the emergency medical services . This paper presents new ambulance allocation optimization models to reduce patients total time to treatment waiting times therefore ED overcrowding . Disparities and fairness are considered in the development of the mixed integer programming models . Under a set of assumptions we apply our strategies to allocate 75 ambulance emergencies to 11 EDs in a specific county in Florida . Heterogeneous types of patients demand characteristics and geographical facility information are considered in the models . Based on numerical experiments and the situation in Florida we show that the optimization techniques can be utilized for large problems and result in up to 31 improvement of the current decentralized model . Further analysis reveals the negative or positive impact that the strategies have on each patient giving new insights for future policy modifications . Bi objective single objective and game theory optimization models are implemented in this study .

@highlight We study the national crisis of emergency department overcrowding.
@highlight We develop new strategies to allocate ambulance emergencies to reduce overcrowding.
@highlight We formulate considering fairness system efficiency and patient level impacts.
@highlight We show that the minimization of system total time affects negatively on patients.
@highlight We show that one strategy has desired levels of efficiency and patient outcomes.
