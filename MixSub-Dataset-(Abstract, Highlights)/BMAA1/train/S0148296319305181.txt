 Organizational ambidexterity in a firm is significantly influenced by the behavioural integration of the Top Management Team . Researchers observe that ambidextrous firms are associated with two dimensions of dexterity namely balanced and combined dimensions . However studies do not explain the varied effects of behaviourally integrated TMTs on the different dimensions of ambidexterity . A clear understanding of this relationship will help firms choose the specific TMT processes needed to facilitate specific dimensions of ambidexterity . We address this research gap and test our research model with structural equation analyses on data collected from 78 SMEs . We observe that behavioural integration processes mostly enhance a firm s combined ambidexterity . Further we find that combined ambidexterity completely mediates the relationship between behavioural integration and firm performance . Our study adds to the literature on ambidexterity micro foundations and the theory of behavioural integration and guides small firms in their choices of behavioural and innovation practices .
