 Confirmatory factor analysis has historically been used to develop and improve reflectively measured constructs based on the domain sampling model . Compared to CFA confirmatory composite analysis is a recently proposed alternative approach applied to confirm measurement models when using partial least squares structural equation modeling . CCA is a series of steps executed with PLS SEM to confirm both reflective and formative measurement models of established measures that are being updated or adapted to a different context . CCA is also useful for developing new measures . Finally CCA offers several advantages over other approaches for confirming measurement models consisting of linear composites .

@highlight Guidelines for the proper application of CCA are provided.
@highlight PLSpredict procedure for out of sample prediction with CCA is explained.
@highlight CCA also does not require fit to confirm measurement models.
