 Extant research offers plausible explanations for why and how early internationalizers differ from late internationalizers in terms of learning . However another question remains unexplored what happens after the stage of early growth and how and why do learning modes change as rapidly internationalizing ventures mature and grow particularly in the context of a post transition economy from Central and Eastern Europe region In an attempt to address these questions we analyze in detail the case of twenty five years of evolution of a Polish RIV today an MNC . We offer a conceptual model of the learning modes dynamics in the process of international growth and identify triggers for learning modes shifts .

@highlight The paper investigates what happens beyond the initial stages of a rapidly internationalizing venture RIV .
@highlight Adopting learning based view we traced the transition of an RIV into an MNC in a CEE context.
@highlight We analyze in detail the twenty five year long evolution of an RIV operating in a brick and mortar industry.
@highlight We find that an RIV uses different learning modes typical for accelerated and stage internationalization.
@highlight Our study identifies different learning modes and triggers over the phases of international growth i.e. pre internationalization early internationalization adolescent internationalization and mature internationalization multinationalization .
