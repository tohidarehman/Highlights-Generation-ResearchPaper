 Board level decision makers often fail to understand that a crisis is imminent and to proactively interpret environmental stimuli through their cognitive schemas . Directors have a selective perception of the environment resulting in a filtered and narrowed vision of a crisis this explains why boards often lack proactivity in crisis detection and response . This study draws on qualitative data from interviews with directors chairs and CEOs of medium large companies that were in crisis at the time of the interview or had recently tackled a crisis . We identify three main categories of factors that can hinder directors cognitive schemas individual collective and hybrid constraints . Our research contributes to the cognitive model in a context of uncertainty exploring the mechanisms underpinning board passivity during a crisis . This study has implications for both boards of directors who should re design the ways in which directors respond during crisis situations and the policymakers who support this process .

@highlight Directors act passively during crises they do not proactively interpret the seeds.
@highlight Directors face individual collective and hybrid constraints.
@highlight Individual constraints are a lack of expertise and independence and overconfidence.
@highlight Collective constraints include groupthink short termism and postponing decisions.
@highlight Hybrid constraints comprise low commitment and emotional responses.
