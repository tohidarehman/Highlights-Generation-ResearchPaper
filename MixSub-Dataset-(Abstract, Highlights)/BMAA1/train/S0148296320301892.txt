 Performance based contract is an innovative advanced service strategy for offering product service solutions . PBC aims at increasing customer value and reducing the costs of operations . However manufacturers incur unquantifiable hidden costs while implementing PBC . This paper uses agency theory and service dominant logic to build a theoretical framework to study the hidden costs of PBCs . The research uses a multiple exploratory case study approach to unravel the drivers of hidden costs during the design delivery and adaptation phases of PBC . This paper derives findings from five PBCs from the UK defence industry . The analysis reveals four major hidden cost drivers of PBC . The research refines the theoretical framework by linking the hidden cost drivers PBC life cycle stages and engagement of the service network partners . It develops a set of propositions for guiding future research and managerial practices .

@highlight Hidden cost drivers of implementing advanced solutions are unearthed.
@highlight Multi actor engagement and hidden cost driver interplay is analysed.
@highlight The hidden costs reduce as the actors gain experience to facilitate engagement.
@highlight Agency theory and S D logic are combined to analyse hidden cost drivers.
@highlight A set of research propositions developed to guide research and practice.
