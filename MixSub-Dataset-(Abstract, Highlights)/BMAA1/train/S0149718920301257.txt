 Higher education has always played an important role in promoting economic and social progress . With the rapid development of economy China s higher education has entered a new stage and made a series of extraordinary achievements . However the uneven development of higher education has become a critical factor restricting Chinas overall progress . In this paper we propose Data Envelopment Analysis approach to evaluate the performance of higher education resource utilization from the perspective of provincial level . In addition we assess productivity changes of each province with the help of Malmquist Productivity Index . Further by considering the enrollment quota as a special kind of resource we construct a more reasonable allocation scheme while keeping the total number of newly added enrollment quota unchanged in the next year . Finally according to the results some suggestions are put forward to help the Chinese government better solve the unbalanced development of higher education among provinces .

@highlight DEA is proposed to evaluate the performance of higher education institutions.

@highlight A new data driven approach is proposed to allocate the enrollment quota in higher education.
