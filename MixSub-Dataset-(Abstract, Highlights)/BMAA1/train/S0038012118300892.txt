 In this study a stochastic multi objective mixed integer mathematical programming is proposed for logistic distribution and evacuation planning during an earthquake . Decisions about the pre and post phases of the disaster are considered seamless . The decisions of the pre disaster phase relate to the location of permanent relief distribution centers and the number of the commodities to be stored . The decisions of the second phase are to determine the optimal location for the establishment of temporary care centers to increase the speed of treating the injured people and the distribution of the commodities at the affected areas . Humanitarian and cost issues are considered in the proposed models through three objective functions . Several sets of constraints are also considered in the proposed model to make it flexible to handle real issues . Demands for food blood water blanket and tent are assumed to be probabilistic which are related to several complicated factors and modeled using a complicated network in this study . A simulation is setup to generate the probabilistic distribution of demands through several scenarios . The stochastic demands are assumed as inputs for the proposed stochastic multi objective mixed integer mathematical programming model .

@highlight Stochastic multi objective optimization model is proposed for logistic distribution and evacuation planning.
@highlight Demands are assumed to be probabilistic and estimated using a simulation approach through several scenarios.
@highlight The stochastic optimization model is transformed to its deterministic equivalent using chance constraint programming.
@highlight The model is solved using an efficient epsilon constraint approach and non dominated sorting genetic algorithm NSGA II .
@highlight The proposed optimization model and solution approach are used to handle the case study of Tehran earthquake.
