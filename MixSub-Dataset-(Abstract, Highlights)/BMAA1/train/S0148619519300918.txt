 This paper investigates the international transmission of various sources of uncertainty between the financial sector and the real economy . I focus on calibrating a two country DGSE model with an international financial exposure in the banking sector for the Euro Area and the United States . In particular the model studies the transmission mechanism of macroeconomic monetary policy financial and stock market volatility uncertainty . The model assumes that uncertainty originates in the foreign economy and studies the spillover effect to the domestic economy . The international transmission mechanism is driven by the international financial exposures where domestic banks hold foreign banks assets as a second market activity . The analysis suggests that the spillover effects from foreign uncertainty have in many cases a sizeable and persistent impact on output lending and asset prices . In particular I find that macroeconomic and monetary policy uncertainty drive a global business cycle where uncertainty leads to a drop in home and foreign GDP .
