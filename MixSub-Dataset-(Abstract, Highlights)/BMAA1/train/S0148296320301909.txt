 How might work engagement help predict emotional exhaustion Incorporating the notion that work engagement and emotional exhaustion represent two ends of a continuum we drew on the conservation of resources theorywhich examines them as two distinct constructsto conduct a multicontext two study investigation in the U.S. and China . We proposed that work engagement would increase emotional exhaustion for individuals who rated lower in the conscientiousness personality trait . Furthermore we found a three way interaction whereby work engagement increased emotional exhaustion for less conscientious individuals who were also neurotic or emotionally unstable while conversely decreasing emotional exhaustion for more conscientious individuals who are emotionally stable . Our results also support a moderated mediation model revealing that work engagement decreased counterproductive work behavior as a result of reduced emotional exhaustion when both conscientiousness and emotional stability were high . Implications for future work engagement and counterproductive work behavior research are offered .
