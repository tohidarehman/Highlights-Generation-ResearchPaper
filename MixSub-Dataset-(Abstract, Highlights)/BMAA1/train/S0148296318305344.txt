 Whether neuromarketing methods can add value to marketing research depends on their cost utility ratio and their ability to offer hidden information that can not be obtained using other marketing research methods . Due to the limitations of functional magnetic resonance imaging for real world situations and its high costs the aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of a mobile functional near infrared spectroscopy system . Two experiments dealing with brands and labels are used to discuss how and if neuromarketing can enrich marketing research and to what extent existing limitations and challenges can be overcome .

@highlight Significant differences in activation of prefrontal cortex between different stimuli
@highlight Using mobile functional near infrared spectroscopy fNIRS in marketing
@highlight Higher activation viewing labels and brands compared to non labeled products
@highlight Significantly higher activation when in drinking cola compared to just viewing a picture situations
@highlight Results indicate the feasibility and high potential of mobile fNIRS.
