In addition the moderating role of the observers relationship orientation is examined . Results suggest that compared to competence oriented messages warmth oriented service recovery messages are more likely to enhance observers service perceptions in the online environment leading to satisfaction with service recovery efforts and positive word of mouth intentions . Furthermore relationship orientation serves as a boundary condition in the effect of service recovery strategy on observers service perceptions .
