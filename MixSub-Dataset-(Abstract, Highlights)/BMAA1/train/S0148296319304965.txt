 Although the research on online consumer reviews is broad several important gaps still exist . This paper aims to bridge some of these gaps by studying the influence of positive OCRs on post consumption responses namely attitude toward the firm and repurchase intentions . It differentiates between whether the performance level during consumption was high or low that is whether the product met the objectives set by the consumers . To this end the paper addresses pOCRs in a twofold approach . First it analyzes the effect of positive valence intensity considering neutral indifferent moderately positive and extremely positive OCRs . Second it tests the influence of individuals perceived positivity of OCRs . The results show that the same pOCRs may have a positive or a negative influence on individuals post consumption responses depending on the performance . Accordingly the relationship between perceived positivity and post consumption responses follows U shaped functional forms .

@highlight Positive OCRs and performance jointly influence post consumption responses
@highlight Positive OCRs can have negative effects on post consumption responses
@highlight Relationships between perceived positivity of OCRs and post consumption responses follow curvilinear functional forms
@highlight If the performance is low inverted U shaped relationships are identified
@highlight If the performance is high U shaped relationships are identified
