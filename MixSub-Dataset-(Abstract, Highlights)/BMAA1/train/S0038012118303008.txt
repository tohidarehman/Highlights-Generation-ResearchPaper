 The paper aims to study the effect of spatial interdependence among nearby municipalities on public services efficiency . An empirical analysis on the waste disposal service in 4250 Italian municipalities was carried out to evaluate the efficiency of waste management expenditure once the impact of positive negative externalities of neighbouring local governments on efficiency levels is isolated . From a methodological point of view our study extends the
