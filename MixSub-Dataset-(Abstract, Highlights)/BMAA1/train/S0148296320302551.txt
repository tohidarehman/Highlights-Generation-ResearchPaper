 Many marketers choose to position their brands as underdogs instead of top dogs in the marketplace . Research suggests that underdog positioning may elicit favorable consumer responses although little is known about when it is more effective . To address this gap we examine how personal control influences consumers responses to underdog positioning . Studies 1 and 2 demonstrate that low control consumers prefer brands positioned as underdogs because the passion and determination exemplified in underdog positioning can inspire those consumers to cope with their loss of control . Studies 3 and 4 show that low control consumers relative preference for underdog positioning is moderated by both their shopping orientation and the causal attribution for their loss of control . We discuss the practical implications of these results for effective marketing communications and the theoretical implications for the growing research on underdog positioning and customer inspiration .
