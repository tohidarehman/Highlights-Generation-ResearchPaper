 Regarding the financial support provided to micro and small enterprises deciding whether to prioritize economic benefit or social responsibility is a crucial policy choice especially in developing countries . This paper establishes a new research framework for density of enterprise output value and wages conditional on loans to balance economic benefit and social responsibility . Using data on 9125 Chinese enterprises from January 2015 to December 2017 this paper shows that loans have a range effect on sales revenue and employee payroll which ascends gradually to a plateau and eventually descends . Based on this finding this paper proposes a reallocation scheme . With total loans unchanged fixed sales revenue can increase employee payroll by 3.8 . Similarly fixed employee payroll can increase sales revenue by 5.2 . This study not only provides empirical evidence for financially supporting MSEs but also provides alternative decision support for policy design .

@highlight The study found that the loan to sales revenue and employee wages gradually rose to a stable period and eventually declined.
@highlight A new nonparametric density method is proposed to balance economic effect and social responsibility the loan scale and sales volume remain unchanged increase employee income and vice versa.
