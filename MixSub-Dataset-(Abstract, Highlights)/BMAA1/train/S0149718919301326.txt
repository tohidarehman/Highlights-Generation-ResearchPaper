 The objective of the study was to develop an index which circumvents the need for quantitative measures in evaluating Livestock Development Programmes . This was done through a conceptual framework which integrates indexing and the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework to attain qualitative benefits . The study utilised a cross sectional survey of Kaonafatso ya Dikgomo Scheme participants in KwaZulu Natal Eastern Cape and Limpopo Provinces South Africa as a case . Data were collected through a questionnaire . Multiple sampling methods were used to identify 164 respondents . The results showed low benefits as exhibited by an index of 0.26 . The Scheme showed highest benefits through social capital followed by human natural financial and physical capital respectively . The study concluded that concentrating on income proxies through conventional cost benefit analysis tends to mask the qualitative benefits exhibited by livestock improvement programmes . The theoretical lessons learnt included the exhibition and possibility of measuring qualitative benefits through indexing . Recommendations include further inquiry and refining the construction of the index to circumvent its subjectivity .
