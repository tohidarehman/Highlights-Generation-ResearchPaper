 We examined the effectiveness of direct and indirect advertising . Direct ads openly depict advertised products and brands . In indirect ads the ad message requires elaboration . Eye movements were recorded while consumers viewed direct and indirect advertisements under fixed or unlimited exposure time . Recognition of ads brand logos and preference for brands were tested under two different delays from the ad exposure . The total viewing time was longer for the indirect ads when exposure time was unlimited . Overall ad pictorials received more fixations and the brand preference was higher in the indirect condition . Recognition improved for brand logos of indirect ads when tested after the shorter delay . Consumers experienced indirect ads as more original surprising intellectually challenging and harder to interpret than direct ads . Current results indicate that indirect ads elicit cognitive elaboration that translates into higher preference and memorability for brands .
