 This research aims to contribute to efficiency improvement by providing the implications for decision making on continuous defense R D investment strategies and acquisition methods via analyzing the current position and measuring the efficiency of overall weapon systems on technological competence and operations . This research is distinctive in comparison to previous studies because it is structured in a two stage DEA analysis for efficiency by distinguishing between the technology and operations of the current eight fields of weapon systems and by adding the external index for government competence and market competence . In 2016 in comparison to the year 2013 the eight major weapon systems efficiency fields of the overall system of Korea efficiency of technological competence and efficiency of operations all increased . This research introduced the input and output variable that fits in with the defense industry by connecting the weapon systems efficiency with the national innovation system and the sectoral innovation system that are both projected in this industry . It also formed the concepts of technological competence efficiency and operations efficiency using the two stage Network DEA method .
