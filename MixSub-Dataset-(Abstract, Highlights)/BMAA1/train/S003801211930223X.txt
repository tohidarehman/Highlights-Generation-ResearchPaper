 The Indian food program has encountered a significant shortfall in storage due to slow expansion of storage facilities in comparison with procurement . The open storage of food grains results in substantial loss and deterioration of quality . While increasing storage capacity is a viable but costly and time consuming option the adoption of policies for peak storage reduction would go a long way towards effective food grains management . On this background this study proposes policy adoption for peak storage reduction for effective inventory management . A dynamic simulation model was built by replicating the complex flow process and incorporating the process variability for finding the bottleneck and significant factors . It was found that steep wheat procurement is the critical bottleneck factor for peak storage requirements . Two practical and straightforward yet effective policies are proposed from the few existing strategies for peak storage reduction owing to the constraints associated with the food program . With the actual data of the food program reduction in peak stock was estimated for the recommended policies including the operational cost saving in storage . The practical implications of these policies within the system were also discussed . Through peak reduction the use of open storage can be significantly reduced and this leads to better food grains management for effective food distribution .
