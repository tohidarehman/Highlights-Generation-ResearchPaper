 This paper presents a stochastic optimisation model for locating walk in clinics for mobile populations in a network . The walk in clinics ensure a continuum of care for the mobile population across the network by offering a perpetuation of services along the transportation lines and also establishing referral systems to local healthcare facilities . The continuum of care requirements for different diseases is modelled using coverage definitions that are designed specifically to reflect the adherence protocols for services for different diseases . The risk of not providing the required care under different realisations of health service demand is considered . In this paper for a multi disease multi service environment we propose a model to determine the location of roadside walk in clinics and their assigned services . The objective is to maximise the total expected weighted coverage of the network subject to a Conditional Value at Risk measure . This paper presents developed coverage definitions the optimisation model and the computational study carried out on a real life case in Africa .

@highlight Risk averse stochastic model to locate clinics for mobile populations is proposed.
@highlight Developed novel coverage definitions reflect problem nature s genuine requirements.
@highlight Conditional Value at Risk measure allows control over uncertainties in demand.
@highlight Empirical evidence supporting the model is provided from real life African case.
