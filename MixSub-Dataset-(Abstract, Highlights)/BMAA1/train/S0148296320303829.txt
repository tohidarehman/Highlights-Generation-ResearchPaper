 In this research the authors examine the effect of underdog versus top dog brand positioning on different stages of WOM generation from mental representation to action implementation and the underlying mechanism . Across five experiments the authors find that an underdog positioning leads to higher WOM intention whereas its effect on actual WOM behavior demonstrates a reverse pattern . Additionally the results show that consumer self concepts mediate the relationship between brand positioning and WOM . Moreover the authors find that the consumer lay theory of achievement moderates the effect of brand positioning on WOM behavior in that consumers who hold an incremental theory are more likely to generate WOM for a brand with an underdog positioning . These findings provide contributions to WOM and branding literatures and offer important implications to managers .
