 This paper has explored patients propensity to consume private healthcare services . We based our analysis on the typical tangible and intangible domains of the SERVQUAL and SERVPERF methods . These variables may influence patients decision making when they choose between the public and private sectors . We combined factor analysis and a partial proportional ordered logit model to estimate the probability that a patient would access private healthcare services . To test the main hypotheses we used data from a stratified sample in Sardinia a peripheral region of Italy . Findings revealed that private and public healthcare are substitutes especially for primary specialised services . Patients who used public healthcare frequently and had a low income were unlikely to change to private healthcare or to recommend private services . Responsiveness and perceptions on tangibles were key in determining the probability that a patient would choose and recommend private services . This paper offers a multifaceted framework that can be used in future research to generalise these findings especially in insular regions that are constrained by mobility .

@highlight The propensity to consume private healthcare services is explored.
@highlight The model accounts for socio economic feature and latent variables.
@highlight SERVQUAL SERVPERF domains tangible elements responsiveness reliability assurance and empathy.
@highlight New evidence substitution effects between private and public healthcare services exist.
@highlight Patients choice strongly depend on awareness about their own health status.
