 Current studies suggest mixed effects concerning the impact of the family system on entrepreneurial outcomes . Through the integration of the family embeddedness theory and social exchange theory we further investigate the potential benefits and costs of family support as a social exchange process between entrepreneurs and their family members . We propose that perceived family support can differentially shape well being across different entrepreneurial contexts depending on the nature of the exchange relationship thereby dual effects are anticipated from time based and temporal processes . After analyzing the data gathered from 61 entrepreneurs over 14days we found evidence that high levels of family support attenuate the relationships between the financial stressor and the well being indicators but amplify the relationships between the workload stressor and the well being indicators . These results demonstrate family support process models are central to between person heterogeneity . The theoretical and practical implications are discussed .

@highlight We link social exchange relationships to the family relationships in entrepreneurship.
@highlight Family support have mixed effects on entrepreneurial stressors well being relationships.
@highlight The moderating effects entail more between person heterogeneity than within person heterogeneity.
