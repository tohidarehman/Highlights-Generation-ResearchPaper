 This study examines how firms innovation practices affect ideation and knowledge codification . Building on previous studies of service innovation we develop a hierarchic framework comprising firms innovation activities and related practices . Using survey data on UK legal services firms we then identify the individual practices that contribute to successful ideation and codification . Our study contributes to our understanding of how a structured and organised approach to innovation benefits professional services firms . Beneficial practices include multifunctional working promoting effective team working developing in house research capability having a leadership team committed to innovation and having strong external relationships . Firms with owners from outside the focal services sector in the present case legal services prove more effective at both ideation and knowledge codification . We find little evidence that competition affects innovation suggesting that de regulation initiatives in the legal services sector have to improve if market forces are to operate effectively .
