 University Spin Offs are dynamically involved in the knowledge spillover process and incorporated in the regional entrepreneurial ecosystem . Drawing on the knowledge spillovers related concepts and entrepreneurial ecosystem approach the paper aims to explore the hypothesis that the regional context may partially determine the USOs growth via a cross national analysis and using an interactionist approach . Two samples of Spanish and Italian USOs over the period 20052013 were used and it was applied the multilevel modelling to empirically test the hypotheses . The findings show that regional context affects firm s growth only for Spanish USOs while for the Italian USOs the evidences seem to suggest a not significant determining influence . The paper provides evidence that the region is a critical contextual dimension and an influential factor in building a more explicative research agenda on entrepreneurial universities .

@highlight The regional context explains the firm growth for Spanish USOs both in term of employment and sales growth.
@highlight The region context seems to not produce effects on Italian USOs.
@highlight The Spanish USOs can benefit of being located in certain regions instead of in others.
@highlight An effective regional policy agenda in supporting the development of USOs is required with proactive and coordinated actions.
@highlight A higher engagement of the regional agents both public and private is a critical prerequisite to foster USO growth.
