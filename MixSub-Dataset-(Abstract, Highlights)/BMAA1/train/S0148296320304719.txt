 This study examines whether economic policy uncertainty affects insider trades . Using data from 22 countries I find a positive association between economic policy uncertainty and the frequency and volume of insider trades . Moreover there is a negative relationship between insider trades and future firm performance during periods of high economic policy uncertainty . The effect is larger in firms with a poor information environment firms with less strict monitoring and for firms that are more sensitive to economic policy uncertainty . The findings are robust to alternative sample periods alternative dependent and independent variables different model specifications and after including additional country level factors . Additional analysis suggests that investor sentiment and firm risks increase during periods of high uncertainty . Overall I provide evidence that increased economic policy uncertainty enlarges the information advantage of insiders and increases insider trading .
