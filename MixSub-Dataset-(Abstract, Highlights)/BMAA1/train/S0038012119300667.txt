 Public water providers aim at developing a water supply plan that not only provides a reliable and satisfactory level of service but also is efficient in terms of performance . This paper deals with evaluating the performance of WSPs within the framework of multi component data envelopment analysis . Specifically we consider the overall performance of each WSP as a decision making unit so that economic social hygienic technological managerial and environmental performances of the WSP make up independent components of the defined DMU . To assess the performance of a set of WPSs we propose a multi component enhanced Russell measure of efficiency that takes all sources of inefficiency into account . We show that the proposed measure can be decomposed into individual efficiency measures at component level . This decomposition much enhances the efficiency of computing the proposed measure noting the fact that this measure is obtained by solving a single linear program . It also guarantees the proposed measure to inherit two importantunit invariance and strong monotonicityproperties of the conventional enhanced Russell measure . In our empirical study we apply our model to evaluate the efficiency of 10 urban WSPs in Qom city of Iran . In line with experts practical opinions our findings reveal that the most efficient WSP is to construct a potable water network and separation of non drinking water network for urban usage .
