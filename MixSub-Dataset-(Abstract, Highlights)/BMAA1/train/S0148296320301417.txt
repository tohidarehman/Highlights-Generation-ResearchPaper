 Past research has demonstrated the robustness of order effects in choice . Even high product category knowledge consumers are biased by serial position . Despite this little work has examined how salespersons interactions can influence these effects . This current work focuses on the effect of two common salesperson interactions being guided to evaluate a choice set following an isolation or a pairwise strategy . Results indicate that order effects occur when HCK consumers are guided to follow a pairwise process which is congruent with how they would naturally however these order effects diminish when following an incongruent isolation process . Three experiments test this notion and demonstrate the role of attention in mediating the effect of process congruency on order effects in choice . Contributing to our understanding of decision biases this present research identifies salesperson interventions that can attenuate the likelihood of order effects in choice .

@highlight Order effects are influenced by evaluation questions asked by a salesperson.
@highlight Guiding consumers to follow an incongruent process eliminates order effects.
@highlight Guiding experts to follow a congruent pairwise evaluation process results in order effects.
@highlight Guiding experts to follow an incongruent isolation evaluation process eliminates order effects.
@highlight Incongruent processing increases attention and eliminates order effects.
