 Organizations are increasingly digitalizing the work associated with information exchange by using enterprise social media . However social medias openness to outsider users poses significant challenges to maintaining alignment between social media logic and the dominant organizational logic . Through an in depth longitudinal abductive study of three successive social media implementations in a single organization I explore the process of maintaining social media alignment and its long term consequences on the nature of the work . The paper shows that digitalization exposes the work to continuous adjustment within and across three elements of digital work digital infrastructure work digital strategy work and aligning work . The findings show that despite initial social media alignment through continuous coevolution of these three elements the platform logic underlying digital community work eventually drifted away from supporting the organizations original logic of cohesion to supporting an alternative logic of inclusivity . Accordingly a process model of platform drifting has been developed . By taking a closer look at actual practices the paper contributes to digital work research by identifying distinct elements of digital work involved in social media alignment and illustrates the profound long term consequences of social media on the nature of the work .
