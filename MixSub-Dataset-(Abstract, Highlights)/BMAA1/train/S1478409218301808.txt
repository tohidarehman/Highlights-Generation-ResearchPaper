 In sustainable supply chain management buyers may use intermediaries to bridge exchanges with suppliers when knowledge of suitable sustainability practices is weak and in need of facilitation . Understanding how supply chain intermediaries perform this role and what happens when intermediation is no longer needed is important in establishing more sustainable supply chains . Two supply chain intermediaries have been investigated with the resulting case study evidence analysed using the Gioia methodology . The findings suggest supply chain intermediaries add value to the buyer supplier exchange by facilitating sustainability related information transfer knowledge development risk management and improved capabilities . For example specific practices such as corrective action reports often managed by the intermediary underpin the development of a sustainable supply chain . When the intermediary is no longer needed they become disintermediated from the specific buyer supplier exchange but may be re employed in a new triadic relationship in the future with previous parties . This provides positive spill over effects through intermediationdisintermediationpost intermediation cycles for both the buyer and supplier populations and for broader society . Overall the findings highlight the value of the transient position of supply chain intermediaries in establishing sustainable supply chains and the intended consequences of their involvement .
