 Advanced workplace technologies are increasingly used alongside traditional enterprise software packages in the workplace . However we have only limited understanding of how different kinds of technologies are used to dynamically shape work routines and fluidity in a digital workplace . We conducted an in depth six year study of the use of enterprise resource planning system by a large information technology service provider company . The company used the system to manage its global staffing processes . We explored how the users of this system sought to achieve the fluidity needed to do their work . Our findings show that users balance two patterns of routine performance through different technologies with varying degrees of malleability one to generate fluidity and another to generate stability . We call this process generative balancing . Our research contributes to the literature on workplace technologies and ERP use by providing insights into how the use of technologies with different degrees of malleability helps to craft digital workspaces and enables users to deal with tensions between accomplishing local level performance and realizing corporate level strategic intents .

@highlight Users mobilize IT components with varying degree of malleability to perform routines.
@highlight We call this generative balancing.
@highlight We offer a new perspective on how actors attain fluidity in the local workplace when using ES.
