 This paper is an initial attempt to use a bibliometric approach for an exhaustive literature review of corporate diversification in order to propose a new comprehensive framework for its study . We conduct an in depth analysis of the historical evolution of research over the period 19702017 in six eight year stages shedding light on the main issues in each stage and the links among them using a sample of 1 253 articles . Attention is also paid to the three disciplines in this research stream Strategic Management Economics and Finance . Our analysis reveals how the research on corporate diversification has extended the range of topics addressed and added new theoretical approaches and methodological tools thereby ensuring greater maturity in its development . Emergent and prevailing research streams are identified as they are expected to play a key role in the near future . We conclude by recognizing the need for an integrated theory on corporate diversification .
