Our findings are that ML use big data analytics maturity platform maturity top management support and process complexity are to some extent drivers of ML BV . We also find that platform maturity has to some degree a moderator influence between ML use and ML BV and between big data analytics maturity and ML BV . To the best of our knowledge this is the first research to deliver such findings in the ML field .
