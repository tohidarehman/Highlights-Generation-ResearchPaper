 Although green supplier integration has received widespread attention how it impacts various types of firm performance remains unclear . Based on social capital theory this study explores the influence of green supplier integration on three dimensions of social capital accumulation which further affect economic and environmental performances . To verify the hypotheses we collect two wave survey data from 206 Chinese manufacturers . Results show that green supplier integration significantly affects social capital accumulation . Relational and structural capital accumulations have positive effects on both economic and environmental performances while cognitive capital accumulation only has a positive impact on environmental performance . Additionally relational and structural capital accumulations partially mediate the effects of green supplier integration on economic and environmental performances whereas cognitive capital accumulation only partially mediates the impact of green supplier integration on environmental performance . This research deepens the understanding of how green supplier integration influences firm performance via social capital accumulation and provides a theoretical basis for firms attempting to enhance their performance .
