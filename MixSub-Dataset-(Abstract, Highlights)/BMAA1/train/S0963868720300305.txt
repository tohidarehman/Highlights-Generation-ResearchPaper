 Digital transformation has become a central construct in information systems research . Current conceptualizations largely attribute transformation to intentionality focus on transformation within a single organization or assign technology the role of a disruptive agent of change . Likewise digital tends to be a general category of technology rather than a specific technology enacted in a time and place . Inspired by Schatzkian practice theory and its site ontology we suggest a contextual viewpoint on digital transformation and call it relational digital transformation . We analyzed the change dynamics in the context of taxi dispatch practice in Finland studying the changing taxi dispatch platforms over years . We investigated five powerful industry actors two incumbents two entrants and a federation of taxi entrepreneurs . We identified events of change in the material arrangements in sites and explain the changes through the process dynamics in the focal practice . We define relational digital transformation as a process through which practice arrangement bundles of digital technologies evolve over time . This approach assumes the default nature of an industry is to be found in the changing relations

@highlight Current definitions of digital transformation DT have limitations.
@highlight Relational digital transformation RDT provides a theoretical extension to DT.
@highlight RDT contrasts radically with intentionality and entity centric assumptions of DT.
@highlight RDT is a practice theoretical approach that captures industry level changes.
@highlight RDT does not attribute change agency to any entities
