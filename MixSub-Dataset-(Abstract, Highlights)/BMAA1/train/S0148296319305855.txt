 Companies need to enhance corporate performance by stimulating the links between stakeholder engagement innovation and co creation . Previous literature lacks a systematic and integrative conceptualisation of these factors limiting our understanding of how to leverage stakeholders in innovation and co creation strategies . Based on a systematic literature review this paper presents a discussion on the conceptualisations of stakeholder engagement open innovation and co creation compiles research gaps and further research directions and propose a conceptual model for stakeholder engagement . The model is globally validated through a case study from 22 companies in the wine industry . Findings suggest jointly managing engagement in co creation activities of internal and external stakeholders through several types of antecedents accounting for engagement evolution across time . Among its limitations this research excludes working papers under review and studies not in English . The model validation is circumscribed to ongoing co creation processes involving internal stakeholders and distribution partners .
