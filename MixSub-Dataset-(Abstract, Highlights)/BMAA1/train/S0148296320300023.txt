 This study examines whether non financial performance measures included in CEO bonus contracts are complementary to equity based compensation and whether they jointly explain future firm value . We predict that in a performance evaluation system NFPMs integrated into CEO bonus contracts complement the use of equity based compensation and that they are jointly and positively associated with firms long term value . Consistent with our predictions we find that the inclusion of NFPMs in bonus contracts is positively associated with the relative importance of equity based compensation indicating a complementary relationship between NFPMs and equity based compensation . We also show that equity based compensation is marginally associated with higher future firm value when the firm uses NFPMs in its CEOs bonus contracts . Overall our findings suggest that equity based compensation is more effective in aligning managerial efforts and actions with firms long term value when firms include NFPMs in CEO bonus contracts .
