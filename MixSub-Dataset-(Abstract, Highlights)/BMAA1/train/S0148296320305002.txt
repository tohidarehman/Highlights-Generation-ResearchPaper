 Artificial intelligence is increasingly being adopted by organizations yet implementation is often carried out without careful consideration of the employees who will be working along with it . If employees do not understand or work with AI it is unlikely to bring value to an organization . The purpose of this paper is to investigate the ways in which employees and AI can collaborate to build different levels of sociotechnical capital . Accordingly we develop a model of AI integration based on Socio Technical Systems theory that combines AI novelty and scope dimensions . We take an organizational socialization approach to build an understanding of the process of integrating AI into the organization . Our framework underscores the importance of AI socialization as a core process in successfully integrating AI systems and employees . We conclude with a future research agenda that highlights the cognitive relational and structural implications of integrating AI and employees .

@highlight Artificial Intelligence AI differs from other technology adoption processes.
@highlight AI adopters should consider cognitive relational and structural complexities.
@highlight These complexities require social processes to integrate AI with employees.
@highlight We offer a systematic socialization framework to integrate AI.
@highlight Successful integration of AI and employees may result in sociotechnical capital.
