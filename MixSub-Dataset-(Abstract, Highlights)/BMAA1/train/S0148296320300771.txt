 Although initial public offering survival is a well studied phenomenon the combinations of organizational orientations and strategic emphases that lower the odds of IPO failure remain less studied . Due to the resource intensive nature of these orientations and the limits of managerial attention committing to an orientation and a conducive strategic emphasis may be important to IPO survival . We ask whether post IPO firms relying on market orientation and strategic emphasis on advertising have higher odds of survival than those relying on entrepreneurial orientation and strategic emphasis on research and development . In a sample of U.S. IPOs we find that MO significantly improves the odds of IPO survival and greater strategic emphasis on value appropriation further improves the odds of IPO survival . However greater strategic emphasis on value creation and EO have no influence on IPO survival .

@highlight Market orientation MO is positively associated with IPO survival.
@highlight Entrepreneurial orientation EO is positively associated with IPO survival.
@highlight Strategic emphasis on advertising strengthens MO IPO survival relationship.
@highlight Strategic emphasis on R D has no impact on EO IPO survival relationship.
@highlight Early stage public firms should balance strategic orientation and emphasis.
