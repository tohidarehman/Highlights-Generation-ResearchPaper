 This paper describes some of the main challenges of evaluating complex interventions as well as the implications of such challenges for evaluation capacity building . It discusses lessons learned from a case study of an evaluation of Dancing with Parkinsons an organization that provides dance classes to people with Parkinsons disease in Toronto Canada . These implications are developed from a realist evaluation lens . Key lessons include the need to develop skills to understand program mechanisms and contexts recognize multiple models of causality apply mixed method designs and ensure the successful scaling up and spread of an intervention .

@highlight The methodological challenges of evaluating complex interventions and what it means for evaluation capacity building are discussed.
@highlight Evaluators need to learn to answer not only the question does a program work but also the question what is it about a program that makes it work .
@highlight Understanding the programs context and mechanisms is important.
@highlight Some methodological lessons from evaluating Dancing with Parkinsons are discussed.
@highlight There may be value in thinking more deliberatively about the differences in skills and knowledge needed to evaluate evaluations of different levels of complexity.
