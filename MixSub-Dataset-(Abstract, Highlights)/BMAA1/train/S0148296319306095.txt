 This paper explores the mechanism by which relational governance affects product innovation and the moderating role of legal and technological appropriability mechanisms . An empirical study of questionnaire survey data on 121 high tech platform leading firms in China found that the two dimensions of relational governance have different impacts on product innovation . Joint planning positively affects product innovation while joint problem solving exhibits an inverted U shaped relationship with product innovation . Second while the appropriability mechanism plays a moderating role in the above process there are differences in the moderating roles played by different appropriability mechanisms . Intellectual property rights strengthen the impact of joint planning on product innovation while contracts and interface standardization weaken the inverted U shaped relationship between joint problem solving and product innovation .

@highlight For leading firms platform relational governance does not follow the more the better prototype.
