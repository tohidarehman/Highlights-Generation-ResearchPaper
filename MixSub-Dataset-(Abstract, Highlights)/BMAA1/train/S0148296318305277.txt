 The success of gamified systems depends on how user characteristics and behavior interact with system design . Prior research however has largely neglected this user system interaction thus limiting our understanding of gamification design . To addresses this limitation in the current literature we investigate how users trait competitiveness is related to the usage intention of a competitive gamified system . Based on our theoretical model we hypothesize and test both direct and indirect effects as well as whether and how system design moderates the effects of trait competitiveness . Results from structural equation modeling demonstrate an indirect only mediated relationship between trait competitiveness and usage intention through perceived enjoyment . Moreover we show evidence that this mediated relationship interacts with system design such that the relationship is strengthened when a team based vs. a player based leaderboard is employed . Our findings show the importance of designing gamified systems that provide appropriate user system fit .
