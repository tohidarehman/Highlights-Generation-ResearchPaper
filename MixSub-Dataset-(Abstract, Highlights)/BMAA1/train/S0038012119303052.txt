 The high speed rail of China has developed and expanded rapidly and made great achievements in the past twenty years . The ongoing HSR plan is expected to have a significant impact on the urban economy and spatial structure in China . However relevant data driven research is still lacking . Traditional data collection approaches such as field surveys are costly to assure the accuracy of materials . In this study a new remote sensing perspective of night time light was adopted to observe the long term impact of the HSR on cities along the rail . More specifically we investigated the impact of the BeijingGuangzhou High Speed Railway on urban economic development by using night time light data from 2002 to 2018 . Such a line connects the capital and southern China and lies on the most important geographic axis of the country . Our results find that the construction of BGHSR line has a considerable positive impact on economies of first tier cities and new first tier cities but also hurt some second tier and third tier cities such as Baoding and Handan . Generally the spatial economic pattern of cities along the BGHSR line has been rapidly reshaped with the change of the transportation system . Each city needs to reconsider its role and value in the coming regionalization process to adapt to the national strategy .
