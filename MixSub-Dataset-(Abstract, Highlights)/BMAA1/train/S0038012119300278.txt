 The objectives and implementation of environmental remediation and regeneration of brownfield sites have evolved over the years . Today the intertwining of environmental economic and social issues related to the reuse of these sites is more apparent than in previous years thus the interconnectedness of these issues is now more considered in the remediation and regeneration of brownfield sites . The implications of environmental remediation and regeneration activities have broadened leading to different and often contrasting interests among the stakeholders involved in these activities . In this study we analyzed the role of private and public stakeholders in the remediation and regeneration of a brownfield site in Porto Marghera Italy . We also examined the influence of the brownfield s site specific features on its own remediation and regeneration . By adopting a multi tiered approach including first a desktop analysis and second in depth interviews and a multi criteria decision analysis we identified factors that if present or improved could enhance the attractiveness of the area to developers and foster the site s redevelopment .
