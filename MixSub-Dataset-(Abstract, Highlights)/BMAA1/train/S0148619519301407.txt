 In this paper we perform a meta analysis of 736 estimates extracted from 31 previous studies to compare China and Eastern Europe from the viewpoint of the relationship between corporate ownership and managerial turnover . Our results strongly suggest the presence of asymmetric circumstances between the two . Namely in Eastern Europe private outside investors and large shareholders exert a positive influence on the managerial discipline of the companies they invest in and the government is also actively involved in the corporate governance of state owned enterprises . In contrast the Chinese government and the Communist Party of China have such significant control over companies as corporate owners that private shareholders only have limited influence over top management . In this sense Chinese firms are more likely than their East European counterparts to face greater problems in corporate governance .
