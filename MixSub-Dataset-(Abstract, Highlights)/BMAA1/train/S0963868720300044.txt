 Researchers and practitioners have long believed that information technology is a key tool for fostering innovation . However there is a certain inconsistency in the literature which makes it challenging for researchers to figure out exactly how and why IT plays such a pivotal strategic organizational role . The motivation for this research is the multiple contradictory results reported by studies investigating the influence of information technology on organizational innovation . This study utilizes a fit based perspective in an attempt to disentangle these contradictions . Using Venkatramans seminal paper on fit we conceive of two critical fit based concepts

@highlight Three fundamental IT affordances in an organization namely collaborative affordance organizational memory affordance and process management affordance are considered.
@highlight These affordances harmonically coalign to produce the overall harmonic IT affordance HITA of the organization.
@highlight HITA is actualized by organizational courage to produce two forms of innovation exploratory and exploitative.
@highlight The effect of actualized HITA is higher on exploratory innovation than exploitative innovation.
@highlight Exploitative innovation leads to exploratory innovation.
@highlight Two studies one in US and the other in China lend support for our theory.
