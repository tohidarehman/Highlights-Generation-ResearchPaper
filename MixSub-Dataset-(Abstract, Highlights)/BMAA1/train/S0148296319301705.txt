Results show that people prefer BOGO deals and they tend to choose them over price reductions even when the deals are equal in terms of net value . The preference is amplified when the discount is relatively high In these cases BOGO deals attract more attention than percentage deals . Overall our findings can help retailers develop promotional strategies to capture potential consumers attention in online commerce . At the same time our results warn consumers to better evaluate their options and not be lured by the first BOGO deal that captures their attention as it might not be the best deal available .
