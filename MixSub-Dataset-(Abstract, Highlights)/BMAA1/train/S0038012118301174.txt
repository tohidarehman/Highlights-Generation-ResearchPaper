 In this work we investigate how European countries belonging to EU15 are performing in terms of the quality and equity of their educational systems . To do so we jointly analysed student competencies in mathematics and reading using data collected in four different waves by the Program for International Student Assessment run by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development . The aim of this analysis is twofold to assess the associations between students competencies inmathematics and reading and their socioeconomic status and to investigate how this relationship varies across countries over time to present a batch of adjusted indicators relevant to the investigation of educational performance over time in terms of quality and equity . We fitted a mixed effect regression model with a bivariate latent structure and random intercepts and slopes to assess the effect of socioeconomic and cultural background on student competencies across countries over time and to assess the performance trajectories of EU15 countries with respect to European Commission benchmarks . We present and discuss our main findings and their implications in terms of the policies of EU15 countries .

@highlight Using four waves of PISA data we investigate how European countries belonging to EU15 are performing in terms of the quality and equity of their educational systems.
@highlight We built up a batch of adjusted indicators to compare education systems over time.
@highlight We adopted a level 4 mixed effect multilevel regression model with a bivariate latent structure and random intercepts and slopes.
@highlight Findings and their implications are discussed in terms of the policies of EU15 countries.
