 Although healthcare is one of the fastest growing sectors in the world it faces crucial shortages in human resource availability and retention . This challenge is worsened in social enterprises . In this research we build on a multimethod and a multistudy approach . In the first study using an exploratory qualitative study we identify HR practices that influence HR acquisition and retention . Utilizing an institutional logics lens we propose that market logic and community logic driven HR practices influence a firm s ability to acquire and retain HR . In the second study we test our hypotheses using primary data from 182 faith based hospitals in India and a robust empirical model accounting for endogeneity . We find that while market logic driven HR practices help with HR acquisition community logic driven HR practices help with HR retention . In the third study through a simple field experiment we showcase that indeed market and community logic based HR practices are responsible for HR acquisition and retention .
