 In care physical activity initiatives primary care and sports are combined to stimulate PA among adults at risk of lifestyle related diseases . Preliminary results from Dutch care PA initiatives for adults with a low socioeconomic status indicate a decrease in participants body weight and an improved quality of life however the elements that make these initiatives successful are yet to be identified . In total 19 Dutch health promotion experts participated in our concept mapping of the effective elements of care PA initiatives for adults with a low SES . The experts identified 111 effective elements of these initiatives which were grouped into 11 clusters focusing on 1 approaching participants within the care PA initiative 2 barriers experienced throughout the initiative 3 long term implementation 4 customizing the care PA initiative to the target population 5 social support 6 structure and guidance 7 the professionals within the care PA initiative 8 the accessibility of the care PA initiative 9 targeted behaviour and progression 10 recruitment and administration and 11 intersectoral collaboration . CM was useful for creating a valuable overview of these effective elements . Our results could be used to improve the development and implementation of future care PA initiatives for adults with a low SES .

@highlight Concept mapping enables the unravelling of effective elements in care PA initiatives.
@highlight This research contributes to developing a framework to classify effective elements.
@highlight When using effective elements the initiatives context must be taken into account.
