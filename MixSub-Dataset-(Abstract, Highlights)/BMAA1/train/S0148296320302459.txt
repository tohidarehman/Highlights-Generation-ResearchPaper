 Market entry timing which is also known as entry order has been proven to significantly influence firm performance under different circumstances . The inherent nature of the online context and IT services complicates the relationship between entry timing and firm performance . This study empirically examined entry timing effects in the online IT service market and the moderating effects of market characteristics . With a unique dataset collected from an online IT service platform we discovered that entry timing has a U shaped effect on firm performance both early and late entry resulted in superior performance to that of intermediate entry . We also revealed that market growth moderates these curvilinear entry timing effects with both early and late entrants benefiting more in high growth markets than they did in low growth markets . The results of this research enrich the relevant entry timing theories by examining entry timing effects in emerging marketplaces and the contingencies of markets .
