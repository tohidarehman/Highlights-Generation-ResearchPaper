 Survey evidence suggests that firms are insufficiently aware of newly introduced R D support measures due to the complexity of the public support landscape . As a result adoption is slow and incomplete which implies that eligible firms leave money on the table . We hypothesize that a key coping mechanism involves firms relying on their peers behaviour to inform their own adoption decision . We test this hypothesis by analysing firms first use of a newly introduced R D tax exemption scheme in Belgium . We identify endogenous peer effects in industry and location based peer groups by exploiting the intransitivity in firms networks as well as variation in peer group size . The results show that firms decisions to use R D tax exemptions are influenced by the choices of their peers primarily in the time window immediately following their introduction . The findings suggest that the efficacy of R D policy can be improved by accounting for the structure of firm networks in the communication of new support initiatives .

@highlight Firms usage of R D tax exemptions is influenced by their peers decisions.
@highlight Peer effects occur within industry and location based firm clusters.
@highlight Take up of innovation support may be increased by more targeted communication.
