 The need for efficient blood supply is of more significance in the event of disasters when there is a lack of coordination between distribution and inventory management . The recent earthquake in Kermanshah province in Iran is among such cases that confirmed the need for coordinating such schedules . In this respect a two stage stochastic programming approach is presented for planning supply of blood after disasters that can assist in inventory decisions under hybrid uncertainty minimizing the shortage and wastages . The uncertainty stems from imprecise parameters and scenario variability and a robust fuzzy stochastic programming approach is devised to hedge against the uncertainty . The perishability of blood the substitutability of blood groups and the age based characteristic of blood are taken into account to make the model more reliable . The compromise programming is applied to solve the multi objective model . The results illustrate that the RFSP model can make a reasonable trade off between mean value feasibility robustness and optimality robustness which results in a robust and reliable solution under disastrous conditions .
