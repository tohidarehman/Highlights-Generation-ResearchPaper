 This research aims to analyze management and innovation patterns among micro and small businesses that participated during 20152016 in the Local Innovation Agents Program from the Brazilian Micro and Small Business Support Service . Complemented by factor analyses two step cluster analysis was applied on 6674 MSBs management dimensions to identify group patterns and statistical tests explored further cluster differences regarding management and innovation dimensions besides innovation improvement throughout the program . Results were multifaceted . First complementary factor analyses showed that management dimensions compose one factor with similar loadings thus in accordance with their predictive importance found in the cluster analysis . Second two main clusters were identified in terms of management level which also presented significant differences regarding innovation levels . Third considering a before and after self comparison by and large innovation was significantly improved by both clusters . Fourth the highest developed cluster presented higher improvement rates in most innovation dimensions thus benefiting more from the program except for two marketing related innovations which improved similarly by both clusters . Overall even though the LIA Program was effective to leverage MSBs innovation higher efficiency rates would be bounded to fewer participating MSBs and hence policy planners should be aware of this tradeoff .

@highlight Two clusters identified differ significantly as to management and innovation levels.
@highlight All clusters significantly improved innovation in a before and after self comparison.
@highlight The high level cluster improved innovation significantly more than the low level one.
@highlight Marketing innovation dimensions improved similarly independent from management level.
@highlight Policymakers face a tradeoff between higher efficiency and lower program coverage.
