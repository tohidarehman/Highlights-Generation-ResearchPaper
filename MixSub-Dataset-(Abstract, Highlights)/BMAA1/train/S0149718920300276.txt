 The overlap of competencies between general program evaluation and specific contexts or content will always be reality because evaluators may need unique competencies to answer evaluation questions for particular contexts or content areas . Limited research exists that explores the essential competencies required by professionals who use evaluation as one part of their job portfolio which leaves unanswered questions regarding the applicability of current evaluator competency models in such settings . We used a modified three round Delphi technique to identify evaluator competencies for non formal educators in Cooperative Extension . Our panelists identified 36 competencies in the non formal educational programming context for CE educators that they considered important to be included in evaluation capacity building efforts . We categorized our 36 identified competencies from the Delphi study into the five competency domains proposed by the American Evaluation Association . Our findings provide information to help guide professional development among non formal educators related to program evaluation .
