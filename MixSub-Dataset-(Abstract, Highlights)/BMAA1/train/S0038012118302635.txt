 To improve the coordination of blood supply and demand the efficient design of the blood supply chain network is a proper strategy . In this regard this paper is the first ever study to strive for a simultaneous investigation on three interdependent challenges of the BSCN donors motivation optimizing location and capacity decisions and controlling the reliability and robustness of the network under combinatorial risk . As in reality blood donors play a critical role in the BSC this study undertakes motivational initiatives to encourage blood donors for maintaining sufficient blood supply . Advertisement education and medical credits are the directions incorporated to construct the motivational function . To observe the efficiency as the most critical factor while evaluating the pool of location alternatives for establishing facilities an augmented version of data envelopment analysis is utilized . In addition a mixed integer programming model is proposed by which the simultaneous location and capacity decisions are supported . The model is also extended to handle the combinatorial risk of uncertainty as well as disruption . Thus a novel mixed possibilistic stochastic flexible robust programming is developed . Eventually the proposed model is implemented in a real case study to assess its practicality and then provide applicable insights for administrators .
