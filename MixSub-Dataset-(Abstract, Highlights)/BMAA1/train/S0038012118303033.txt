 This paper proposes a latent class path model to analyse the intention to move house as a function of residential satisfaction which in turn is influenced by the gap between residential aspirations and reality . Different from the existing literature which assumes the same structural dependencies apply to all residents with different socio demographic profiles we allow for different unobserved classes with different structural dependencies . Class membership is a function of the socio demographics of individuals . Using data from eight renovated historical blocks in two Chinese cities the differences influencing the intention to move house between two latent classes are captured . In one class the intention to move is significantly influenced by housing and environmental satisfaction but this dependency is not found in the other class . The impact of the residential gap on satisfaction also differs between the two classes . Class membership is found to be mainly attributed to having property rights or not and whether respondents are supporting the elderly . Policy and planning implications are provided considering the different residential interests and backgrounds of residents .

@highlight The first integrated model that can identify the unobserved heterogeneity among individuals is raised in the residential field.
@highlight A clear difference is found between two groups of residents while forming the intention to move.
@highlight Policy and planning implications targeted to specific groups of people are provided considering their residential interests and social demographic backgrounds.
