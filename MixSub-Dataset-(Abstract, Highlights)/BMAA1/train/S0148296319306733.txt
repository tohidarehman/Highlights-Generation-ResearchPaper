 This study builds upon the literature around tensions conflicts and mission drift in social enterprises to provide a clearer understanding of how SEs position themselves and which strategies can more effectively prevent a shift toward pure social or pure commercial outcomes . We conducted an in depth investigation of 10 SEs in Italy and the UK contextualized in the food and beer industries . We produced a theoretical framework shedding light on the possible strategies to deal with sources of conflict and applied a csQCA to identify the most effective combination of strategies in preventing mission drift mixed ownership and financial resource mobilization . We discuss that differences between the countries emerged due to some of the paradoxes of SEs in these industries . This is seemingly the first study adopting a csQCA in such a context and it proved to be suitable for studying social entrepreneurship in homogenizing variables hardly comparable otherwise .

@highlight Italian SEs tend to adopt selective coupling as a strategy to deal with tensions.
@highlight Italian SEs show a prevalence of pure social logic enactment.
@highlight UK SEs adopt combining strategies most effectively preventing mission drift.
@highlight Combining alternative strategies for ownership and financial resource mobilization can prevent mission drift.
@highlight Alternative strategies for goals governance and inter organizational relationships are necessary conditions to reach the outcome.
