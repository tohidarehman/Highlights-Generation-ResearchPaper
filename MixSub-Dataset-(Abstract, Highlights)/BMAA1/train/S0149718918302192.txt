 Value for Money is an evaluative question about the merit worth and significance of resource use in social programs . Although VfM is a critical component of evidence based programming it is often overlooked or avoided by evaluators and decision makers . A framework for evaluating VfM across the dimensions of economy effectiveness efficiency and equity has emerged in response to limitations of traditional economic evaluation . This framework for assessing VfM integrates methods for engaging stakeholders in evaluative thinking to increase acceptance and utilization of evaluations that address questions of resource use . In this review we synthesize literature on the VfM framework and position it within a broader theory of Utilization Focused Evaluation . We then examine mechanisms through which the VfM framework may contribute to increased evaluation use . Finally we outline avenues for future research on VfM evaluation .

@highlight The VfM framework helps synthesize evidence across the dimensions of economy effectiveness efficiency and equity.
@highlight Linking methods for evaluating VfM to principles of UFE can address specific limitations of traditional economic evaluation practices.
