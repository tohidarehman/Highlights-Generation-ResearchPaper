 In todays hypercompetitive environment it is critical for manufacturing firms to be agile in responding to ephemeral opportunities in the marketplace . This agility often requires the collaboration with supply chain partners . However how a manufacturing firm collaborates with its suppliers to achieve agility remains an understudied issue . This study holds that manufacturing firms and their suppliers need to develop manufacturer supplier flexibility accompanied with well built integrated information systems and associated analytical systems to enable manufacturer agility . To deepen our understanding of the roles of manufacturer supplier flexibility and IOS technologies in facilitating manufacturer agility we build and test a model based on the real options theory and bounded rationality . Based on 141 matched pair samples of Taiwanese manufacturing firms our findings demonstrate the importance of manufacturer supplier flexibility in achieving higher manufacturer agility wherein IOS integration enables better flexibility . We also show IOS enabled analytical ability can strengthen the effect of such flexibility on manufacturer agility . Implications of the results for practices and academics are provided .
