 Real options theory is applied widely to the study of MNEs international expansions . This stream of research views the MNE as a network that incorporates a portfolio of options to maximize return in changing environmental conditions . In this study we examine whether and how flexibility benefits of multinationality influence MNEs ability to sustain superior performance . From a real options valuation perspective our findings indicate that the composition of the MNEs affiliates portfolios influences aggregate value of individual options . We empirically test our theoretical framework using a comprehensive panel dataset of 134 U.S. manufacturing MNEs and their foreign affiliates from 2004 to 2012 . Our findings suggest that institutional diversity of the host country portfolio moderates the relationship between multinationality and superior performance persistence and the effect shows an inverted U shape .

@highlight Multinationality provides flexibility for MNEs to avoid unfavorable events.
@highlight A high level of multinationality is associated with superior performance persistence.
@highlight Both costs and benefits exist for multinationality.
@highlight MNEs host country institutions influence their performance persistence.
@highlight The diversity of MNEs portfolio influences their flexibility.
