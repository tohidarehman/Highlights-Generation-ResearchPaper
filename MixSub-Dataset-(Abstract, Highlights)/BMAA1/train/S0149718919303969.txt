 Policymakers demand for increased accountability has compelled organizations to pay more attention to internal evaluation capacity building . The existing literature about ECB has focused on capacity building experiences and organizational research with limited attention on challenges that internal evaluation specialists face in building organizational evaluative capacity . To address this knowledge gap we conducted a Delphi study with evaluation specialists in the United States Cooperative Extension Service and developed a consensus on the most pervasive ECB challenges as well as the most useful strategies for overcoming ECB challenges . Challenges identified in this study include limited time and resources limited understanding of the value of evaluation evaluation considered as an afterthought and limited support and buy in from administrators . Alternatively strategies found in the study include a shift in an organizational culture where evaluation is appreciated buy in and support from administration clarifying the importance of quality than quantity of evaluations and a strategic approach to ECB . The challenges identified in this study have persisted for decades meaning administrators must understand the persistence of these issues and make an earnest investment to make noticeable progress . The Delphi approach can be used more often to prioritize ECB efforts .
