 Firms hold excess resources known as slack that could be valuable as the environment becomes more complex . This article provides evidence on how higher environmental complexity alters the slack performance relationship in the long run by introducing three types of effects the efficiency effect the profitability effect and the incentives effect . After measuring those effects on a panel of Colombian firms we show that firms implement multiple and simultaneous purposeful actions on organizational slack to compete in more complex environments . Depending on the slack type complexity can encourage the efficient use of slack it can alter the incentives to hold slack and it can change the profitability of slack . Those results could be used to answer how efficient or profitable are firms levels of slack and if they have higher incentives to accumulate more slack .

@highlight Firms have incentives to accumulate or not slack resources depending on the environmental complexity.
@highlight Firms require lower levels of available slack to maximize firm performance in more complex environments.
@highlight Slack resources can affect either positively or negatively firm performance.
