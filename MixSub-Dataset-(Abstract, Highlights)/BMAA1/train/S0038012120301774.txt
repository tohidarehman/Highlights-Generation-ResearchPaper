 Pandemic influenza is a regularly recurring form of infectious disease this work analyses its economic effects . Like many other infectious diseases influenza pandemics are usually of short sharp duration . Human coronavirus is a less regularly recurring infectious disease . The human coronavirus pandemic of 2019 has presented with seemingly high transmissibility and led to extraordinary socioeconomic disruption due to severe preventative measures by governments . To understand and compare these events epidemiological and economic models are linked to capture the transmission of a pandemic from regional populations to regional economies and then across regional economies . In contrast to past pandemics COVID 19 is likely to be of longer duration and more severe in its economic effects given the greater uncertainty surrounding its nature . The analysis indicates how economies are likely to be affected due to the risk modifying behaviour in the form of preventative measures taken in response to the latest novel pandemic virus .
