 We analyze technical progress in the Brazilian agriculture in the period 19762016 . Output is production value and inputs are expenses on land labor and other inputs . Data Envelopment Analysis measures are used to capture technological progress via efficiency analysis . Filtering the data with a moving average and fractional regression we identify four periods with distinct behavior of technical efficiency under constant or decreasing returns to scale . From 1976 to 1988 and from 1996 to 2007 technical efficiency decreases at statistically significant rates of 1.74 and 0.26 respectively . From 1989 to 1995 and from 2008 to 2016 efficiency increases at statistically significant rates of 1.53 and 1.75 respectively . Efficiency of input use varies in these periods and is computed as a byproduct of the DEA analysis . We observe a more efficient usage of land and other inputs . A parametric fit using adjusted efficient inputs indicate the relative elasticities of 40.5 38.5 and 21.0 for other inputs land and labor respectively . Technological progress increases 3.73 in the period 19761988 decreases 1 58 between 1989 and 1995 increases 0.17 in the period 19962007 and increases 1.01 between 2008 and 2016 . Technological inputs are statistically significantly influential on total factor productivity as indicated by an infinite distributed lag model . The long run elasticity effect is 39.5 . The effect of investments in agricultural research has a significant elasticity of 0.835 .

@highlight We investigate Brazilian agricultural production productivity and technological progress in the period 1976 2016.
@highlight The basic concept allowing frontier estimation as well the marginal analysis of input efficiencies is DEA time series.
@highlight Four break points in the evolution of the expected conditional mean of a centered moving average of the DEA scores.
@highlight The optimum input levels require less use of land and high levels of technology labor is intermediary.
@highlight The effect of investments public in agricultural research is assessed via a regression analysis.
