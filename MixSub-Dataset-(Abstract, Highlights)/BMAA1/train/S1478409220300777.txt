Scenarios are particularly effective for considering how the complex interaction of macro environmental factors affects the PSM context avoiding incremental thinking surfacing assumptions and revealing significant blind spots . PSM research using scenarios aligns with Corley and Gioia s call for prescience oriented research in which academics aim for more impactful research enhancing sense giving potential and theoretical relevance to practice to better perform their adaptive role in society .
