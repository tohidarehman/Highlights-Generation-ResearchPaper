 This paper deals with the productivity index based on Hicks Moorsteen productivity index for analysis of Stock Exchange firms . In this paper a decomposition of Hicks Moorsteen productivity index is provided that uses data envelopment analysis models . On the other hand it is offered a new interpretation and decomposition for components of HM productivity index that in previous studies were not performed any interpretation of it . These components have named the output production and the input consumption in terms of changing the efficiency frontier . In addition by comparing the components of HM productivity index and productivity value the optimal values of output production and input consumption are determined . Also the analysis is determined how to identify the optimal value of a firm over a period of time . The proposed approach is applied to 26 pharmaceutical manufacturers that are from Tehran Stock Exchange . Data have been collected for six consecutive years and have been considered financial ratios for evaluating companies . The results show that the Hicks Moorsteen productivity index is more able to provide managerial aspects than other productivity indexes such as the Malmquist productivity index .
