 Bioplastics represent an innovation for replacing materials obtained from fossil fuels and could provide significant benefits to the environment . A new generation of bioplastic from urban waste is now technically feasible . This paper is among the first to assume the perspective of the consumers rather than the manufacturers in addressing what could lead to the market acceptance of this particular type of bioplastic . A conceptual model is developed addressing psychological drivers that could encourage consumers transition from a linear to a circular economy with the purpose of better understanding what drives consumers intentions to switch to and purchase products obtained from organic waste . Specifically we find that green self identity positively impacts perceived value leading to higher behavioral intention . In addition the relationship is moderated by self congruity but not by differences in product involvement .

@highlight We address a new generation of bioplastic from organic waste for a circular economy.
@highlight We investigate what drives the intention to shift from linear to circular economy.
@highlight We focus on green self identity self congruity perceived value intention to switch.
@highlight Green self identity impacts perceived value leading to switching intention.
@highlight Self congruity moderates the green self identity perceived value relationship.
