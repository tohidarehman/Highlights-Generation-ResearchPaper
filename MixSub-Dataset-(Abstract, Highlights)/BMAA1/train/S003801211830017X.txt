 One of the most influential measures of multidimensional well being the Better Life Index launched by OECD in 2011 contains a detailed overview of the social economic and environmental performances of different countries . Since its launch a relevant number of empirical studies have been proposed on these data but the role played by the distance between societal priorities and country level performance in Better Life Index as well as in multidimensional well being remains underexplored . We propose to address this issue by means of a multidimensional spatial model . We position the countries in the Euclidean K dimensional space in which each dimension is a specific aspect of well being and we consider each individual s opinion on the same dimensions to calculate the personal optimal point . The distance between the optimal point of well being and the actual observed point at individual level is the individuals loss in well being . We show that the societal loss at country level is negatively related to the overall well being and the main indices of quality of democracy . Based on the above evidence we would argue that a multidimensional spatial framework represents a promising tool for the analysis of the whole class of multidimensional measures of well being in which a group of individuals expresses the weights individually assigned to a set of dimensions within a pre established range .

@highlight A multidimensional spatial model is proposed to evaluate multidimensional well being.
@highlight The distance between countries profiles and individual s opinion is interpreted as loss of well being.
@highlight Societal losses are negatively correlated to well being and quality of democracy.
@highlight Multidimensional spatial model is a promising framework for well being assessment.
