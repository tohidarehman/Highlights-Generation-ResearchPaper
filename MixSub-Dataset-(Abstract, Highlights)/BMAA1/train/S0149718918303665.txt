 This study explored feasibility and fidelity of an education program for parents with intellectual disability . The Australian Parenting Young Children intervention was translated and adapted for support workers in the Swedish social services . Fidelity was examined using implementation diaries tracking frequency of implementation of program activities and teaching approaches . Eighteen of these support workers and their managers Results showed that implementation of Parenting Young Children was feasible with overall positive attitudes to Evidence Based Practice good program compatibility low perceived program complexity and high satisfaction with implementation support . The fidelity measures suggest problems in how the program is used by some support workers parents received less than the recommended number of sessions and activities such as observation of parents and follow up were infrequently used by support workers . The findings raise questions about how program support and education should be provided . Difficulties in defining fidelity within the flexibility of the Parenting Young Children program are also discussed .

@highlight PYC appears to have good compatibility for the Swedish context.
@highlight Practitioners were satisfied with implementation support they received.
@highlight Some aspects of the program were excluded by practitioners e.g. clarification of roles observation .
@highlight On average parents received half of the recommended number of monthly PYC sessions.
@highlight There is a need to define program fidelity and identify key program ingredients in PYC.
