 In the last decades supply chains have increasingly transcended national boundaries developing into global supply chains . Along with the many opportunities arising from international sourcing and the extended commercial presence over the world the management of a globally dispersed supply chain is highly complex . A key issue to consider when dealing with the global supply chain design is the location of facilities not only with respect to firms owned facilities but also the supply and distribution side as factors that affect supply chain complexity and operational performance . This paper sets out a methodological framework to characterize the geographical configuration of a firm s suppliers and retailer networks . Quantitative indexes of network spatial concentration and relative proximity measures based on a nonparametric kernel density estimator are developed to identify both intra and inter firm patterns between the supply and point of sales distributions . The method is first described by means of a series of theoretical illustrative examples and exemplified by analyzing the geographical dispersion of four practical cases from the fashion textile industry . Subsequently managerial implications and potential use of the metrics are discussed showing how the proposed approach can support researchers and practitioners to improve supply chain location decisions and logistic integration and evaluate changes in either the purchasing or distribution strategy .
