 Given exponential growth in the size of big data its multi channel sources and variability in quality that create challenges concerning cost effective use firms have invested significantly in databases and analytical tools to inform decision making . In this regard one means to avoid the costs associated with producing less than insightful reports and negative effects on performance through wasted resources is prioritizing data in terms of relevance and quality . The aim of this study is to investigate this approach by developing and testing a scale to evaluate Big Data Availability and the role of Big Data Prioritization for more effective use of big data in decision making and performance . Focusing on the context of supply chain management we validate this scale through a survey involving 84 managers . Findings support a positive association between Big Data Availability and its use in SCM decision making and suggest that Big Data Prioritization as conceptualized in the study has a positive impact on the use of big data in SCM decision making and SCM performance . Through developing a scale to evaluate association between Big Data Availability and use in SCM decision making we make an empirical contribution to value generation from big data .
