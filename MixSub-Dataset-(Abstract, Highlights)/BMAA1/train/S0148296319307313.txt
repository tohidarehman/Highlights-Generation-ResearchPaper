 This study examines the impact of corporate executives with financial backgrounds on firm innovation . Our findings suggest that firms that have more executives with FBs engage in less innovation than firms that have fewer executives with FBs . Compared to firms with fewer executives with FBs firms that have disproportionately more executives with FBs invest in more financial assets invest in fewer fixed assets spend less on R D and experience more severe financial constraints . This phenomenon corroborates the logic of the crowding out effect which serves as a transmission mechanism in the negative causal relationship between executives FBs and firm innovation . Our findings also suggest a moderating effect in that the negative impact of executives FBs on innovation is less pronounced when firms have a stronger corporate governance .

@highlight Firms with financial background FB executives engage in less innovation.
@highlight We find the crowding out effect as a transmission mechanism.
@highlight These firms have more financial assets fewer fixed assets and less R D.
@highlight The negative impact on innovation is less with strong corporate governance.
