 With the growing expenditure on the R D activities of industrial enterprises above designated size in China it is important to evaluate the R D efficiency of the Chinese IEDSs . However few studies about R D efficiency measurement of Chinese IEDSs have considered the internal structure of the R D production process . To fill this gap this paper investigates the R D performance of IEDSs of 30 sample provinces on China s mainland from 2009 to 2014 based on a two stage data envelopment analysis model . The major findings from the empirical results are shown as follows serious imbalance exists in the R D resources among Chinese IEDSs of 30 provinces there is a decline in the average overall efficiencies after 2012 there are great differences regarding the performances of R D activities among the Chinese IEDSs of 30 provinces high attention to the R D activities or strong scientific research atmosphere may promote the R D efficiency of Chinese IEDSs and the IEDSs with the relatively high profitability or high government support in terms of R D activities have relatively poor performance . Based on these findings several policy suggestions are proposed for the R D activities of Chinese IEDSs .
