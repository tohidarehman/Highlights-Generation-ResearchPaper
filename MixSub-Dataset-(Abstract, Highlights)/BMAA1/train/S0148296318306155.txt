 From the concept of homophily we argue that the pattern of strong ties of organizational actors is mainly the result of two forces one bureaucratic and the other positional . We suggest that the moderation between these forces causes the problem of excess redundant ties and that social actors limit these relationships . We tested these hypotheses using the Logistic Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure LR QAP technique on 47 306 dyads collected during a sociometric survey in an intra organizational network . We found that when two actors belong to the same department there is a greater likelihood of their being connected . We also found that this occurs when two actors have structural equivalence . In addition we found that departmental similarity structural equivalence moderation reduces the likelihood of the existence of strong ties between two actors providing evidence of a type of architectural agency capability in egocentric networks .

@highlight The interaction between homophilic forces causes a problem of excess redundant ties.
@highlight Social actors limit homophilic relationships.
@highlight The redundancy of ties tends to be reduced through architectural agency.
@highlight The organizational structure does operate as a source of homophily and heterophily.
@highlight Social networks are structured and restructured by their agents.
