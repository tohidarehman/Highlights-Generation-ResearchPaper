 Larger food packages are often preferred by consumers because they are associated with a decrease in per unit costs and therefore may lead to monetary savings . In this research we show through a series of studies that consumers preferences for larger packages may diminish when they anticipate the potential food waste associated with such packages . Specifically Study 1 highlights the mediating role of anticipated food waste on consumers purchase intentions across small and large package sizes . In Study 2 we show that this mediating effect is observed only for non perishable products . Study 3 investigates the role of information and shows that when consumers are primed with information about the consequences of food waste their preference for larger packages decreases even though such packages are associated with a price promotion . In Study 4 we examine the influence of packaging format and find that anticipated food waste decreases when large packs are sold as individual units . We also provide a discussion of the practical implications of our results for consumers food retailers and policy makers .
