 Given the importance of comparative advertising in advertising praxis scholars have long studied the CA approach from different perspectives . There are several review and meta analysis academic papers on CA published . Review articles result in academic information gaps and differ from the approach proposed here . Therefore there is a need for a comprehensive study of CA research themes in the past present and future . This paper responds to the need to analyze additional aspects of CA research . Using several bibliometric analyses a comprehensive thematic review of comparative advertising research is discussed . Forty themes emerge from the 305 marketing and advertising journal articles reviewed producing four thematic clusters .
