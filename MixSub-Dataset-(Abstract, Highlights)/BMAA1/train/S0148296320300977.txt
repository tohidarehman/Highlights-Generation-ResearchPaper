 Laterality effects generally include two major components laterality in the horizontal display of objects and laterality in terms of human embodiment for example with regard to handedness . Horizontal display is an environmental factor whereas handedness is largely a genetic trait grounded in evolution . Both can act together in driving consumer choice . Previous research has shown that right handers react differently from left handers to a variety of stimuli . Right handers are conditioned to engage stimuli in asymmetric terms favoring their dominant right hand in guiding their perceptions of those stimuli left handers view the world in more symmetric terms with less favoring of their dominant hand . In three studies we show that handedness plays a role in consumers choice responses to lateral displays an effect that we call the choice polarity effect . Implications are drawn for laterality research and for the complex interrelationships of handedness with evolutionary coevolutionary and epigenetic forces .

@highlight Laterality effects involve both display order handedness and magnitude perceptions.
@highlight Handedness embodies an evolutionary factor which interacts with the environment.
@highlight This interaction can drive consumer choice behavior i.e. the choice polarity effect.
@highlight This is shown in studies of food choice and choice of shirts with logos.
@highlight Implications are drawn concerning biased choices and epigenetic effects.
