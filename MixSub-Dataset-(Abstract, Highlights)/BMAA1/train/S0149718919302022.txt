 This article examines whether two of the major German flagship programmes to increase the participation of female researchers in the German science system the Women Professorship Programme and the Pact for Research and Innovation have actually increased the number of women especially in leadership positions . In a second step we analyse whether such an assumed increase influences the publication patterns of authors with German affiliation . This article is based on literature and desk research as well as bibliometric analysis using Scopus . The most important result is that the number of women in research has indeed increased significantly in recent years and that accordingly more women are the authors of scientific publications . In particular it can be seen that quality indicators such as citations and excellence rates are high for female authors . This enables us to show that more women in the science system not only bring about a gain in justice but also a concrete scientific benefit .
