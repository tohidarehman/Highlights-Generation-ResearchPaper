 Despite the increasing relevance at the professional level and although the complexity of its configuration and implementation keeps growing the existing research about public private partnerships remains embryonic . This paper focuses on three complementary fields of study for its understanding risk management governance management and private participants behaviour . A causal model is proposed in which network market orientation acts as a previous relational governance mechanism enabling as a result a better perception of risk by the private agents involved . The model was tested using structural equation modelling on a sample of 180 agents involved in PPP projects in China . Results confirm this assumption by placing inter organisational trust as a central variable the effect had by network market orientation upon companies perceived risk occurs through the reinforcement of their particular entrepreneurial orientation . Findings provide researchers and managers with practical insights into the development of PPP projects from a relational perspective .
