As technology is increasingly integrated into service and retail environments and employee presence is decreasing much of the responsibility for initiating service encounters has shifted from employees to customers . However many customers are reluctant to approach employees . This manuscript examines the process through which a customer decides whether to approach an employee . Apparel is among the most noticeable cues customers use to evaluate employees thus signaling theory is used to examine employee apparel s effect on consumers approach intentions . Additionally embarrassment is shown to moderate the approach decision process . Three studies including a 360 video experiment and a behavioral lab study are used to assess the relationship between apparel and approach decisions . These findings provide evidence that expertise signaling apparel may be more effective at increasing approach intentions .
