 This study assesses the extent to which a firm s external environment shapes the cross functional interactions between procurement and engineering utilizing an embedded multiple case study methodology . In summary we found that high environmental ambiguity discourages procurement engineering mutual understanding . High environmental uncertainty with moderate ambiguity on the other hand appears to foster both mutual understanding and inter functional collaboration . Overall procurement personnel are more optimistic than engineering personnel regarding the performance results stemming from cross functional integration . Additionally increasing job tenure for procurement personnel leads to a higher level of perceived integration with engineering while engineers with longer job tenure report see less value in collaborating with procurement often creating an asymmetric power distribution with engineering taking a dominating role .

@highlight High ambiguity discourages procurement engineering mutual understanding.
@highlight High uncertainty moderate ambiguity fosters mutual understanding and collaboration.
@highlight Purchasers report higher performance benefits from collaboration than engineers.
@highlight Longer tenured purchasers perceive higher value collaborating with engineering.
@highlight Longer tenured engineers perceived lower value collaborating with procurement.
