 We examine the cognitive and motivational process underlying the effect of consumers conservatism on their corporate social responsibility perceptions of irresponsible versus responsible companies . Building on political psychology and system justification theory we identify and test market system justification as a motivated social cognition underlying ideological differences in CSR perceptions and reactions . Using four empirical studies we find that the relatively high MSJ of conservatives results in less critical CSR perceptions of irresponsible companies and thus in less penalizing reactions . Moreover we find that conservatism influences CSR perceptions of irresponsible companies more strongly than of responsible companies because MSJ affects only perceptions of market behaviors that threaten notions of fair markets . The results improve predictions of consumers perceptions and reactions to responsible and irresponsible companies .
