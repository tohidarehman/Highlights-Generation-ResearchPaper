 Case management programs for frequent users of healthcare services are complex interventions which implementation and application are challenging to evaluate . The aim of this article was to conduct a logic analysis to evaluate a case management program for frequent users of healthcare services . The study proceeded in three phases 1 establishing causal links between the programs components by the construction of a logic model 2 developing an integrated framework from a realistic synthesis and 3 making a new reading of the case management program in regard of the integrated framework . The study demonstrated on one hand strengths and weaknesses of the actual case management program and on the other hand how logic analysis can create a constructive dialogue between theory and practice . The evaluative process with decision makers clinicians and patients has helped to make connexions between theory practice experience and services organization .

@highlight Each phase of the logic analysis is complementary throughout the evaluation process.
@highlight Stakeholders involved became familiar with concepts relative to the intervention.
@highlight Logic analysis improves the understanding of both structural and intangible factors.
@highlight Concrete intervention strategies have been identified which can be prioritized.
