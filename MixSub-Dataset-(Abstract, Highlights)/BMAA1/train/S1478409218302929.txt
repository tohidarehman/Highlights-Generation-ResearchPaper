 The principal aim of this study is to provide theory and testing to elucidate the role of decision maker s decision process and speed during the global sourcing decision making process . In order to achieve this goal we examine the behavior of a sample of 202 decision makers belonging to Italian SMEs in the manufacturing sector . Our main finding suggests that faster decisions during the GSDP process lead to superior financial and non financial performance of the selected supplier . Moreover we find support for dual processing theory wherein rationality and intuition of the GSDP are associated with increased supplier performance both directly and through their effects on decision speed . Results are discussed in terms of the GSDP SME and strategic decision making literatures and practical implications for managers in SMEs .
