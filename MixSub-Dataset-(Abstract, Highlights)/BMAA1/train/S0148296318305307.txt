 Unit pricing is deemed helpful for grocery shoppers . Many countries mandate that supermarkets provide unit prices . However consumers only make limited use of unit pricing . Consumer advocates attribute this to the poor and inconsistent presentation of the unit price information . Using eye tracking the present research tests how unit price label design factors affect consumers eye movements during the product decision process . Additionally the study assesses how the effects of the design factors depend on the consumer s price consciousness . The research also tests how the consistency of the label presentation affects eye movements and choice . Findings from an experimentally designed shopping task using natural stimuli reveal that an enhanced label design leads to an increase in the number of eye fixations in particular when the unit price is color highlighted and especially for consumers who are less price conscious . These increased fixations however do not result in changes in product choice .
