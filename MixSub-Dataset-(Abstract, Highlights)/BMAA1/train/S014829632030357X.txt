 This research examines how hosts interaction styles can shape consumer outcomes after experiencing service failure in home sharing via the intervening role of trust . Drawing on findings from two experimental studies the results consistently suggest that adopting a personal style in the initial hostguest interaction yields higher trust in the host . When service failure occurs consumers exposed to an initial personal interaction with the host report greater satisfaction and lower switching intentions regardless of recovery interaction styles . Serial mediation analysis suggests that trust accounts for the differential impact of interaction styles on post service recovery outcomes . Implications for the sharing economy literature and managerial practices are discussed .

@highlight Host interaction styles significantly influence post failure responses.
@highlight Trust is the underlying mechanism explaining the effect of interaction styles.
@highlight Findings are consistent across two studies.
