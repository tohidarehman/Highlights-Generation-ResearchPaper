 Many brands utilize social media to communicate with consumers but are they taking advantage of these media s potential for co creation We explore this in the corporate social responsibility context where online CSR dialogs form as brands interact with consumers using social media . Study 1 examines eight brands digital CSR communications on Twitter and suggests these dialogs are present but are rarely part of the process with most interactions between their consumers . Study 2 assesses the brands CSR relevant tweets content and finds that most are not relevant to CSR and moreover are predominantly one way . Therefore both studies reveal that brands are not tapping into the potential for co creation that is inherent in social media . Thus we recommend that social media communications should include mentions of individual consumers audience specific and relevant message content and opportunities for consumers to co create value with the relevant brands .

@highlight Study 1 suggests that consumers are engaging with each other but rarely with brands.
@highlight Study 2 finds that studied brands CSR communications lack engagement opportunities.
@highlight Brands should consider the engagement potential of social media to create value.
