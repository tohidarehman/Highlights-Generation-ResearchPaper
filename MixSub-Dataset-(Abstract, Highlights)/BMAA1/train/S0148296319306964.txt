 Increased fish consumption can contribute to a more sustainable food system . This paper explores how signaling affects consumer choices in fresh fish purchasing situations both in traditional and online retail settings . We examined two different types of market signals quality signals stemming from consumers as a social proof and authority signals coming from stores . Study 1 showed that quality signals from other consumers had the highest importance score in an online setting when compared to traditional attributes in a conjoint experiment . Study 2 again confirmed the prominence of quality signals from consumers by extending the research over to brick and mortar retailing and top selling items . Study 3 followed up with in store experiments using fresh cod fillets as the target product and fresh ground beef as a comparison . The experiments showed increased sales from both types of signaling with an overall 41.5 increase for fish in our study .
