 This paper investigates the motivations behind the associations between the M A risk level and the M A risk reporting . For a sample of 231 M As I performed a detailed content analysis of Item 1A of the 10 K filing after the completion of M As . While the M A risk reporting quantity captures the number of M A risk factors the M A risk reporting quality additionally reflects the M A risk reporting depth and width . The results suggest that the M A risk reporting quantity and quality are related but not identical theoretical constructs . Overall consistent with the transparency motivation a higher M A risk level encourages managers to increase the M A risk reporting quantity and quality . Managers will disclose more M A risk factors if the target firm is relatively large and from a foreign country a relatively large amount of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and the M A intensity is high .
