 This research bridges the literature on developmental psychology and marketing by distinguishing perceived operational competence from perceived conceptual competence and examines their differentiated impacts on the evaluation of brand extensions . We conducted a study analyzing mixed secondary and survey data a study based on big data analysis and an experimental study . The results show that perceived operational competence which represents the skills needed to manufacture existing products or familiar product features leads to higher evaluations of near brand extensions through the fit of the transferability of manufacturing facilities skills or technologies . In contrast perceived conceptual competence which represents the ability to generalize the abstract brand concept and establish a relationship between existing situations and new settings leads to higher evaluations of far brand extensions through the fit of brand concept consistency .

@highlight This research bridges the literature on developmental psychology and marketing.
@highlight Perceived operational competence differs from perceived conceptual competence.
@highlight The former leads to higher evaluations of near brand extensions.
@highlight The latter leads to higher evaluations of far brand extensions.
@highlight Dual mediation paths of transferability and brand concept consistency are observed.
