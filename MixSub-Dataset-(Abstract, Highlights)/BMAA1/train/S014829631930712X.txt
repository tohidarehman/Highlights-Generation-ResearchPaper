Several factors can influence how employees perceive their organizations commitment to sustainability however no research has yet explored how green human resource management can influence that perception . This study thus examines the role of green hiring green training and green compensation along with age and gender in sustaining the organizational rationale for sustainability . Results from a sample of 275 Portuguese employees analysed through the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis shows that perceived ORS is mainly grounded in green hiring and to a lesser extent in green training . Green hiring is especially important for older employees whereas younger employees require green training . Green compensation is surprisingly irrelevant . The study is useful for researchers and practitioners who seek to understand employees perception about the value and priority their organizations give to sustainability .
