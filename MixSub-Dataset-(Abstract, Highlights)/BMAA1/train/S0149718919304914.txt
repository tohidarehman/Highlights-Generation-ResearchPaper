 The purpose of this study was to examine the final analytic sample of a longitudinal randomized control trial evaluation of a sexual violence prevention program at a university after facing challenges with the implementation of a self generated identification code . The matched and unmatched samples included 10 135 surveys . Eighty eight percent of these surveys were matched into the final longitudinal dataset . Findings suggest that students with certain characteristics were more likely to be matched over time . In addition students who did not comply with RCT protocol were less likely to be matched . Student history of victimization or perpetration of sexual violence was not associated with being matched over time . This study provides recommendations for preventing matching problems in longitudinal studies a process for rectifying matching issues and a critique of studies that do not address issues of matching related sample bias in their final analytic sample .

@highlight Provides a multi step process for rectifying issues with longitudinal matching of anonymous surveys.
@highlight Demonstrates a method for testing for sample bias by examining characteristics of matched and unmatched participants.
@highlight Provides lessons learned for designing anonymous longitudinal studies on sensitive topics.
