 The forecast of the real estate market is an important part of studying the Chinese economic market . Most existing methods have strict requirements on input variables and are complex in parameter estimation . To obtain better prediction results a modified Holt s exponential smoothing method was proposed to predict the housing price by using historical data . Unlike the traditional exponential smoothing models MHES sets different weights on historical data and the smoothing parameters depend on the sample size . Meanwhile the proposed MHES incorporates the whale optimization algorithm to obtain the optimal parameters . Housing price data from Kunming Changchun Xuzhou and Handan were used to test the performance of the model . The housing prices results of four cities indicate that the proposed method has a smaller prediction error and shorter computation time than that of other traditional models . Therefore WOA MHES can be applied efficiently to housing price forecasting and can be a reliable tool for market investors and policy makers .
