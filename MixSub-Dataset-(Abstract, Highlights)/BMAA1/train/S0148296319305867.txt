 Four studies provide evidence for a process by which a womans conspicuous consumption can serve as a deterrent to affiliative behaviors by materialistic men via heightened perceptions of the womans financial standards for a romantic partner . Materialistic men report utilizing status and resources to attract women more than non materialistic men . Materialistic men may therefore utilize information about a womans status linked displays to better calibrate their financially oriented mating efforts . Differential attention to more subtle displays of a womans luxury branded items appears to drive materialistic mens disinterest in social interaction with a woman who conspicuously consumes . A womans conspicuous consumption causes materialistic men to rate a real interaction with that woman less favorably . For women the opposite is observed with non materialistic women reacting more negatively to the interaction .
