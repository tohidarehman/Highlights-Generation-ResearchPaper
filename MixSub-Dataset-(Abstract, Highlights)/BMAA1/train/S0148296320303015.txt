 Stakeholder theory has called for more research on competing interests . This research contributes by investigating investor preferences that affect the competing positions of incumbents and sharing economy firms . The sharing economy promises wider distribution of benefits across stakeholders which may influence investor attractiveness . So this research asks when sharing economy firms are competitive for investor support in comparison with incumbents . Value creation and value capture are employed to develop hypotheses predicting investor interests . Using data from a matched sample of 334 firms we find evidence of conditional investor preference for non sharing firms and conclude implications for the sharing economy and sustainable development .
