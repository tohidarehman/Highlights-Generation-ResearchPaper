 Recessions are recurring events in which most firms suffer severe impacts while others are affected less or may even prosper . Notwithstanding strategic management scholars have made little progress in understanding the reasons for these differences in performance particularly in unstable macroeconomic environments such as Latin America . In this study we link literatures on entrepreneurship and improvisation to create an integrative model that indicates characteristics and capabilities that enable a firm to adapt successfully to the recessionary environment . We use survey data from Brazilian firms on the 20082009 global recession and we find that the firms that have superior performance in recessions are those that had before the recession 1 a propensity to recognize opportunities and 2 improvisation capabilities for fast and creative actions . We also find a moderating effect of entrepreneurial orientation .
