 The literature on broadband policies has been focusing on the possible role of mobile broadband as a means for addressing geographical digital divide in areas with no or inadequate fixed broadband infrastructure coverage . Broadband plans designed by most of the industrialized countries take the substitutability between fixed and mobile technologies for granted with restrictions essentially relating only to bandwidth performance . We explore the determinants of individuals private access to the Internet with the smartphone through a mobile broadband connection focusing on the role played by Internet uses and taking into account the availability of a fixed broadband connection at home . The results of our econometric exercise carried out on microdata referred to Italian individuals provide original and interesting evidence a complementarity effect between mobile and fixed broadband is found for browsing video streaming gaming and cloud services a substitution effect emerges for social networking and music streaming . Such increasing complexity of individuals broadband usage patterns should be acknowledged in the way broadband coverage is mapped and policies designed adopting a more ecosystem oriented approach which integrates supply and demand side features . A first step in this direction is the inclusion of some so far neglected key attributes of the demand among the relevant dimensions of policy design .

@highlight We investigate the determinants of mobile broadband adoption and its substitutability with fixed broadband.
@highlight For video streaming gaming cloud services and browsing fixed and mobile access are complements.
@highlight For social networking and music streaming they are substitutes.
@highlight Mapping of broadband digital divide focused on bandwidth may be misleading.
@highlight Sound policy design needs to include key access attributes such as data traffic allowance latency Internet capable devices.
