 Research on radical change in CSR is needed to understand how to address threatening issues to society and the planet which are often systemic complex and time sensitive . In a seven year case study of the U.S. dairy industry the processes behind voluntary radical change are explored finding two core themes related to structure and strategy . First structure changed to include the whole system such that both external and internal stakeholders at all levels and at the same time were engaged in CSR throughout the entire process of change . Second a strengths based approach to strategy was used in which the industry built on its core strengths and amplified them to address CSR issuesthis is counter to prior approaches in change that are often deficit based . The findings uncover how stakeholders can positively and voluntarily work together collectively for large scale radical and rapid CSR change .
