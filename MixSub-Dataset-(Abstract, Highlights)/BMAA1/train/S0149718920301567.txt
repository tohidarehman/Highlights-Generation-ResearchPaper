 In applying a methods oriented approach to evaluation this study interpreted the effectiveness of a summer reading program from three different stakeholder perspectives practitioners from the school district the funding agency supporting the program and the policymakers considering mandating summer school . Archival data were obtained on 2330 students reading below benchmark in Grades 25 . After propensity score matching participants to peers who did not attend the summer program the final sample consisted of 630 students . Pre to posttest growth models revealed positive effects in Grades 24 but fifth graders demonstrated negligible improvement . The standardized mean differences of propensity score matched treatment and control group students indicated null effects in all grade levels

@highlight Younger students experienced more growth in reading over the summer.
@highlight Summer students reading was not significantly better than their matched controls.
@highlight Few students achieved reading proficiency after the summer program.
@highlight Evaluators must explain to stakeholders how research design impacts effect sizes.
