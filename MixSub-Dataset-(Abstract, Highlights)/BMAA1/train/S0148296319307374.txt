 Understanding the psychological aspects that influence fans attachment to a sporting event can help shape its legacy as well as preparations for similar future events . Using theories of social identity and attachment this study evaluates the cognitive and affective predictors of fans attachment to an event . The study models discrete emotions as outcomes of team identification which in turn influences fans satisfaction with team performance and by extension team and event attachment . This proposition was tested using a sample of 324 All Blacks fans who were surveyed online during the 2015 Rugby World Cup . The findings suggest that team identification has a positive influence on the discrete emotions of happiness and love which then predict team attachment . Pride meanwhile moderates the relationship between team and event attachment . The paper discusses the implications of these results for event sustainability and fandom management .
