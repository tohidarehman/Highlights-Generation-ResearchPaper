 We considered a humanitarian environment composed of donors and non governmental organizations that the non profits may adopt competitive or coopetitive inter organizational interaction for managing the disasters . We also assumed that the government intervenes in the relief operations by applying one of its two policies social welfare maximization or budget consumption minimization . Using game theory approach we develop 4 scenarios and as a result 4 mathematical programming models for examining the effect of the NGOs interactions and the government policies on the performance of donors NGOs and government . We find that coopetition of NGOs facilitates the achievement of the government s objectives and it also helps the non profits to become more successful in providing relief . The government prefers to provide the indirect relief to the nonprofits to manage emergency operations successfully and the financial aids are given only in the condition of reducing the level of NGOs cooperation . We also conclude that the cooperation of NGOs increases the donors utility . A numerical example is conducted to test the findings of the models .

@highlight Cooperation and competition models are developed for humanitarian SCs interaction.
@highlight Leader follower game model is established for interactions of the SCs and government.
@highlight Welfare maximization or budget consumption minimization are the government s policies.
@highlight The government prefers to give financial aids rather than reliefs to the NGOs.
@highlight Cooperation among NGOs in relief operations is beneficial for government and donors.
