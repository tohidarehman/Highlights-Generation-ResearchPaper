 Firms are deploying chatbots to automate customer service . However miscommunication is a frequent occurrence in human chatbot interaction . This study investigates the relationship between miscommunication and adoption for customer service chatbots . Anthropomorphism is tested as an account for the relationship . Two experiments compare the perceived humanness and adoption scores for an error free chatbot a chatbot seeking clarification regarding a consumer input and a chatbot which fails to discern context . The results suggest that unresolved errors are sufficient to reduce anthropomorphism and adoption intent . However there is no perceptual difference between an error free chatbot and one which seeks clarification . The ability to resolve miscommunication appears as effective as avoiding it . Furthermore the higher a consumers need for human interaction the stronger the anthropomorphism adoption relationship . Thus anthropomorphic chatbots may satisfy the social desires of consumers high in need for human interaction .
