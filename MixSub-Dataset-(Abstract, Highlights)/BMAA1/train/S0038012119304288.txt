 Existing academic literature on the relationship between agglomeration economies and university activities is both under theorized and relatively sparse in terms of empirical examination . This paper addresses each of these voids by contributing and analyzing a market model of pro revenue education program creation such as graduate level executive business education that reveals some intriguing characteristics . For instance it shows that demand for these pro revenue programs is inelastic and therefore uniquely determines their availability . More specifically we show that through agglomeration economies these types of education programs are more likely to emanate from universities located in metropolitan areas and from less academically prestigious universities . Regression analysis of a cross section of national public universities lends support to important facets of our formal model by suggesting that agglomeration economies continue to increase the probability of offering EMBA programs through a city size of approximately 2.12 million and that the probability that a given business school will offer an EMBA is negatively related to the academic prestige of the institution to which it is affiliated .
