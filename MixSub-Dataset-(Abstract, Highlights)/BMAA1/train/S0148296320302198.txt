 In this manuscript we investigate the central role of perceived frontline service employee authenticity and the process by which it impacts purchase intentions taking into account the represented brand s authenticity . While brand authenticity has previously been shown to enhance consumer outcomes we find that FSE authenticity is a separate significant predictor of purchase intentions . Further we find that FSE authenticity enhances purchase intentions by increasing perceived trust and perceived quality . However this finding only holds for brands that do not emphasize their authenticity indicating that brand managers should differentially emphasize FSE authenticity based on their brand s positioning . Furthermore we investigate the robustness of these effects across both experience and credence services and find that FSE authenticity is especially important in credence service contexts .
