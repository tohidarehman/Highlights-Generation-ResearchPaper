 The coinsurance and wealth transfer hypotheses are both used to explain the wealth effect of acquirer and target bondholders during mergers and acquisitions . Hindered by a paucity of high quality bond data to date there is at best only limited and mixed evidence . Using bond transaction data from TRACE we investigate daily bond market reactions to M A announcements . Consistent with the wealth transfer hypothesis we find new evidence that acquiring firm bondholders experience negative and statistically significant abnormal returns . Moreover investors of speculative grade bonds experience more negative returns for the acquirer than investment grades . In addition larger deals and cash payment method worsen acquirer bondholders losses and reduce target bondholders gains . Target bonds experience more positive returns when the acquirer is a public firm and when the targets credit rating is below the acquirers . Lastly consistent with a loss to acquiring firm bondholders in the initial market reactions acquirer bonds are more likely to have their credit rating downgraded following the announcement of a merger or acquisition .
