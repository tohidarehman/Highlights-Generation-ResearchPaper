 The 20072008 global recession and consequent slow recovery have revealed considerable heterogeneity in economic performance across countries and regions . This study contributes innovatively to existing resilience literature by identifying a life cycle resilience framework and computing a handy composite Regional Economic Resilience Indicator . We analyse economic resilience by means of a cluster and exploratory spatial data analysis revealing well defined spatial patterns in the EU . National resilience trends dominate in the EU 15 while a more heterogeneous spatial pattern is present in the EU 13 . Our findings can support the monitoring of economic resilience at regional level and facilitate a common understanding of this complex and dynamic process for policy purposes .

@highlight We characterize regional economic resilience as a complex process.
@highlight The main dimensions of this process are synthetized into the Regional Economic Resilience Indicator.
@highlight Spatial and cluster analyses identify economic resilience patterns across EU regions.
@highlight Our composite tool is a potential instrument to draw policy implications.
