 In four studies this research investigates consumers responses to the trend of art commercialization and more importantly provides marketers solutions validated empirically to target consumers who disapprove of commercializing art and thus dislike art infused products by examining the cross pollination between emerging retail practicesinfusing art on products and in retail spaces . First we demonstrate that consumers exhibit heterogeneous views on commercialization that translate into their evaluations of art infused products . We then verify consumers involvement with art as the reason for this heterogeneity . Second we suggest two methods to infuse art in retail spaces to induce consumers situational cognitive and affective involvement with art . As a result familiarity with art and sensory experience with art are found effective in increasing the intention to purchase products infusing art on the part of the segment of consumers who initially disapprove of commercializing art .

@highlight Consumers exhibit heterogeneous views of art commercialization which translate into evaluations of art infused products.
@highlight Stimulating situational cognitive involvements targets consumers holding negative views.
@highlight Stimulating situational affective involvements targets consumers holding neutral views.
@highlight Both types of involvement stimulations result in endorsing favorable responses toward art infused products.
