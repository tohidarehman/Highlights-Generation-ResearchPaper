 This research offers insights into childrens agency in the context of recycling behaviors by exploring how childrens agency might be enacted in various settings . Using a series of child centered methods the authors observe childrens recycling behaviors at school and at home and investigate their behaviors using role playing games and a verbalization phase that captures the childrens understanding of recycling and their varying degrees of agency around recycling . The findings suggest that personal environmental and behavioral factors can facilitate or constrain childrens consumer agency . In particular their level of agency varies according to each childs specific microenvironment within the family the location where the recycling takes place and communication patterns within the family . From these findings we provide several recommendations for public policymakers and business managers .
