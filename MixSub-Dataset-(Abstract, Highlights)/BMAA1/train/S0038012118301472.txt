 It is crucial to develop appropriate strategies to reduce the evacuation time in a disaster situation . The negative impact of large scale disasters can be mitigated by proactive and efficient evacuation planning . The present study aims to develop strategies for public transit based evacuation for better control and reduced congestion . Mathematical models are formulated for both strategic and operational aspects of evacuation planning to result in efficient optimal evacuation . The study also presents methods to manage the external environment uncertainties in particular evacuation demand uncertainty by providing robust solutions . To test the efficacy of the models a case study for a radiological accident in a nuclear plant in India is presented . The results of the case study demonstrate that the models can provide live efficient and robust results during actual emergencies in acceptable time .
