 Motivated by the recent discovery of a significant increase in corporate debt in developed countries we use a large sample of 775 listed companies to examine the dynamics and determinants of South African corporate debt . We find an 89 increase in the leverage of the average firm from 11 in 1990 to 21 in 2015 . Long term and short term debt increased by 103 and 67 respectively . We find that this increase is pervasive and can not be explained entirely by either firm attributes or macroeconomic factors despite the importance of the latter . Instead we find supply side factors to be the main determinants of the upward trend in corporate debt highlighting their importance to corporate debt policies in emerging economies .

@highlight Corporate debt in South Africa increased by 89 over the last three decades.
@highlight Firm specific and macroeconomic factors do not fully explain this increase.
@highlight Overlooked supply side factors are crucial to explaining the increase in debt.
