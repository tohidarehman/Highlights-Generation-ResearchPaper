 South African municipalities are taking hesitant steps towards institutionalising evaluation practice . This paper explores how evaluation is being institutionalised at a municipal level looking at both the legislative and regulatory requirements in terms of planning budgeting and reporting as well as opportunities for evaluative practice . A well established performance management system coupled with certain constraints to innovation and building an evaluative culture are contributing to the creation of an evaluation function that serves a monitoring purpose . A combination of desktop research and participatory action research was used to understand the municipal practice of evaluation . The results have implications for how decentralised public sector evaluation systems are understood .

@highlight There is an over emphasis on monitoring compared to evaluation in municipalities.
@highlight Lack of technical expertise in municipalities to conduct the actual evaluations.
@highlight Evaluation function is still nascent in municipalities there is variation on the practice in municipalities although there are disparities.
@highlight Compliance driven environment might erode efforts for evaluation institutionalisation.
