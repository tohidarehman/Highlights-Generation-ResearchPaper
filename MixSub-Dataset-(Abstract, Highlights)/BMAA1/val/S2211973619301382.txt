However it is necessary to analyse the extent to which IT contributes to hotels being agile in responding to changes in the environment . The paper analyses the mediating and moderating role of IT capability in the relationship between IT uses and hotel agility . Results demonstrate the mediating role of IT capability confirming IT uses affect organisational agility not only directly but also indirectly by improving the ability to manage technological resources . However the role of IT capability as a moderator is not confirmed in this research . Such findings provide guidance to hotel managers to improve IT management and applications suggesting future lines of research .
