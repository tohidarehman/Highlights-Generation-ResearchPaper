 Tourism destination competitiveness is a multidimensional concept that is widely studied in the academic literature but multiple factors make its measurement a difficult task . In this article we design a synthetic index to rank the 80 countries that attract the majority of international tourists by level of tourism competitiveness . In order to do this we use all of the simple variables included in the 2017 Travel Tourism Competitiveness Index proposing a new methodology for the construction of this synthetic index which it solves the problems of aggregation of variables expressed in different measures arbitrary weighting and duplicity of information issues that remain unresolved by the TTCI . Likewise we analyse the most influential dimensions in tourism competitiveness . Air transport infrastructures cultural resources and ICT readiness are the key dimensions that explain the main disparities .
