 This paper analyses the impact of online reviews on hotel booking intention . The moderating effect of brand image star category and price on this relationship was also tested . A quantitative approach has been followed by collecting questionnaires from a convenience sample of 432 customers who have previous experience with online booking . Results of the research revealed that reviews with positive valence do not affect booking intention while reviews with negative valence have a strong impact . In addition it was found that several moderators made this impact more or less severe . Brand image demonstrated a slight moderating effect due to the factor s inherent subjective nature . A moderating effect was also observed for both price importance and star category on the relationship . In conclusion this study emphasizes the need for hotel managers to address online customer reviews and specifically negative ones to take advantage of promotional opportunities .
