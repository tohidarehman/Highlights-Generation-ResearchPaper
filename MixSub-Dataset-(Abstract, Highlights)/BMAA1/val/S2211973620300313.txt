 In recent years international attention has been rendered to development of ecotourism for poverty reduction and biodiversity conservation . We assessed local livelihood assets in Kampong Phluk Community before and after the introduction of the community based ecotourism governance system where it was previously under the private company management system . We used a sustainable livelihood framework to assess natural physical human social and financial assets by analyzing a set of panel data of 150 observations according to the scoring scale of zero to one . We found that full implementation of CBET raised the overall average score of livelihood assets by 0.15 . In particular physical capital and human capital achieved remarkable growth by 0.25 to 0.23 respectively while growth in natural capital and financial capital was statistically insignificant . Although CBET showed promising results improving communication and providing community health care would motivate active participation in ecotourism development .
