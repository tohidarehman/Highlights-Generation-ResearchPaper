 This study researches both the perception of a destination and the importance of the previous visit in shaping that perception . First the factors that influence the image are analysed moderated by the effect of the previous visit . Next the gap between the projected image and the perceived image of Malaga which is located in a tourist area specializing in sun and beach and trying to become a cultural destination is studied . Data are obtained from 301 surveys administered through proportional and stratified sampling . A descriptive inferential analysis and a structural equation model are proposed to analyse the causal relationships . The results confirm the influence of information sources and motivations on the image as well as the importance of the previous visit . The conclusions suggest that there are significant difficulties in changing the Malaga image as a seaside destination for visitors but not for the local community .
