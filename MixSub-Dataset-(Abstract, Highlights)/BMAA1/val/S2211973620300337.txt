 Tranquillity is considered a preferred travel experience for people . Despite there are many researches on the measurement and evaluation of tranquillity little has explored the perception of tranquillity during the tour . Through the study of Chinese tourists we try to cover the gap by exploring how tourists perceive tranquillity in different tranquil areas . This study expounds the Chinese understanding of tranquillity and adopts the grounded theory to systematically analyse the real experience of tourists . The study summarizes 3 major categories and 20 types of tranquil areas . The environmental characteristics of tranquil areas are classified into 4 dimensions quietness stable society natural scenery and local culture . We propose a geographical process of perceiving tranquillity in tourist destinations which includes the relationship between tourists and motivation environment behaviour emotion and psychological activities . These relations are helpful to provide a new perspective on tranquillity outside the post positivist research paradigm .
