 The purpose of this research is to explore the role of online photography in creating experience value in nature based tourism and what types of experience value are conveyed through photography based user generated content . The paper draws from existing literature in defining tourism experience value as a subjective inter subjective and inter contextual construct performed by situated valuation practices . Consequently the paper presents interpretive and participatory netnography as an effective method to investigate experience value and identifies online photography on Instagram as both a valuing practice and a valuing place . Results show the capability of online photography based UGC to create multidimensional values from strategic combinations of textual and visual content . Simultaneously new dimensions of experience value are introduced which exist beyond single tourism experiential encounters but critically contribute to an iterative experience valuation . Finally Instagram posts introduce valuation timelines that can elude linear models of pre in situ post experience valuation and assume subjective and fluid connotations .
