 The concept of sustainability has been widely accepted in tourism to mitigate the detrimental effects of mass tourism . However developing a valid scale and testing it in cross cultural settings is critical in evaluating sustainable tourism outcomes . This study examines the validity of the Sustainable Tourism Attitude Scale in an Eastern island context . We adopted competing models testing cross cultural validity examination and multigroup confirmatory factor analyses . Data were collected from three archipelagoes in Taiwan . A seven correlated factor model was identified as the best fitting model . Cross cultural validity demonstrates that SUS TAS shares the same psychometric properties originally found in Choi and Sirakaya and multigroup confirmatory factor analyses support the concept that SUS TAS has the same cognitive framework across the three groups . The findings suggest that SUS TAS can be used to assess resident attitudes toward sustainable tourism in an Eastern island context . Implications for future research and managerial practice are discussed .
