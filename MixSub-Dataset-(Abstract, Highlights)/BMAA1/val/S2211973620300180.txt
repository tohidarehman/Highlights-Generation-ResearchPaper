 The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of family firm specific non financial dynamics and family firm psychological capital on firm performance . We develop a model of how family firms SEW preservation goal negatively affects firm performance in terms of sales and the mitigating influence of FFPsyCap on this association . We test the model on a sample of 192 family firms in the Hospitality and Tourism industry . Using a cross sectional research design surveys were solicited from small and medium size hotels in Turkey . Ordinary Least Squares technique is used to test our hypotheses . The results reveal that family firms SEW preservation goal negatively affects firm performance in terms of sales and the FFPsyCap mitigates this influence . Accordingly if small and medium size firms in H T can capitalize on non financial strengths and minimize the impact of family centric goals on firm outcomes they can attain transgenerational sustainability and success .
