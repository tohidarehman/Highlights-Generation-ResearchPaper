 Resilient tourism organisations and destinations can adapt and prosper in changing environments . Social networking and community engagement contribute to self organisation a typical element of resilient systems . In this context the present work aims at assessing the role of two of the main factors that contribute to the development of resilience in tourism organisations their preparedness to crisis and their participation in the destination s crisis management plans . To this end quantitative data was collected through a survey with 72 hotel managers in Galicia Spain a region that is frequently afflicted by natural disasters namely forest fires and oil spills . A logistic regression model has shown that planning to change and broadening participation increase organisations ability to capitalise on opportunities that arise in an uncertainty situation . Therefore in times of unpredictability more flexible organisations are better able to adapt and transform themselves in response to internal and external changes .
