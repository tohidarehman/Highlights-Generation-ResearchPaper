 The purpose of this paper is to study how the fit between innovation capabilities and supply chain strategies affects business performance . An empirical study based on a sample of 329 companies from Portugal and Brazil was performed to test a theoretical model based on the resource based view . Linear and hierarchical regression analyses are conducted to test the hypotheses . The different combinations of core and supplementary innovation capabilities and lean and agile SC strategies are empirically tested and discussed . Data reveal that core and supplementary innovation capabilities positively impact on business performance and that SC strategies moderate the relationship between innovation capabilities and business performance . The analysis also shows that the combination of an agile SC strategy and supplementary innovation capabilities offers the greatest opportunities to improve business performance . The results of this study could help managers to choose the most appropriate SC strategy thus contributing to increasing the impact of innovation capabilities on business performance . This study contributes to the knowledge concerning the consequences of adopting different innovation capabilities and SC strategies on business performance .
