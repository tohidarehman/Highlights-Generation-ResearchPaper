 A standardized website evaluation model is needed in the tourism sector . This research article aims at revising previous models and updating them to contribute with a unified evaluation model for the analysis of web quality that incorporates a three dimensional approach on usability since usability is closely related to graphic design and navigability . This perspective has not been stated before . To test this correlation a model to evaluate User Usable Experience which integrates this three dimensional approach on usability is proposed and a set of indicators that have been devised from a close bibliographic revision of previous web analysis models is shown . Its application to a purposive sampling verifies the positive correlation among the three above mentioned parameters by means of a multiple linear regression model . The results confirm the need to analyse UUX from a three dimensional perspective on usability .

@highlight A multidisciplinary model for evaluating User Usable Experience UUX in tourism websites is proposed.
@highlight The proposed model combines previous contributions and updates them in the context of the web 2.0.
@highlight The positive correlation among usability graphic design and navigability is verified multiple linear regression model .
@highlight Graphic design and navigability affect UUX in websites when they both work together not independently.
@highlight Hints to check and improve UUX in tourism websites.
