 Research on collaboration relationships among researchers assists in understanding scientific information dissemination . Network analysis has been used in many studies on collaboration . However understanding the co authoring communities in collaboration networks and identifying their key researchers generally remain unexplored although these insights can lead to an improved comprehension of collaboration relationships . The current study discovers and analyzes co authoring communities in the collaboration networks of researchers in tourism research . Results indicate that productivities within co authoring communities are high because of dense collaboration relationships . We also observe that location may be one of the formation reasons of co authoring communities . Key researchers who are globally and locally important can be further identified by introducing the community centrality measure . The network robustness test demonstrates the effectiveness of this measure .
