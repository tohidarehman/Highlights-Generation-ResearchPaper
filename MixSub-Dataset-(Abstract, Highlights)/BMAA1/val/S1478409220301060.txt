 We compare how Finland and the Netherlands organize home care services both in legislation and in procurement practices from a service triad risk perspective . We find Finnish public bodies rely to a great extent on inhouse provision and hybrid outsourcing . Dutch public bodies rely completely on outsourcing using framework agreements with many care providers in parallel . Incentives used in contracts affect financial and service quality risks assumed by buyers suppliers and end customers in the triad . This research improves our understanding of risk allocation among the actors in the service triad based on buyer decisions on outsourcing and supply market conditions . The risk profiles for all three actors in the home care service triad are affected by the manner in which public bodies outsource home care services the purchasing practices . The delivery method and the number of providers impact the information position of the municipality versus the care provider in the triad .
