 Visiting friends and relatives travellers have often been categorised based on their purpose of travel and their use of accommodations . This study focuses on the non VFR category defined by these two factors and on the investigation of hidden VFR travellers in the non VFR category . A total of 500 Japanese participants who met their friends or relatives in five major English speaking destinations completed an online survey . Using the two criteria 164 were categorised as VFRs whereas the others were grouped into the non VFR category . Among the non VFR travellers there was a group that shared similar characteristics with the VFR travellers . The result implies that there are HVFRs in the non VFR category . To expand the current understanding and concept of VFR travellers this study proposes an additional criterion for categorising VFR namely the influence of VFR hosts .

@highlight Travel purpose and accommodation type cannot define some VFR travellers.
@highlight The influence of VFR hosts is an additional VFR definitional factor.
@highlight The influence of VFR hosts excavates hidden VFR travellers.
@highlight Approximately 25 of the non VFRs can be categorised as hidden VFR travellers.
@highlight Hidden VFR travellers more often visit their friends than their relatives.
