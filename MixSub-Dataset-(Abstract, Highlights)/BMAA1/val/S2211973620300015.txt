 There are shortcomings in studying tourist satisfaction from the direct effect of travel motivation . The current study constructed an integrated model of motivation satisfaction towards a heritage destination with the addition of experience related factors and destination image . Unlike previous studies mainly focusing on pre or after the experience this research employed a survey aiming at tourists during their on site experiences . By using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling the proposed structural model was tested with a sample of 352 visitors at Hoi An UNESCO World Heritage Site Vietnam . Motivation had significant effects on visitor engagement visitor experience and heritage destination image which in turn led to heritage tourists satisfaction . The indirect link between motivation and satisfaction was also confirmed contributing to a better understanding of the formation of satisfaction in the context of heritage tourism . Practical implications are provided for Destination Management Organizations of heritage sites .
