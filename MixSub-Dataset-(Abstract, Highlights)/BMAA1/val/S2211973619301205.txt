 This paper explores the association between brand importance and growth in museum visitors . We analyzed 10years of online forum discussions and applied the Semantic Brand Score to assess the brand importance of five European Museums . Our Naive Bayes and regression models indicate that variations in the combined dimensions of the SBS are aligned with changes in museum visitors . Results suggest that in order to attract more visitors museum brand managers should focus on increasing the volume of online posting and the richness of information generated by users around the brand rather than controlling for the posts overall positivity or negativity .
