 This study compares the perspectives of government agencies academic experts and tourism suppliers on providing tourists with tsunami risk information . Previous studies highlight that government agencies are often in charge of developing tourism oriented risk communication plans academic experts are recognized as having a more in depth understanding of the technical aspects of a risk as well as the hazard development and potential effects and tourism suppliers play a fundamental role during the risk communication process due to direct connection with the tourists . However tourists are often found to be insufficiently informed about risks and warning systems . We use the Mental Models approach aiming to analyze the communication between the aforementioned categories of stakeholders . We carried out interviews and conducted field trips in Japan between April and December of 2018 . Results highlight an increased general awareness regarding tourists preparedness poorly supported by risk communication gaps misperceptions and a lack of efficacy analyses .
