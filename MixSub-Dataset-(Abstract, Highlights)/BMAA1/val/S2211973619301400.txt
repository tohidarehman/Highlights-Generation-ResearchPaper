 This study aims to provide a comprehensive network analysis to understand the current state of big data research in tourism by investigating multi disciplinary contributions relevant to big data . A comprehensive network analytical method which includes co citation clustering and trend analysis is applied to systematically analyse publications from 2008 to 2017 . Two unique data sets from Web of Science are collected . The first data set focuses on big data research in tourism and hospitality . The second data set involves other disciplines such as computer science for a comparison with tourism . Results suggest that applications of social media and user generated content are gaining momentum whereas theory based studies on big data in tourism remain limited . Tourism and other relevant domains have similar concerns with the challenges involved in big data such as privacy data quality and appropriate data use . This comparative network analysis has implications for future big data research in tourism .
