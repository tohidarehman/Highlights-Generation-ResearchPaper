This study focuses on how cruise companies can develop a solid relationship with their passengers by examining four dimensions of experiential value and their impact on well being and passengers value co creation behavior . Experiential value consists of four dimensions playfulness aesthetics consumer return on investment and service excellence . A structural equation model delineating relationships among experiential value well being and value co creation was developed and tested with 292 luxury cruise passengers .
