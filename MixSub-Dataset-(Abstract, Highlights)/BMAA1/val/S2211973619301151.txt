 This study empirically investigated the effects of temporal construal upon the compromise effect the extent to which the importance of price and quality attributes to selecting a compromised option changed over time and the malleability of the influence of the temporal construal heuristic by changing the time parameters . Three hundred and ninety four questionnaires were used for further data analysis . The study s results suggested that the compromise effect was present in the tourism context but with weakened effectiveness when the time frame in which the purchase can be used was moved back . The importance of price and quality was different between those groups who selected each of three options . The importance of price level in selecting a middle option was not different in terms of temporal construal but the quality level was a more important consideration in selecting a middle option for future use than for use today .
