 Psychological capital of tourism business owners and managers in the face of adversity has received scant attention . This study explores how the four components of PsyCap affect organizational resilience in a post quake environment . Using a case study approach and in depth interviews with small tourism business owners and managers in Kaikoura New Zealand we found that problem focused and emotion focused coping mechanisms enabled participants to activate PsyCap components to build organizational resilience . Realistic optimism of owners and managers for example fuelled problem focused coping strategies that led to greater situation awareness of changes in both the internal and external business environment . The findings have implications for small tourism businesses as they navigate the recovery process following major disasters .
