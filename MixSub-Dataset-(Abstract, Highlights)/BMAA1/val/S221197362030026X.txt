 Given the minimal attention that researchers have given to how various stakeholders contribute to festival experiencescapes in destination settings this paper examines how an intangible cultural heritage experiencescape is constructed focusing on a local and national level listed heritage item in Macau . In depth stakeholder interviews are conducted to identify involvement in the event by government officials organizers performers shop owners and tourists . Organizers and performers were found to play key roles in delivering experiences and the researchers determined that participation by most visitors is spontaneous . Government plays a supporting and coordinating role with local community representatives engaging actively in operational aspects . The participation by local shop owners in creating the experiencescape is modest . This study contributes to knowledge by proposing an ICH experiencescape framework that conveys a multidimensional scape concept and shows the progressive formation and refinement of experiences before during and after visitation .
