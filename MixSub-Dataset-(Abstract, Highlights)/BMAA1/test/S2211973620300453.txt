 More people are choosing to include their pets and companion animals in their holidays but provision for and understanding of nonhuman travellers remain limited . Multispecies tourism provides opportunity for the creation of rich personally meaningful experiences that are key to satisfaction but also has potential for producing stress and disappointment . The limited field of multispecies tourism tends to focus on dogs whereas this paper considers some of the different issues raised when humans and horses holiday together . Auto ethnographic vignettes of human horse partnerships on holiday are used to consider questions of interspecies trust and relationships as enacted through tourism and to reflect on some of the complexities and contradictions inherent in these practices . These tourism activities prompt consideration of what makes a good holiday and for whom as well as some of the power relations inherent in multispecies tourism .
