 Due to fast paced developments in the technological sphere we witness robots becoming commonplace in hospitality . While research has focused on technical and functional aspects of robots the ways in which robots could become effective members of human service teams are less understood . By taking a human robot interaction lens this study investigates the impact of integrating non human service providers into human teams with a focus on trust . A qualitative focus group approach with the LEGO Serious Play method is employed to open novel avenues in tourism research and to build visualise and distil what human robot interaction in hospitality frontline teams could look like . The study s contribution is a conceptual framework that reveals three dominant factors of trust and their sub dimensions necessary for successful future human robot interaction in frontline teams in tourism hospitality and the wider service sector .
