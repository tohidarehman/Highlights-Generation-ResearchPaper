 The timelines of planning theory and the approaches to tourism planning are compared from the early twentieth century to the present . The researchers address two specific questions what are the links between these two timelines and what are the contributions to tourism planning knowledge Unlike general planning theory a distinctive business and profitability ethos influenced foundation tourism approaches until the impacts of the sector prompted attention to the need for more stakeholder communication and attention to sustainability concerns . Now communication based planning and sustainability imperatives tend to co exist in both domains with strong roles for stakeholder involvement and compartmentalized plans in tourism . Disciplinary contributions from geography and politics are more marked in general planning theory while business and marketing orientations infuse the tourism perspectives . Tourism planning knowledge is usefully contextualized and advanced by considering generic planning theory but remains very substantially influenced by tourism industry issues and shocks .
