The results show that the park has become significantly more effective than before and the policy is compatible with Kaldor Hicks efficiency . Local residents tourists and the catering and retail businesses in and around the park have been the main beneficiaries while local authorities and state owned enterprises have borne most of the costs . The original cost benefit scenario has been disrupted . Key policy implications for managerial practice and contributions to scholarly knowledge are discussed .
