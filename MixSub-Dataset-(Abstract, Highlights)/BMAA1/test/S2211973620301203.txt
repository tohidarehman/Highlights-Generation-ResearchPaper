 The principal aim of this paper is to establish a Spa Assessment Model to help assess the current use and tourism potential of spas as tourism products as well as for determining spa visitor preferences . This was achieved through the inclusion of tourism experts who assisted in choosing the subindicators for the model and with the help of visitors who gave their opinion about the importance of each subindicator through a survey . Afterwards this data was analyzed and compared between two market segments in order to reveal their preferences . Results indicate the main differences between two market segments and reveal their preferences which further enables the spa management to create a tailor made product best suited to a certain market segment .
