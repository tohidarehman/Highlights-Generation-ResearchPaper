 Holiday camping and time spent in outdoor environments are critical childhood experiences . This study aims to identify the outcomes and processes underlying children s experiences of holiday camping . The researchers use the contextual model of learning as the theoretical background underpinning the study . Chinese children who left their families and participated in structured camping trips formed as the research respondents . Several child centred research methods including participant observation focus group discussions and interviews based on elicited drawings were employed to study the children s construction of their experiences . Children mainly reported positive camping outcomes including enhanced interpersonal skills improved self awareness general knowledge and skills and positive emotions . Negative outcomes including feelings of anxiety and boredom were also occasionally observed . The ongoing interplay of personal social and physical contexts works together to generate these camping outcomes . Practical and theoretical implications are offered to enhance positive outcomes and reduce negative ones when children go camping .
