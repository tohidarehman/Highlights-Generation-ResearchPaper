 The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between justice perceptions of hotel employees in international hotels and work related variables such as organizational commitment and organizational citizenship behaviours . The hypotheses were examined by collecting data from over 200 employees currently working for eight international upscale hotels located in the Canary Islands during the economic crisis period with a high unemployment level . This paper proposes multiple dimensions of employee justice organizational commitment and citizenship behaviours which allows for identifying the relative importance of justice concepts to explain various aspects of organizational outcomes . While distributive justice and interactional justice have positive influences on continuous and affective commitments only distributive justice leads to normative commitment . Continuous commitment is a specific type which positively influences all three types of organizational citizenship behaviours . The discussion sections indicate theoretical and practical implications of the findings .
