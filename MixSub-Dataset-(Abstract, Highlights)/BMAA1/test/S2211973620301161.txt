 This study investigates the factors influencing food experiences perceived by food tourists in the context of a food museum and its associated restaurant . A qualitative exploratory approach was employed using Chinese tourists visiting Hangzhou Cuisine Museum in Zhejiang province . This research finds that food tourists look for knowledge accumulation and gastronomic experiences when visiting a food museum and restaurant complex and each experience is formed by both tourist and setting factors . The findings highlight the significant and more complex engagement of setting factors in the museum restaurants .

This paper discusses broad implications for food experience design at food museums and restaurants as emerging tourism attractions .
