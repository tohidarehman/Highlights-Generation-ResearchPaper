 This paper aims to examine the role of economic policy uncertainty on tourism investments across the samples of OECD non OECD high income upper middle income and low income economies . We account for cross sectional dependence and endogeneity and also incorporate economic development financial development and trade openness indicators in the analyses . By using annual data between 1996 and 2016 and a total of 101 countries we provide robust estimates on the determinants of tourism investments . The findings from the Common Correlated Effects Mean Group and the Group Mean approaches show that the EPU has a significant negative impact on tourism investments across the panels . Moreover other estimates suggest that economic development financial development and trade positively contribute to tourism investments .
