 Blue Flag is one of the most renowned tourism ecolabels in the world . Although this ecolabel is based primarily on environmental education and management it is argued that its core strength is the capacity to trigger political will . This paper presents the BF implementation process in a country through application of a BF Readiness Matrix and interviews with key stakeholders in eight coastal municipalities in Colombia . The matrix used 87 items to assess the level of compliance of 12 beaches with each of the 33 BF criteria . The challenges faced in the implementation of BF are presented and discussed . Because they are not unique to Colombia the results and conclusions are applicable to many low and middle income countries that historically have not committed to the management of tourist beaches . The conclusions underline the capacity of BF to raise political will to support beach management and generate specific management actions .
