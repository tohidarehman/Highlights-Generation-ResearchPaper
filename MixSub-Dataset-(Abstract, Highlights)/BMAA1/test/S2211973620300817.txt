 The aim of this study is twofold to explore whether board characteristics lead to greater corporate social responsibility performance and to test whether CSR performance enhances firms financial performance in the hospitality and tourism industry . Data were collected from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database for the H T firms listed there between 2011 and 2018 . We employed panel data analysis after which we ran robustness tests . The results indicated that having a CSR committee and female directors on the board are robust factors driving firms to show superior CSR performance in all dimensions including environmental social and governance . Independent directors and directors diligence selectively enhance the overall CSR score and individual pillars of CSR . Investigating the relationship between CSR performance and firms financial performance did not produce a significant outcome . The findings propose a straightforward roadmap for H T firms and policymakers to identify characteristics of CSR friendly boards .
