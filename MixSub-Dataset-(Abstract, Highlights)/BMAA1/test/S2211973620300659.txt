 Quality in cultural heritage attractions is mainly approached from the visitors satisfaction perspective and the literature does not contain a clear definition of quality in the management of cultural heritage sites open to the public . The present study aims to reframe this trend . By way of theoretical contribution we propose a definition of quality in cultural heritage attractions management based on dimensions such as the capacity of preserving the cultural assets the ability to communicate effectively their significance the quality of commodification for visitor use and the ability to boost intercultural competence and promote intercultural dialogue . Based on the above an empirical qualitative study was conducted on the cultural heritage managers current perceptions of quality . The results suggest that a profound asymmetry exists among practitioners opinions and practices and four types of cultural heritage managers were defined with regard to their perception of quality Reactionary Reticent Pragmatic Enthusiastic .
