 Although postcolonial analyses examining the sexualized imagery of women in tourism have been conducted previous studies have predominantly focused on gender and colonialism from a patriarchal perspective . By doing so other colonial power asymmetries such as race class and ethnicity have often been neglected . This paper mobilises postcolonial feminist theory to expand the existing analyses and discourses concerning gendered representations in tourism . Through a narrative analysis of the images published in the official Instagram page of Sri Lanka s Ministry of Tourism we contend that the images produced and circulated to promote Sri Lanka in many instances echo essentialist gendered binaries . However as the images tend to produce and reiterate Sri Lankan national identity through a hegemonic Sinhalese Buddhist discourse they also show the intersections between gender and other asymmetries of power in reproducing colonial gendered identities .
