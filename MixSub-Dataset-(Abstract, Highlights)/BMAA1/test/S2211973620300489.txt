 This article examines the VFR tourism behaviour of international PhD students in New Zealand . Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used . The results showed considerable participation of international PhD students in VFR tourism during their studies although at relatively low travel frequency . Students undertook a wide range of activities when travelling to visit their friends and relatives and often stayed with the visited friends or relatives . The findings also indicate a number of travel behavioural differences and similarities between the VF and VR categories . The study recognises potential growth of non traditional forms of VFR tourism such as VFR tourism in a third place and VFR in transit . A conceptual framework was proposed to help describe spatial flows of VFR tourism . Overall this paper adds to the understanding of the VFR tourism phenomenon in the global mobile context .
