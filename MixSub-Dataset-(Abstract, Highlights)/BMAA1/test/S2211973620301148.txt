 The tourism industry faces multiple changes . Because of this vulnerability as evidenced by the COVID 19 pandemic the study of hotel resilience is a key issue for the survival and competitiveness of organisations and destinations . Therefore this paper proposes a holistic model to measure organisational resilience . To that end it aims to analyse the determinants of organisational resilience i.e . predictors of resilience and to assess how they contribute to hotel resilience and performance . Firstly the hotel context in the Canary Islands is examined to identify the level of impact frequency and predictability of each type of change . Secondly scales development and validation were conducted . Finally the proposed model is validated . Findings confirm that the strategy and change dimensions have a considerable effect on hotel resilience which positively influences hotel performance . Discussion provides hotel managers with guidelines to improve organisational resilience and performance .
