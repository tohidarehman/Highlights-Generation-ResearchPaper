 Destination management processes continue to undergo substantial change and managers now need to demonstrate a social presence and balance the interests of businesses host communities and a wide range of other stakeholders . Advocacy and community leadership have become increasingly important but little is known about the implementation of these functions within destination management . The aim of this paper is to explore how advocacy and community leadership feature in destination management and how they interrelate with other destination management functions . Empirical data were gathered through a series of in depth interviews amongst destination management practitioners in Estonia . The study advances our understanding of how practitioners conceptualise and enact advocacy and community leadership in destination management . A framework for advocacy and community leadership within destination management is proposed to depict the interdependencies with other destination management functions .
