 Arts led revitalization projects are increasingly being undertaken in South Korean cities to improve residential areas in decline . One of the more common initiatives involves the beautification of residential neighbourhoods through mural art . Seoul s Ihwa Mural Village is one of the most representative examples of the murals based regeneration trend . The residential area s transformation by artists in 2006 has made it one of the most popular murals tourism destinations albeit to the displeasure of a segment of the local population . In 2016 two of Ihwa Village s most iconic murals were destroyed by several residents . This paper explores the context behind the incident through in depth interviews with key stakeholders . Our research reveals that the Ihwa mural incident was not simply a local reaction to overtourism but also a response to the perceived unequal economic benefits accruing from the murals tourism . We offer recommendations for policy makers considering similar revitalization projects in residential neighbourhoods .
