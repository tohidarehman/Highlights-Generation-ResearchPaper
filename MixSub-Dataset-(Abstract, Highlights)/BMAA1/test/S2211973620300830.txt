 National culture can affect consumer behaviour but there is limited empirical evidence to establish the exact magnitude of this effect in particular consumption contexts and in specific consumption markets . This paper contributes to knowledge by exploring and comparing the extent to which national culture may contribute to pro environmental behaviour of tourists in the UK and China . By drawing upon the five dimensions or values of national culture proposed by Hofstede Schwartz and Trompenaars and Hampden Turner and by applying the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling the study establishes the causal relationships between the cultural backgrounds of tourists their environmental knowledge pro environmental attitudes and pro environmental behavioural intentions . The implications for policy making management and future research are discussed .
