 Tourists are essential to a destination s social and economic recovery following disaster reducing future risk and enhancing resilience . Drawing on the results of visitor surveys in Kaikura New Zealand we analyse visitors experiences and their consideration of natural hazard risk and response abilities in relation to a damaging earthquake in the region in 2016 . Despite widespread national media and significant disruption findings suggest the disaster had very little impact on visitors perceptions and experiences and did not translate into greater preparedness . Instead tourists reported only limited knowledge about what to do or where to go in the event of a natural hazard event . Results suggest tourists resilience and Kaikura s resilience as a whole would be enhanced by improving knowledge sharing and awareness building . Furthermore by considering tourists as part of a linked social ecological system targeted interventions to improve understanding of natural hazards can support long term recovery trajectories and minimize future losses .
