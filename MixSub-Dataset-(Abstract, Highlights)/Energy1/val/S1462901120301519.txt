 The Catchment Based Approach was established in 2013 to drive collaborative water management across England . Globally unique in its national coverage CaBA encompasses 106 river catchment partnerships that either incorporate or work with a range of cross sector partner organisations including environmental organisations Government agencies water companies local authorities businesses and civil society . The partnerships work through consensus to build social capital and deliver environmental improvements . Because of the variety of stakeholders and interests represented partnerships attract a range of funds multiplying the core monies they receive from Government . A National Support group several thematic working groups and a team of technical specialists help to build expertise within partnerships . Supported by data and evidence including that derived through citizen science the partnerships have developed catchment plans that capture priorities for action . Challenges of legitimacy funding integration with Englands wider water management framework and the monitoring of outcomes remain . Future opportunities exist including closer alignment with academia and the potential for CaBA to undertake a key role in delivering the UK Governments 25 Year Environment Plan . Several lessons learnt from the CaBA approach may be applicable internationally .
