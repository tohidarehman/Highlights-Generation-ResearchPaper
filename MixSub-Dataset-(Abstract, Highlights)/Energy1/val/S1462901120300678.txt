 This paper introduces a novel triple bottom line sustainability assessment to evaluate the water energy food nexus of desalination for agriculture . Falling technology costs and rising water scarcity worldwide make desalination an increasingly attractive proposition and agriculture is one of the main sectors grappling with its potential impacts . To explore this issue we combine a wide range of primary and secondary environmental economic and social data with a triple bottom line WEF nexus analysis to demonstrate both the holistic sustainability impacts of desalination for agriculture and the multi sectoral policy environment within which desalination is adopted . We apply this approach to 54 privately owned desalination plants that treat brackish groundwater for agricultural use in the San Quintn Valley of Baja California Mexico . We find that subsidized energy for local agribusinesses plays an important role in making desalination economically viable in the region . This in turn fuels a large agricultural export industry that represents a significant virtual water transfer to the US market . Rapid population growth in the area driven by agricultural labor needs exacerbates the issues of social equity and sustainability that these subsidies and transfers raise . We conclude with a discussion of how to manage these identified trade offs across the water energy food nexus .

@highlight We use a novel triple bottom line water energy food nexus methodology.
@highlight We evaluate sustainability of desalination for agriculture in San Quintn Mexico.
@highlight Energy subsidies play a key role in making desalination economically viable.
@highlight Desalination and other technologies have intensified labor migration and water use.
@highlight Desalination is currently unsustainable but with potential for policy intervention.
