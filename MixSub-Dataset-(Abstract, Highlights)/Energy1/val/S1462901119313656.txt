 Plastic pollution is a global environmental concern and several approaches have been implemented seeking to reduce and control releases of plastic waste especially in marine environments . Recently disclosure of data on occurrence of single use plastic straws among the litter collected in beach cleaning campaigns unleashed a worldwide movement that resulted on banning of these items in several countries . The market then quickly began to offer sustainable solutions as the professed biodegradable plastic straws . However cases of greenwashing added to current limitations related to the technical standards used to attest biodegradability of commercial plastic products may lead these measures to be largely ineffective . Herein a case study assessing the composition of plastic straws marketed in Brazil and United States under false claims of biodegradability was used as background for discussion of this neglected issue which goes far beyond plastics straws . Thus although some local regulations have already banned single use plastic products additional actions in regional and global scales should be implemented especially concerning proper labeling of the alleged biodegradable products . Therefore from a multi dimensional perspective and considering the resistance of the powerful plastic industry multiple management strategies focused on educating people in the matters of deciding purchases based on correct labeling and properly discarding the waste are possibly our best chance to drive a positive global environmental change . Additionally we also suggest the inclusion of this relevant subject among the tasks proposed by the Basel Convention Partnership on Plastic Waste .

@highlight So called biodegradable plastics and greenwashing are issues of environmental concern.
@highlight Cases of false claims of biodegradability in plastic products are becoming frequent.
@highlight Appropriate labeling rules for biodegradable products should be implemented.
