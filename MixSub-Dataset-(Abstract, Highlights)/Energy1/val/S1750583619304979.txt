 This study investigates the mass transfer intensification in the absorption of carbon dioxide into a monoethanolamine solution enhanced by TiO

@highlight This study investigates the feasibility of using nanoparticles in MEA solution in an RPB to intensify CO
@highlight absorption.
@highlight Significant enhancement in K
@highlight a was observed by adding TiO
@highlight nanoparticles into MEA solution in the RPB.
@highlight Due to the high rotational speed in the RPB and severe turbulence no sedimentation of nanoparticles was observed.
