 Carbon dioxide capture and storage combined with enhanced deep saline water recovery is a potential approach to mitigate climate change . However its investment has been a dilemma due to high costs and various uncertainties . In this study a trinomial tree modelling based real options approach is constructed to assess the investment in CCS EWR retrofitting for direct coal liquefaction in China from the investor perspective . In this approach the uncertainties in CO

@highlight The real options approach is used to assess CCS EWR investment decisions.
@highlight The critical CER price for CCS EWR is 7.15 CNY ton higher than that for CCS.
@highlight EWR with exemption from water resource fees has a potential investment economy.
@highlight The investment feasibility is not optimistic.
