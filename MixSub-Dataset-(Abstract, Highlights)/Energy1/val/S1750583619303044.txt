 An in situ FT IR based quantitative analysis model has been designed to track the internal state of solvent mixtures in a CO

@highlight In situ FT IR quantitative analysis for amine based solvent mixtures is implemented.
@highlight The neural network is used for the regression to reflect the nonlinearity of data.
@highlight PCA and POD are applied to reduce the redundancy and dimension of raw data.
@highlight Model performance is checked by leave one out cross validation and in situ test set.
