 Most indicators of airport performance found in the literature evaluate the quality of the services and the maintenance of operational safety levels but only a few studies take into account environmental issues . This study presents the experience of the Brazilian Airport Infrastructure Enterprise in the implementation and assessment of the Infraero Environmental Performance Index formed by 25 indicators distributed into 10 environmental dimensions . The index was applied to 54 Brazilian public airports administrated by Infraero between 2017 and 2019 . The index was also applied to groups of airports according to their category defined by the Brazilian Civil Aviation Regulation n 153 IEPI

@highlight Airport environmental performance index in Brazil had average annual evolution of 5 .
@highlight Large airports presented better environmental performance values.
