 Zhundong coalfield occupies an important position in Chinese energy resource . However the high sodium content has become the hindrance for the safe use of Zhundong coal leading to severe fouling and slagging issues . Oxy fuel combustion is a clean combustion technology and beneficial for capturing CO

@highlight Effects of oxy fuel combustion on fouling and slagging issues were investigated.
@highlight The influential mechanism of oxygen content on slagging was explored.
@highlight Element and mineral species of slag were similar in air and oxy fuel cases.
@highlight Slagging was worse with the increase of flue gas temperature and oxygen content.
