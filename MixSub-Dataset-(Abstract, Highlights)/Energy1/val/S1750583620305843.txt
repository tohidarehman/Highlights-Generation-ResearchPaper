 How would high angle normal faults be reactivated under a present day strike slip tectonic regime if reservoir pore pressure increased during injection operations What parameters would control shear slip localization To answer these questions 3D one way coupled reservoir geomechanical modeling of potential fault reactivation in the St. Lawrence Platform Quebec is performed . We evaluate the risk of shear failure along the pre existing subsurface Yamaska high angle normal fault under the present day strike slip tectonic regime . Slip may be generated by pressure perturbations in deep saline aquifers of the Early Paleozoic sedimentary basin this has implications for the assessment of risks associated with CO

@highlight Strike slip slip reactivation of a high angle normal fault caused by fluid injection.
@highlight Reservoir pore pressure buildup 8 MPa results in dextral slip along a normal fault.
@highlight The non planar fault geometry and the rock properties determine stress localization.
@highlight Plastic shear strain is localized on optimally oriented fault segments.
@highlight 3D reservoir geomechanical modeling helps quantify the risk of fault reactivation.
