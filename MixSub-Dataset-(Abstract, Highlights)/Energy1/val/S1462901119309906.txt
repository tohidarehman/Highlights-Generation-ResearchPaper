 Citizen Science has been emerging in the last decade as a new field of environmental monitoring involving a direct collaboration between everyday citizens and scientists . In Tunisia several recent governmental efforts aimed at reinforcing and renovating the existing official water monitoring systems . However the lack of reliable hydrological data is still an issue which could be better addressed through integrating a CS approach . The latter approach is tested for rainfall monitoring in the Medjerda catchment in Tunisia using cost effective and publicly available manual rain gauges . We used a step by step approach to target engage and train citizens on using the monitoring tools and transmitting the data to a user friendly online platform . The ongoing approach involved 7 citizens from different generations and different educational backgrounds . The collected daily CS data are compared with data from reference stations . Results yield a significant correlation between CS data collected at 3 different sites and the reference stations with r ranges between 0.91 and 0.98 for all citizens . Students

@highlight A citizen science CS based method was applied to monitor rainfall in a test region.
@highlight A step by step approach was used to engage citizens from different generations.
@highlight Field training was provided to volunteers to guarantee consistent monitoring.
@highlight Statistical analysis validated the quality of the CS data compared to reference ones.
