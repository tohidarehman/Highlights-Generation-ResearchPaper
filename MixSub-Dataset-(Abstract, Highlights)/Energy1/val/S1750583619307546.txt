 Carbon capture and storage would contribute considerably towards climate change mitigation if it would be implemented on a very large scale at many storage sites with substantial injection rates . Achieving high injection rates in deep saline aquifers requires a detailed assessment of injectivity performance and evaluation of the processes that alter the permeability of the near well region . One of the most common forms of the injectivity loss in the context of CO

@highlight We have suggested a compositional framework for modelling of salt precipitation during CO
@highlight storage in saline aquifers.
@highlight The evaporation process and ionic effects are incorporated via an accurate and reliable ePC SAFT fluid model.
@highlight Two different approaches for modelling of salt deposition i.e. kinetic or equilibrium are implemented and compared.
@highlight Two interrelated phenomena capillary back flow and self enhancing of salt growth are implemented via a novel formulation.
@highlight We showed that the extent of formation damage is primarily controlled by the porosity permeability relations.
