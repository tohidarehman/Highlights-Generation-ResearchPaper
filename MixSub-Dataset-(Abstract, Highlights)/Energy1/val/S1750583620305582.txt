 CCS is expected to play a sizeable role over the next several decades to drastically abate greenhouse gas emissions in the energy system by 2050 . With the integrated assessment model TIAM ECN we project how large its contribution could be in Europe in the power sector and industry and analyze how this contribution may be affected by cost decline and ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets . If Europe stays on track of achieving zero net emissions by mid century we find that CO

@highlight CCS applied to natural gas and biomass could then account for 25 of electricity generation.
@highlight Natural gas with CCS could contribute over 35 of energy use in industry.
@highlight Strict climate policy is a bigger driver of broad CCS diffusion than technology cost reductions.
@highlight A 30 CCS capital cost reduction could yield about 17 billion US yr energy system cost savings.
