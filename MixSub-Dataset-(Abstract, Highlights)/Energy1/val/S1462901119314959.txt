 Climate changes and associated impacts are placing pressure on institutions and the professionals working within them to become proactive and to plan for more extreme impacts in distant futures . Despite a growing recognition of the need for climate adaptation action there are limited assessment frameworks and strategic evaluation resources to support our understanding of regional adaptive capacity . We build on the literature and on information provided by climate adaptation experts to design a multi criterion framework called the Regional Fingerprint . This framework consists of five critical categories adopted actions institutional capacity research quality planning processes and regional collaboration and twenty one evaluation criteria . The framework is designed to uncover asymmetries between places identify opportunities for intervention and track progress in adaptive capacity . We further applied this framework to regions in California to test its viability and glean insights into the frameworks capacity to generate new and useful policy relevant information . Through this work we find that the Regional Fingerprint offers insights into adaptive capacity and can be used to highlight critical areas for strategic intervention by state and local planners .

@highlight The role of governance institutions and management in regional adaptive capacity is emphasized.
@highlight A framework to assesses regional adaptive capacity of governance systems is proposed.
@highlight Framework encompasses adopted actions institutional capacity research quality planning processes and collaboration.
@highlight Insights from the assessment include asymmetries between places and opportunities for interventions.
@highlight Provides a foundation and method for future assessments in other places and contexts.
