 Chemical Looping Gasification is a promising technology to produce syngas from renewable biomass material without the need for upstream air separation . It has been proposed as an innovative scheme for eliminating the tar through hot gas cleaning after biomass is gasified . Lignin is the main component of biomass and the second most abundant organic material on the planet . Also lignin is a waste by product from integrated bio refineries . Four bimetallic oxygen carriers CaFe
