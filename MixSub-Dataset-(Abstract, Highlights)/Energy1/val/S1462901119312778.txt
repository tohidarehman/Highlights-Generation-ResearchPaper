 Achieving the objectives of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Conservation and Enhancement of Forest Carbon Stocks and Sustainable Management of Forests in developing countries will remain an aspiration unless and until the historical contributions of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities to the state and management of forests are recognised and respected . REDD is designed for developing countries where community based forest management systems are becoming increasingly popular . Using the case study of Nepal a pioneer of community forest management we show how the traditional users of Tarai forests are systemically excluded from mainstream CF practices and discuss the potential negative implications of not rewarding their historical contribution . Considering the scope provided by REDD benefit sharing plans and the greater number of developing countries involved in designing BSPs we argue that BSP offers a unique opportunity to recognize historical contributions of traditional users suggest specific provisions for channelling REDD benefits to the traditional users as a potential solution and conclude that the inability to provide such benefits may result in the failure of REDD on a broader scale nullifying global efforts for forest based climate change mitigation .

@highlight Knowledge and contribution of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities is critical in REDD success.
@highlight Benefit Sharing Plan BSP offers an opportunity to recognize historical contributions of traditional users.
@highlight Inability to resolve context specific benefit sharing issues may result in the failure of REDD .
@highlight Nepals BSP need to specify the monetary benefits to the traditional distant users of Tarai region.
