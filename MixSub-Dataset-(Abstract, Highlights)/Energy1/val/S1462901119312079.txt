 Phosphorus is a critical agricultural nutrient and a major pollutant in waterbodies due to inefficient use . In the form of rock phosphate it is a finite global commodity vulnerable to price shocks and sourcing challenges . Transforming toward sustainable phosphorus management involves local to global stakeholders . Conventional readings of stakeholders may not reflect system complexity leaving it difficult to see stakeholder roles in transformations . We attempt to remedy this issue with a novel stakeholder analysis method based on five qualitative pillars stakeholder agency system roles power and influence alignment to the problem and transformational potential . We argue that our approach suits case studies of individual stakeholders stakeholder groups and organisations with relationships to sustainability challenges .
