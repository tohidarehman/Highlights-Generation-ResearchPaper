 Using a novel agent based model we study how US withdrawal might influence the political process established by the Paris Agreement and hence the prospects for reaching the collective goal to limit warming below 2C . Our model enables us to analyze to what extent reaching this goal despite US withdrawal would place more stringent requirements on other core elements of the Paris cooperation process . We find first that the effect of a US withdrawal depends critically on the extent to which member countries reciprocate others promises and contributions . Second while the 2C goal will likely be reached only under a very small set of conditions in any event even temporary US withdrawal will further narrow this set significantly . Reaching this goal will then require other countries to step up their ambition at the first opportunity and to comply nearly 100 with their pledges while maintaining high confidence in the Paris Agreement s institutions . Third although a US withdrawal will first primarily affect the United States own emissions it will eventually prove even more detrimental to other countries emissions .

@highlight We use an agent based model to simulate future interaction under the Paris Agreement.
@highlight US withdrawal causes negative knock on effects on other countries emissions.
@highlight This detrimental effect is biggest under otherwise benign model settings.
@highlight Given re election of Trump 0.1 of model runs stay within the 2C carbon budget.
