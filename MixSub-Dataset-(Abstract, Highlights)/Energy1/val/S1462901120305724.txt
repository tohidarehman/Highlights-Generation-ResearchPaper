 In the face of global environmental change decision makers need effective environmental assessments to shape policies and plans aiming at sustainable human development . In this paper we propose a new approach to address the needs of Strategic Environmental Assessment . We develop a Limits Oriented Adaptive framework that is useful not only to recognize and address existing SEA problems but also to incorporate elements of social and institutional uncertainty . This framework conceptualizes the need to first identify existing SEA limitations through learning loops and then to address them with incremental or transformative change through adaptive cycles . The first part of this paper presents existing frameworks of adaptive policy making adaptive management and loops of learning that can contribute shaping better environmental assessments . In the second part we present our framework and we illustrate how the contributions from different disciplines relate to the procedural and technical sides of Strategic Environmental Assessment . Last we present the results of the experimental application of our method in an Australian and an Italian case study . We then discuss our findings outlining how SEA can learn from adaptive management to overcome its limitations and to embrace incremental and transformational change . We tie these lessons to the needs of different groups of SEA professionals developers legislators and the broad public .
