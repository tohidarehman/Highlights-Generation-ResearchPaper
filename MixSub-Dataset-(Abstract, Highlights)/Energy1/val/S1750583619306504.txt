 Hydrocarbon gas emissions from with decommissioned wells are an underreported source of greenhouse gas emissions in oil and gas provinces . The associated emissions may partly counteract efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel infrastructure . We have developed an approach for assessing methane leakage from marine decommissioned wells based on a combination of existing regional industrial seismic and newly acquired hydroacoustic water column imaging data from the Central North Sea . Here we present hydroacoustic data which show that 28 out of 43 investigated wells release gas from the seafloor into the water column . This gas release largely depends on the presence of shallow gas accumulations and their distance to the wells . The released gas is likely primarily biogenic methane from shallow sources . In the upper 1 000m below the seabed gas migration is likely focused along drilling induced fractures around the borehole or through non sealing barriers . Combining available direct measurements for methane release from marine decommissioned wells with our leakage analysis suggests that gas release from investigated decommissioned hydrocarbon wells is a major source of methane in the North Sea kt yr
