 Aquaculture including marine aquaculture is the fastest growing food production sector globally and is expected to play a key role in delivering future food security . A potential factor limiting growth of the aquaculture industry however is the maintenance of good water quality on which all forms of aquaculture depend . This is particularly challenging in open coastal and estuarine systems and requires engagement with a wide range of stakeholders that can influence water quality . We applied a semi quantitative method to capture and evaluate perspectives across diverse stakeholders in order to address the overarching question How do stakeholders rank water quality issues and management options versus other issues and actions for ensuring the sustainability of shellfish mariculture in South West England Results from this regional case study were used to highlight key issues and knowledge gaps that have national and international relevance . Stakeholders were found to hold distinct perspectives but there was general consensus that good water quality is essential for sustainable aquaculture and that there is a need for better understanding of spatial and temporal variations in land use throughout catchments to ensure effective water quality management . Stakeholder engagement highlighted the importance of managing anthropogenic and environmental pressures on land and water through agri environment and urban planning policy in order to ensure sustainable food production including from mariculture .

@highlight Diverse stakeholders agree that water quality management is key to sustainable mariculture.
@highlight Stakeholders were found to hold one of three distinct perspectives P1 P3 .
@highlight P1 Downstream thinking focusing on managing sewer overflows affecting microbial quality.
@highlight P2 Broad view of upstream and downstream pressures on microbial and chemical quality.
@highlight P3 Upstream thinking for controlling diffuse and point source pollution from agricultural land.
