 The expansion of China s coal fired power industry is facing enormous pressure to reduce carbon emissions in the context of global decarbonization . Existing national level carbon accounting is insufficient to support developing carbon reduction policies and measures tailored for specific locations . In this study we conducted a spatially high resolution analysis to estimate life cycle carbon emissions from the coal fired power industry at the province level . The estimate is from a bottom up perspective including computing carbon emission factors for 22 coal fired power technologies based on the operation data of 47.8 of all units measuring provincial technology structures based on the information data of 99.7 of all ones and weighted calculating the above two terms . We also analyzed the carbon reduction potential of the coal fired power industry according to relevant measures by province . The estimate shows great differences in carbon emission factors of various technologies . The coupling of these factors with different technology structures causes significant variations of 0.9331.019kg CO

@highlight The information data of 99.7 and operation data of 47.8 of all coal fired power units in China are investigated.
@highlight Carbon emission factors of 22 coal fired power technologies and technology structures of 30 provinces is considered.
@highlight High resolution carbon emissions from the coal fired power industry at the province level are estimated.
@highlight The carbon reduction potential caused by technology structure optimization and energy conservation is analyzed.
