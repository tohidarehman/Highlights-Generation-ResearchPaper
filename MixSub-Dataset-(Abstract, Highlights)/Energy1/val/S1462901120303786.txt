 Marine spatial planning a process aimed at negotiating the spatial allocation of human activities at sea has to integrate new challenges arising from growing human activities and their impacts on threatened marine ecosystems . Yet humanwildlife interactions that result in threat to humans are rarely explicitly addressed in planning and almost not at all in MSP . Rare events of unprovoked shark bites can significantly impact local economies while leading to polarized social debates that often hinder the development of evidence based shark risk public policy . Here we suggest an approach for integrating shark risk and its management into MSP . The method addresses simultaneously the spatial social and ecological components of shark risk and its inherent uncertainties . The approach is applied on Reunion Island case study where shark risk management is implemented as a response to a rapid increase in the frequency of shark bite events over the past decade . Similar to other countries where shark risk management is implemented sharks removal is in the heart of social debate in Reunion Islands and data gaps provide a fertile ground for alternative discourses and social conflicts about shark risk . Through a structured public consultation involving 200 stakeholders we demonstrate how MSP can be used to address shark risk while considering multiple sea uses and conservation objectives . The results suggest that the approach is ideal both for integrating shark risk as a driver to the MSP process and for developing a transparent sustainable and evidence based shark risk public policy as it places shark risk management within a broader social ecological spectrum of stakes .
