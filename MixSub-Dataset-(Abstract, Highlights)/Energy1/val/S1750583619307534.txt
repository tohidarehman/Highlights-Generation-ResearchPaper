 This paper provides a discussion of the experimental results obtained at the amine based carbon capture pilot plant having the capacity of 200m

@highlight The split flow flow system allowed to achieve low reboiler heat duties in a wide range of column liquid to gas ratio.
@highlight For various flow configurations for systems having interheating the reboiler heat duties can be reduced.
@highlight In the interheated stripper reduces heat losses.
@highlight The lowest external condenser cooling stream needed for the split flow was achieved.
