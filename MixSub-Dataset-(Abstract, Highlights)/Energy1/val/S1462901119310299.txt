 This paper investigates how different dimensions of water water as a public health concern as an essential prerequisite for producing livelihoods and as a cultural heritage or an element of spiritual practice are taken up in international guidelines and certification schemes for the extractive sector . As a notoriously water intensive economic activity mining frequently infringes on other forms of water use . Simultaneously the legal articulations and governance implications of the hydrological aspects of mining are complex as commercial interactions associated with mining span the globe governance efforts occur primarily at the national level and negative externalities manifest locally . Increasingly transnational initiatives play a role in setting rules and norms for responsible or sustainable mining .

@highlight Increasingly transnational rule setting also occurs for the mining sector.
@highlight Provisions for the protection of water resources are not always included.
@highlight Water is mostly treated as a public health concern sometimes as an economic good.
@highlight The cultural dimension of water resources often remains unacknowledged.
@highlight Newer certification schemes and guidelines tend to be more comprehensive.
