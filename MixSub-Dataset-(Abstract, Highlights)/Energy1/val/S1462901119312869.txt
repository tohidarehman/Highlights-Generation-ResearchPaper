 Contemporary socio environmental problems such as the reduced availability of natural resources the loss of biodiversity soil degradation pollution an unprecedented population growth the mass migration of people to cities and urban sprawl may be associated with the consequences of an economic infinite growth paradigm on a finite planet . Despite international goals for improving the spatial and environmental management current and future developments are continuously planned without the consideration of the biophysical limits to growth . This could be equated with the environmental carrying capacity a concept and a tool for the sustainable development of human settlements . This research use the environmental indicators such as Ecological Footprint and biocapacity for ECC quantification . Despite EF and BC accounting is well developed at the global national and regional levels there is still lack of local urban standard for EF assessment . Therefore the main goal of this study is to present the local approach for EF assessment and its potential to use for ECC assessment at local level . The study compares the hybrid EF which joined the bottom up CF with the remaining EFs components from a top down approach with the standard top down EF approach . In this study the assessment focused mainly on household consumption which could be equated as main driver responsible for Ecological Footprint . Thus the impact of household consumption was quantified according to four categories reflecting resources use and waste generation as

@highlight The EF and BC were applied for environmental carrying capacity assessment.
@highlight Hybrid EF joining bottom up CF with remaining top down EF components was presented.
@highlight Proper correspondence between TD and BU categories avoids risk of double counting.
@highlight The quality of input data should be assessed to determine best outcome combination.
@highlight A hybrid datasets can be a cost effective approach relevant to local policy.
