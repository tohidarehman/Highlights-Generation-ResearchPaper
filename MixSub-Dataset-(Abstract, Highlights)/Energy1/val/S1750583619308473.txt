 In order to achieve the Paris Agreement target of well below 2 degrees centigrade goal developed countries have committed to reducing their emissions considerably during the coming decades . In order to achieve the ambitious target of an 80 CO

@highlight A whole system energy analysis study is conducted using the TIMES Japan framework.
@highlight The model follows a least cost optimization approach.
@highlight The minimum amount of CCS capacity varies between 5 and 150 MtCO
@highlight by 2050 under different scenarios.
@highlight The minimum CCS capacity to achieve the emission target is heavily affected by availability of hydrogen imports and EAF.
@highlight There is no feasible scenario that achieves emission reduction goals without CCS.
