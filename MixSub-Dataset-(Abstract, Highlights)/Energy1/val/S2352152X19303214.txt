 The development of smart micro grids makes the use of new and green technologies like plug in electric vehicles more suitable . The plug in electric vehicles can play a role in storing energy due to their network connection capability . The smart micro grid can use this stored energy to reduce its operating cost . In this paper a new mechanism based on the contractual agreements between the owners of plug in electric vehicles and the smart micro grid is proposed to provide the system s energy during the operating day . The proposed model enables plug in electric vehicles parked in official parking to be integrated into the operation of smart micro grid and earn revenue . The operation optimization is formulated as a two stage stochastic mixed integer linear problem and is implemented on energy management of a typical smart micro grid as a case study . The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed design for both smart micro grid and plug in electric vehicles in the case of expected cost reduction . Also the performance of the stochastic model for uncertainty handling is shown by the value of the stochastic solution .

@highlight A two stage model based on bilateral contracts was presented for providing required storage energy.
@highlight Plug in electric vehicles PEVs voluntarily participate in the contracts.
@highlight The impact of the proposed energy storage contract ESC on the smart micro grid MG operation was investigated.
@highlight The uncertainty of different parameters was considered by stochastic scenarios.
@highlight The proposed model was formulated as a two stage mixed integer linear stochastic optimization.
