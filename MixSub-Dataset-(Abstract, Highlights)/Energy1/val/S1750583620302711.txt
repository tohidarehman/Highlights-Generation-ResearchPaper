 The removal of nitrogen oxides under a high pressure has been widely accepted as an effective method for the treatment of oxy fuel combustion flue gas . The high pressure promotes the oxidation of NO to NO

@highlight Multiparameter optimization was proposed in modeling nitrogen oxides absorption.
@highlight Nitrogen mass balance based on measurements was achieved with a relative error8 .
@highlight Five pressure dependent critical parameters of the modeling were investigated.
