 Carbon Capture and Storage has the potential to make a significant contribution to the mitigation of climate change however there is a regulatory and societal obligation to demonstrate storage robustness and minimal local environmental impact . This requires an understanding of environmental impact potential and detectability of a range of hypothetical leak scenarios . In the absence of a significant body of real world release experiments this study collates the results of 86 modelled scenarios of offshore marine releases derived from five different model systems . This synthesis demonstrates a consistent generalised relationship between leak rate detectability and impact potential of a wide range of hypothetical releases from CO

@highlight Models show consistent relationship between release rate and environmental footprint.
@highlight Models deliver a first order environmental impact assessment for consenting purposes.
@highlight Detection is possible well below levels which would undermine storage performance.
@highlight Detection is possible well below levels imparting significant environmental impact.
