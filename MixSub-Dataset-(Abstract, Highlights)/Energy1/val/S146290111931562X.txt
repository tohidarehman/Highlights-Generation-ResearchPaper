 High water availability enhances agricultural performance and food security . However many countries where water is abundant according to hydrological indicators face difficulties in the utilization of water in agriculture being in a situation of economic water scarcity due to lack of institutional and material means for water management and governance . EWS faces a stronger challenge of measurability if compared to physical water scarcity . Since the Sustainable Development Goal Indicator on Integrated management of domestic and transboundary water resources is a unique attempt to quantify information on water management at a national level we explore whether it can represent a valid metric for EWS measurement . We first show that a high level of water management is neither necessarily associated to high economic power of the country nor to low physical water availability . Then we analyze whether the indicator can predict typical EWS situations such as low agricultural productivity and inefficient water use . Although the importance of water institutions for agriculture is well known through case studies at the local level we make the first attempt to quantify the strengths of this relation at a global scale for different crops in climatic diverse countries . We detect a positive and significant association between IWRM level and yield and consequently a negative and equally significant association between the IWRM level and the crop water footprint . Statistical significance holds also when potentially confounding variables are included in a multiple regression analysis . We infer from this analysis that good water management as detectable through the IWRM indicator improves land productivity and water saving in turn mitigating EWS . Our findings pave the way toward the use of the IWRM indicator as a valuable tool for measuring EWS in agriculture bridging the measurability gap of economic water scarcity with straightforward policy implications in favour of investments in water management as a lever for enhancing food security and development .

@highlight Economic water scarcity hinders food security but faces the challenge of measurability.
@highlight The SDG indicator Integrated Water Resource Management IWRM could measure economic water scarcity.
@highlight Good IWRM is not always associated to high countrys income or to physical water scarcity.
@highlight Globally the impact of IWRM on agricultural yield is positive and statistical significant.
@highlight Higher IWRM is significantly associated to lower water footprint and to water saving.
