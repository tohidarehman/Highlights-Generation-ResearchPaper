 In this paper we assess the sustainability of Variable Rate Technology application for different wheat intensive agricultural areas in Europe . Within the H2020 FATIMA project we developed an analytical framework to assess the environmental and economic sustainability of nutrient management in two Case Studies in Greek and Czech Republic implemented with different fertilization strategies in the winter wheat production compared with the conventional one .

@highlight Water Energy Food nexus approach was applied to evaluate the impact of Variable Rate Technology at farm level for a sustainable use of nitrogen.
@highlight The results show the importance for farmers of managing inputs in an efficient way in order to obtain economic and environmental benefits.
@highlight The adoption of VRT in input management can provide important benefits both under economic and environmental perspective.
