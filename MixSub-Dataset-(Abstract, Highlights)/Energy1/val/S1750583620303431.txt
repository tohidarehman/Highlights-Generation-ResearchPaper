 Monitoring and Verification was reviewed in this journal in 2015 as part of the Special Issue to mark the tenth anniversary of the IPCC report on CCS . This article provides an update focusing on identifying areas where there has been technical progress . Activity in CCS has continued since 2015 but the shift towards commercial utilization has altered the context for M V. Published field experimentation and verification with monitoring methods has not progressed as much as was hoped . While much high quality theoretical work has continued especially in the area of the design of monitoring systems an imbalance is apparent . One area where field tests have continued and progress has been marked is the rapid development of distributed acoustic sensing and its pairing with permanent seismic sources . Progress here has the potential to make seismic monitoring cheaper and less intrusive . Interesting proposals have been made for monitoring with pressure data but most have not been tested . Methods of monitoring in the marine ecosystem are rapidly being adapted to the requirements of M V. These methods are well adapted to the quantification of leakage that is mandated in some jurisdictions . Overall the need for testing the numerous good ideas in field experiments is very apparent .
