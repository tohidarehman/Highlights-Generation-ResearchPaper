 One of the great challenges in carbon capture and storage development is the monitoring and determination of the underground CO

@highlight The time lapse 2D vertical seismic profiling VSP technology can support the monitoring and numerical modeling of CO
@highlight plume migration at the CO
@highlight geological storage site.
@highlight Results of time lapse VSP data and numerical modeling show some new characteristics of CO
@highlight plume migration in multi layer reservoirs with strong heterogeneity and low permeability.
@highlight A new 3D geological model of Shenhua CCS demonstration project in China is constructed.
@highlight Characteristics of CO
@highlight plume migration during the injection period and after site closure at the Shenhua CCS demonstration project storage site are much clearer than previous studies.
