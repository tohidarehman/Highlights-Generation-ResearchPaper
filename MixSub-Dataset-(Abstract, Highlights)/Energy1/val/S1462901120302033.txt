 This paper explores the implications of the widespread success of the term circular economy in the institutional and public debate . The concept of circular economy in itself implies a logical contradiction on the one hand the concept acknowledges the dependence of the economy on biophysical flows on the other hand the proposed solutiona business model guaranteeing a full decoupling of the economy from natural resourcesseemingly ignores that biophysical processes are subject to thermodynamic constraints . A biophysical view of the sustainability predicamentthe flows exchanged between the technosphere and the biosphere is depicted to show that the idea of a full decoupling is simply due to ignorance of the knowledge generated in disciplinary scientific fields other than the dominant economic one . The success of economics as an elite folk science is explained by the need of the establishment to ignore uncomfortable knowledge that would destabilize existing institutions . The success of the term circular economy can be seen as an example of socially constructed ignorance in which folk tales are used to depoliticize the sustainability debate and to colonize the future through the endorsement of implausible socio technical imaginaries . A strategy that can lead to an irresponsible management of expectation implausible master narratives are impossible to govern . Rather than continuing to impose technocratic plans as if we knew the optimal thing to do Post Normal Science suggests that it is much more effective and responsible to adopt a flexible management approach exploring the ability of self organization of social ecological systems .

@highlight The term Circular Economy acknowledges the biophysical roots of the economic process.
@highlight The entropic nature of the economy entails that decoupling is impossible.
@highlight Economics needs to recognize the relevance of other inter disciplinary knowledge.
@highlight Policy legends are used to protect the establishment from uncomfortable knowledge.
@highlight Post Normal Science is needed to avoid the ancient regime syndrome attractor.
