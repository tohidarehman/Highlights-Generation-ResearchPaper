 Pesticides used in agriculture are widely considered to be the most cost effective way to reduce undesirable plants and animal pests and increase crop yields . However these economic benefits should be evaluated against any deleterious impacts on the natural environment and human health . While a great deal of attention is paid to the impact of agricultural runoff more studies are needed on the impacts of pesticides on local waterways . The aim of this study was to develop a methodology to determine which pesticides were being used in local agriculture in the Byron Shire Australia and search the literature for evidence of the impact of these chemicals on local waterways . After a comprehensive search involving multiple government databases three herbicides with potentially high toxicity on the aquatic ecosystems and humans which are used for the treatment of crops cultivated on the agricultural land in the Byron Shire Australia were selected for this review bromoxynil diquat and paraquat . In the systematic scoping review two databases were searched for publications between January 2008 and April 2019 . From 160 articles identified 36 papers were selected for inclusion . The evidence of harmful effects at realistic field concentrations was found for all selected herbicides but not on all organisms . In aquatic environments diquat was found to be toxic to snails and bromoxynil to microalgae . The clearest and most consistent evidence was found for paraquat . At realistic field concentrations paraquat severely inhibited healthy bacterial growth

@highlight This study sets out a new method to determine the pesticides likely to be used locally.
@highlight Bromoxynil diquat and paraquat are the three most toxic pesticides in local use.
@highlight There is evidence of harmful effects at realistic field concentrations for all three pesticides.
@highlight The strongest evidence was for paraquat causing negative impacts on aquatic organisms.
@highlight Paraquat has been banned from use in many countries around the world but not Australia.
