 Strategic land use planning assumes a pivotal role in flood risk management . By using formal instruments spatial planning can legally secure areas for flood retention or other flood protection measures as well as regulate settlement development in hazard areas and ensure flood adapted land uses . The interrelations between upstream and downstream riparian areas in flood risk management however require regional or catchment oriented approaches in strategic land use planning to better coordinate land development options along rivers . This paper examines two strategic planning instruments in Austrian flood risk management . The two instruments Blauzone Rheintal in Vorarlberg and Schutzwasserwirtschaftlicher Raumentwicklungsplan in Carinthia were developed by water authorities and spatial planning departments to prevent settlement growth in flood prone areas and to secure land for flood protection schemes . Despite having similar problems in their backgrounds and objectives the implementation processes of these instruments differ significantly while the Blauzone Rheintal was formalized as a legally binding regional land use plan the SREP was not developed beyond the pilot stage . This paper identifies important contextual conditions and lessons learned to facilitate the scaling up and replication of catchment oriented spatial planning instruments in other flood prone regions .
