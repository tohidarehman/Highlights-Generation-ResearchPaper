 The multiple positive effects of an active school commute have convinced many cities to promote home school walks among children and increase the awareness of designing healthy child friendly routes . One of the ways to ensure a child friendly and healthy daily walk to school is to increase the greenery that children encounter on their way . This paper aims to evaluate welfare related disparities among children in the visibility of greenery along their home school routes and link them with distributive justice regarding aesthetic appreciation . We hypothesise that children who belong to poor welfare related status group have lower visibility of greenery along their routes to school than other children . Furthermore we hypothesise that aesthetic appreciation provided by the greenery surrounding home school routes is not equitably distributed to all children . For this purpose we conducted a visibility analysis for primary school pupils in Lodz . In particular we quantified the amount of greenery in the visibility areas of 5 10 30 and 50m along the home school routes of children . Our results show that the median visibility of greenery along the home school routes is lower for shorter visibility distances and street trees dense tree and shrub canopies what could be further related to limited aesthetic experiences . We found that children who belong to poor welfare related status group have less greenery along their home school routes than others . This could indicate a distributive environmental injustice may occur not only in terms of the availability of green spaces for inhabitants homes but also reveal disparities in the visibility of greenery during daily commutes . Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on making cities greener . In particular they may be used by urban planners to identify priority streets for implementing urban green initiatives .

@highlight The visibility of street trees and dense tree and shrub canopies in an area of 5 and 10m around home school routes is scarce.
@highlight The median coverage of greenery in the visibility area of 5m around home school routes is equal to 15 .
@highlight Poor visibility of greenery may indicate limited aesthetic appreciation for children.
@highlight Environmental injustice can be understood as welfare related inequalities in the visibility of greenery along home school routes among children.
@highlight Promoting an active home school commute needs urban planning actions towards greening the walking routes.
