 Reduced order models are a widely used and powerful approach to reducing the complexity of predictive physics based numerical simulations for a wide range of applications including electronics and fluid mechanics such as geologic CO

@highlight Reduced order models ROMs are a powerful approach to reducing the complexity of physics based numerical simulations.
@highlight We show that a traditional ROM can display excellent overall statistics and yet have poor predictive power.
@highlight We introduce a novel approach where a set of sub ROMs are generated to overcome potential pitfalls in traditional ROMs.
@highlight The effectiveness of the new approachthe ROMster frameworkis demonstrated using injection rates for CO
@highlight sequestration.
@highlight In our case study the ROMster framework reduces average CO2 injection prediction errors from 200 to only 4 .
