 Alluvial aquifers in seasonal rivers are a yet underutilised resource in many arid regions of Africa . These so called sand river aquifers provide nature based water storage within easy reach because they are shallow . They form a significant potential renewable source of water for irrigation development . Innovative approaches and solutions are needed to sustainably increase productive use of this resource to enhance rural livelihoods . The A4Labs action research explores the potential and pitfalls of introducing solutions designed for individual smallholder farmers . This entails innovation in three domains the technology used the arrangement and the purpose . Pilots were established in the Limpopo river basin in Zimbabwe and Mozambique . Monitoring and assessment are ongoing but preliminary findings indicate that successful adoption of the approach was not constrained by water availability . Despite the fact that these pilots were established during two subsequent drought years there was no difficulty in accessing freshwater in sufficient quantity . Instead successful adoption depends on previous farming experience market access and the possibility to grow adaptively in terms of technology scale and financial risks . In addition establishing an individual farm to grow cash crops requires acceptance and new skills as irrigation for smallholder farmers in Africa has traditionally been framed as a communal activity in collective irrigation schemes with strong support by outside agencies and with the well known collective action challenges . This action research has also estimated that the potential for upscaling this innovation in the Limpopo river basin is significant .

@highlight Sand river aquifers provide potential for individual family focused solar irrigation in arid lands in Africa.
@highlight Action research in the Limpopo basin aims to bridge the gap between hydrological theory and practical farm experience.
@highlight Preliminary findings show that it has technical and economic potential and requires an adaptive development approach.
@highlight Future ambitions include enhanced monitoring of the water source and use and technical performance of frugal innovations.
@highlight These diverse innovations need better understanding in relation to marketing and families livelihoods and rural networks.
