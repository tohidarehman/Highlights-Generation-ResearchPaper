 Regulatory oversight of a geologic carbon sequestration project relies on iterative estimations throughout the project lifetime of the area where increased risks to underground sources of drinking water may occur due to injection of CO

@highlight Uncertainty in reservoir and aquifer characteristics yields a probabilistic risk based Area of Review.
@highlight AoR is determined based on the probability of aquifer impacts rather than just on leakage from an open conduit.
@highlight The workflow is demonstrated using characterization and modeling data from a permitted carbon storage project.
