 In response to global warming it is important to explore alternative disposal technologies for greenhouse gas emissions in the geothermal power sector . One alternative which has received widespread focus is co injection of non condensable gases with the waste fluids from geothermal operations .

@highlight TOUGHREACT models satisfactorily represent fluid rocks reactions.
@highlight Mineral RSAs are affected by the degree of dissolution and etch pit formation.
@highlight Fluid flow rates affect the reaction rates.
@highlight NCGs dissolved in injectates promote mineral dissolution increasing both permeability and porosity.
@highlight NCG co injection is a viable reservoir stimulation method.
