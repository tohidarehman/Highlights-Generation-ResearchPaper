 Participatory forestry needs to revisit the notion of what participation means rather than uncritically follow the technobureaucratic guidelines of baseline assessment and monitoring . In this study we are concerned about materialism and idealism in the policy and practice of participatory mangrove rehabilitation in the Philippines . The analysis is based on the review of mangrove policies and a case study of a successful project the Katunggan Ecopark . Empowerment does not necessarily follow a bottom up strategy but is given as an impetus by the traditional authority after capitalizing on the rhetoric of participation and limiting the decision making power of the members of the community during the incipient stages of the project . This has put the local communities to work despite having anxieties over the projects positive promises . Social cohesion a volunteer network and the communitys sense of ownership of the success of the project that was not previously felt before can be gained through evidence from the material success of rehabilitation . With the transformation of the denuded area to a mangrove forest power was decentralized from the local government authority to the peoples organization . Recognizing the difference between the materialist and idealist perspectives and learning to negotiate between the two can significantly inform pragmatic approaches to environmental policy and governance . More studies that reflect on the inconsistencies and biases of the materialist idealist divide in both policy and practice should be done to further our understanding of a dynamic flexible and transformative participatory process .

@highlight Participatory forestry should be reflective about the materialist idealist divide and its inconsistencies in both policy and practice.
@highlight Policies should look beyond the conventional measures of success and consider the transforming network among interest groups.
@highlight Decentralization of power is given as an impetus by the traditional authority after capitalizing on the rhetoric of participation.
@highlight Long term sustainability would come to emerge when tangible benefits are perceived as instrumental to human wellbeing.
