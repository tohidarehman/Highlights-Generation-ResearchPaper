 Hybrid techniques which combine standard separation methods are being developed in an attempt to overcome some limitations associated with standalone absorptive adsorptive or membrane processes for CO

@highlight A dynamic model of the CO
@highlight capture in a VSA membrane hybrid system is presented.
@highlight The performance of the large scale hybrid system was assessed comprehensively.
@highlight The unit energy consumption in the hybrid system may be lowered to 1.54MJ
