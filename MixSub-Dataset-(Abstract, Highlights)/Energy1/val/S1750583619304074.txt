 Post combustion carbon capture with chemical absorption has strong interactions with coal fired power plant . It is necessary to investigate dynamic characteristics of the integrated CFPP PCC system to gain knowledge for flexible operation . It has been demonstrated that the integrated system exhibits large time inertial and this will incur additional challenge for controller design . Conventional PID controller can not effectively control CFPP PCC process . To overcome these barriers this paper presents an improved neural network inverse control which can quickly operate the integrated system and handle with large time constant . Neural network is used to approximate inverse dynamic relationships of integrated CFPP PCC system . The NN inverse model uses setpoints as model inputs and gets predictions of manipulated variables . The predicted manipulated variables are then introduced as feed forward signals . In order to eliminate steady state bias and to operate the integrated CFPP PCC under different working conditions improvements have been achieved with the addition of PID compensator . The improved NNIC is evaluated in a large scale supercritical CFPP PCC plant which is implemented in gCCS toolkit . Case studies are carried out considering variations in power setpoint and capture level setpoint . Simulation results reveal that proposed NNIC can track setpoints quickly and exhibit satisfactory control performances .
