 This paper reviews the early history of IPBES and focuses on epistemic choices that occurred early on in its establishment and assessment work .

@highlight The paper conceptualises IPBES as a site where diverse conceptions of nature compete for relevance and authority.
@highlight To establish authority and increase its immediate relevance for policy makers IPBES addressed uncertainty debates and used economic rhetoric.
@highlight These epistemic choices anticipated struggle among and between IPBES member states and experts.
@highlight To resolve them IPBES shifted from ecosystem services to Natures Contribution to People and thereby institutionalized its authority.
@highlight Yet authority is liquid and IPBES authority may change as new uncertainties arrive as part of its assessment on transformative change.
