 Optimism about the contribution of city policies worldwide to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is widespread . It is based though on partial and anecdotal studies rather than comprehensive system wide estimates . Popular empirical indicators to support the importance of cities such as consumption based emissions within city borders lack a policy connection . Here I undertake an initial assessment of the effectiveness of emissions reduction through urban climate policies . It employs a novel decomposition of effectiveness into reach capability and stringency . This results in a qualitative estimation of current and maximum contributions of city climate policies divided into four types to global emissions reduction . I formalize the framework to numerically illustrate additional policy aspects . Based on the insights obtained I suggest policy and political strategies to make better use of cities competences to mitigate climate change .
