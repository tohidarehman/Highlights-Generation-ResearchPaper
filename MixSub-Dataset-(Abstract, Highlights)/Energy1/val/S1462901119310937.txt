 In a rising urban age planning for cities around the globe is increasingly based on assessments of ecosystem services making enhanced considerations of ecosystem service justice critically important . Yet justice remains a blind spot in urban ecosystem service models and research which can be traced back to the ecological and economic legacies of the concept itself . This legacy reproduces the normative focus on natural capital as a guarantee of sustaining ecosystem services enforces a static understanding of nature that insufficiently considers human agency and conceptualizes ecosystem service flows from nature to humans in a way that does not reflect the social ecological structure and constantly shifting priorities of the urban realm . In response this conceptual paper aims at broadening the analytical foundation for justice in urban ecosystem service assessments by presenting a model that links the co production of urban ecosystem services with established lines of recognition procedural and distributional justice . It further highlights the need to embed these classical dimensions of justice within both spatial and temporal justice frames . Relying on urban environmental social spatial and temporal justice theory as well ecosystem service scholarship we outline theoretical entry points and provide practical examples for weaving notions of justice into urban ecosystem service research and practice while highlighting future research needs .

@highlight This study develops an ecosystem service justice model from an urban perspective.
@highlight Infrastructure institutions and perceptions filter ecosystem services in ways that impact social justice.
@highlight Spatial justice concerns for ecosystem services account at once for down scale and inter scale relations.
@highlight Temporal justice concerns for ecosystem services link past present and future conditions of social ecological systems.
