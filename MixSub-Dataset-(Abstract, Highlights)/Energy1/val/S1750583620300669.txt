 The wettability of a formation is defined as the tendency of one fluid to spread on a surface in competition with other fluids which are also in contact with it . However the impact of temperature on wettability in an aquifer and the modification of relative permeability curves based on the temperature variation in aquifers is not well covered in the literature . This study redresses this dearth of information by investigating the impact of temperature on wettability distribution in a reservoir and updating the relative permeability curves based on its temperature propagation . The impact of the latter is studied in relation to the solubility of CO
