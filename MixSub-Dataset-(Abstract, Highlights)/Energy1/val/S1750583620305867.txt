 If carbon capture and storage needs to be deployed at basin or larger scale it is likely that multiple sites will be injecting carbon dioxide CO

@highlight A strategy to overcome pressure limitations by simply deploying more CO
@highlight injection wells could be very costly and exhibit diminishing returns.
@highlight Brine production could be necessary to sequester 20 or more of the annual CO
@highlight emissions of major stationary sources in the region at lowest cost.
@highlight If onsite disposal of brine without repressurizing the storage reservoir is feasible brine production could possibly reduce net storage cost.
@highlight Data on the geologic heterogeneity within the storage reservoir allowed identification of a high injectivity zone CO
@highlight storage sweet spot .
@highlight With or without brine production the lowest cost option found in this study was to sequester CO
@highlight exclusively in the storage sweet spot.
