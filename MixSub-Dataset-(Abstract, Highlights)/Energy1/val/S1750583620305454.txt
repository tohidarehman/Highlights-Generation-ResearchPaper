 Carbon Capture and Storage is a collective term for technologies that allow society to unlock the benefits of energy intensive processes like fertiliser production and combustion of fuels without releasing the CO

@highlight This paper distils the learnings of three research projects that all investigated aspects of marine monitoring for CO
@highlight storage.
@highlight Technologies for detection location and quantification of potential leakage from offshore CCS projects
@highlight Each project used controlled releases in representative marine environments to verify technology performance and environmental impact.
@highlight Impacts of small to medium CO
@highlight leakages from large scale storage have been assessed to be limited and localised.
@highlight Integrated marine monitoring systems can detect even small leakages of 1050 L min at unknown locations in a large area of interest.
