 The state of the environment continues declining despite improved global responses towards environmental protection . This mismatch could be because government policymakers and bureaucrats tend to focus on the tangible and controllable aspects of interventions such as resources and actions rather than the consequences of these interventions . We test this assumption by classifying governance indicators in the environmental sector according to a logic model an evidence based causal chain articulating the causes effects and consequences of management interventions . In this paper we synthesized consensus on logic models and developed a decision tree to classify governance indicators depending on whether they measured

@highlight The state of the environment keeps declining despite increased government efforts.
@highlight We ask if this is caused by governance indicators that measure effort and efficiency rather than effectiveness.
@highlight We categorise governance indicators in the South African environmental sector according to a causal logic model.
@highlight Most governance indicators are at the wrong level of the logic model and do not measure government effectiveness as intended.
@highlight This may explain why the state of environment keeps declining even when government consistently meets performance targets.
