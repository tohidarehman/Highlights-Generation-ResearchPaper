 Carbon capture and storage is indispensable in achieving the well below 2 C warming target especially for China with coal dominated energy structures . However high investment makes the development of CCS far from the global warming target . Concerns about the high cost have led to a spread of pessimistic attitude towards the future of CCS to some extent . Therefore this study provides the first instance to determine the unit CO

@highlight The study quantifies component based learning curves of four CCS pathways.
@highlight A nonlinear programming approach of CCS technology selection was developed.
@highlight An empirical analysis of Chinas power sector was carried out.
@highlight Advanced CCS technology roadmaps in line with 2 C target were put forward.
