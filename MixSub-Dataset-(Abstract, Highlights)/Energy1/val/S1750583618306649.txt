 In this review paper an extensive overview of solar assisted carbon capture systems is presented . The focus of this paper is on possible integration schemes between solar thermal collectors and carbon capture systems . In its entirety solar assisted carbon capture systems can be categorized into direct and indirect systems . This classification is applicable to all three possible processes namely post combustion pre combustion and oxyfuel combustion . Key factor in designing solar assisted carbon capture systems is to match the thermal grade between the collector and gas separation process . Possible future research direction for solar assisted carbon capture systems can be classified into solar collectors cost reduction research and innovative integration scheme research .
