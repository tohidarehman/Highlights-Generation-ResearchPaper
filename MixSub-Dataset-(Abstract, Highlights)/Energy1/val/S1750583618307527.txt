 CCS is expected to be one of the major measures contributing to carbon reduction and meet net zero emission in near future . Fossil fuel power plants equipped with CCS can be considered to be zero carbon power generation if nearly full CO

@highlight Advanced KM CDR Process is used to explore feasibility of high CO

@highlight The near zero emission case is the same level of OPEX tonneCO
@highlight  as the base.
@highlight A near zero emission that recovers 99.5 of CO2 is technically feasible.
