 Science and knowledge are called to participate in the institutional political and behavioral changes that are necessary to address biodiversity loss . Knowledge however does not possess direct performative powers and the relationships between knowledge production and use are complex as has been documented for multiple issues and by different fields of research . This paper proposes to unpack three dimensions of decision making . By taking the field of ecosystem service assessment and valuation as its main example the paper discusses and illustrates how this unpacking can help researchers situate themselves in the diversity of decision making contexts that can exist and how this can influence the contributions they can make to try and solve biodiversity issues they are involved in . After describing some key characteristics of the rationalist vision of decision it suggests that looking at the temporal continuity of decision making processes e.g . a one time moment

@highlight The contribution of biodiversity researchers to policy making is linked to how they see decision making.
@highlight The rationalist model of decision often prevails in researchers assumptions regarding the social uptake of their results.
@highlight To supplement this rationalist model 3 dimensions of decision making are presented and their combination leads to 27 different contexts.
@highlight Researchers contributions vary according to the type of decision making they may contribute to.
@highlight Information is often used in an argumentative way which has important consequences on how researchers treat social values.
