 This paper explores the viability of Carbon Capture and Storage in Italy by examining two different scenarios . The first scenario evaluates the investments on traditional power generation technologies i.e . USC NGCC and IGCC with and without CCS and on wind farms the second scenario studies the convenience of retrofitting existing Italian power plants with respect to the construction of new capture ready plants . To the scope a techno economic analysis based on the calculation of the LCOE the CCAV cost of CO

@highlight Carbon Capture and Storage investments in Italian power plants are evaluated for new built and retrofitted power plants
@highlight Investigations are carried out from the technological and economic viewpoints
@highlight The LCOE Levelised Costs of Electricity cost of CO2 avoided and captured are calculated for each investment scenario
@highlight A newly indicator i.e. the LACE Levelised Avoided Cost of Electricity is added to the analysis
