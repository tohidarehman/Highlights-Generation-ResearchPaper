 Chemical looping combustion for industrial scale applications is hindered by challenges of inefficient fuel conversion auto thermal operation and complex system operation . To improve the CLC performance under low temperature operational strategies were optimized in a 3 kW

@highlight Three operational strategies are optimized to improve CLC performance under a low temperature condition.
@highlight The strategy of FR staged fluidization can significantly improve the CO
@highlight capture and carbon conversion efficiencies.
@highlight The furnace gases and OC particles are extracted from the different height of FR.
