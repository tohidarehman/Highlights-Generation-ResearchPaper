 What does a science of environmental conservation look like Though we often see it as a contemporary problem engineering the interface of science and decision making bodies has been a question since the founding of ecology . This study traces the creation of new conservation initiatives via the repeated splintering of the Ecological Society of America since the early 1900s and compares these against the results of a network analysis of contemporary scientists and their affiliations . Notwithstanding the new terminology of science policy interfaces brokers and gaps these questions often hinge on the same dilemmas as they did at the beginning of 20th century . The history of these groups shows how divisive distinctions between ecology and conservation pure and applied research science and politics and facts versus values can quickly become integrated into the structure of organizationseven those that are created specifically to bridge gaps in what today would be called the science policy interface . Meanwhile a social network analysis of present day scientists suggests that individual researchers are finding ways to informally jump across science policy gaps at a sub organizational level . Remarkably these science policy conflicts can pose major problems for organizations even when the actual activities of members traverse these boundaries on an individual basis . When designing science policy interfaces formal bridging mechanisms between organizations remain important but these should also support the ongoing if under the radar ways that individuals negotiate gaps between conservation research and policy advocacy .

@highlight Conservation sciences role in policy advocacy has been debated for over a century.
@highlight Science organizations have splintered repeatedly over questions of policy engagement.
@highlight Not knowing this history ensures organizations are doomed to repeat it.
@highlight Network analysis suggests scientists collaborate with NGOs more than they realize.
@highlight Science policy interfaces should facilitate existing collaboration when possible.
