 Ternary hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents were synthesized using the binary mixture of fatty acids and tetrabutyl ammonium bromide . The formation of H DES was confirmed by the phase diagram FTIR and H NMR analyses . The critical properties of H DESs were then determined using the modified Lydersen Joback Reid method . The viscosity and conductivity of H DESs were experimentally calculated and modeled using the Arrhenius equation . Further the hydrophobic nature of H DESs was confirmed by the extractive dye removal from an aqueous solution . Finally CO
