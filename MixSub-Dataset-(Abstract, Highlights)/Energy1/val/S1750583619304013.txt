 Oxy combustion typically consists of burning coal with a combination of oxygen and a large amount of recycled flue gas to obtain a similar heat flux profile to that of air fired systems . As the cost of electricity from first generation oxy combustion is relatively high several new oxy combustion process concepts have been proposed in recent years and within these the proposed amount of flue gas recycle has varied from near zero to 80 . To better understand the fundamental impact of FGR on the efficiency of oxy combustion systems a thermodynamic approach is used herein . Second law losses associated with flue gas recycle are found to be significant and highly non linear with recycle ratio . A difference in efficiency of up to 10 points can be realized with a maximum efficiency occurring at zero FGR . Furthermore due to the non linear relation of plant efficiency with recycle ratio processes with low recycle experience only a small efficiency penalty compared to no recycle . Additionally fan power requirements also scale non linearly with recycle ratio resulting in significantly lower FGR fan power requirements for low recycle processes as well . These results suggest that for systems employing cold recycle FGR should be kept below 33 .

@highlight Effect of flue gas recycle on the efficiency of an oxy combustion plant is explained.
@highlight Exergy losses are a significantly greater contributor than fan power consumption.
@highlight Net plant efficiency non linearly dependent on recycle ratio.
@highlight Knee in the efficiency vs. recycle ratio exists at approx. 33 recycle.
@highlight Low recycle is almost as efficient as zero recycle may work better in practice.
