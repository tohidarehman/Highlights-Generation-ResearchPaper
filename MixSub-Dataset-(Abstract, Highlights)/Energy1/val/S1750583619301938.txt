 We investigated the relationship between amine structure and corrosion rates in a study of the corrosion behaviour of carbon steel in CO

@highlight CO
@highlight  loaded 4A1PPD shows the lowest corrosion rate in the studied amines.
@highlight The structure of amines displays a significant influence on the corrosion rate.
@highlight The bicarbonate carbamate speciation affects the formation of a protective film.
@highlight FeCO
@highlight film is formed on CS after hydrothermal treatment in CO
@highlight rich 4A1PPD.
