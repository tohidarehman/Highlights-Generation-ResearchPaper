 As climate change erodes current levels of flood protection in the UK and government investment in hard flood risk management is rationed by cost benefit ratios the option for many communities at risk is to implement local soft FRM . The frequency of widespread flooding generates an added urgency to understand how to support sFRM . Using a case study and qualitative analysis we explore social processes such as acculturation that drive stakeholder adaptation to be more flood resilient . We conceptualise the status quo beleaguered by conflict and competition and propose practices of accommodation and cooperation that can support shared objectives and responsibility that strengthen sFRM . Our conceptual model is mapped on a stylised catchment to illustrate how SPs underpin sFRM interventions that join up the catchment in wholescape thinking . The transferable learning is that there are group behaviours and inclusive practices that can initiate and support local sFRM .

@highlight As soft FRM sFRM is more widely implemented this brings in social elements.
@highlight Underlying social processes SPs can strengthen sFRM joining up catchments.
@highlight The SPs of Accommodation Coordination and Acculturation foster shared objectives.
@highlight Inclusive practices of visioning and partnering are key activities for local groups.
