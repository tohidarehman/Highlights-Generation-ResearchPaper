 The present study was aimed at developing a non aqueous absorbent system that does not form any precipitate solid upon exposure to CO

@highlight Eighteen alcohol solvents were investigated for alkanloamine based CO
@highlight capture.
@highlight Alkanolamine absorbents carbonate ratios linearly increase when CO
@highlight loading increases the carbamate showed the opposite trend.
@highlight Viscosity of non aqueous solvent was highly affected by CO
@highlight loading.
@highlight All EAE TEG solutions showed homogeneous mixture within the whole range of CO
@highlight loading.
@highlight Developed a high performance non aqueous solvent system that does not form any precipitate solid upon exposure to CO
