 The idea of decoupling environmental bads from economic goods has been proposed as a path towards sustainability by organizations such as the OECD and UN . Scientific consensus reports on environmental impacts and resource use give an indication of the kind of decoupling needed for ecological sustainability global absolute fast enough and long enough . This goal gives grounds for a categorisation of the different kinds of decoupling with regard to their relevance . We conducted a survey of recent research on decoupling on Web of Science and reviewed the results in the research according to the categorisation . The reviewed 179 articles contain evidence of absolute impact decoupling especially between CO2 emissions and evidence on geographically limited cases of absolute decoupling of land and blue water use from GDP but not of economy wide resource decoupling neither on national nor international scales . Evidence of the needed absolute global fast enough decoupling is missing .

@highlight We reviewed 179 articles on decoupling published between 19902019.
@highlight The papers present evidence of absolute impact decoupling mainly between CO2 and GDP.
@highlight No evidence of economy wide national international absolute resource decoupling.
@highlight No evidence of the kind of decoupling needed for ecological sustainability.
@highlight In the absence of robust evidence the goal of decoupling rests partly on faith.
