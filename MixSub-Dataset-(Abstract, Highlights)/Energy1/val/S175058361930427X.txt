 We analyze four general architectures for electrochemically mediated carbon dioxide capture systems in each of which the electrophilicity of a redox active absorbent or absorbent blocking species is manipulated to influence the system s affinity for CO

@highlight Thermodynamic cycles for electrochemical CO
@highlight capture dominated by state of charge.
@highlight Energetics depend on system architecture and configuration.
@highlight Electrochemical CO
@highlight capture can be favorable energetically.
