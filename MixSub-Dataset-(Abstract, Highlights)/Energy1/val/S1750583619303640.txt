 Quantifying the petrophysical properties of low permeability sedimentary units helps to determine the possibility of upward flow of supercritical carbon dioxide when evaluating a site for safe confinement of geologic carbon storage . This research examines fine scale pore characteristics that affect the sealing capacity of the Upper Ordovician Maquoketa interval a thick and heterogeneous sequence of carbonates siltstones and clay rich rock units in the Illinois Basin . This unit has been previously identified as a regional caprock that would likely isolate and effectively store any CO

@highlight The Maquoketa Group is heterogeneous with varying amounts of carbonates and clastic rich intervals.
@highlight Petrophysical measurements suggest that the Maquoketa Group is a caprock that can efficiently prevent the upward flow of carbon dioxide.
@highlight Pore shape analyses suggest that the Maquoketa Group can also store carbon dioxide via capillary entrapment.
