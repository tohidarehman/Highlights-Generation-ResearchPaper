 Acid gas removal is a critical step in the supply chain of natural gas for its safe transmission and clean combustion . Chemical amines are the most commonly employed commercial solvents for the gas cleaning . Due to energy intensive nature of the AGR process ways to improve process efficiency are vital . This study investigated the removal of acid gases from the associated and non associated sour feeds using a blend of diglycolamine and methyldiethanolamine solvents at a total strength of 50wt . . Steady state process simulation models have been developed to seek the process improvement by utilization of amine blends . The study performed a detailed energy and economic analysis to understand the feasibility of the investigated amine blends . The results show that when 45wt . DGA is mixed 5wt . MDEA additive for the processing of associated gas a saving of 3.42 MMSCF of sweet gas produced is achieved . On the other hand cost per MMSCF of sweet gas increases significantly when DGA additive is mixed with MDEA amine for the processing of non associated gas .
