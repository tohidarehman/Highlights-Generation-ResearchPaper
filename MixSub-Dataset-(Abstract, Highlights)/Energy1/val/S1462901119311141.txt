 Water is key to keeping urban areas safe and healthy for humans and hence safe sanitation and waste water treatment is promoted by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals . We show that emissions from existing state of the art water technologies are problematic from a Planetary Boundaries perspective . The magnitude of the climate change impact in relation to the PB based normalization is much higher than for any other PB . The current paradigm for urban water management needs a radical change for society to be served while emissions are reduced to a level that complies with the Planetary Boundaries .

@highlight The UN SDGs are possibly conflicting with the Planetary Boundaries.
@highlight Four urban water LCA studies are re referenced based on the Planetary Boundaries.
@highlight Climate change impact from urban water management is massive.
@highlight Radical changes need to happen for urban water management to be sustainable.
