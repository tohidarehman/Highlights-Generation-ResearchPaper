 An almost continuous 13 000h long term testing under real operating conditions was conducted at the post combustion capture pilot plant in the Niederaussem lignite fired power plant with a 30wt aqueous monoethanolamine solvent solution . The capture plant at Niederaussem shows lower solvent consumption and emissions in comparison to other testing facilities which are also part of the ALIGN CCUS project pilot rig at Tiller PACT facilities at Sheffield . One of the key activities of the ALIGN CCUS project is to investigate how the time dependent degradation products and trace components that might act as catalysts for degradation develop over long term operation as well as which countermeasures against degradation could be applied . Particularly it was tested if critical threshold values for the iron ion concentration from literature could be confirmed . Therefore partial solvent inventory replacement by Bleed and Feed and solvent reclaiming based on ion exchange were applied . Dedicated test campaigns on the dynamic behaviour of the capture plant were also carried out and MEA emissions under transient conditions were investigated . Important results are the confirmation of the non linear degradation behaviour of MEA a different degradation behaviour of MEA in comparison to shorter testing campaigns at other pilot plants regarding the main degradation product acetate no critical threshold concentration of iron in the solvent was detected very low emissions of MEA 3mg m and 10mg m even under transient operating conditions could be reached and no aerosol formation occurred .

@highlight Continuous long term testing with 30wt MEA over 13 000h at a lignite fired power plant.
@highlight Low specific MEA consumption of less than 300g t CO
@highlight in the linear degradation regime.
@highlight At the Niederaussem pilot plant thermal degradation is less significant compared to other capture plants.
@highlight No critical threshold concentration of iron as a possible catalyst for degradation was detected.
@highlight Bleed and Feed as solvent management strategy is not effective and inferior to ion exchange.
