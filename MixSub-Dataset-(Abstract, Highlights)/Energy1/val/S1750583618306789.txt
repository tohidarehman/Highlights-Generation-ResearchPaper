 To accelerate the deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage based on the solid amine adsorbents towards a practical scale application relevant to Natural Gas Combined Cycle power plants this study has evaluated the cyclic performance of a polyethylenimine silica adsorbent of kg scale in a laboratory scale bubbling fluidized bed reactor . A high volumetric concentration 8090 vol of steam mixed with N

@highlight Cyclic performance of kg scale PEI silica adsorbent was evaluated in a BFB reactor.
@highlight Stripping gas containing 8090 steam was used for regeneration in a TSA cycle.
@highlight Simulated NGCC flue gas and actual flue gas of a gas boiler were used as the feed gas.
@highlight Cyclic adsorption capacities could be stabilized using steam regeneration.
@highlight CO
@highlight in the stripping gas resulted in a significant loss in the working capacity.
