 Carbon Capture and Storage is a promising technology to help greenhouse gas emission mitigation . However one of the greatest challenges for this technology implementation is the opposition from the population living near the potential sites . Despite the Brazilian geological potential for carbon dioxide injection research investigating social site characterization or CCS public perception is almost non existent in Brazil . Thus this research aims to address this gap and analyze social factors driving CCS perception of the population living near potential sites in the Recncavo Basin state of Bahia this being one of the first steps for social site characterization . Fifty seven interviews were carried out near 10 CCS potential injection fields focusing on questions about climate change knowledge peoples previous relationship with oil exploration trust in public and private stakeholders belief in citizens influence and CCS perception . The results showed that the previous history of the community with oil companies is an important factor influencing peoples perception of private companies in general and CCS projects in particular . Another relevant social factor is the sense of empowerment in some communities that may respond with riots and obstruction of the project if they feel harmed by the companies . The results also suggest that communication can be a relevant factor for CCS perception correcting some wrong assumptions about the technology . It is important to educate people not only about CCS but also about climate change and other environmental issues and ethically address all aspects positive and negative of CCS implementation .
