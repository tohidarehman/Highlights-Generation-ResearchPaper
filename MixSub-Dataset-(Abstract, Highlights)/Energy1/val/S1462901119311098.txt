 The application of gene drives is a powerful tool to control populations of insects that are agricultural pests vectors of diseases or a threat to biodiversity potentially leading to the local or global eradication of a species . The potential use of gene drive organisms has triggered a heated discussion regarding their environmental impacts and regulatory oversight . However experience exists in assessing the environmental impacts of a number of established agricultural pest control methods that require the release of living organisms that provide high levels of area wide control and that might be irreversible . This includes classical biological control the sterile insect technique the incompatible insect technique that is based on the cytoplasmic incompatibility caused by

@highlight The application of gene drives is a powerful new tool to control insect populations.
@highlight Concerns exists regarding the environmental consequences of gene drive applications.
@highlight Experience in assessing risks of control methods using living organisms exists.
@highlight We do not envisage any unforeseen novel risks with the use of gene drive organisms.
@highlight Existing frameworks can assist the risk assessment of insects carrying gene drives.
