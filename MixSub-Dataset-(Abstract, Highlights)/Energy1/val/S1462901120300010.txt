 Crop booms in forest frontiers are a major contributor to land conversion and deforestation . In this study we investigate the smallholder driven northern Laos rubber boom in two case study areas with different speed and intensity of rubber expansion . We assess the relative importance of market contextual and behavioral factors in fostering or hindering the conversion of forest to rubber plantations . We develop a Bayesian network model of land use change based on household surveys expert interviews market price data and land use maps covering the period 20002017 . We use regression analysis to inform the structure of the BN compare model results and analyze time varying effects . The BN and regression models incorporate perceived price signals as a combination of market price and local price knowledge and local self reinforcing imitation dynamics as a combination of aggregate rubber conversion and imitation behavior elicited in the survey . Results show that deforestation was lower in strictly protected areas but not in forests with lesser protection status . Imitation had a large effect on rubber uptake in both areas . In the CSA that experienced the most intensive spread of rubber price signals transmitted through social networks had a significant impact especially throughout the stage of rapid expansion . Rubber expansion continued in both areas during periods of descending prices mainly because of increased cash availability and access to inputs . Our research sheds light on the underlying dynamics of crop booms and contributes to the understanding of agricultural expansion processes .

@highlight We analyze drivers of rubber expansion in northern Laos in 20002017.
@highlight We use a combination of Bayesian network BN modeling and regression analysis.
@highlight The effect of rubber price on rubber uptake was large during the expansion stages.
@highlight Local self reinforcing imitation was significant during the expansion and later stages.
@highlight Designating protected forest areas reduced deforestation.
