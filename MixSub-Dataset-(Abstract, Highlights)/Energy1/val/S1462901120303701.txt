 Soil degradation is one of the greatest threats to global civilization with claims that there may be as few as 60 years of harvests left globally . As such the concept of soil health has gained increasing interest in recent years . However despite years of research there is no universally agreed metric or metrics on which policy aimed at protecting or enhancing soil health can be based . Here we argue that the challenges associated with measuring and monitoring soil health from a policy perspective are an issue of current approach rather than concept of soil health
