 Evidence informed decision making aims to deliver effective actions informed by the best available evidence . Given the large quantity of primary literature and time constraints faced by policy makers and practitioners well conducted evidence reviews can provide a valuable resource to support decision making . However previous research suggests that some evidence reviews may not be sufficiently reliable to inform decisions in the environmental sector due to low standards of conduct and reporting . While some evidence reviews are of high reliability there is currently no way for policy makers and practitioners to quickly and easily find them among the many lower reliability ones . Alongside this lack of transparency there is little incentive or support for review authors editors and peer reviewers to improve reliability . To address these issues we introduce a new online freely available and first of its kind evidence service the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence Database of Evidence Reviews CEEDER

@highlight The number of evidence reviews is increasing but their rigour and risks of bias vary.
@highlight Easier access to rigorous evidence reviews may support evidence informed decision making.
@highlight CEEDER collates published evidence reviews into a searchable open access database.
@highlight CEEDER assesses evidence reviews for their reliability using the CEESAT appraisal tool.
@highlight CEEDER will be further developed through co production with evidence user organisations.
