 This study presents the results obtained from a lab scale two stage reactor system to investigate the reaction characteristics and chemical kinetics of separated gasification chemical looping combustion with a coal char as the fuel . The results have shown that there is huge mismatch of reaction rate between the slow gasification of char occurred in the gasification reactor and the rapid redox reactions of oxygen carrier and gasification products occurred in the reduction reactor . Hence the GR is recommended to be operated over 950C for a carbon conversion higher than 90 at the reaction time of 15min while 900C should be enough for the RR with an ideal gas combustion efficiency . Besides the OC in SG CLC shows favorable cycle stability which can be attributed to the indirect mixing between the OC and char so that the attachment of potassium salt from the ash to the OC surface can be effectively avoided . In addition the reaction kinetics models are determined to obtain the kinetics parameters of the char fueled SG CLC . The apparent activation energy is found to be 154.44 149.79 and 161.42kJ mol for the first order Kinetics Model 2 D Contraction Model and 3 D Contraction Model respectively .
