 Herein our study has demonstrated that microporous carbon supported Ru catalysts can selectively convert 5 hydroxymethylfurfural to 2 5 dimethylfuran in isopropanol through hydrogenolysis in a catalytic ratio of 2.47mol under 5bar of hydrogen at 125C for 1h . DMF yield can reach 69.52 with complete HMF conversion . The effects of reaction temperature hydrogen pressure metal loading and reaction solvent for hydrogenolysis have been carefully investigated . In addition to better understand the influence of the intrinsic nature of carbonaceous material carbon materials possessing different surface texture including microporosity mesoporosity and nonporous carbon black were used as catalyst supports and structural properties have been comprehensively characterized by powder X ray diffraction spectrometer transmission electron microscopy nitrogen and CO
