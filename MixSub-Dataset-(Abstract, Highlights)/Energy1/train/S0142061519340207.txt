 Voltage deviation and voltage flicker are considered common operational problems associated with high photovoltaic penetrated distribution systems . In this paper an optimal control strategy is proposed for minimizing VD and VF in PV rich distribution systems . The control strategy is based on proposed analytical expressions that minimize both voltage problems by optimizing the smart functions of the PV inverters and control devices simultaneously . The proposed analytical expressions are formulated based on voltage sensitivities with respect to the active and reactive power injections of PV . Specifically a three level control strategy with different time resolutions is proposed to significantly alleviate voltage deviation flicker while minimizing PV active power curtailments and tap movements for transformers . These control levels are local control area control and coordinated control . LC provides rapid local control actions to minimize VD and VF AC minimizes VD within the corresponding area individually and CC plays a vital role to coordinate between the various control units . The proposed control strategy is assessed using high PV penetration with realistic high resolution very variable solar radiation datasets . To demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed analytical expressions the calculated results have been compared with existing methods . Results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy effectively coordinates between the various voltage control units while minimizing VD and VF .
