 Recently more and more consensus based hierarchical control methods are proposed in micro grid . The main components of these methods are primary and secondary controllers . And they are usually used to adjust the output frequency and voltages of distributed energy resources . But the implementation of these methods is highly dependent on the communication network which is consisted by sensors and communicators . Once the data transmit of some sensors or communicators is interrupted it will directly affect the control effect of hierarchical control . To solve the above problems a cyber physical cooperative response strategy is proposed in this paper . The main designs are as follows To solve the interruption problem among communicators there are two defense methods proposed in the cyber layer path planning and path reconstruction . Both methods are combined with cyber physical hybrid vulnerability assessment and improved genetic algorithm To solve the interruption problem in the output channels of sensors a distributed predictive compensation method combined with extreme learning machine and model predictive control is proposed in physical layer Based on the designs in and a novel secondary controller is proposed in this paper . Finally the simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative response strategy .
