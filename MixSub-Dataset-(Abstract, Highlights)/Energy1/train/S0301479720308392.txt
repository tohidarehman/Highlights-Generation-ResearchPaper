 This review summarizes the recent development and studies of anaerobic membrane bioreactor to control fouling issues . AnMBR is an emerging waste water treatment technology mainly because of its low sludge residual high volumetric organic removal rate complete liquid solid separation better effluent quality efficient resource recovery and the small footprint . This paper surveys the fundamental aspects of AnMBRs including its applications membrane configurations and recent progress for enhanced reactor performance . Furthermore the membrane fouling a major restriction in the practical application of AnMBR its mechanism and antifouling strategies like membrane cleaning quorum quenching ultrasonic treatment membrane modifications and antifouling agents are briefly discussed . Based on the review the key issues that require urgent attention to facilitate large scale and integrated application of AnMBR technology are identified and future research perspectives relating to the prevalent issues are proposed .
