 Catalytic esterified biomass pyrolysis oil is a potential renewable fuel for application in internal combustion engine . Although a number of studies have been conducted on bio oil production and upgrading relatively few attention has been paid on the bio oil application in diesel engine . Here the aim of this paper is to investigate the performance and emission characteristic of EF EA EP in diesel engine . For this purpose 10 and 20 vol . of the selected ester surrogates were blended with diesel and tested in a diesel engine to check the variation of BSEC emission temperature CO emission NO

@highlight The performance and emission characteristics of surrogates from esterified bio oil have been testified in a diesel engine.
@highlight Adding surrogates from esterified bio oil will reduce the emissions of CO and NOx and soot.
@highlight Adding surrogates will influence the morphology and structure of soot.
