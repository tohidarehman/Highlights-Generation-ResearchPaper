 Among hazardous pollutants 2 4 Dinitrophenol is considered highly toxic and possesses a remarkable resistance to degradation . Therefore investigation of the possible mechanisms for removal of such pollutants is important . Laccase enzyme can decompose phenolics despite the fact that its application has been limited due to lack of possibility to reuse it . Immobilization can overcome this problem . In this paper laccase complexes with montmorillonite K10 and zeolite were used to decompose 2 4 DNP with concentrations of 1.5mgl

@highlight Enzyme immobilization has advantages like easier handling and storing.
@highlight Laccase was immobilized on glutaraldehyde coated montmorillonite K10 zeolite.
@highlight Immobilized laccases significantly removed 2 4 dinitrophenol from polluted media.
@highlight Immobilized laccases on zeolite were more effective than the others.
