 The UN Sustainable Development Goals constitute a bench of directives with a universal scope to establish actions to mitigate poverty and protect the environment . Benefiting from the Environmental Economic Accounting for Water recently published in Brazil it is possible to harmonize the demand of water and the economic sectors . To this end this study conducted an input output analysis and structural decomposition analysis to explore the water consumption of the Brazilian Economy and its driving forces during an unprecedented drought and economic recession between 2013 and 2015 . The results indicate that the total variation of the water consumption in the period is 15 . Between 2013 and 2014 the total effect was positive causing an increase of 45 in the embodied water consumption having as main driver the final demand and the intensity effect . In the second period the total intensity effect was negative provoking a decrease of 10 in the total water consumption . The Agriculture livestock forestry and fishing is the main sector responsible for these positive and negative results while the Energy and gas natural supply sector has a strategic position to avoid a structural increase on the economic water demand .

@highlight The agriculture is the most important economic sector in relation to water consumption.
@highlight The power generation has a strategic position which can lead to a structural increase of the water consumption demand.
@highlight The final demand effect dominates the increase in water consumption even during economic recession.
