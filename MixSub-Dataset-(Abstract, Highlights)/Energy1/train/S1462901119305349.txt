 The EU has developed a Directive on Sustainable Use of Chemical Pesticides that aims to enhance the use of non chemical alternatives to pesticides like microbial plant protection products . The number of authorized microbial PPP for plant protection has increased globally during the last decade . There is however variation between different countries . Sweden and Denmark have for example each authorized 20 microbial PPP while Norway has only authorized four microbial PPP . Norway has also received significantly fewer applications for authorization of microbial PPP than the other Scandinavian countries . We explore possible explanations for the observed differences . Our results show that that the regulations in the three countries had similar requirements for the authorisation of microbial PPP . The size of the market is somewhat smaller in Norway than in Sweden and Denmark and could therefore explain some of the differences . We suggest however that the most important explanation is implementation differences in terms of different decisions made in the authorization process . By comparing the authorization process for three microbial PPP in the Scandinavian countries we found that Norway used more time for the product authorization decisions . Norway assess the same types of microbial PPP more restrictively with respect to environmental aspects and especially human health risks .

@highlight Regulatory and market differences could explain some of the differences.
@highlight The most important explanation are different safety judgments made in the authorization process.
