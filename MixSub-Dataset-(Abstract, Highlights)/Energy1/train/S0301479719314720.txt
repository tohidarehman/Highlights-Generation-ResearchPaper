 The purpose of this paper is to contribute with a tool to guide decision makers with some level of understanding of coastal dynamics as to the most appropriate management measures to adopt . A set of indices for assessing beach dune systems and their potential for dune restoration are presented . The systems analysed are described using variables related to physical and anthropic factors and the sites are classified according to the intervention actions required . Fifty beach dune systems representing the range of types of beaches the degree of urbanisation and the dune morphologies found on the Catalan coastline are sampled . The results show that beaches with the most developed dunes usually have high scores for management and low scores for urbanisation while the less developed dunes are found on beaches with very low scores for management . Regarding the potential for dune restoration the beaches are classified into four groups according to the management measures recommended dune conservation dune restoration dune recovery and renaturalisation of beaches where only incipient dunes can be developed .

@highlight A tool to guide decision makers and prioritise beach management is presented.
@highlight Set of indices for assessing dunes and their potential for restoration are designed.
@highlight The most degraded dunes on the Catalan coastline are found on low managed beaches.
@highlight The most developed dunes are found on non urbanised and well managed beaches.
@highlight The four proposals are conservation restoration recovery of dunes and renaturalisation of beaches.
