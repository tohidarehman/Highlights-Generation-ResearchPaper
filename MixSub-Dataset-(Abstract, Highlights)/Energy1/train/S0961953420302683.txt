 Herein we describe a simple and fast spectroscopy method based on the Time Domain Nuclear Magnetic Resonance method to determine the efficiency of lignocellulosic biomass pretreatments for increasing saccharification by enzymes a key step in second generation ethanol production . Three different pretreatments steam explosion and steam exploded and delignified process were used as characteristic processes to reduce biomass recalcitrance being the untreated and treated biomass fully characterized before and after the treatments using electron microscopy structural techniques and the direct evaluation of commercial enzyme activity . The analyses in TD NMR indicate that the binding mode of water 1 . Shorter T

@highlight Fast spectroscopy method based on TD NMR to determine the efficiency of lignocellulose biomass pretreatments is proposed.

@highlight The analyses in TD NMR are directly related to the ability of each process for increasing the enzymatic action.
@highlight TD NMR can be proposed for monitoring during pretreated lignocellulosic biomass in future biorefineries routines.
