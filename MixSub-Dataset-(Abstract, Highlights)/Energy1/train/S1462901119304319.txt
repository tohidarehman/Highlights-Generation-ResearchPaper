 The majority of global emissions scenarios compatible with holding global warming to less than 2C depend on the large scale use of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage to compensate for an overshoot of atmospheric CO

@highlight There is a strong tendency to view IAMs as providing objective analysis.
@highlight Largescale reliance of IAM scenarios on CDR is problematic for a number of reasons.
@highlight Dependence on CDR is being baked into emissions targets without a public debate.
@highlight Polarisation on CDR could hinder progress on CDR and alternative strategies.
@highlight Approaches to allow diversity in value sets in climate policy making is essential.
