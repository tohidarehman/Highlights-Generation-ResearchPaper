 To achieve better controller performance the impact of control parameters on the stability and dynamic performance is essential to be clarified mathematically for hybrid multi terminal HVDC systems considering different operation modes . In this paper a generic small signal model is established which can be modified flexibly for different OMs . Then the SSM can be converted into a transfer function matrix which avoids deriving the transfer function separately for each controller of the system and greatly improves the work efficiency . By inputting a step into the TF Matrix the time domain mathematical model for the all system state variables can be obtained and it is more efficient than iterative solutions of high order differential equations . To this end a quantitative control parameter analysis method based on a TF Matrix is proposed . Utilizing the proposed method a typical Hybrid MTDC system is investigated and the results demonstrate the practicality and accuracy of the proposed method .
