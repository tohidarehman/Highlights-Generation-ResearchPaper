 This paper proposes a fault tolerant control strategy for a doubly fed induction generator based wind energy conversion system with sensor faults . The DFIG system is decomposed into stator rotor grid current models and the sensor fault observer is presented to provide accurate estimations of sensor fault components in the presence of model uncertainties . Based on the independent current dynamics of DFIG system three SFOs are designed in parallel to respectively estimate the stator rotor and grid current senor fault signals . During the occurrence of faults the fault estimations derived from current observers are adopted to compensate the faulty signals thereby achieving the system reconfiguration of DFIG without requiring any fault diagnosis schemes . Simulation studies are undertaken on a grid connected WECS under the conditions of stepped and random wind speeds and single and multiple current sensor faults . Simulation and experimental results reveal that the FTC controlled DFIG system is resilient from the sensor faults and maintains continuous stable operation .
