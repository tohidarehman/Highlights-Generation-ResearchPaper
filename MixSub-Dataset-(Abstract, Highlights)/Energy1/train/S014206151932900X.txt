 Microgrids are emerging as an alternative mode of operation for distribution systems integrated with Distributed Energy Resources . With appropriate management and control of the DERs a section of a distribution system can operate isolated from the main grid thereby enhancing the reliability and security of supply to consumers . However the integration of DERs has raised many technical challenges including protection . The traditional distribution system protection can not provide reliable protection to the microgrid in the isolated mode due to the limited short circuit capacities of the converter interfaced DERs . This paper proposes the application of a new voltage based relay type for the protection of microgrids . The relay algorithm achieves its protection function through active power differential and sensitivity calculations based on voltage measurements within a specified protection zone . In the paper the new relay type is modelled in Digsilent PowerFactory software and installed at the nodes of a microgrid test system . The performance of the relay type is investigated under variety of faults . The relay is shown to operate correctly and effectively to detect and identify faults in both radial and meshed microgrids integrated with inverter interfaced DER technologies .
