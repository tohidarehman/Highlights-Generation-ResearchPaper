 Scientific knowledge is considered to be an important factor in environmental policy making . However the opportunity for environmentalists to influence policy can often occur within short discrete time windows . Therefore a piece of research may have a negligible or transformative policy influence depending on when it is presented . These policy windows are sometimes predictable such as those dealing with conventions or legislation with a defined renewal period but are often hard to anticipate . We describe four ways that environmentalists can respond to policy windows and increase the likelihood of knowledge uptake 1

@highlight Policy windows periodically open enabling easier knowledge uptake.
@highlight Environmental research has tended to regard policy windows as serendipitous.
@highlight We argue that environmentalists can create identify and seize on policy windows.
@highlight We propose a 4 stage framework for practically approaching policy windows.
