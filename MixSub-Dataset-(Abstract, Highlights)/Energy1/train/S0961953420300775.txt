 Granular activated carbon as an economic and robust amorphous material could facilitate the syntrophic metabolism of acetogenesis and methanogenesis during anaerobic digestion of post consumer substrates . In this study influences of supplementing GAC on anaerobic co digestion of brewery waste activated sludge and food waste for the production of methane were investigated by analysing the VFA production ammonia concentration pH oxidation reduction potential and electrical conductivity . Our data showed that a 45 increase in methane production with adding 1.5 GAC was achieved . The maximum amount of 478mL CH

@highlight 45 increase of methane production was achieved by supplementing 1.5 GAC.
@highlight Co digestion of FW and brewery sludge was carried out to provide suitable usage of post consumer substrate.
@highlight Biofilms formed on GAC suggest the electron transfer to the acetogenesis and methanogenesis was enhanced.
@highlight ORP EC VFA and ammonia concentrations were monitored during AD to understand influence of adding GAC.
