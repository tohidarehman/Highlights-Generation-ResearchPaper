 Management of bacterial survival post chlorine disinfection is vital for safe wastewater reuse for irrigation as the presence of microorganisms in large numbers may lead to subsequent contamination of the surface and ground water reservoirs . Even after satisfying the current norms of coliform counts after disinfection chlorine tolerant bacteria surviving in inadequately treated wastewater may pose a public health threat as many of these bacteria are able to re grow upon storage . The current study is aimed to assess the magnitude of the problem posed by chlorine tolerant bacteria during chlorine disinfection and attempts to derive a strategy for safe disinfection . The chlorine tolerance was examined in the dominant gram negative bacteria recovered from secondary treated sewage from a treatment plant located at Jaipur India . Bacterial survival and re growth studies on test species with reference to

@highlight Majority of bacteria registered significant re growth p 0.05 post chlorination.
