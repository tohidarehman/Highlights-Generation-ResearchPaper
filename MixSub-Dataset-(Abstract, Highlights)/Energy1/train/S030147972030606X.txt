 To avoid hydrogen injection and to enhance the settleability of microbial biomass in biological treatment of nitrate contaminated drinking water resources a new method based on granulation of a mixture of hydrogen consumer denitrifiers and microalgae is introduced . Decreasing hydraulic retention time was applied as the selection pressure in an up flow photobioreactor to increase the speed of granulation and nitrate removal under autotrophic condition during a 50 day operation . Formation of granules occurred at three phases including granule nucleation growth of granule and mature granule with decreasing the values of potential from 19 mV to 4 mV . Enhancement of microbial attachment within granule formation could reduce the presence of total suspended solids in the effluent . Developed granules of HCD and microalgae could settle down with velocity of 400.6m h when reaching the average size of 1.2mmat day 40 . Complete NO
