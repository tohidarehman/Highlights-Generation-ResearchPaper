 Wide area differential protection uses the wide area multiple information to quickly identify faults . It is not affected by factors such as grounding resistance and distributed capacitance . As the wide area measurement requires the high synchronization of wide area information its protection sensitivity is reduced by the accumulative errors . A novel wide area protection algorithm is proposed in this paper to solve these problems . Firstly the information of the single terminal voltage phasor and the differential current phasors of the transmission line are used to construct the protection criteria based on the composite impedance . Then the criteria of the fault identification and fault branch are established based on the information of the wide area branch direction and regional direction . The advantages of the wide area differential protection are retained in the proposed algorithm . The high dependence on the synchronization of wide area information is overcome and it is not affected by the high grounding resistance and the load current . The validity of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulation tests of the IEEE 10 generator 39 bus system .
