 Electricity transmissions have been utilized in China to balance its spatially mismatched development needs and natural resources endowments . However it has led to spatial shifts of negative environmental impacts induced by electricity generations including water consumption and carbon emissions . This study calculates that from 2010 to 2016 carbon emissions and water consumption to produce the transmitted electricity have grown from 507Mt and 2.7km

@highlight Carbon emitted and water consumed for China s power transmission have increased.
@highlight 642Mt carbon emitted and 6.5km water consumed for China s power transfers in 2016.
@highlight Changing generation and transmission structures reduce carbon but increase water.
@highlight Power transmissions led to 155.27Mt of national net carbon reduction in 2016.
@highlight Power transmissions led to 3.4km of national net water consumption increase.
