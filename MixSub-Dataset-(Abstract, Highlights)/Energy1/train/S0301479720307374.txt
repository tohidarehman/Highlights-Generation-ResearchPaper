 Soil pollution is a serious environmental issue in China . As a key subject of agricultural practices promoting Chinese farmers Pro Environmental Behavior through increasing their soil pollution risk perception is an important means for soil protection agricultural transformation and ecological development . In this study we distinguish four dimensions of soil pollution risk perception fact perception loss perception cause perception and response behavior ability perception . We conceptualize a model that depicts the relationships between the four dimensions of Chinese farmers soil pollution risk perception and their PEB and the moderating effect of farms household income level on these relationships . Using a questionnaire survey to collect empirical data we find first the four dimensions of Chinese farmers soil pollution risk perception have positive effects on their PEB second Chinese farmers household income level positively moderates the relationships between their FP LP and CP and their PEB but its moderating effect on the relationship between their RBAP and their PEB is not significant . Relevant theory and policy implications for environmental management are discussed in the paper .
