 As a consequence of the rapid utilization of fossil resources the effective sustainable biomass transformation will get great importance towards the production of valuable chemicals . Here we developed 5wt Ni loaded Cu supported on SBA 16and evaluated its catalytic performance in the hydrogenation of 5 hydroxymethylfurfural which was carried out a bench top stainless steel autoclave reactor . The major product in the present reaction is 2 5 dimethylfuran . A number of characterization techniques were used to clarify the effective loading of bimetals on SBA 16 and the novelty of catalysts . The prepared bimetallic catalysts reduction profile shifted towards lower temperatures compared to a monometallic catalyst indicating stronger metal metal interaction . X ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed to distinguish between oxide and metallic states of Ni and Cu . Among the prepared catalysts 5Ni12Cu SBA 16 exhibited superior performance regarding the entire conversion of 5 HMF on account of better synergy between Cu and Ni species well dispersion of the metal in the support favorable surface acidity . Also this catalyst shows a favorable DMF yield of 60.7 and DMF is the major hydrogenation product in all the reactions . The reaction was thoroughly optimized and developed by a thorough investigation of various reaction parameters such as Ni Cu ratio temperature pressure reaction time and catalyst recyclability .
