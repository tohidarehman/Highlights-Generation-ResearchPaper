 Multi area interconnected schemes are beneficial for power networks to coordinate energy resources and have created the need to identify the critical conditions for transferring power among multiple subareas . This study proposes an improved continuation power flow model to calculate the power transfer limits among interconnected networks corresponding to either saddle node bifurcation or limit induced bifurcation . Formulations of the cooperation in multi area automatic generation control systems are proposed to express the power balance in each subarea and the adjustments of power exchange . The predictor corrector scheme for the improved CPF is derived and restated . Moreover a practical step size control method is proposed in accordance with polynomial fitting analysis with the relevant computational variables to enhance the performance and efficiency of CPF steps . Case studies based on an IEEE 5 bus IEEE 118 bus and Polish 2383 bus test system demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed CPF model and its ability to generate reliable PTL results .

@highlight The parameterized formulations of power flow and the CPF model for multi area is proposed.
@highlight Formulations of predictor and corrector of multi area CPF model are derived.
@highlight A practical step size control method is established by the polynomial fitting analysis.
@highlight PTL calculations result in three case studies that verified the proposed model.
