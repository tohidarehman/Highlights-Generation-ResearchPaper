 This paper presents an impedance based method to estimate the fault location in transmission lines . The mathematical formulation uses a generalized equation for the estimation of the fault distance which does not depend on the fault type and its solution is obtained by the application of a least squares method . The method considers available voltage and current measurements at both terminals of the transmission line as well as the line parameters . Additionally the proposed method shows an adequate performance for the fault detection . Moreover you can use it for locating high and low impedance faults . The paper presents extensive numerical experiments demonstrating that the method has high accuracy specifically the error in fault location accuracy is under 10 for more than 80 of the test cases . The easiness of method implementation and encouraging test results indicate potential for real life applications .
