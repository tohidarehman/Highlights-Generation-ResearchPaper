 Open phase conditions typically result in very low fault currents which makes their detection using the existing conventional protective relaying schemes very difficult . This paper proposes a new current only Open Phase Detection scheme suitable for effectively grounded distribution networks . The proposed OPD approach is based on the prevailing current imbalance in the network . Reference phase currents are calculated online using Residual Current Multiplying Factors and are afterwards compared with the measured phase currents . A mismatch between the predicted reference phase currents and the measured phase currents is used as an indication of an open conductor event .

@highlight At present only very few publications addressing the OPD problem exist in the literature. This paper presents the development of an Open Phase Detection OPD method suitable for effectively grounded distribution systems with single and multiple infeeds.
@highlight The proposed OPD approach is a current only method based on the prevailing current imbalance in the power system. Reference phase currents are calculated predicted online in real time using residual current multiplying factors. A mismatch between the predicted reference phase currents and the measured phase currents is used as an indication of an open conductor event.
@highlight The identification of the affected circuits phases 
@highlight The practicability and applicability of the proposed OPD method in radial distribution networks looped systems and for lightly loaded or unloaded SATs.
@highlight Performance testing of the proposed method using the Real Time Digital Simulator RTDS .
