 Bioflocculation phenomena for filamentous cyanobacteria were studied and analysed in two different cultivation systems and for different initial biomass concentrations . Floc formation and biomass settling were monitored during batch cultivation tests according to an innovative protocol . Results showed that the two cultivation systems enhanced two different flocculation behaviours air bubbling led to the formation of small and dense flocs while the shaking table resulted in larger 14mm

@highlight Different mixing systems air bubbles shaking induced different bioflocculation behaviour.
@highlight Flocs formation was influenced by the initial biomass concentration.
@highlight 70 of the total cultivated biomass was recovered through natural settling in 50min.
@highlight A new method to evaluate biomass settling dynamics through image analysis has been developed.
@highlight A mathematical model has been developed to deeply investigate the bioflocculation dynamics and factors of influence.
