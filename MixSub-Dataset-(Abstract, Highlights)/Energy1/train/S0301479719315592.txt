 A process for the continuous extraction of ammonia from anaerobic digesters is proposed . In this process a portion of the sludge treated in the digesters is continuously withdrawn and transferred to a thin film evaporator unit where the ammonia is stripped through a biogas stream . The ammonia rich biogas is treated with a sulfuric acid water solution in a reactive absorption unit with production of ammonium sulphate . The chemistry of a CH

@highlight A process for stripping ammonia from an anaerobic digester is proposed.
@highlight Stripping is carried out through biogas.
@highlight Upon absorption into a water sulfuric acid stream ammonium sulphate is formed.
@highlight Pilot plant experimental data confirm theoretical calculations.
@highlight TAN in the digester decreases when the side stream ammonia stripper is in operation.
