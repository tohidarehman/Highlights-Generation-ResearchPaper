 This paper presents the catalytic activity of ruthenium phosphides supported on SBA 15 material as hydrodesulfurization catalysts of gasoline model compounds . It was studied the influence of the P Ru molar ratio of 0.5 1 2 3 and 4.5 in the hydrodesulfurization of 3 methyl thiophene as a model molecule and evaluated under mild reaction conditions . The ruthenium phosphide phase was synthesized from a conventional phosphate reduction method using RuCl

@highlight The ruthenium phosphide catalysts are effective for the HDS for selective sulfur removal of gasoline model compounds.
@highlight The phosphorus load leads the formation of Ru
@highlight P active phase optimizing a P Ru molar ratio of 3.
@highlight The ruthenium phosphide catalysts displayed medium acidity properties that led to a high isomerization ability.
