 Struvite precipitated from wastewaters is an important fertilizer . However struvite derived from wastewater usually contains toxic Pb which can bring contamination to soil and even plants . Thus understanding the incorporation mechanisms of Pb

@highlight  99 of Pb was incorporated into struvite solids at 0.1100mg L of Pb.
@highlight Pb bound with PO
@highlight and OH adsorbs on struvite surface at 0.11mg L of Pb.
@highlight Pb precipitated as Pb
