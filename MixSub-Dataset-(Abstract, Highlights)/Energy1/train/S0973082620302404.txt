 Solar inverter providers optionally offer plant operators online access to their installed photovoltaic systems . Benefits consist of better system monitoring faster response to maintenance needs and a more comfortable data acquisition . Data mining from an online database enables a comparative statistical analysis for a large number of plants about specific productivity parameters emission reductions and monetary savings . Restriction of information usually confines the progress of PV systems . Due to this situation the Sunnyportal website managed by one of the most important world provider of solar inverters does not delimit the visualization of their own systems . In addition there is unrestricted access to their available plants in cases where the owners set the status of their plants as public . This study gathered and analyzed information on photovoltaic installations in Mexico with free access to production data . The results show an increase of almost 700 in the number of registered plants in Mexico with exponential growth since 2012 . Mexico still shows a lack of studies regarding the monitoring of PV systems because available data are scarce . The specific productivity rate of the PV systems primarily depends on solar irradiation on site weather conditions air contamination the technology employed correct engineering and plant maintenance . Based on data obtained conclusions are drawn concerning preferences and performance of Mexican PV plants . The most both surprising as well as important result is that there is no correlation between specific productivity and average daily on site irradiation .

@highlight PV systems in Mexico generate in the range between 90 and 125 kWh kW
@highlight month
@highlight Specific production of PV plants in Mexico is less than the projected production.
@highlight Solar irradiation is overestimated in comparison to other factors.
@highlight Only a slight increase in productivity with increasing irradiation is observed.
