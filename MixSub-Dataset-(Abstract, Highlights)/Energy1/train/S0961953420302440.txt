 Biochar has the potential to increase crop yields on degraded tropical soils . It can be readily produced in rural community settings using low cost technology and is most economically feasible if produced from local biomass or waste residues . Biochar was produced from

@highlight Low cost
@highlight biochar improved crop yield only on very acidic tropical soils.
@highlight Biochar reduced short term soil N availability potentially improving N retention.
@highlight Increased yield was associated with high soil Mg and low Fe Mn and Al availability.
