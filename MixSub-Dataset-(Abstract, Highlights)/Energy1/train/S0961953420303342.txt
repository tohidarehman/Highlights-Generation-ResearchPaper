 Many environmental benefits have been claimed for anaerobic digestion facilities embracing waste management and multiple energy vectors that could be help create more circular economies . Whether these benefits are realised depends greatly on the sites exploited for AD plants and the social and geographical conditions . To examine this we assess the distribution of AD plants in Wales and the socio demographic characteristics of the populations that live in close proximity . The results show that farm fed ADs are predominantly located in rural villages and sparsely populated settings while waste fed AD plants could be found more evenly distributed in both rural villages towns and cities . In addition populations living in proximity to AD plants tend to be older frequently in families without children and without any central heating in neighbourhoods experiencing deprivation in access to services . Our results are significant for our understanding who could be both positively and negatively affected by the AD operation and how these facilities could contribute to the social development of communities . Factors affecting the realization of prospective benefits from farm fed ADs include public sensitivities to development in these rural idyll locations and the economics of using AD to re tool energy systems in more sparsely populated rural sites .

@highlight Characteristics of population living around AD plants in Wales are studied.
@highlight AD plants contribute to the creation of new circular economies in the countryside.
@highlight In proximity of AD plants lives rather older population and families without children.
@highlight In neighbourhoods of ADs deprivation in access to services was detected.
@highlight There is a scope for policies to support usage of outputs of AD.
