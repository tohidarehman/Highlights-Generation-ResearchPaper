 Industrial pollution is a great concern for modern society and developing cyclic processes is one of the major challenges . As far as we know this work is the first to report the use of multiple white rot fungi species for degrading a binary mixture of anionic dyes under solid state fermentation conditions and a further physicochemical characterization of the residual biomass . First eight white rot fungi decolorized the dye mixture of brilliant blue FCF and allura red AC adsorbed onto corncob reaching decolorizations between 11.47 and 87.64 . Then
