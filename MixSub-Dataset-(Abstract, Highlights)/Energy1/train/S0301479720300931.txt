 The degradation of four representative neonicotinoids namely Thiamethoxam Imidacloprid Acetamiprid and Thiacloprid was carried out by the sequential association of different advanced oxidation processes including Ozonation Electro chemical Oxidation Ultrasound Ultraviolet radiation and their different possible associations . There are no published papers in the literature on the removal of this type of insecticides through these associated oxidation processes . Single oxidation processes did not achieve total pollutants removal in less than 3h . For double sequential processes Electro oxidation Ozone treatment obtains a total removal of Imidacloprid in 120min and an increase of mineralization to 50 TOC . Three or four sequential processes are recommended to improve degradation and mineralization rates in a significant way Electro oxidation Ozone UV treatment obtains a total removal of Thiamethoxan in 80min with mineralization over 75 TOC . These results confirm important synergistic effects which were quantified . The global trend indicates that Thiamethoxam is the most oxidizable neonicotinoid whereas Acetamiprid is the most recalcitrant compound . The degradation rate of each neonicotinoid followed pseudo first order kinetics and the different oxidation pathways were also quantified from a kinetic point of view .

@highlight Surface water contamination by neonicotinoid insecticides is currently a problem of growing interest.
@highlight Ozonation electro chemical sono chemical photochemical were investigated for the degradation of common neonicotinoids.
@highlight Binary tertiary and quaternary sequential oxidation processes were tested to improve degradation and mineralization.
@highlight Important synergistic effects in mineralization and kinetics were achieved when different processes were combined.
