 Thermal conversion is an effective non traditional method for sewage sludge disposal . Herein the application of sorption enhanced steam gasification to sewage sludge treatment is experimentally investigated to generate hydrogen rich syngas in a fixed bed setup . The main aim was to determine the optimal conditions and suitable sorbents for this process . CaO was selected as the sorbent and different CaO sorbents were prepared via the sol gel method . Al

@highlight Hydrogen rich syngas was produced from sludge gasification by sorption enhancement.
