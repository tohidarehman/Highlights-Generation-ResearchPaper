 Wetland ecosystems have a disproportionally large influence on the global carbon cycle . They can act as carbon sinks or sources depending upon their location type and condition . Rehabilitation of wetlands is gaining popularity as a nature based approach to helping mitigate climate change however few studies have empirically tested the carbon benefits of wetland restoration especially in freshwater environments . Here we investigated the effects of passive rehabilitation of 16 semi arid rain filled freshwater wetlands in southeastern Australia . Eight control sites were compared with older or newer rehabilitated sites dominated by graminoids or eucalypts . Carbon stocks and emissions carbon dioxide CO

@highlight Rehabilitation did not increase soil carbon or reduce greenhouse gas GHG emissions.
@highlight Aboveground plant biomass was highest in sites rehabilitated 1020 years ago.
@highlight Hydrology drove GHG emissions CO
@highlight decreased in the wet phase while CH
@highlight increased.
@highlight Dominant vegetation type influenced aboveground plant carbon and GHG emissions.
