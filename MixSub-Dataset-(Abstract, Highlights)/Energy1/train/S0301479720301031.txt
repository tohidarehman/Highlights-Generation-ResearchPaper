 The efficacy of direct control methods in bark beetle outbreaks is a disputed topic . While some studies report that control reduces tree mortality others see little effect . Existing models linking control rate to beetle population dynamics and tree infestations give insights but there is a need to take into account the environment spatial variability and its impact on beetle life cycle . Here we use natural variability found in a carefully monitored and controlled infestation to simulate outbreak dynamics under different control effort and to explore the impact of control on outbreaks suppression and tree mortality . Our semi empirical predictive model of the number of infested trees as a function of ecological and environmental variables is coupled to a simulation model for infestation dynamics . We show that even a little control can have a major impact on the number of infested trees after several years of sustained effort . However a moderate control of 60 is required to reduce the beetle population on the long term . Furthermore a control rate of 69 83 is needed to achieve outbreak suppression in under 13 years depending on the abundance of incoming flights from outside sources .

@highlight Direct control impacts outbreak duration and host mortality even at a low level.
@highlight Moderate control is required to reduce pest population on the long term.
@highlight A significant control rate is needed to achieve quick outbreak eradication.
