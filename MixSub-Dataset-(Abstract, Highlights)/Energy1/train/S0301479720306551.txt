 We develop and operationalize an integrated groundwater and watershed management model using data from the Kholo aquifer on the west coast of Hawai i Island . Results from a numerical simulation suggest that investment in fencing is preferred to invasive species removal if we are limited to selecting a single conservation tool . However using both instruments jointly increases net present value relative to using either instrument independently in most cases tested and the additional benefit of invasive species removal increases as water becomes scarcer . The general results are largely insensitive to variations in the invasive species uptake rate and recharge benefits of fencing and in all cases use of both instruments reduces the loss resulting from the imposition of a safe minimum standard for groundwater dependent ecosystems more effectively than either instrument alone .

@highlight Upstream and midstream watershed management supports downstream ecosystem health.
@highlight When groundwater is scarce using multiple management instruments is always optimal.
@highlight Optimal watershed management reduces loss from imposition of a safe minimum standard.
@highlight Results are insensitive to variations in invasive uptake rate and recharge benefit of fencing.
