 This paper introduces a communication aided scheme to enhance the fault detection and fault location calculation for a thyristor controlled series capacitor compensated transmission lines . In the proposed method only the current data at the remote end should be synchronously sent to the local end . Since the remote end voltage data do not use in local end compared with the conventional pilot impedance based protection schemes the proposed method significantly reduces the requirement of data transmission bandwidth . The proposed algorithm is independent of fault resistance power flow direction and pre fault condition . In the proposed method the TCSC parameters are not utilized in the derived fault location formula and as a result the performance of the proposed method is not impacted due to variations in TCSC parameters . Several major factors are taken to investigate the accuracy of the proposed method including measurement errors and power swing conditions . The simulation results prove the high accuracy and acceleration of the proposed scheme during all fault cases .

@highlight A pilot scheme to enhance the fault location for TCSC compensated line is proposed.
@highlight In this method only the current data at remote end should be sent to the local end.
@highlight The proposed algorithm is independent of fault resistance and TCSC parameters.
