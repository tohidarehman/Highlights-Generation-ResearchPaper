 Agricultural use is the main way of recycling sewage sludge . Besides providing nutrients and organic matter to crops and soils it is an important alternative for recycling this residue . However problems during the sewage treatment process may generate sludge batches with an acidic pH . Thus it is essential to understand the consequences of using such sludge on soils and plants and to explore ways to overcome this limitation . The objective of this study was to evaluate addition rates of anaerobic sewage sludge with acidic compositions on the soil fertility and performance of lettuce plants . Additionally a methodology for pH correction of ASS with acidic pH is proposed . An agronomic experiment was conducted in a greenhouse using seven addition rates of ASS 0.0 0.25 0.5 1 2 4 and 8gkg

@highlight Anaerobic sewage sludge with acid pH were evaluated for agricultural purposes.
@highlight Acid pH limit the benefits of sewage sludge on soil fertility and crop response.
@highlight A simple and fast method of pH correction through limestone addition was proposed.
@highlight Long stay solarization provided suitable levels of pathogens for agricultural use.
@highlight Solarization and pH correction improved agronomic aspects of anaerobic sewage sludge.
