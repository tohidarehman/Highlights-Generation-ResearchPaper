 The continuous biodiesel production process under sub and supercritical conditions using a trace amount of potassium hydroxide as a catalyst has been studied . CO

@highlight Application of supercritical technology in chemical energy materials production discussed
@highlight Method is a novel approach to study use of supercritical ethanol in biodiesel production
@highlight CO
@highlight added as a co solvent to reduce reaction time and increase biodiesel yield
@highlight Shorter reaction time milder conditions reduce energy consumption and simplify separation step
@highlight Kinetic model for biodiesel production evaluated with calculated thermodynamic parameters
