 The gasoline market in the US is nearly twice that of diesel and jet fuel combined and yet nearly all research efforts to produce synthetic biobased fuels center around these latter products . The reason for this is that a major component of gasoline is highly branched alkanes which unlike straight chained products are not readily derived from either fatty acid or carbohydrate based feedstocks . This review unpacks the motivations behind renewable gasoline synthesis and examines representative approaches to the targeted de novo synthesis of densely branched high octane isoalkanes and cycloalkanes employing chemocatalytic methods as contrasted with the catalytic refining of biomass derived feeds using petrochemical technologies .

@highlight The mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is a global environmental imperative
@highlight Most de novo synthetic approaches to hydrocarbons target diesel and jet fuel
@highlight Introducing biomass derived feeds into petrochemical refining streams is practicable but involves technological challenges
@highlight Isolkanes and cycloalkanes suitable for use in gasoline can be efficiently synthesized from biobased platform molecules
