 Biomass is the sole renewable organic carbon resource in nature . Conversion of Biomass can produce a series of platform molecules . As an essential multi purpose bioderived furanic platform compound 5 hydroxymethylfurfural can be effectively transformed into a variety of value added derivatives due to its rich chemistry and potential availability which is an ideal renewable alternative to fossil fuels . This review highlights recent advances in the development of efficient catalytic systems for the conversion of HMF especially heterogeneous catalysts . Heterogeneous catalysts have advantages in facile separation and recovery tunable performance by adjusting catalyst structures . Simultaneously we mainly focus on the application of downstream products in material monomers pharmaceutical intermediates and fuels . Furthermore a few potential research trends are also proposed in order to provide some useful ideas for the further exploration of the utilization and conversion of HMF in a much simple efficient and economical way .

@highlight Highly summarized recent advances in the conversion of HMF into monomers fuels and pharmaceutical intermediates
@highlight Discussion of research priorities and current challenges in the preparation of HMF downstream products
@highlight Prospects for potential research directions downstream of HMF
