 The reactive nitrogen loss of the rice cropping system in the arid region shows a different pattern from that of subtropical humid region due to different climate types and crop management . However little attention has been paid to this region . To fill this knowledge gap a two year field observation was conducted in the Ningxia irrigation region northwest China to explore the major pathway of N loss following local farmers optimal practice . Further we determined the site specific emission factors of ammonia and nitrous oxide rate of surface runoff and subsurface to improve the inventory resolution of arid irrigation region . Results showed that ammonia volatilization leaching and seepage were proved to be the primary factors of N loss in rice paddy fields . The emission factor of ammonia and N leaching rate following farmers practice were 2.1 and 5.4 times higher than the country specific default value in China . The country specific N runoff rate and emission factor of N

@highlight NH
@highlight emission and N leaching are main N loss for rice paddy in arid irrigation area.
@highlight NH
@highlight volatilization rate and N leaching rate were underestimated previously.
@highlight 20 N fertilizer reduction reduce environmental loss without yield penalty.
