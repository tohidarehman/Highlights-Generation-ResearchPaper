 This work presents a new bioprocess design which allows a substantial reduction of organic and inhibitory compounds and a better quality of the final treated water . The process involves a physicochemical and a biological treatment which were tested separately with lab equipment for olive oil mill wastewater . Primary treatment of OMW involved flocculation sedimentation by Flocudex CS 51 and microfiltration using a 0.2m membrane . Secondary treatment consisted of

@highlight A combined bioprocess was established for industrial OMW treatment.
@highlight Flocculation and microfiltration removed organic and growth inhibitors compounds.
@highlight culture as secondary treatment assimilated TOC IC TN and TPCs.
@highlight High energetic compounds contents were achieved in final biomass generated.
