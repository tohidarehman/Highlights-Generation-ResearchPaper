 Fuels and fuel additives from furfural derivatives via etherification are reviewed . Etherification is classified into two methods such as reductive etherification and direct etherification . A previous study showed that ethers containing shorter alkyl chains increase the octane number of fuels . Ethers containing longer alkyl chains enhanced the cetane number of diesel fuel . The etherification of furfural and its derivatives hold particular promise for the production of fuel additives . There are two strategies to produce furanic ethers the conversion of furfural to furfuryl alcohol or acetal followed by etherification and the etherification of furfuryl alcohol occasionally known as direct etherification . Both strategies require an acid catalyst . The conversion of furfuryl alcohol to furfuryl ethers was influenced by Brnsted or Lewis acid . The synthesis of methylfurans which has higher research octane number than gasoline is also described .
