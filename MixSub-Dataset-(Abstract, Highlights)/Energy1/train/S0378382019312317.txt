 Ethanol steam reforming is a promising reaction as a sustainable carbon neutral hydrogen production process . Because of their high activity and low cost Co based and Ni based catalysts are suitable for industrial ESR processes . Nevertheless these catalysts present several issues such as deactivation by coke formation and methane formation as a by product . This review summarizes the most recent three years works related to ESR for hydrogen production over non noble transition metal catalysts exploring their catalytic performance coke formation and reaction mechanisms to provide direction for the development of high performance catalysts . Findings suggest the particle size and oxidation state of the active metal acidbase and redox properties of the support and appropriate promoter selection as important factors to minimize coke and by product formation .
