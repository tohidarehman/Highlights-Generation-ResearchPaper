 The summation impedance relay is characterized by a strong sensitivity to high resistance faults . However previous studies have not made SIR completely immune to the adverse influence of distributed capacitive currents and have ignored its inherent deficiency of faulted phase selectivity . Therefore a novel protection scheme is proposed . First by compensating distributed capacitive currents an improved ground type SIR is created . Using this SIR the identification of internal high resistance faults is performed while guaranteeing security under external faults . Then a novel phase type SIR is designed based on which a suitable phase selection algorithm is proposed to distinguish single phase faults and multi phase faults . Comprehensive simulations show the security and dependability of the proposed protection scheme in various fault scenarios including non linear high impedance faults and series compensation scenarios . Moreover the approachs performance under power swings is investigated revealing its complementarity with existing protection principles .
