 A rate based model of desorber column in carbon dioxide capture process by MEA solution was performed using Aspen Plus software . The effect of different reaction kinetics and mass transfer correlations were assessed simultaneously . The results show the higher effect of kinetic model on prediction of the rate based model of desorber than the mass transfer correlations . The effect of flow model on rate based modeling of desorber was also studied and a proper flow model was chosen . The axial discretization of desorber column was changed to study the effect of this parameter on prediction of model . The parameters of film discretization were another assessed parameters that showed a negligible impact on prediction of rate based model of desorber column . The optimum model was validated using several experimental data sets from literature . Results indicated the good performance of optimum model in prediction of temperature and concentration profiles along the desorber column and low errors in prediction of several variables in outlet streams with respect to experimental data .

@highlight A rigorous rate based model for simulation of de absorber in PCC process with MEA solvent was developed and validated.
@highlight The effects of different rate based parameters on accuracy of the developed model were studied.
@highlight A more decisive effect of kinetic model on accuracy of rate based model compared to mass transfer model was inferred.
@highlight The activity based kinetic models result in more accurate prediction of rate based model compared to concentration based ones.
