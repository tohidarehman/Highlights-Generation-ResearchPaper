 In this study batch tests were conducted with and without the addition of calcium ions to clarify the interaction between calcium ions and extracellular polymeric substances . The maximum degradation rates of EPS and chemical oxygen demand in the reactor with the addition of Ca

@highlight Ca
@highlight promoted the secretion of EPS and improved sludge digestion performance.
@highlight EPS content is positively correlated with the degradation rate of COD.
@highlight Ca
@highlight affect sludge digestion performance via changing EPS.
