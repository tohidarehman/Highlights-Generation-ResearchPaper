 The work presented in this article proposes a new energy management algorithm for hybrid micro grids consisting of higher penetration of DC non critical loads and renewable energy sources . The methodology suggested in this work is a rule based approach and tries to make the micro grids more autonomous . During generation deficits in the micro grids the suggested control strategy proposes to make the hybrid micro grids self dependent to a possible extent without the incorporation of actual storage devices . Instead of using actual storage elements like the batteries or super capacitors the projected approach uses virtual storage devices like the DC electric springs for its functionality . The electric springs used in this work operate the DC NC loads in accordance with the voltage produced by the renewable sources which in turn reduces the power import from the main grid during generation deficits in the micro grid . Further the work presented in the due course only studies about the efficiency of the proposed algorithm by operating the DC NC loads as per the requirement without intervening with the AC and DC critical loads operation . In order to test the robustness of the proposed methodology a scaled down hybrid micro grid is developed in the laboratory using dSPACE 1104 real time interface .
