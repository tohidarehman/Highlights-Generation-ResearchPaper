 Household fuel substitution has been a crucial step for controlling air pollution in China but the performance evaluation of household fuel substitution policies is overlooked . This study capitalized on the opportunity to use data collected during the household coal replacement program in North China to evaluate the effect of a mandatory policy on fuel substitution at the micro level . The results indicate that there is a significant effect of the coal replacement program on fuel substitution as we expected . The coal to electricity policy is effective in achieving the goal of a clean winter but not a warm winter due to the decline of delivered energy while the high quality coal replacement policy results in better performance in delivered energy but no improvement in indoor air quality . It is recommended to prioritize supporting measures on both the supply and demand sides before implementation along with undertaking differential measures during the implementation phase to better address energy inequality .

@highlight China s coal replacement program improves household energy structure.
@highlight Coal to electricity policy worsens delivered energy but improves indoor air quality.
@highlight Higher quality coal replacement policy only achieves the goal of warm winter.
@highlight Mandatory fuel substitution should consider energy affordability and energy infrastructure.
@highlight Differential measures are needed to ameliorate the policies.
