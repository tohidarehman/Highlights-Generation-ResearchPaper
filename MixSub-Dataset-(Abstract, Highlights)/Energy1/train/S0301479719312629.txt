 The present work was conducted to evaluate the carbon storage potential of Moroccan cedar forest and its vulnerability to transformations through deforestation and overgrazing . The present study took place in the Middle Atlas where is the most beautiful of Moroccan cedar forest

@highlight The storage of carbon in Cleared area was 5 times less than forest.
@highlight Conversion of Cedar forest into cleared area decreased soil physical quality.
@highlight Uronic sugars can be the best indicator of the richness in soil organic carbon.
@highlight Neutral sugars appear the good indicator of soil physical quality.
@highlight The soil was the largest carbon reservoir.
