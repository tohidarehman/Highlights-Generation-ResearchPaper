 Human activities are considered a critical impact factor for decision making in coupled human nature systems such as conservation of coastal systems . Identifying key human activities that cause significant habitat degradation for coastal species remains challenging . We improved the spatial subsidy approach to identify and prioritize control strategies for human caused distribution shifts of marine species . We applied this method to a threatened Indo Pacific humpback dolphin

@highlight Trade off values are used to develop spatial subsidies for humpback dolphins.
@highlight Human impacts prevent an existing nature reserve from covering the dolphins home.
@highlight Tourism and construction need to pay more for the conservation of humpback dolphins.
