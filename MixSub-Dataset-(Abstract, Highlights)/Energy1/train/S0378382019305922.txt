 There are several options for biomass valorization either for value added products manufacturing or for heat and power generation . Among the various concepts gasification based pathways attract a lot of interest mainly because all the biomass components that consist of C and H can be converted into syngas which in turn can be valorized for various applications . Many numerical studies on steady state process modeling have been performed to simulate the complex processes and to propose novel concepts for the effective design of a gasification based route . However dynamic process modeling is an important numerical tool providing a deeper understanding of the behavior of each process step under unsteady conditions and the potential to develop an appropriate control strategy . A review of the dynamic modeling approaches and the control strategies for the main process sections of biomass thermochemical conversion either via gasification or through direct combustion was undertaken . Methodologies towards the proper control of the main units the different tools and platforms that are used for the dynamic modeling and the control system design are presented and analyzed . Finally the challenges that need to be overcome for the plantwide control of the thermochemically based systems are discussed .
