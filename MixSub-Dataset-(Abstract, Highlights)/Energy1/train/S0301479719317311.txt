 The effect of competition between isolated petroleum degrading bacteria and indigenous compost microorganisms on the efficiency of composting process in bioremediation of petroleum waste sludge was investigated . After isolating two native PDB

@highlight The native strains KA5 and KA6 were isolated from petroleum waste sludge.
@highlight The consortium degraded hydrocarbon in mineral medium and composting process.
@highlight A competition between the consortium and indigenous compost organisms was observed.
@highlight The competition lowered the consortium efficiency in hydrocarbon degradation.
