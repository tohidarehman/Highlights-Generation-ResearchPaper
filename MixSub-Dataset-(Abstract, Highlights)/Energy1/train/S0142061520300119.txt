 The coupled multiple energy carriers integrated with distributed energy units e.g . energy converters renewable energy and storages have offered energy hubs high flexibility and independent controllability . In this paper a decentralized transactive based energy management framework enabling coordination among multiple energy hubs is developed . Aiming to improve the economic performance of the interconnected energy hub system a peer to peer transaction platform is established for the self organized trading of MEH . Particularly a generic scheme for the generation of transaction prices is specified for the energy hub which is firstly integrated into a modified alternating direction method of multipliers method for the realization of achieving P2P transaction consensus amongst MEHs . Furthermore this price scheme offers high traceability of energy price flows inner EHs operation process and external energy transaction activities providing transparent price signals in the local P2P market . A three energy hub system is simulated and numerical case studies have demonstrated the proposed coordination scheme actively encourages individual EH to enroll in the P2P transaction scheme offering all EHs a win win transaction framework and improving the global economic efficiency of the networked system .
