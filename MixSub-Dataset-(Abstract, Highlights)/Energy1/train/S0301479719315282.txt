 In order to predict the effects of climate change on the global carbon cycle it is crucial to understand the environmental factors that affect soil carbon storage in grasslands . In the present study we attempted to explain the relationships between the distribution of soil carbon storage with climate soil types soil properties and topographical factors across different types of grasslands with different grazing regimes . We measured soil organic carbon in 92 locations at different soil depth increments from 0 to 100cm in southwestern China . Among soil types brown earth soils had the highest carbon storage with 19.52.5kgm

@highlight Soil carbon storage was compared among grasslands of Yunnan province China.
@highlight Mean soil carbon density was 12.1kgCm
@highlight in the top 100cm soil layer.
@highlight Seasonal and year long grazed grasslands also had greater soil carbon storage.
@highlight MAT MAP soil type and topography significantly affected soil carbon storage.
@highlight Environmental factors explained 60 of the total variation in soil carbon density.
