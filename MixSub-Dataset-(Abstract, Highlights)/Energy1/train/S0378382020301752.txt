 Fuels used in various combustion engines necessitate deep understanding of the fuel components before being used as a feedstock with present engine technology . Fuel components impact the efficiency of the engine along with the formation of pollutant emissions . Aromatics are important component of the fossil based diesel fuel which highly affects the tailpipe emissions . Therefore the study of aromatics has a great significance for diesel engine . A comprehensive study with a total of 13 different aromatics was performed to investigate the impact of their structure and content on diesel engine characteristics . Diesel pure higher chain alkanes and single added aromatics were blended as ternary mixture . Detailed spray investigations were carried out at an injection pressure of 200bar using a three hole nozzle of diesel engine . The aromatic structure and content highly influenced the emission and performance characteristics . A blending ratio of 10 aromatics in base fuel shows promising results compared to 5 and 15 blending content of aromatics in the base fuel . Higher aromatics blending in ternary mixture led to higher particulate matter carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions . Due to higher degree of unsaturation polycyclic single and double ring aromatics produce higher pollutant emissions compared to single ring monocyclic aromatics .
