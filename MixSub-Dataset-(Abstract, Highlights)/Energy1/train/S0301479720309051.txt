 Mammal herbivores and specially deer can cause severe damages to agriculture producing economic losses . Repellents based on odor visual and or taste stimuli have been tested to minimize these damages but their global effectiveness has not been quantified . A systematic literature review on the use of repellents to reduce damage by deer was carried out and an evaluation of the effectiveness of different repellents and application methods was performed . A Beta regression was employed considering the percentage of vegetation unbrowsed at the end of the essay as the response variable . A total of 246 essays testing ten different repellents and 236 essays testing four different application methods were extracted from 58 articles . Odor based repellents such as those including meat and blood and urine hair and feces of predators were found to be the most effective to reduce damage . Non lethal methods such as repellents could be valuable tools to manage this human wildlife conflict .
