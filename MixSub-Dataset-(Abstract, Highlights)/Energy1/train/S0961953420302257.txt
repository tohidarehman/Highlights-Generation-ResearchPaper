 Stages of waste corn cobs processing leading to the production of biohydrogen via dark fermentation are presented and discussed in this paper . Firstly the effects of pre treatment conditions i.e . alkaline alkaline oxidizing and Fenton oxidizing pre treatment of lignocellulosic biomass on the removal of lignin were examined . The solid residue obtained in the first stage was subjected to saccharification by means of enzymatic hydrolysis . The composition of enzymatic hydrolysates and fermentation broths were investigated in order to determine the content of sugars as well as phenolic compounds and fermentation broth composition containing organic acids . The dark fermentation process of the obtained hydrolysates was carried using mixed wastewater sludge from the municipal sewage treatment plant . The highest hydrogen production was obtained for alkaline pre treated hydrolysates . The effects of investigated chemical pre treatment methods were discussed in terms of the obtained saccharification efficiency and composition of the gas phase formed during the fermentation and the composition of fermentation broth .

@highlight Alkaline oxidative pre treatment allowed to achieve the highest lignin removal.
@highlight The presence of hemicellulose derivatives affects the development fermentation by products.
@highlight Hydrogen formation is more efficient for hydrolysates obtained after alkaline hydrolysis.
@highlight Methanogenes may be present in the broth even though eliminating procedures were carried.
