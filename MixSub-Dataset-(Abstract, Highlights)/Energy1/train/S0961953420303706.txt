 This study investigated the production of natural nitrogen doped carbon from expired fresh milk for use in a supercapacitor electrode . The material was prepared by hydrothermal carbonization followed by sequential KOHH

@highlight Carbon from expired fresh milk can be used in a supercapacitor electrode.
@highlight The specific capacitance was higher than carbon derived from other forms of waste.
@highlight Specific capacitance was affected by surface area and surface functional groups.
@highlight Natural doped heteroatoms played a key role in improving capacitance.
@highlight Specific capacitance 186.3F g was higher than that of carbon from other waste.
