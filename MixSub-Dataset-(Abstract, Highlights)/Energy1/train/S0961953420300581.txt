 In this study an innovative approach is proposed for the integral valorization of all sugars contained in a lignocellulosic residue as is brewer s spent grain through the production of an advanced biofuel such as biobutanol . For this purpose the whole slurry obtained in the microwave assisted dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment under optimized conditions 147C 2min and 1.26 H

@highlight Efficient process for the combined valorization of structural carbohydrates.
@highlight High sugar recovery 85 by microwave assisted dilute acid pretreatment.
@highlight ABE fermentation of the whole slurry without previous solid liquid separation.
@highlight Butanol concentration of 11g L after ABE fermentation of the whole slurry.
@highlight Butanol yield of 112L butanol t BSG from pentoses and hexoses fermentation.
