 Aromatic skeleton structure of Naomaohu coal was investigated by a step wise oxidation degradation and XRD Raman and XPS characterization . Coal was first oxidized with H

@highlight A step wise oxidation degradation was used to investigate aromatic ring structure of coal.
@highlight Coal conversion reaches 97.8wt without ring open reaction of aromatic compounds.
@highlight Aromatic ring structures in NMH coal mainly involves 14 rings aromatic compounds.
@highlight 1 2 3 and 4 ring compounds account for 54.4 23.1 20.0 and 2.2 respectively.
