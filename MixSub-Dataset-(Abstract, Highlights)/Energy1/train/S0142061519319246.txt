 Isolated microgrid is a conventional power supply mode for inhabited pelagic islands but limited land resources restrict the capacity of renewable energy units resulting in overreliance on diesel turbines or gas turbines which consumes a large amount of fossil fuels and produces substantial emissions . Establishing effective connections among pelagic islands can optimize the use of land energy resources in uninhabited islands . However a transmission network composed solely of submarine cables is not feasible or economical . This paper proposes an energy transmission route that uses all electric vessels to transport battery energy storage between islands . The battery swapping mode is employed and part of the cable network is replaced by AEV routes to transmit the renewable energy and lower the overall cost . First the transmission modes composed of AEVs and batteries are modeled to analyze energy transmission efficiency and cost effectiveness . Then a hybrid transmission planning model is established using scenario clustering method and the additional costs under extreme weather scenarios are also considered . The model is optimized with the chaotic gravitational search algorithm and the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified through actual cases and sensitivity analysis .
