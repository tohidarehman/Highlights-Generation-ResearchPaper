 Lactic acid bioconversion processes have numerous advantages over the chemical synthesis route not only due to the high titer yield of the final product with great optical purity but also due to the possibility of utilizing lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks as carbon source in an economic and environmentally friendly way . In the present study beechwood and pine were pretreated with a novel mild oxidative organosolv process to produce cellulose rich solid fractions which were tested for their ability to support the growth and high lactic acid productivity of

@highlight subsp.
@highlight efficiently produced
@highlight  lactic acid from biomass.
@highlight Lactic acid was produced utilizing organosolv pretreated beechwood and pine.
@highlight SSF with beechwood resulted in 0.69g lactic acid g of biomass 82.7 yield .
@highlight Pine was less efficient feedstock reaching 0.40g lactic acid g of biomass.
