 The southwest Brazilian Amazon state of Rondnia has a relatively recent non indigenous occupation which subsequently develops a variety of human pressures and conflicts of interest presently identified in the region . Given such framework it is worthwhile to note that there are 57 Conservation Units that must guarantee the biodiversity protection of Amazonia biome . However due to the need for electricity and the international high demand for minerals the highlighted scenario has dramatically changed in recent years . Official data from mining processes in the studied area demonstrated the existence of high interest for minerals especially cassiterite and gold . Mining is indeed an essential activity for the nation mainly due to the generation of jobs and income . On the other hand it produces several environmental and social impacts that vary accordingly to the peculiarities of the mining and with respect to the type of ore . Therefore this research work investigated the concentration of mining projects in the state of Rondnia and complementarily evaluated the impact of such activities on areas of environmental protection . Landsat 8 OLI imageries were employed to map the diversity of land covers across the study area and also to evaluate the corresponding impact of mining activities . More than 500 processes have been identified within the Conservation Units . A significant part of the mining areas covering about 26km

@highlight The proposed Mineral Pressure Index MPI presented satisfactory results.
@highlight Mining processes presented higher intensity on the banks of the river Madeira.
@highlight Jamari FLONA has proved to be the CU most susceptible to environmental pressure.
@highlight More than 500 mining processes were identified within the Conservation Units.
