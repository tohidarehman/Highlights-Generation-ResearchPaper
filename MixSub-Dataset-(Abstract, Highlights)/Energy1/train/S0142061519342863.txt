 This paper deals with the problem of sensorless output feedback control for wind energy conversion systems . The considered system consists of a synchronous aero generator connected to the grid through an AC DC AC converter . Maximum wind energy extraction is achieved by running the wind turbine generator in a variable speed mode without using a wind velocity sensor . This work establishes a different approach to estimate the rotor position speed and turbine torque . Furthermore the proposed technique aims to provide an on line estimation of the grid voltage and pulsation considered generally as accessible . To overcome these issues a high gain observer is designed . It provides estimates of all state variables only from the current and voltage measurements . An integral sliding mode controller is then synthesized based on the estimation provided by the observer with the view of ensuring the MPPT objective . Several simulations show that all control objectives are achieved and the output feedback performances enjoy robustness properties .
