 In this study a new electrocoagulation electrode configuration has been investigated in order to induce dielectrophoretic force for the enhanced harvesting of marine microalgae

@highlight AC AC DEP module was tested for harvesting microalgae.
@highlight Optimum conditions were 10min electrolysis time and 7.1mA cm
@highlight current density.
@highlight At optimum conditions both modules showed similar algal harvesting efficiency.
@highlight However AC DEP module showed 52 reduction in aluminum content in biomass.
