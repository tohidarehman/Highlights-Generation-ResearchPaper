 Large amounts of agricultural residues are produced annually in the UK alone which presents a significant biomass energy resource . It has limited availability in briquetted form in the UK but is widely used particularly in Asia . The aim of this work is to assess the emission from briquetted agricultural residues to wood fuel including commercial wood briquettes when utilised in a 5kW domestic heating stove . Other straw type materials sugarcane bagasse Miscanthus were also investigated . The combustion behaviour depended on the chemical and physical nature of the briquettes . Results indicate that fuel choice is an important consideration for emission reduction . Fuel N directly correlates to emitted NOx and all the fuels studied had NOx emissions below the EU regulation limit . While agricultural residues can be relatively high in Cl and S there is evidence of in situ capture of HCl and SO

@highlight Compares emissions from the combustion of solid biofuels in a domestic wood stove.
@highlight Briquetted woods produce much less particulate matter than from straw briquettes.
@highlight NOx emissions are dependent on the fuel N content and also on the type of biomass.
@highlight Optimised straw briquettes can be lower emitting and less variable than wood logs.
