 Transesterification of biomass derived triglycerides with methanol is a promising method for the industrial production of the biodiesel fuel fatty acid methyl esters . Herein we present a simple heterogeneous catalytic method for the selective transformation of triglycerides into FAMEs . For the methanolysis of trilaurin under reflux of methanol a commercially available high silica H zeolite showed a higher yield of methyl laurate than other zeolite catalysts metal oxides and conventional heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts . Under the optimized conditions the method was widely applicable to the transformation of various triglycerides into the corresponding FAMEs . The catalyst was furthermore reusable . Quantitative relationships between acidity hydrophobicity and reaction rates versus Si Al ratio of H zeolite catalysts show that a low affinity to glycerol which arises from the hydrophobicity of the high silica zeolites is an important factor for controlling the catalytic activity .

@highlight H 75 catalyst was found to be effective for transesterification of triglycerides to fatty methyl esters.
@highlight The developed catalytic system is reusable and applicable to various triglycerides.
@highlight Hydrophobicity and number of Brnsted acid sites influence the catalytic activity.
