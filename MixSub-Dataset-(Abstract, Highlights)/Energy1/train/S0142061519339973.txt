 Load modeling is a crucial part of modeling a power system . Traditional load model identification methods are mainly based on post large disturbance response which can not be conducted without large disturbance events . In this paper a new approach of ambient signals based load model parameter identification is proposed to solve this problem through which the time varying load model parameters can be identified more frequently . First the composite load model structure and the measurement based identification approach are introduced . Then a two stage identification framework to identify the load model parameters from ambient signals is proposed . In the first stage the electromagnetic parameters are identified using an optimization method with the predicted error as the objective function and the differential evolution as the optimization algorithm . In the second stage the mechanical parameters are identified using linear regression . Finally the effectiveness of the proposed identification method is validated through the simulation results in Guangdong Power Grid with practically measured ambient signals data . The proposed two stage identification framework has shown its ability to accurately identify the load model parameters from ambient signals and the advantage over the other identification approaches .
