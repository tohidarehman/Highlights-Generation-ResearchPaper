 Climate change has reduced the snow cover in the Swiss Alps negatively impacting the winter tourist sector . The adaptation of artificial or technical snow as a solution to combat a decline in tourism is pervasive yet controversial . This paper uses Q methodology to analyse the perspectives of stakeholders in relation to artificial snow production with regard to the three pillars of sustainable development . While all stakeholders agreed that there are ecological constraints to socioeconomic development three distinct perspectives were identified . Perspective 1 prioritizes the environment not accepting ecological compromises for socioeconomic development . Perspective 2 is more willing to accept trade offs focusing on economic diversification and long term strategies . Perspective 3 focuses on the economy with a preference for the status quo . The ecological awareness of all stakeholders provides a promising basis for sustainable development . However the diverse views on priority setting present nontrivial obstacles towards devising future strategies for sustainable development .

@highlight Three distinct groups are identified amongst diverse cross sector stakeholders based on their specific social perspectives.
@highlight Q methodology revealed broad value consensus even among divergent stakeholders.
@highlight Consensus finding is hindered by polarized stakeholder views on tourism development.
@highlight Relying solely on snowmaking as a climate change adaptation strategy is unsustainable.
@highlight Nuances in stakeholder attitudes and value systems may undermine climate change adaptation if not fully recognized.
