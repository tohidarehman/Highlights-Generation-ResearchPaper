 Bacterial communities play a critical role in food webs and the biogeochemical cycles of fundamental elements . However there remains a substantial gap in our knowledge of the anthropogenic impacts on bacterial co occurrence patterns and ecosystem functions . In this study we used Illumina high throughput sequencing to characterize and compare the diversity composition co occurrence patterns and functional changes in bacterial communities in the Qingliu River under the influence of different types of domestic sewage . Twelve samples had similar dominant phyla mainly

@highlight NH
@highlight  N TP pH and DO were the key factors affecting the bacterial community.
@highlight Bacterial community compositions differed in different types of domestic sewage.
@highlight The predicted bacterial community functions of four sites were different.
@highlight Non random co occurrence patterns appeared in the river bacterial communities.
