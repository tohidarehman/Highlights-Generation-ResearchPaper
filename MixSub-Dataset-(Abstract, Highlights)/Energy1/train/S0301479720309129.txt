 Plants have different physiological characteristics as the season changes grazing management in compliance with plant growth and development characteristics may provide new ideas for sustainable livestock development . However there has been little research on seasonal grazing and plants physiological responses under it . Here we studied a typical steppe ecosystem of Inner Mongolia with

@highlight Plants adjusted its Morphological and physiological traits in response to grazing Plant regrowth in the next year affected by nutrient accumulation and transfer.
@highlight Different responses of plants under grazing were regulated by various hormones.
@highlight Seasonal grazing alleviated grazing stress and promote regrowth of plants.
@highlight Grazing started in June was the most suitable grazing regime for production.
