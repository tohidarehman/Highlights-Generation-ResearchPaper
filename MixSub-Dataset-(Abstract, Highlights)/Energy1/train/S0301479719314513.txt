 Identification of flood risk dynamics is pivotal for refurbishing the existing and future flood management options . The present study quantifies the marginal and compound contributions of hazard and vulnerability to flood risk through an innovative concept of Risk classifier designed in the form of a 55 choropleth . The proposed framework is demonstrated at the finest administrative scale of village level over Jagatsinghpur district in Mahanadi River basin Odisha for two time frames Scenario I and Scenario II . An increase in high and very high hazard and vulnerable villages is noticed in Scenario I the majority of them lying in the coastal stretches and adjoining flood plains of Mahanadi River . Scenario I is characterized by the majority of hazard driven and compound risk villages while Scenario II is characterized by a majority of vulnerability driven risk villages . For the vulnerability driven risk villages rigorous enforcement of policies and mitigation schemes are recommended while for hazard driven risk villages enhancement of structural measures and flood plain zoning should be exercised . Such exhaustive flood risk information may serve as a valuable cartographic product for the civic authorities and stakeholders and help in prioritizing flood mitigation actions for improved environmental planning and management .
