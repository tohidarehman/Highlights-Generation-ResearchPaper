 This study focused on providing a holistic solution to biodiesel instability challenges using a fuel additive . Three different samples of the multi functional fuel additive were synthesized from abundant lignocellulose based feedstock . Findings from their property evaluation reveal that 29.678.08 44.672.31 and 53.338.08 2 2 Diphenyl 1 picrylhydrazyl radical inhibition with the MFA 1 MFA 2 and MFA 3 respectively which shows an obvious antioxidation property . Also findings obtained from the analysis of the additives using differential scanning calorimeter reveal a reduction in crystallization temperature of biodiesel by 3.96 8.79 and 14.25C with the MFA 1 MFA 2 and MFA 3 respectively which signifies a robust anti freezing property . Furthermore the additives exhibited antibacterial and antifungal properties against some bacterial and fungal strains that were reported to have negative effects on biodiesel

@highlight Synthesis of a multi functional biodiesel additive from bio based feedstock is reported for the first time.
@highlight The synthesized additives are totally miscible in biodiesel and exhibited antioxidative anti freezing and antimicrobial properties.
@highlight 5 vol vol. dosage of the additive impacted significant increase in oxidation induction temperature of biodiesel by 82C.
@highlight 20 vol vol. dosage of the additive impacted significant reduction of 8.79C in the high melting temperature.
