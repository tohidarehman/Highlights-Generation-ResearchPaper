 Spent coffee grounds an agro industrial residue produced after brewing of coffee beans contains appreciable amounts of lipids . One way of valorizing SCG is to subject it to dilute acid hydrolysis for the production of sugar rich hydrolysate and lipid dense post hydrolysis residue . The post hydrolysis spent coffee grounds contains substantial amounts of lipids making it necessary to gather lipid extraction kinetics and equilibrium data for process and equipment design . The effects of solvent to solid ratio 420mLg

@highlight Post hydrolysis spent coffee grounds PHSCG contain more lipids than native SCG.
@highlight Lipids recovered from PHSCG are suitable as feedstock for biodiesel production.
@highlight At least 80 of the available lipids could be extracted in less than 10min.
@highlight Up to 40 less solvent is required to recover lipids from Post hydrolysis SCG.
