 This manuscript proposes to study different cases that require the use of renewable energies in addition to diesel generators and energy storage systems with the aim of increasing the resilience of a microgrid feeding critical facilities . The aim of the work here presented is to quantify the benefits provided by an improvement of the energy resilience that could be achieved by installing a microgrid in a hospital fed by renewable energy sources . The microgrid will use a scheme based on solar PV in addition to diesel generators and an energy storage system based on electrochemical batteries . First it has been evaluated how the implant of the microgrid increases the resilience of the power supply when a power failure occurs considering that the main application in a hospital even in the event of breakdowns is to ensure the continuity of the surgical procedures and safely store drug stocks . Thus these have been defined as the critical loads of the system . The components sizes have been optimized by considering both economic profitability but also the resilience capacity observing that by installing solar photovoltaic modules Li ion batteries and diesel generators according to simulations performed in

@highlight An optimal microgrid considering power resilience for a hospital was designed.
@highlight Economical profit and minimum resilience were considered for components sizing.
@highlight Up to 12 scenarios have been analyzed in
@highlight observing a significant impact.
@highlight Positive net savings and more than 1day of minimum survival time can be achieved.
