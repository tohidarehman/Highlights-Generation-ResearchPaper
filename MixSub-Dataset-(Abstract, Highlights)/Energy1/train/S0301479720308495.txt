 The application of organic amendments to improve the chemical and biological properties of degraded soils from calcareous quarries is necessary to accelerate restoration processes . The aim of this study is to assess the success of different restoration treatments in the long term using two organic amendments and compost from domestic solid waste . The chemical properties and bacterial communities of restored soils were compared with unamended soils and surrounding natural soils from a limestone quarry in a semi arid ecosystem . After 10 years of the addition of organic amendments the abundance of soil bacteria diversity and taxonomic composition at the phylum and genus level in each soil type was analysed by rRNA 16S amplification sequencing using Illumina and comparison with the SILVA database using QIIME2 software . The relationships between soil bacterial taxa and chemical soil properties total organic carbon and total nitrogen content were also studied as well as the interrelations between soil bacterial taxa at the genus level or the next upper taxonomic level identified . The organic amendments changed the chemical properties of the restored soils influencing the microbial communities of the restored soils . CW treatment was the organic amendment that most resembled NS favouring in the long term a greater diversity and proliferation of bacteria . Several bacterial communities more abundant in NA and CW soils were strongly correlated with each other

@highlight Organic amendment modifies soil bacterial communities composition in the long term.
@highlight Compost treatment generates higher diversity and abundance of bacteria communities.
@highlight Soil properties in compost treated soils were the most similar to the natural soils.
@highlight Soil chemical properties significantly influenced soil bacterial consortia.
