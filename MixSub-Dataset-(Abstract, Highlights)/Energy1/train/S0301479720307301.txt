 The high content of sodium in coal ash can induce severe ash deposit problems on heated surface . Vermiculite has been investigated to solve this problem in drop tube furnace recently . In this work the effects of vermiculite and perlite on appearances inorganic mineral transformation elemental composition change and Na capture efficiency of ash deposit were investigated . The results show that the molten deposit obtained by drop tube furnace at 1373K was transformed into weakly condensed deposit and strongly sticky deposit respectively when vermiculite and perlite were added separately . Vermiculite has a better effect on improving the ash deposition than perlite . The mechanism of alleviating the ash deposition by vermiculite and perlite is proposed as follows The interaction between ash particles is inhibited due to the combination reactions of thermal expansion additive particles with coal ash particles . The coal ash particles attach to the surface and the gap of thermal expansion additive particles forming a porous structure . With vermiculite added Mg

@highlight Thermal expansion additive are proposed to solve the ash deposition problem of high sodium coal.
@highlight Physical and chemical interactions between additives and coal ash on the deposition probe are investigated.
@highlight Vermiculite has a strong capacity for Na capture at 1023K and perlite has a strong capacity for Na capture at 1373K.
@highlight It is recommended that the addition ratio of vermiculite is 46 for high sodium coal.
