 The indiscriminate use of fossil fuels has led to several challenges such as greenhouse gas emissions environmental degradation and energy security . Establishment of clean fuels is at the forefront of science and innovation in today s society to curb these problems . Dark fermentation is widely regarded as the most promising clean energy technology of the 21st century due to its desirable properties such as high energy content its non polluting features its ability to use a broad spectrum of feedstocks and inoculum sources as well as its ability to use mild fermentation conditions . In developing nations this technology could be instrumental in establishing effective waste disposal systems while boosting the production of clean fuels . However DF is still hindered by the low yields which stagnate its commercialization . This paper reviews the recent and emerging technologies that are gaining prominence in DF based on information that has been gathered from recent scientific publications . Herein novel enhancement methods such as cell immobilization nanotechnology mathematical optimization tools and technologies for biogas upgrading using renewable H
