 In this paper the stability region of power systems is studied from a geometrical point of view . A new method is proposed to obtain the global orbits which have the significance for making the stability region be more complete . This method is based on the theory of invariant manifolds and focuses on dynamical behavior at infinity . The boundary of the stability region with respect to the stable manifolds of dimension 1 and dimension 2 are given to describe the topological characteristics of the stability region of a multi machine system . The effect of damping coefficient on the stability region is discussed through the variation of the singularities at infinity . The GOs of the power system when subjected to large disturbance are analyzed with the time domain simulation . The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a 16 machine 68 bus system . The simulation results reveal the types and characteristics of the GOs which play an important role in the prediction of stability instability of the postfault system .

@highlight The stability region is studied from a geometrical point of view. Global orbits GOs in 3 dimensional space are proposed to make the stability region be more complete.
@highlight The GOs and the boundary of the stability region BSR with respect to the stable manifolds of dimension 1 and dimension 2 are given.
@highlight By using the new projection transformation the system state and phase portraits at infinity are projected into a closed space which helps to form the closed BSR of power systems.
@highlight The effect of damping coefficient on the stability region is discussed through the variation of the singularities at infinity.
