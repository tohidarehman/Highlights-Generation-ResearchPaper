 Sludge recovery disposal represents one of the most crucial aspects related to the management of wastewater treatment plants . The most widely diffused technology for the treatment of industrial and municipal wastewaters is the conventional activated sludge process which is characterized by a relatively high excess sludge production . Different technical solutions are proposed in the literature for sludge minimization and they can be applied either on wastewater line or sludge line . This work is focused on different approaches based on the use of Thermophilic Aerobic Membrane Reactor this can be added to a CAS plant and integrated to WL or SL yielding a significant sludge reduction . The process performance was analysed in terms of volatile solids reduction and specific sludge production . The TAMR was tested both at full scale and pilot scale with different feeding substrates industrial wastewater for the full scale plant industrial wastewater sludge and a mix of these for the pilot scale plants . The results obtained are good solids removal low specific sludge production 0.010.09 kg

@highlight Different substrates were fed to Thermophilic Aerobic Membrane Reactor.
@highlight Upgrading of conventional activated sludge system were studied.
@highlight Up to 90 of volatile solids reduction was obtained.
@highlight Sludge production is one order of magnitude lower than other biological processes.
