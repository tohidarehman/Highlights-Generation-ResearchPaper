 China s paper industry development is rapid but the recycling rate of China s waste paper has been low all the time . Meanwhile material flow analysis can help determine the flow of waste paper and life cycle assessment is the methodological framework for quantifying greenhouse gas emissions . Therefore present study integrates these two methods into the model construction of China s waste paper recycling decision system . Present study constructs a benchmark model of China s waste paper recycling decision system in 2017 focusing on the impact of nonstandard waste paper recycling on the economic and environmental benefits of China s domestic waste paper recycling system . This model construction is followed by sensitivity analysis of the relevant parameters affecting the efficiency of the waste paper recycling system . Finally present study forecasts the system s economic benefits and greenhouse gas emissions in the context of integrating and regulating nonstandard recycling vendors . The results show that the economic benefit of China s waste paper recycling in 2017 is approximately 458.3 yuan t and that the GHG emissions are 901.1 kgCO

@highlight Present study constructs the life cycle framework of Chinese paper and paperboard by the combination of MFA and LCA.
@highlight Quantitative analysis of the economic benefits and GHG emissions generated by China s waste paper recycling system.
@highlight Sensitivity analysis on the main parameters of the economic and environmental benefits of the waste paper recycling system.
@highlight Benefits of Chinas waste paper recycling from 2018 to 2030 are evaluated by integrating nostandard and standard recycling.
