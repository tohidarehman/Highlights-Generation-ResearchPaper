 Soil salinity can limit the use of marginal lands for biomass production based on cultivation of short rotation woody crops as energy willow . Here we compare salt stress responses of the diploid productive cultivar and its artificially produced autotetraploid variants . After pre testing the effects of various salt concentrations willow plants with different genome sizes were exposed to 1.5g NaCl kg

@highlight Salt tolerance in energy willow cultivars can contribute to the extended production of green energy by using marginal lands.
@highlight Autotetraploid energy willow genotypes show a moderate reduction in green biomass parameters under salt stress.
@highlight Doubling the genome size ensured development of a highly adaptive root system to saline soil.
@highlight Salt tolerance of autotetraploid lines was expressed by maintenance of photosynthesis shown by CO
@highlight assimilation rates.
@highlight The described autotetraploid
@highlight genotypes can serve as breeding stocks for selection of adaptive variants.
