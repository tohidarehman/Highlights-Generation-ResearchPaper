 This study presents an effective and sustainable approach for biodiesel production through oleaginous yeast fermentation by utilizing volatile fatty acids rich acidogenic effluents as an alternative feedstock . Experiments were designed in two stages to obtain high cell density and lipid productivity . Primarily oleaginous yeast

@highlight Integration of acidogenic fermentation with with fermentation for biodiesel production.
@highlight Maximum carbon utilization and energy recovery in an integrated approach.
@highlight Lipid profiling revealed predominance of palmitic stearic oleic and linoleic acid.
@highlight Microbial lipids produced has biodiesel properties with high energy efficiency.
@highlight Utilization of acidogenic effluent as an alternative feedstock for microbial lipid production.
