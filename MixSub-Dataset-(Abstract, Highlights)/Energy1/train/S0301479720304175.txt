 Investigation of the cost effectiveness of low impact development practices at the hectare scale in response to impacts of possible climate change was conducted using representative concentration pathways . An LID project in Guangzhou has been selected to illustrate changes in the hydrologic performance for alternative source control strategies for a variety of future climate models and scenarios . Frequent storms of shorter duration in RCP 8.5 cause more dramatic fluctuation of hydrologic performance . Hydrologic performance of LID practices on reducing runoff volume and peak flow in test catchment are different in climate scenarios . Based on the constraints of life cycle costs and environmental impacts of LID alternatives comprehensive strategies were found effective in managing surface runoff at the source to adapt to the influence of climate change . The methodology described herein could be useful in considering LID practices for critical source management with limited budgets and considering environmental impacts under long term climate change .
