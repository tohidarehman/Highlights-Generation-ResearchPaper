 Pycocyanin pigment of spirulina was used as photosentizer for the fabrication of Bio sensitized solar cells . The pigment was extracted in different solvents such as water Ethanol and Acetone and pure and Ag doped TiO

@highlight The successful fabrication of novel BSSC using Pycocyanine pigments extracted from spirulina as photosentizer along with pure and Ag doped TiO2 nanoparticles.
@highlight The main observation from this research work is reduction of energy band gap values due to doped Ag ion which allowed slow recombination rate and that enhanced the photovoltaic conversion efficiency.
@highlight The Photovoltaic properties and EIS measurement revealed that Phycocyanine acted as good sensitizer.
