 Organosolv pretreatment reactions with glycerol applied to water hyacinth were performed with evaluation of the effects of the following variables time temperature solid liquid ratio water percentage and cobalt ferrite CoFe

@highlight Optimization of the most important variables by experimental design 2
@highlight First work on the pre treatment of water hyacinth with iron based catalysts.
@highlight First study that evaluated organosolv pretreatment with glycerol CoFe
@highlight  FeCl
@highlight and FeSO
@highlight The organosolv pretreatment with glycerol FeCl
@highlight showed promise.
@highlight Better understanding of the action of metallic salts in pretreatment reactions.
