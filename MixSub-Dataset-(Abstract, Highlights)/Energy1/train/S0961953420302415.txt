 Residues of the palm oil agro industry were pyrolysed to produce biofuels . Effects of several parameters on the slow pyrolysis process were evaluated using the central compound rotational design for modelling and optimization the process conditions aiming the maximum yield of bio oil . After pyrolisis and using various approaches the products were characterized with emphasis on bio oil . The response surface methodology and desirability function indicate that the temperature was the most influential parameter in regard to the liquid yield in which the optimum pyrolysis conditions were temperature of 628.2C and N

@highlight Optimal process conditions to bio oil production 628.2C and 0.259L min of N
@highlight Temperature is the most important parameter for obtaining the maximum liquid yield.
@highlight Main compounds hexadecanoic acid methyl ester nonane hexadecanoic acid and phenol.
@highlight Bio oil has a high antioxidant capacity by presence of the phenolic compounds.
