 Fault identification for the neutral un effectively grounded distribution systems has long been an unsolved problem since conventional zero sequence protective relays can not trip the single line to ground fault . Moreover few branch feeders are equipped with zero sequence current monitors whereas existing fault identification methods that not relying on the zero sequence current measurement are facing problems regarding speed and sensitivity . To solve this problem the distribution characteristics of the high frequency energy of the faulted phase within the entire NUGS is firstly analyzed . Then the principal component energy is employed to represent the high frequency energy related to the occurrence of the single line to ground fault . Finally an online tracking approach is proposed to find the origin of the PCE . To assess the performance of the proposed method massive fault scenarios are studied on a closed loop RTDS test platform . Test results indicate that the proposed method is capable of online application independent of zero sequence current measurement and data synchronization . Also the sensitivity is high enough to cover a thousand Ohms fault resistance .
