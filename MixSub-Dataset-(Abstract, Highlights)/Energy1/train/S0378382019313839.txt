 Biomass are a key contributor to many countries strategies for decarbonising heat particularly in domestic applications . The emissions from these small devices can be high and severely impact air quality but their levels depend on the design control abatement and fuel options . This paper is concerned with the last case . A comparative study shows the emissions from a domestic wood stove for three biomass fuels and their torrefied counterparts . The fuels were burned in a multi fuel stove along with two reload batches creating continuous combustion cycles the initial cold start data is presented but not included in averaging and calculation of emission factors . Measurements were made using an FTIR instrument for carbon and nitrogen based gaseous emissions particulates were measured using a smoke meter with micro quartz filters as well as a size selective impactor to obtain the particle size distribution . Particulate emissions were significantly reduced from the torrefied fuels and this is thought to be related to their pyrolysis fingerprint which was investigated by pyrolysis GCMS . NOx was slightly reduced despite increased fuel N after torrefaction . In addition the reduced moisture in the torrefied fuels decreases emissions of CO and CH

@highlight Compares emissions from combustion of raw and torrefied fuels in a domestic multi fuel stove
@highlight Torrefied fuels emit significantly less particulate matter and slightly less NOx GJ energy.
@highlight CO and CH
@highlight emissions are reduced for the torrefied fuels.
@highlight Changes in pyrolysis products by PY GCMS can explain changes in particulate emission.
