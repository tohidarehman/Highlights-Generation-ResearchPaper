 Recovery of molybdenum has been studied from coke formed as a by product of catalytic steam cracking of heavy oil containing a Mo based nanodispersed unsupported catalyst and from mixtures of industrial coke with Mo based compounds as model systems via combustion in the fluidized bed of deep oxidation catalyst and the fixed bed of coke . Quantitative carbon removal was found to be impossible even for several cycles of combustion in fluidized catalyst bed most probably due to a drop of size of the coke particles to those of too small in order to have a sufficient contact time for the complete burning off . Non catalytic combustion in the fixed bed mode showed best efficacy resulting in complete carbon removal without any Mo losses in the range of 450750C .

@highlight Dispersed coked Mo based catalyst regeneration in two modes was considered.
@highlight 54 C removal from coke was achieved in fluidized bed of deep oxidation catalyst.
@highlight 100 C removal from coke and MoS
@highlight or MoO
@highlight mixtures was achieved in tubular reactor.
@highlight Spent dispersed catalyst roasting in the form of fixed bed proceeds without Mo loss.
@highlight Complete C removal is possible at temperatures higher than 350C.
