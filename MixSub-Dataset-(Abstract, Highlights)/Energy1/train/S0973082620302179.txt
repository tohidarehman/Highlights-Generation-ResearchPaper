 The present study investigates the combustion process of the producer gas from a gasifier cookstove for four solid biomass fuels wood pellets wheat straw sheep manure and cow manure . It was found that more primary air and or a deeper fuel bed reduces tars in the producer gas and increases the combustion efficiency especially from low ash containing WP . At higher air supply rates indications of a strong influence from the fuel ash content on the emissions were found . Although more combustible gases and fewer tars are produced in the conversion process a substantial increase in particulate matter emissions is noted . At low air supply rates the emissions of particulates with an aerodynamic diameter 2.5m PM

@highlight Investigation of the producer gas combustion from a gasifier cookstove
@highlight Four tested fuels wood pellets wheat straw cow manure and sheep manure
@highlight Higher primary air supply and a deeper fuel bed increases the combustion efficiency.
@highlight At lower air supply rates relatively lower emissions of both PM and CO are achieved.
@highlight Emissions appear to be influenced by the release or retention of ash constituents.
