 In recent decades the generation of bioenergy from wastes as a cost effective and environmentally friendly source has attracted the attention of researchers . Among waste materials sewage sludge contains a high amount of organic matter that can be stabilized and converted directly into electricity via microbial fuel cells . Here in this study the effects of different concentrations of mixed liquor suspended solid and initial chemical oxygen demand concentration of the municipal sewage sludge on the electricity generation in an air cathode microbial fuel cells have been investigated . The results confirmed significant effects of MLSS and COD on the sludge stabilization and power generation . The secondary excess sludge when MLSS was 10000 mgL
