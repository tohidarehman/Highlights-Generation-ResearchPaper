 Dyes are toxic and inherently resistant to microbial degradation . In this study decolorization and degradation of textile dye reactive yellow 145 were evaluated using pure bacterial strains

@highlight Complete decolorization could be achieved in nutrient broth under static condition.
@highlight Lower decolorization of dye was observed under shaking condition in nutrient broth.
@highlight Static followed by shaking condition resulted in greater mineralization of the dye.
@highlight Acclimatized cultures showed dye decolorization in mineral media MM .
@highlight Maximum decolorization was observed in MM supplemented with peptone at pH 7.
