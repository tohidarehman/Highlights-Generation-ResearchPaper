 Electric power is increasingly being used in the globalized day to day and keeping the electric power system running is necessary . Insulators are important components of the electric power system . In case of failure in these components there may be disconnections and consequently no electricity . Contaminated insulators can develop irreversible failures if they are not inspected . One equipment used for the inspection of the electric power system is the ultrasound which generates an audible noise based on a time series that is used to identify possible failures . The time series forecast can be used for possible prediction of the development of failure . In this paper a hybrid method that uses Wavelet Energy Coefficient for feature extraction and Group Method of Data Handling for time series prediction is proposed being defined as Wavelet GMDH . For comparison and validation of the proposed method a benchmark is made with well established algorithms such as Long Short Term Memory and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System . For a fairer analysis these algorithms are also evaluated based on the same data extraction with WEC . The proposed method proved to have good accuracy comparing with LSTM and ANFIS and is much faster than the compared methods .
