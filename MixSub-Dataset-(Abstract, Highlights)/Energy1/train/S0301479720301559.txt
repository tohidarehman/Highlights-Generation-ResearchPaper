 Faecal pollution modelling is a valuable tool to evaluate and improve water management strategies especially in a context of water scarcity . The reduction dynamics of five faecal indicator organisms

@highlight Decay rates of faecal indicator organisms in a Mediterranean stream affected by a wastewater treatment plant are reported.
@highlight Air temperature and streamflow are the main drivers of indicator behaviour.
@highlight Decay rates of microbial indicators have been modelled seasonally.
@highlight The impact of a WWTP has been modelled in terms of stream self depuration.
@highlight The self depuration distance metric could be a useful tool in water management strategies.
