 In this study novel carbon oxide composite supported Ni Co and Fe catalysts were prepared by the sol gel method using polyethylene glycol as a carbon source and catalytic properties of the test catalysts were estimated for the steam reforming reactions of ethanol . The reactions were carried out in a fixed bed reactor under the following conditions H

@highlight Novel carbon oxide composite supported Co catalysts were prepared by the sol gel method using PEG.
@highlight Among Co catalysts calcined at 500C 32Co47C21A was the most active.
@highlight 16Co63C21A700N
@highlight showed the highest activity 100 and hydrogen yield 80 at 600C.
@highlight XRD of 16Co63C21A700N
@highlight exhibited only active metallic Co before the reaction.
@highlight The addition of 0.5 Ag to 16Co63C21A increased hydrogen yield and ethanol conversion.
