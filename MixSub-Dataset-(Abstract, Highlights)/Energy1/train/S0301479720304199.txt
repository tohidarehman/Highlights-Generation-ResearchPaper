 Across the world the flood magnitude is expected to increase as well as the damage caused by their occurrence . In this case the prediction of areas which are highly susceptible to these phenomena becomes very important for the authorities . The present study is focused on the evaluation of flood potential within Trotu river basin in Romania using six ensemble models created by the combination of Analytical Hierarchy Process Certainty Factor and Weights of Evidence on one hand and Gradient Boosting Trees and Multilayer Perceptron on the other hand . A number of 12 flood predictors 172 flood locations and 172 non flood locations were used . A percentage of 70 of flood and non flood locations were used as input in models . From the input data 70 were used as training sample and 30 as validating sample . The highest accuracy was obtained by the MLP CF model in terms of both training and testing samples . A percentage between 21.88 and 36.33 of study area is covered with high and very high flood potential . The results validation performed through the ROC Curve method highlights that the MLP CF model provided the most accurate results .

@highlight This study presents six novel ensembles used to identify the areas susceptible to floods.
@highlight Historical flood locations were considered into the methodological workflow.
@highlight The model performances were assessed through several statistical metrics.
@highlight Generally more than 19 of the study area has a high and very high flood susceptibility.
