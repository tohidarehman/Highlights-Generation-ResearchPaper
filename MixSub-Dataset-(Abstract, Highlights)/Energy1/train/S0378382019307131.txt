 During transportation and storage of wood pellets various gases are formed leading to toxic atmosphere . Various influencing factors and measures reducing off gassing have already been investigated . The present study aims at applying an antioxidant acetylsalicylic acid to reduce off gassing from wood pellets by lowering wood extractives oxidation . Therefore acetylsalicylic acid was applied in industrial and laboratory pelletizing processes . Pine and spruce sawdust were pelletized with adding 0 0.8 ASA . Glass flasks measurements confirmed off gassing reduction by adding ASA for all wood pellets investigated.The biggest effect was achieved by adding 0.8 ASA in the industrial pelletizing experiments where the emission of volatile organic compounds VOC
