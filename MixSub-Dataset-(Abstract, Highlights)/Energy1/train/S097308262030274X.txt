 Solar technologies promise to provide clean energy to the poorest populations . Motivated by observations of low quality products in the solar home system market this study analyzes the role of product quality in the transition to cleaner energy technologies in developing countries . Our systematic empirical analysis of the Ugandan solar home system market reveals several market segments .

@highlight This paper explores the role of product quality in the energy transition.
@highlight It presents a systematic empirical analysis of the Ugandan solar home system SHS market.
