 Due to depletion of water resources and increased water demand greywater reuse is gaining popularity as a means of water conservation all over the world . Availability of reliable data on greywater generation and quality characteristics is important in deciding the treatment system and the reuse option . This paper summarises quantity and quality characteristics of greywater reported from different parts of the world . Greywater generation from different countries is compared and its variability is discussed . Important pollutants of concern in greywater such as organic content nutrients microorganisms metals and organic micropollutants from different greywater sources such as bathrooms hand basins kitchen and laundry are described . The review shows large variations in greywater quality and quantity with respect to time and source and the selection of a treatment system would largely depend on this variability . The review also shows that at the levels found in greywater heavy metals and organic micropollutants in recycled greywater generally do not pose a threat to human health if treated properly .

@highlight Greywater quantity and quality characteristics from across the world were compared.
@highlight Significant variation in quantity and quality characteristics with time and from source to source observed.
@highlight Nutrient content in some greywater streams is limited and nutrient addition may be required for biological treatment.
@highlight Heavy metals may not be a cause for concern if treated greywater is used for toilet flushing.
