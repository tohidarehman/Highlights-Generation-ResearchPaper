 The implementation of woody short rotation coppice in Portugal has a high potential due to abundant solar radiation and to an availability of about 2.8Mha of uncultivated derelict marginal areas . In this work a GIS based proposal is made to evaluate such potential considering spatial data for soil use soil type site micrometeorology and slope . The proposed species are poplar and eucalypt clones chosen due to the large implementation of poplar in Europe and to the high biomass productive potential of eucalypt . The latter species was installed for decades in the country under an intensive coppice management aiming at pulp production . Four main uses for produced biomass are proposed following a mass and energy balances approach namely co firing of 10 biomass in two coal units combined heat and power cogeneration units with nominal power of 5MW with organic Rankine cycle technology and smaller pellet units running during 2880 hy

@highlight Woody SRC cultivations are an option for clustered bioenergy production.
@highlight GIS analysis is very useful for planning of bioenergy production and allocation.
@highlight CHP ORC is a pivotal technology for renewable heat and electricity production.
@highlight Sustainable co firing and co generation are possible with SRC cultivations biomass.
@highlight Decentralized energy supply boost local economies in rural areas.
