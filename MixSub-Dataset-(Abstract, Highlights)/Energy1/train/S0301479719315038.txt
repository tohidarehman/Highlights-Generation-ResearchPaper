 It is important to understand the migration of Cesium in soils particularly after the nuclear power plant accident at Fukushima Dai ichi Japan . Dissolved organic matter is one of factors affecting the migration of Cs in soils under flowing water conditions . We investigated the effect of DOM on the migration of Cs adsorbed to the clay planar site via laboratory column experiments . The sequence of DOM application had a significant influence on Cs transport in the soil . When DOM was applied concurrently with or prior to Cs application the DOM adsorbed on to the clay planar site adsorbed onto the soil solid surface and enhanced Cs adsorption consequently it slowed Cs migration in the soil . In particular in the case of DOM loaded prior to the application of Cs solution a noticeable delay in Cs migration was observed . On the other hand when DOM was applied to the soil where the Cs solution had been previously applied the DOM desorbed Cs from the soil . DOM in liquid phase enhanced the migration of Cs through the formation of binding to organic matter . Majority of Cs affected by DOM was the exchangeable fraction that adsorbed to the clay planar site . In other words DOM attached to the soil would adsorb Cs as a easily exchangeable form and depress migration of Cs . On the other hand DOM in the soil solution may up take adsorbed Cs from the soil and enhanced the transport in the form of Cs bound to DOM .

@highlight We investigated the effect of DOM on the migration of Cs adsorbed to the clay planar site in soil via column experiments.
@highlight DOM attached to soil enhanced Cs adsorption and depressed its migration.
@highlight DOM in soil solution desorbed Cs adsorbed to soil and enhanced its transport through the formation of Cs DOM form.
