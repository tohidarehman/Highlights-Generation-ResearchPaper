 The development of nonpetroleum routes for producing high octane clean gasoline rich in isoparaffins is still an important challenge today . Here nanosized ZSM 5 and zinc isomorphously substituted ZSM 5 NZ5 zeolites with different Si Me ratios in initial gels were prepared in situ by a seed induced method and were used as high efficiency catalysts in the reaction of dimethyl ether to gasoline . It was found that the formation of isoparaffins and aromatics are competitive processes . The long chain olefin intermediates can be converted to aromatics by cyclization and hydrogen transfer on the Brnsted acid site whereas they undergo the hydroisomerization to form isoparaffins on the hydrogenation species . Excellent catalytic activity and high isoparaffin selectivity were obtained for the NZ5 samples due to the reduced BAS and the unique ZnOH
