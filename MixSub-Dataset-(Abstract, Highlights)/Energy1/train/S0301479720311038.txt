 Papermaking waste liquid is a serious source of water pollution worldwide . The subsequent treatment of it is very difficult cause it contains a large amount of lignin inorganic salts organic matter and pigments which lead to serious water pollution . Lignin is the main by product of the paper industry and is the only natural aromatic recyclable resource . Its effective utilization rate is currently less than 3 . Therefore how to effectively recycle lignin in papermaking waste liquid and further synthesize industrialized products is of great significance to the sustainable development and environmental protection . Besides based on the shortage of petroleum resources in recent years the application of biomass resources instead of petroleum resources in the industry is also an important issue . In this article we explored the best optimal conditions for the oxypropylation and esterification of lignin and prepared bio bitumen based on modified lignin and then applied it to the waterproof coating sheets . FTIR and mechanical properties were tested on the obtained waterproof coating sheets . The results show that the addition of modified lignin reduced the softening point and peel strength of the coating sheets . Interestingly both oxypropylated lignin and esterified lignin were very beneficial to resist the decrease in peel strength during the aging process showing a significant improvement in the performance of the coating sheets after aging compared to the control .

@highlight The optimal reaction condition for oxypropylation and esterification of lignin was investigated.
@highlight The first exploration of the application of modified lignin in Bio bitumen and coating sheets.
@highlight The utilize of large amounts of lignin in papermaking wastewater is of great significance for recyclable resources.
@highlight The modified lignin shows a significant effect on resisting the decrease of the peel strength of coating sheets during aging process.
