 Transdisciplinary research seeks to address real world problems and aims to be socially transformative . This normative objective extends beyond particular TDR projects as real world problems are embedded in concrete contexts but at the same time are also related to wider societal challenges that are not restricted to one context . Therefore TDR generally entails transfer of knowledge and results to other contexts . However the TDR discourse has mainly treated transfer efforts from the perspective of scientific generalization translation and packaging of knowledge . Within this understanding of transfer little attention has been paid to interplay between contexts and the role of new contexts themselves .

@highlight Transfer to other contexts is usually an objective of transdisciplinary research to provide sustainability transformations.
@highlight Transfer is a complex process in which different types of knowledge are mediated to other contexts in various ways.
@highlight Actors in pick up contexts also bear responsibility for successful transfer and appropriation.
@highlight Transfer to other contexts can be steered only to a limited extent but it can be approached systematically.
@highlight Generating transfer potential for knowledge and result depends on being aware of potential pick up contexts.
