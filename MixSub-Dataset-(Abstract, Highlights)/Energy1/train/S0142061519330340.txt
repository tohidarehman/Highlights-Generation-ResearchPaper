 This paper presents a methodology that enables a combined wind battery power plant to participate in the energy and ancillary services market . Due to uncertainties of both the wind power output and the system regulation demand the day ahead optimization strategy and real time operational management of the power plant must be studied . Firstly in day ahead optimization this paper presents two data processing methods to analyze the probabilistic distribution of the two uncertainty factors from the perspective of defining a robust optimal strategy in both markets . Then in real time operation a model predictive control based strategy is proposed to increase the performance of the wind power plant by managing the battery storage . The methodology is evaluated using historical prices of energy and ancillary service reserves . In addition to confirming the effectiveness of the proposed methodology the result shows that deploying the battery can provide extra flexibility to a wind farm for providing symmetric reserve services . Moreover the data driven approach using historical wind generation data and regulation signals can improve the performance of the plant .

@highlight A robust optimization strategy for energy regulation reserve offer is proposed.
@highlight Data analysis methods are used to improve the robustness considering the batterys energy constraint.
@highlight An MPC based real time operation strategy considering the BESS s energy constraints is developed.
