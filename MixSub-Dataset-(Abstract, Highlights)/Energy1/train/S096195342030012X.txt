 The production and chemical composition of the biomass of four fast growing woody crops are studied across species and rotation cycles . High density plantations of poplar willow black locust and sycamore were monitored for 9 years over 3 year rotation cycles in marginal land in the Mediterranean area . The fuel quality properties of the produced biomass was assessed using proximate and ultimate analysis biomass and ash chemical composition and ash melting behaviour .

@highlight Willow revealed the highest production followed by poplar and black locust.
@highlight Sycamore provided very poor yields.
@highlight Biomass production sharply decreased during the third rotation cycle.
@highlight The chemical composition of the biomass varied across species and rotation cycles.
@highlight Woody species from SRC can be considered quality solid biofuels.
