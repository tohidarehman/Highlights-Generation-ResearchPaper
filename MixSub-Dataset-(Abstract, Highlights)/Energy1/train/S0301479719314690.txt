 Using 2025 as the target year we quantitatively assessed the reduction potentials of emissions of primary pollutants including CO HC NO

@highlight Emission reduction potentials under different vehicle control measures are estimated.
@highlight WRF Chem model is used to simulate the emission control scenarios on PM
@highlight and O
@highlight Upgrading new vehicle emission standards and fuel quality in the BTH region are the most effective.
@highlight Season and location specific vehicle control policies are needed.
