 Recent studies show the feasibility of choosing sewage sludge as feedstock to produce biodiesel . However low yield of biodiesel as using wet sludge directly high cost of the pretreatment of sludge drying and poor cognition about residues utilization lead to the urgent need of new processes . In this study hydrothermal process was introduced for biodiesel production by

@highlight 8.63 of biodiesel yield was obtained
@highlight a HP using wet sludge as feedstock.
@highlight HP can break the distinction of biodiesel yield derived from wet or dried sludge.
@highlight Sludge residues were applied further for pollutant removal and yeast cultivation.
