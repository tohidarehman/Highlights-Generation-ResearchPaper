 Identifying the spatio temporal variations of evapotranspiration from its components can greatly improve our understanding of water cycle and biogeochemical processes . However partitioning evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration at regional scale with high accuracy still remains a challenge . This study has aimed to reveal the spatio temporal variations of evapotranspiration and its components by using an improved Shuttleworth Wallace model to partition ET in the Yellow River Basin during 19812010 . The environmental factors affecting the spatial and temporal variations of evapotranspiration and its components were also assessed . Results showed that the mean annual ET T and E in the Yellow River Basin were 372.18mm 179.64mm and 192.54mm respectively over the last 30 years . The spatial pattern of mean annual ET and T displayed a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest in the Yellow River Basin and the temporal variation showed a significant increasing trend with rates of 1.72mm yr

@highlight ET can be partitioned by the SWH model in regional scale.
@highlight T accounted for the increases of ET in the YRB over the last 30 years.
@highlight NDVI and temperature dominated the variations of ET and T.
