 Stove and fuel stacking is becoming accepted as part of the clean cooking transition process even though it attenuates positive health and climate benefits that can be realized by cookstove interventions . This study analyses the underlying drivers of stove and fuel stacking from the household perspectives and its implications for improving impact of clean cooking programs .

@highlight We use a qualitative study design to generate explanations why stove and fuel stacking is pervasive in three Kenyan settings.
@highlight The explanations coalesce around the need for simultaneous cooking and practical limitations of the new technologies.
@highlight Fuel availability cost and tenancy arrangements also emerge as important for urban residents.
@highlight Preference for food prepared on certain stoves did not emerge as an important reason for stacking.
@highlight Offering a range of clean stacking solutions can support the transition process towards clean cooking.
