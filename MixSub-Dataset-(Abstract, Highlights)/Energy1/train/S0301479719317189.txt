 Bioflocculant has been recently exploited in various research activities . In this research we report for the first time that a novel bioflocculant can self assemble into nanoparticles with an irregular structure in solution . Bioflocculant has been developed from novel consortium encompassing

@highlight Bioflocculant derived from consortium such as
@highlight Sp. were self assembled into nanoparticles in solution.
@highlight Presence of polysaccharides and proteins were revealed in the bioflocculant.
@highlight Removal efficiency of the novel bioflocculant for heavy metal adsorption antibiofilm and mosquitocidal activities of the bioflocculant were investigated.
@highlight Non toxicity of the bioflocculant was confirmed with aquatic organism using CA and MN assay.
