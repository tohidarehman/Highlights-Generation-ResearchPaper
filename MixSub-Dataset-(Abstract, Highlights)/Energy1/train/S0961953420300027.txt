 Mechanical disruption of lignocellulose during fermentation cotreatment is a nascent approach to increase biologically mediated carbohydrate solubilization without exposure to high temperatures or chemicals . However ability to tolerate the presence of milling at intensities sufficient to allow high lignocellulose solubilization yields has to date only been evaluated for

@highlight Cotreatment was tested on three lignocellulosic feedstocks and four microorganisms.
@highlight Carbohydrate solubilization is improved with cotreatment on all feedstocks tested.
@highlight Solubilization was found to be high for both woody and herbaceous angiosperms.
@highlight Growth of some microorganisms is affected by milling but for others it is not.
