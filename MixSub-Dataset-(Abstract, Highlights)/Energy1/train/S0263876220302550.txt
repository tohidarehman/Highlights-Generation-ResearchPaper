 In this work sessile drop and low bond axisymmetric drop shape analysis methods were coupled to provide some new aspects on stick slip behavior as well as stick time of a drop on calcite surfaces . Slightly hydrophobic calcite surfaces typified with three irregular roughnesses were used to create irregular surfaces to mimic defects for the water calcite air systems . Polishing papers of 200 600 and 1200 grit and a polishing machine were used to prepare surfaces . X ray diffraction energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy Fourier transform infrared and atomic force microscopy techniques were employed to evaluate the chemical and physical properties of surfaces . A model was developed to predict stick time based on the Laplace equation to take into account the effect of gravity which is neglected in the spherical cap model . An irregular stickslip behavior of the three phase contact line was observed for different roughness levels . Increasing roughness level from nono metric to micrometric scale induced variation of 77.4 9.0e03

@highlight The stick slip behavior of drop on a surface with irregular roughness was analyzed.
@highlight The advancing contact angels did not oscillate with a constant amplitude.
@highlight An accurate model was developed to predict stick time based on the Laplace equation.
