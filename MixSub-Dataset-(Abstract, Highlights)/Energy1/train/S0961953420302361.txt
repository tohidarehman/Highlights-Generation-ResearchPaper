 It is commonly known that the pretreatment of complex substrates yields higher biogas production in anaerobic digestion by improving hydrolysis . However it is still questioned whether all solubilized fractions after pretreatment can be used for CH

@highlight AD of whole and soluble fraction of pretreated LEMW was performed.
@highlight Combined pretreatment of LEMW UI 60min pH 1 increased CH
@highlight volume up to 7x.
@highlight Discrepancy between increased solubilization and CH
@highlight in response to pretreatment.
@highlight Increase of Soluble NCH
@highlight was observed at more severe pretreatment conditions.
@highlight Application of high intensity pretreatment is not always efficient to increase CH
