 Intensive farming is widespread throughout the UK and yet the health effects of bioaerosols which may be generated by these sites are currently not well researched . A scoping study was established to measure bioaerosols emitted from intensive pig

@highlight There are 10 900 pig farms and 2500 poultry farms within the UK which are unregulated for bioaerosols 
@highlight Bioaerosols are generated from intensive farms and are found in concentrations downwind higher than upwind at distances of up to 250m 
@highlight Of particular interest in terms of emissions from farms are bacteria and endotoxin which were elevated from background 
@highlight spp. downwind were at least 61 times higher than background at the boundary and at least 8 times higher 70m downwind on the four farms tested 
@highlight Intensive farms may require regular monitoring and regulation for bioaerosol emissions.
