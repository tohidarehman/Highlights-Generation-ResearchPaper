 One of the bottlenecks to commercialize microalgae based biofuel production is harvesting of microalgae biomass from high dilute culture broth . Meanwhile flocculation is identified as a low cost and promising technique to address this challenge . In this study the flocculating potential of agricultural waste derived bio based alkali from plantain peel ash was evaluated . The plantain peel ash and the produced bio based alkali were characterized using inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry and scanning electron microscope energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy . Results showed that more than 90 harvesting efficiency of microalgae biomass were obtained for both
