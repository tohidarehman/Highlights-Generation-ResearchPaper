 In the modern metropolitan regions the coupling among distribution networks gas networks and transportation networks is increasingly intensified which gives rise to the urgent demand for efficient modeling and solving methods . In this context a mathematical model for the configuration planning of integrated energy systems is proposed in this paper . With the aim of minimizing total planning costs the model jointly considers the investment and operation strategies for distribution lines distributed wind power generators combined heat and power units power to gas units gas furnaces fast charging facilities and slow charging facilities . Since the proposed model comes down to a non convex and nonlinear optimization problem a two layer algorithm is designed to solve it . In the outer layer a genetic algorithm is performed to obtain a set of individuals representing the investment decisions on distribution lines DWGs and FCFs which will be delivered to the inner layer model . With fixed decision variables the inner model optimizes the operating costs charging profit coefficients and strategies for DWGs and energy converters in a coordinated manner . A real urban area in China is employed in the numerical experiment which corroborates the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm .
