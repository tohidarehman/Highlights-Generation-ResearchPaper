 Against a backdrop of accelerating digital innovation in nature conservation and environmental management a real world experiment was conducted with the research aims of assessing 1 the effects of introducing a digital data entry platform on volunteer data submission and 2 the extent to which coordinators influence digital platform use by their volunteers . We focussed on a large scale volunteer based initiative aimed at eradicating the non native American mink

@highlight Digital innovation is often enthusiastically employed but effects poorly studied.
@highlight We build a data entry platform to assist a geographically dispersed organisation.
@highlight The centralised platform increased data submission by volunteers.
@highlight The digital orientation of project coordinators influenced volunteer platform use.
@highlight Digital tools need be introduced with caution and attention for mediating effects.
