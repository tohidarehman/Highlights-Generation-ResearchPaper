 Hydrothermal carbonization of pure cellulose and birchwood samples was carried out at temperatures between 160 and 280C 0.5h residence time and biomass to water ratio 1 5 to investigate the reactivity of cellulose in lignocellulosic biomass . Thermogravimetric analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the CE samples remained unaltered at temperatures up to 220C but were significantly decomposed at 230C producing a thermal recalcitrant aromatic and high energy dense material . FTIR showed that dehydration and aromatization reactions occurred at temperature equal or higher than 230C for the CE samples while a similar increase in aromatization for the BW hydrochars was evident only at temperatures equal or higher than 260C . Acid hydrolysis TGA and FTIR suggested that a higher thermal resistance of naturally occurring cellulose in BW could be related to a protecting shield offered by interlinked lignin in the plant matrix .

@highlight HTC induces decomposition of pure cellulose at temperature higher than 220C.
@highlight HTC promotes aromatization of cellulose at temperature equal or higher than 230C.
@highlight Cellulose decomposition in biomass is mitigated by lignin component during HTC.
