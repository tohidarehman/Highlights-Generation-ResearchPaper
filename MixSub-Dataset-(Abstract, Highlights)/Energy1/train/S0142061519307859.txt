 This paper introduces an accurate fault location algorithm for double circuit transmission lines compensated by Static Var Compensator . The proposed algorithm is based on the negative sequence circuit of the transmission system and it depends only on the current data available from one end of the line . Since only magnitudes of current signals are required there is no need for data synchronization . The proposed technique uses the COMTRADE fault files available from digital distance relays and it can effectively locate the all types of unbalanced faults regardless the high fault resistance effect of mutual coupling and SVC current injection information . As one formula can be used for all types of fault classification of fault types and phase selection are not required . The shunt capacitances of the line are considered by utilizing the distributed parameters model of the transmission lines . The proposed algorithm is rigorously investigated for various fault scenarios in SVC compensated transmission system . The simulation cases in the MATLAB environment verifies that the proposed scheme has excellent performance . Test results are compared with a conventional fault location technique to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm .

@highlight This method is only based on the current data in relay location.
