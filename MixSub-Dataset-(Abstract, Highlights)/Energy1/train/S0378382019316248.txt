 Although the synthesis of carbon nanotubes from coal can efficiently reduce the cost of preparing these materials the effect of the primary minerals present in coal on the growth of these structures has not been studied in depth . In this study we used a bituminous coal containing siderite and investigated the changes of the original siderite phase and the growth mechanism of carbon nanotubes during a KOH catalyzed coal pyrolysis process . The results shown that the primary Fe minerals played an important role in the formation of carbon nanotubes during coal pyrolysis . During the KOH catalyzed pyrolysis of coal the Fe present in the raw material migrated from the bulk to the surface of the coal particles and enriched in some areas of the surface of the coal particle . KOH catalyzed coal pyrolysis had a significant effect on the formation of micropores and the increase of specific surface area and pore volume in coal . The primary siderite in coal and the catalytic growth of carbon nanotubes in line with the following mechanism FeCO

@highlight CNTs were prepared by catalytic pyrolysis of coal with low alkalinity.
@highlight The growth of CNTs was catalyzed by primary Fe in coal was discovered and verified.
@highlight The siderite in coal was transformed as follows FeCO
@highlight  FeFe
@highlight C.
@highlight Mechanism of siderite catalyzed formation of CNTs during coal pyrolysis was proposed.
