 A literature review is presented in this paper of the methods for quantifying the solar PV hosting capacity of low voltage distribution grids . Three fundamentally different methods are considered i deterministic ii stochastic iii time series . The methods outline of applications merits and shortfalls are summarized . The methods differ in the input data accuracy accuracy computation time consideration of uncertainties consideration of the time related influence and the models used . Two types of uncertainties need to be considered certain uncertainties and uncertain uncertainties . The latter ones are only included in some of the stochastic methods .

@highlight Increased installed Solar PV necessitates need for hosting capacity HC quantification methods.
@highlight Overview of methods applicable to quantify HC in low voltage distribution grids.
@highlight Methods categorised into three and namely Deterministic Stochastic and Time series methods.
@highlight The application merits and shortfalls of the methods discussed in the article.
@highlight Guide on HC quantification methods based on input data computational effort and desired accuracy.
