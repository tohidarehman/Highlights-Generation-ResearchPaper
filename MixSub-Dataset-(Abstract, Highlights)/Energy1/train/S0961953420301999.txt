 Biogas digestates contain substantial amounts of nutrients and are widely used as fertilizer . However long term results of their agronomic effects are limited . A ten year field experiment was evaluated regarding the phosphorus fertilizer value of digestates in dependence of different crop species paying special attention to turnover and translocation of P in the soil profile . The input substrate and digested substrate from a biogas plant were applied annually to at a rate of 30m ha

@highlight Long term fertilizer values of undigested and digested slurries were compared.
@highlight The slurries represented valuable and readily available P sources.
@highlight Activities of soil enzymes increased only after application of undigested slurry.
@highlight Application of digested slurry resulted in higher P concentration in the subsoil.
