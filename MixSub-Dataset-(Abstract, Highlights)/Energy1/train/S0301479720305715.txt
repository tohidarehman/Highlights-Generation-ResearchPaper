 Wind erosion is one of the main factors of soil degradation and air pollution in arid and semi arid regions . In this study we evaluated microbial induced carbonate precipitation as an alternative soil conservation method against wind erosion using sugar cane molasse and vinasse as growth substrates in comparison to tryptic soy broth . The three substrates were applied in laboratory tests with and without addition of MICP cementing solution to two sandy soils differing in calcium carbonate content . The performance of MICP solution inoculated with a cultured urease producing strain of

@highlight Wind erosion is one of the main factors of air pollution in arid and semiarid regions.
@highlight MICP with three substrates sugarcane molasse vinasse and tryptic soy broth are investigated.
@highlight Extensive in situ wind tunnel experiments and soil properties analysis are performed.
@highlight Links between soil erosion rates and soil amendments are illustrated.
@highlight Environmentally friendly and cost effective amendments to control wind erosion of bare sandy soils are proposed.
