 Native riparian vegetation communities have declined downstream of large water infrastructure like dams and diversions owing to water management operations that prevent successful seedling colonization and recruitment . Altered timing and magnitude of reservoir releases to fulfill competing water demands often lead to reduced peak discharges and flow recession rates that do not support native riparian reproduction processes . To achieve short term ecosystem function in highly regulated rivers an alternative method might be restoration planting whereby success depends on identifying appropriate planting location and spatial extents . This study aims to provide a methodology to inform resource managers about the extent of possible natural seedling recruitment under average and wet hydrologic conditions as well as constrain restoration planting operational uncertainties . Results from field surveys and simulations showed limited favorable areas for successful riparian seedling recruitment under regulated flows regardless of hydrologic conditions in the basin . However wet hydrologic conditions were more favorable than average conditions for seedling recruitment . Furthermore model results identified the location and spatial extent of favorable restoration planting areas during average flow . This extent is approximately 25 times larger than natural recruitment during an average year and even twice that for natural recruitment for a wet year . This suggests that ground operational activities guided by numerical modeling may effectively constrain planting uncertainties .

@highlight Habitat is limited for riparian seedling recruitment under regulated flows.
@highlight Wet hydrological conditions are more favorable than average for seedling recruitment.
@highlight Model helps to select suitable sites for planting and restoring riparian ecosystems.
