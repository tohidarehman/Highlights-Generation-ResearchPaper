 The performance of a polyamide based thin film composite nanofiltration membrane was investigated for the retention of atenolol a pharmaceutical pollutant from the single and binary aqueous solutions . The effect of pH applied pressure feed flux initial atenolol concentration and different co existing salts with varying concentrations were studied to test the performance of the membrane . The removal efficiency of ATN increased with increasing solution pH giving the highest retention at pH 9 which was slightly decreased with the increasing initial ATN concentration but increased with increasing applied pressure and feed flux . As per the uncharged solutes rejection concept the average pore radius of NF membrane for slit like and cylindrical pore geometries were respectively 0.1690.003 and 0.2640.009nm . The Spiegler Kedem model could predict the performance of NF membrane by retaining ATN over the investigated range of feed flux . The calculated reflection coefficient

@highlight With increasing solution pH the ATN retention was enhanced and indicating effect of p
@highlight value.
@highlight The calculated
@highlight ratio for slit like and cylindrical pore geometries are 1.17 and 0.79 respectively.
@highlight The
@highlight value is almost close to unity demonstrating sterically hinderance of convective process.
@highlight Upon addition of NaCl and Na
@highlight SO
@highlight as coexisting salts the ATN retention by NF33 was dropped.
@highlight Addition of CaCl
@highlight in feed solution improved the ATN retention.
