 There are different physicochemical and biological methods to treat effluents . However their efficiency is not enough to meet the effluents discharge limits . For this reason it could be possible to employ a polished treatment . A suitable alternative for this goal could be constructed wetlands . The aim of the present research was to evaluate contaminants removal efficiency of a pilot scale horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland for tertiary treatment of dairy wastewater . A vegetation study was also conducted in order to determine the role of plants on nutrient removal . A pilot scale HSSFW planted with

@highlight HSSFW s performance for dairy industry wastewater tertiary treatment was evaluated.
@highlight A pilot wetland was monitored during spring summer and a plant study was conducted.
@highlight High removal efficiencies for COD BOD TSS nitrates and nitrites were obtained.
@highlight HSSFW would be an advisable alternative as a tertiary treatment of dairy wastewater.
@highlight role in phosphorus and nitrogen uptake was verified.
