 The exposure to extremely high temperatures varies across population groups . Those with better adaptation strategies suffer less . This paper combines China s daily mean temperature data with comprehensive national survey data at the household level and estimates the relationship between high temperature exposure and adaptation behavior of urban dwellers . We find that the usage of air conditioning and electric fans by urban households in China increases with their summer high temperature exposures . The rise in the number of days with extreme heat induces the purchase and use of air conditioning . High temperature adaptability varied across householdsthe rich are more likely to increase air conditioning usage to cope with the high temperature discomfort while the poor are less likely to afford such a market product for adaptation they suffer more from high temperature exposure . Such a variation in the affordability and usage of market products to adapt to climate risks will exacerbate the climate induced inequality .

@highlight We study the adaptation behaviors to high temperature exposures in China.
@highlight The Chinese Urban Household Survey data is used for empirical analysis.
@highlight The rise in days with extreme heat induce the purchase and use of air conditioning.
@highlight The rich are more likely to increase air conditioning usage compared with the poor.
