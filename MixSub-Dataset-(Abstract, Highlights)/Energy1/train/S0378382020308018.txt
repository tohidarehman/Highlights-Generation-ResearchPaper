 Coal spontaneous combustion in the goaf usually occurs in the multi component gases environment . In this work the multi component gases competitive adsorption properties and its effects on the coal oxidations were investigated by gas adsorption analyzer and in situ FTIR . Results show that the order of gases adsorption selectivity on coal surface based on IAST is that CO
