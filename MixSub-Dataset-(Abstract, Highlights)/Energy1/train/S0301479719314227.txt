 Hydrothermal processing as a post treatment technology for sludge has attracted great interest globally as it could reduce the amount of sludge considerably . This experimental study developed a comprehensive kinetic model of cellulose degradation via non oxidative hydrothermal processing at various temperatures . Values of activation energies and pre exponential factors were determined using chemical oxygen demand based lumped concentrations . In this study a new reaction pathway between solid soluble matter and gaseous products was proposed which not only enables prediction of solid phase degradation but also can predict the formation of various types of products during the reaction time . The results show that the reaction rate of cellulose to liquid products

@highlight Kinetics of non oxidative hydrothermal process of cellulose were investigated.
@highlight A new reaction pathways was suggested for the degradation of organic compounds.
@highlight The existence of psudo direct pathway from solid to gaseous products was shown.
@highlight Results inferred that the majority of the solid was converted to gaseous products.
@highlight The model predict the kinetics of non oxidative hydrothermal process accurately.
