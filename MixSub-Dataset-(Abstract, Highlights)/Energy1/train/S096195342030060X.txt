 Perennial grasses are the promising source of bioenergy in South America which could provide several environmental benefits such as reduction in the greenhouse gasses emissions and reduction of nutrients and soil losses . Our objective was to determine the impact of N and P fertilization on biomass yield N use efficiency apparent N recovery and nutrient removal on three perennial grasses elephantgrass

@highlight All perennial grasses had excellent biomass yields for temperate regions.
@highlight Biomass yield from all grasses highly increased in response to N fertilizer but little to P.
@highlight Elephantgrass had the highest nitrogen use efficiency but it could lead to soil nutrient depletion for high N recovery.
@highlight Switchgrass had good biomass yield with low N recovery making it an excellent species for bioenergy.
