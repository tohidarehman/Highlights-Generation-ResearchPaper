 This work proposes a strategy for start up of dry semi continuous reactors for methane production without using adapted inoculum . Using OFMSW as substrate three reactors operating at 35C were used . Experimentation consisted in start up adjusting operational parameters and after start up was successful semicontinuous feeding under different organic loading rates . After the first 22 days to control acidification feeding was stopped . On day 42 slow feeding was restarted and after day 50 the reactors produced methane under stable conditions and after day 70 semicontinuous maximum feed was achieved with maximal methane production . Although the values for methane production vary between 339 and 333 NL kg

@highlight A strategy to start up dry anaerobic digester to treat OFMSW was developed.
@highlight Start up of dry OFMSW fermentation required 6 weeks using non adapted inoculum.
@highlight Acidification can be controlled through slow feeding.
@highlight Methane can be produced also under unstable conditions.
