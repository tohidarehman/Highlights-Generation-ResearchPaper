 Soaring demand for technology metals and its ever depleting primary resources ask for alternative recovery from secondary sources . NiCd battery is one such source that can abridge the gap between demand and supply of such metals . Biogenic recovery being environmentally benign is explored for Cd and Ni recovery to manage the menace of spent NiCd battery . Studies with 20 40 and 60mg L Cd

@highlight First report on bacterially assisted recovery of Cd from waste NiCd battery.
@highlight Bioavailability of Cd was bacterially reduced and immobilized as CdS nanoparticle.
@highlight PN secretion was enhanced enabling Cd EPS binding to protect the bacteria.
@highlight PXRD and TEM pictured the biosynthesis of 26nm crystals of hawleyite.
@highlight Metal was bacterially recovered from digested NiCd battery liquor in benign way.
