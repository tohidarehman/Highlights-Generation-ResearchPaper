 Activated carbons with high porosity and high surface area are promising materials to be used in wide range applications . They can easily be prepared from various biomass source following by simple and reproducible activation and carbonization steps . In this study the woody part of tea which is highly available tea waste after the harvesting of tea leaves is considered as the precursor of highly porous activated carbon . In fact activated carbon with well ordered porous structure micropore area 1614.3m

@highlight Highly ordered porous activated carbon from tea waste was successfully prepared.
@highlight Cobalt nanoparticles were supported on activated carbon.
@highlight Highly reusable cobalt catalyst was prepared for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane.
