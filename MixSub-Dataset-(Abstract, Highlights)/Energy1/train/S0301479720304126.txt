 The current emphasis of developing countries on policies that favor the intensification of mining exploitation as the main source of incomes has generated negative consequences for ecosystems and rural communities mainly due to the release of highly toxic elements into the environment . This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of the Vetas California gold mining district on As distribution in stream sediments and surface water samples from Surat River located in the southwestern area of Santurbn paramo Colombia . With this aim samples distributed along the high Surat River basin in areas near and far from mining areas were selected . Samples were chemically characterized . The As mobility enrichment and sources were evaluated using sequential and single extractions enrichment factor geoaccumulation index I

@highlight Vetas California gold mining district impact on Surat River in Santurbn paramo.
@highlight Concentrations above 50g As L were found in water samples near mining areas.
@highlight High arsenic enrichments along the high basin of the Surat River was demonstrated.
@highlight Changing environmental conditions may increase As mobilization from sediments.
