 Research into herbaceous bioenergy production has focused on identifying grassland systems that are both productive and temporally stable where stability equals the ratio of mean biomass production to its temporal standard deviation . The question remains as to effects of community properties including species richness on temporal stability . We compared aboveground net primary productivity and the temporal stability in ANPP of unfertilized grassland planted either as a mixture of native perennial grass and forb species or monoculture of

@highlight Temporal stability of plant biomass for bioenergy depends on plant community traits.
@highlight Stability was similar in switchgrass monoculture and mixed species grassland.
@highlight Stability depended more on a community aggregated leaf trait than species richness.
@highlight Stability was similar despite differences in biomass leaf trait relationships.
