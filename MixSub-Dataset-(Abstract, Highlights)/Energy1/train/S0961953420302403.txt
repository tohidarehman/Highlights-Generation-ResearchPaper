 Batch anaerobic digestion using municipal solid waste as a substrate with anaerobic sludge as inoculum were carried out under mesophilic conditions to understand the effect of Vitamin supplement coupled with micronutrients on the AD process . Reactions were operated using various concentrations of vitamin and water based metal supplementations . The stability and process performance in the low level supplementation was indicated by evaluating Volatile fatty acids to alkalinity ratio pH as well as methane kinetics . The feasibility of AD process was further evaluated by cost benefit ratio analysis . This study shows that Vitamin addition as a sole supplement had either no significant or negative effect on methane production and process performance of anaerobic digestion . However coupling the metal supplement with vitamins shows an increase in methane production up to 30 compared to sole vitamin supplement and control systems . This study also shows that high levels of metal supplementation were detrimental and 15 decline in methane production over the control system was observed in high concentrations . Low level addition improved the reactor performance and process stability . Moreover cost benefit ratios lower than 1 were achieved for these concentrations . Hence low levels of vitamin and water based metal supplementation at 0.55mg L increased the methane production and process stability by approximately 15 and 25 respectively .
