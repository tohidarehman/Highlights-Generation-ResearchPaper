 Lactic acid is a potential building block in biomass refinery based on lignocellulose . Herein we report three component Lewis acid catalyst systems comprised of metal triflates In chloride and Sn chloride for the direct synthesis of methyl lactate from cellulose in methanol . These three catalyst species cooperatively catalyzed this reaction the metal triflates depolymerized cellulose to sugars which was converted to trioses by retro aldol reaction with In chloride followed by their isomerization with Sn chloride to give MeLac . Among the metal triflates Sm triflate was the most effective with which MeLac was formed in 45 yield . Ball milling pretreatment of cellulose in the presence of methanol increased the yield of MeLac to 64 .
