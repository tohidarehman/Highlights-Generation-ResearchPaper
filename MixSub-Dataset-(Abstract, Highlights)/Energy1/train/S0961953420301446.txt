 The main aim of the present work was to characterize the mesophilic anaerobic co digestion of food waste and sewage sludge by considering different mixing ratios of primary sludge secondary sludge and food waste . The experiments were carried out using batch reactors . The applied ratios included VS

@highlight C N was much more effective than VS
