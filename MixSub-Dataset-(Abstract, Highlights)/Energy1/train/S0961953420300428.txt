 The biodiesel industry generates crude glycerol at the rate of 10 of the amount of biodiesel produced . With the production of this biofuel increasing a large amount of CG is produced each year . This results in low price for it and its final disposal becomes a significant problem . Herein steam reforming represents a viable route to valorize this biodiesel by product into hydrogen . The performance of NiLaZr catalysts for steam reforming of a CG without any purification treatment has been investigated at atmospheric pressure and at 500C and 650C . These materials were prepared using a coprecipitation method with oxalic acid . At 650C the catalyst calcined at 850C presents higher catalytic activity and stability and displays better resistance to deactivation by carbon formation than the catalyst calcined at 700C . This behavior can be attributed to several causes higher surface nickel content higher catalyst reducibility and the presence of oxygen vacancies formed as a consequence of the partial substitution of nickel atoms into the pyrochlore structure during the formation of the biphasic system which is related to mechanisms that act in the removal of carbon deposits on the catalyst .

@highlight Steam reforming of untreated crude glycerol was studied over NiLaZr catalysts.
@highlight SR tests performed at 500C showed low conversion of carbon to gaseous products.
@highlight Catalyst calcined at 850C presented the highest activity and stability at 650C.
@highlight This catalyst showed the best abilities in anti sintering and coke resistance.
