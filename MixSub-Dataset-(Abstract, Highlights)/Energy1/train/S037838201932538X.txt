 The upgrading of highly unsaturated bio oil by zeolite cracking suffers from severe catalyst deactivation due to the carbonaceous deposition . Therefore the dual stage hydrotreating cracking process is developed for more stable operation . In this work to further promote the generation of aromatic hydrocarbon in a hydrotreating cracking process cofeeding bio oil light fraction and methanol the cracking catalyst HZSM 5 was modified by MO

@highlight HZSM 5 was modified by metal oxides for bio oil hydrotreating cracking.
@highlight Aromatic hydrocarbon production was promoted by MOx HZSM 5 catalysts.
@highlight Ga
@highlight  HZSM 5 exhibited the best performance for selective aromatics production.
@highlight CH
@highlight re activation and alkenes selective conversion was promoted by Ga
@highlight  HZSM 5.
