 Generally Fly ashes in Municipal Solid Waste Incinerator are classified as hazardous waste and commonly managed in a mixed way even though distinct FA in incineration flows have different characteristics . Thus it can cause improper management of fly ashes and an increase in cost as well as the volume of residual ashes sent to the hazardous landfill . In this study Bottom ash Secondary furnace ash Superheater ash Boiler chamber ash Economizer ash and Baghouse Filter Ash have been sampled separately from different locations at an MSWI plant . An integrated approach involving physical chemical mineralogy and leaching behavior was used to characterize the residual ashes . Results point out that the average diameter of ash particles varies from 4.87m for BHFA to 6825m for BA with three distinct zones . The Blaine fineness value increases when the median size of ash particles decreases . All values of Loss on Ignition at 550C are less than 3 indicating a suitable burning . The main mineralogical crystalline phases in ashes were KCl NaCl Mg .

@highlight Physical chemical mineralogy and leaching properties are necessary for characterization of various ashes from MSWI.
@highlight Particle size pH and organic chloride could significantly affect the leaching rate of heavy metals.
@highlight Based on different leaching tests some types of MSWI ashes are classified as hazardous or non hazardous waste.
