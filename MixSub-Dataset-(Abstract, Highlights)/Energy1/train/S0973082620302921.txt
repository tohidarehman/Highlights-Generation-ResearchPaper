 As countries start to implement the Sustainable Development Goals in their national development agendas reviews of the current policy environment are necessary to ensure that the goals are achievable by 2030 . The present study assesses the effectiveness of energy policy in Indonesia in supporting progress towards universal energy access a substantial increase in renewable energy deployment and improvement in energy efficiency . Laws and regulations related to energy were reviewed and their contribution to achieving the energy targets of the Sustainable Development Goals in Indonesia was evaluated in terms of policy effectiveness . Results show that providing electricity for the remaining 1.1 million households living in the outermost and least developed regions of the archipelago is very challenging . However Indonesia is still on track to achieve 100 residential electrification by 2030 as long as enough budget is allocated annually . Indonesia may not be able to provide access to clean cooking fuels and technology for everyone by 2030 . The current policy focusing mostly on gas for cooking will be less effective in reaching the remaining households that cook with solid biomass and usually live in poverty . Similarly the current policy scenario is not sufficient to allow enough progress to achieve the renewable energy target . Finally the assessment of energy efficiency policy suggests that sectoral energy use is shaped by variables and regulation not primarily intended to improve energy efficiency .

@highlight The electrification program as a national priority improves electricity access.
@highlight The clean cooking energy target may be missed as policy focuses on gas use only.
@highlight Regulatory uncertainties discourage investment in renewable electricity.
@highlight Energy use is shaped by policies not primarily intended for energy conservation.
