 Efficient and effective thermal management of Li ion battery pack for electric vehicle application is vital for the safety and extended life of this energy storage system . In this paper the thermal management system of a battery module is presented as an integral part of the electric vehicle air conditioning system . The refrigerant is bifurcated from the main system through a pipe and expansion valve and guided to the battery module compartment consisting of 64 18650 type Li ion battery arranged in the form of 88 array . Several experimental strategies such as expansion valve throttle level thermostat sensitivity and proportional integral derivative control algorithm are investigated . The results indicate that a larger openness of the throttling valve avoids superheating of the refrigerant and maintains the maximum temperature difference in the battery module around 2C . Additionally thermostat sensitivity and PID control algorithm is found to be able to offer effective thermal management for an electric vehicle battery pack .

@highlight The battery thermal management is integrated with the vehicle air conditioning.
@highlight Battery temperature control by the valve openness and thermostat sensitivity.
@highlight The PID control algorithm is found to be an effective strategy.
