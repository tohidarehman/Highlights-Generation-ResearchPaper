 The pyrolysis behaviors the kinetics of the synergistic effects the functional groups during the co pyrolysis of torrefied biomass with a tire and different plastics such as high density polyethylene ethyl vinyl acetate polystyrene polypropylene were analyzed by TG FTIR . The TG DTG curves revealed thermal stability due to torrefaction treatment and blending . The most potential reaction mechanisms associated with the first stage for both pure and blend samples were first order reaction and one dimensional diffusion mechanisms while the second stage was mostly governed by second and third order reaction mechanisms . The interactions between TBG plastics tire were obvious at temperatures of 290540C according to the variation of weight loss values . The highest degree of synergy was observed with the TBG PS blend while the TBG tire mixture being the least synergistic . The FTIR spectra indicated that hydrocarbons compounds CO
