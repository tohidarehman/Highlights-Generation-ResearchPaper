 This study used a laboratory scale system to investigate the effects of calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer biochar and spent mushroom substrate on compost maturity and gasous emissions during pig manure composting . The results showed that the addition of CaMgP Biochar or SMS had no negative effect on the quality and maturity of compost and all three additives could reduce the emissions of ammonia NH

@highlight Calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer decreased polluting gases emission.
@highlight Calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer increased the final total nutrient contents.
@highlight Biochar improved the final maturity and reduced sulfur containing gaseous emission.
@highlight Spent mushroom substrate reduced nitrous oxide emission by 37 .
@highlight Spent mushroom substrate reduced 65 dimethyl sulfide and 72 dimethyl disulfide.
