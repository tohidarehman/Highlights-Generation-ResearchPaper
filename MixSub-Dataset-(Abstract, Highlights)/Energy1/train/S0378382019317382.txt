 In order to increase 1 3 BD yield ordered mesoporous materials was synthesized and used as supporting materials of heterogeneous catalysts for ethanol conversion into 1 3 BD . To make acidic and basic sites acting as active sites on the surface of catalysts a moderate amount of zinc oxide and zirconium oxide ZrO

@highlight The ZnO ZrO
@highlight  ordered mesoporous materials OMMs were synthesized by soft templating and solution impregnation.
@highlight The ZnO ZrO
@highlight  OMSs showed better ETB Ethanol to 1 3 butadiene performances.
@highlight Highly dispersed Zn
@highlight  Zr
@highlight with balanced acidic and basic sites may be responsible for noticeable ETB activities of the ZnO ZrO
@highlight  OMSs.
