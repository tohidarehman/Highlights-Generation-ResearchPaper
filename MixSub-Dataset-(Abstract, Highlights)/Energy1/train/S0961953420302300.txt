 Traditional sugarcane breeding seeks for high sucrose content . However with the increasing demand for renewable energy sources there has been a shift in desired traits for sugarcane as an energy crop . Energy cane is a cultivar developed from

@highlight S. spontaneum has high fiber and low sucrose content and it is used as a parental line to energy cane cultivars.
@highlight S. s
@highlight lignin S G unit ratio is distinct among cultivars of the same species.
@highlight Distinct sugarcane crops have different fiber sucrose and morphology but similar biomass composition.
@highlight The internodes from the top to the base of the culm revealed progressive maturation stages.
@highlight Sampling culm across the stages of development was a useful system to follow cell wall composition in energy cane varieties.
