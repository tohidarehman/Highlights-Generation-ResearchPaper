 The electrochemical oxidation of butyl paraben over boron doped diamond anode was studied in this work . Emphasis was put on degradation performance in various actual water matrices including secondary treated wastewater bottled water surface water ultrapure water and ultrapure water spiked with humic acid . Experiments were performed utilizing 0.1M Na

@highlight Butyl paraben BP undergoes fast BDD anodic oxidation in Cl free environment.
@highlight Increasing matrix complexity and current density accelerates degradation.
@highlight BP degradation in real wastewater occurs within minutes at low current densities.
@highlight Persulfate activated by carbon black also degrades BP albeit slower than BDD.
@highlight Unlike BDD oxidation matrix complexity is harmful for the sulfate radical system.
