 The utilization of non edible and low cost feedstock in bioenergy research is getting more attention in recent decades . Catalytic deoxygenation of fatty acids from waste oil feedstocks is a promising route to produce diesel like hydrocarbons . Here we report the conversion of palm fatty acid distillate a low value side product of physical refining of crude palm oil into green diesel using a solventless and hydrogen free deoxygenation reaction using catalytic deoxygenation over solid acid catalysts with total metal loadings of 5wt . Metal precursors were doped on the mesostructured catalyst supporter SBA 15 by wet impregnation . The catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm analysis X ray diffraction X ray fluorescence infrared spectroscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy with elemental mapping . The DO reaction was carried out in a semi batch reactor with a catalyst loading of 10wt at 350C for 3h . The use of both Ni SBA 15 and NiCo SBA 15 afforded products with high contents of liquid hydrocarbons with yields of 85.8 and 88.1 respectively and selectivity for diesel range hydrocarbons above 85 were achieved . Cobalt seems to have a larger particle size then associates with the carbon formation and introduces coke formation . It blocks some pores and deactivates the active sites of the catalyst thus reducing the catalytic activity .
