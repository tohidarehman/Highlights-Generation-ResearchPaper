 Beta zeolite supported NiMo catalysts NiMo HBeta were developed and applied to the hydroconversion of methyl laurate under a hydrogen pressure of 0.4MPa . Compared with the NiMo catalyst supported on a zeolite with no Al content NiMo HBeta exhibited high catalytic activity and selectivity for

@highlight Acidic properties of beta zeolite supported Ni Mo catalysts affect catalytic activity.
@highlight Catalytic activity increases after treatment of H Beta with HNO

@highlight Selective conversion of methyl laurate to
@highlight  dodecane proceeds after treatment.
@highlight Successive TEAOH and HNO
@highlight treatments of H Beta further enhance catalytic activity.
@highlight Brnsted acid sites contribute to the improvement in catalytic performance.
