 As a type of special biowaste waste wood based panels have a high nitrogen content and typical biomass defect properties which limit their clean and efficient thermal utilization . An upgrading and denitrogenation procedure prior to thermal utilization is necessary but the relevant mechanisms and characteristics have not been clearly elucidated . Torrefaction pretreatment of three typical WWPs was conducted to investigate the evolution of carbon and nitrogen functionalities in relation to the upgrading denitrogenation procedure . The results demonstrated that the combined upgrading denitrogenation of WWPs was possible . Under optimal operating conditions the denitrogenation efficiency could reach 6070wt with a slight energy loss of 30 and a high HHV of the corresponding torrefied products . The carbon functionality evolution was believed to be the continuous change from low energy

@highlight Torrefaction can achieve a combined upgrading and denitrogenation for WWPs.
@highlight Upgrading and denitrogenation during torrefaction of WWPs are asynchronous.
