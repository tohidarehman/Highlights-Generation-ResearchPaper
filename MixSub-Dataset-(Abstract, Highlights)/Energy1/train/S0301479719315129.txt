 Pharmaceuticals are a subset of micropollutants present in the environment in trace concentrations . Because of their persistent nature these chemicals are of particular concern . Little is known about how mixtures of pharmaceutical residues found in WWTP effluents affect the environment or public health . Yet numerous studies show negative outcomes for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms suggesting that they are given both to bioaccumulation and uptake in plants . Israel leads the world in effluent reuse almost exclusively utilized for purposes of agricultural irrigation . Pharmaceuticals however are not included in Israel s water regulatory oversight or management essentially creating an epidemiological experiment among its citizens and environment . Globally these compounds also are not commonly subject to monitoring or regulation . This study reviews and analyzes water policies and regulation worldwide that address the presence of pharmaceuticals in water resources with a particular focus on Australia Singapore Switzerland and the USA . Furthermore the study investigates the reasons why these chemicals are not yet regulated in Israel . Based on a comprehensive evaluation of the data and analysis of the regulatory rationale in other countries a list of recommended pharmaceutical standards that should be measured and monitored in Israel s wastewater treatment system is proposed . The suggested prioritization criteria should be at the heart of a new regulatory agenda for controlling pharmaceutical contamination in wastewater .
