 This study evaluates the effect biomass blending and binder addition on the strength calorific value and durability by biomass pellets . Blended biomass materials and three binders recovered polyvinyl alcohol waste cooking oil and waste lubricating oil were used to make biomass pellets . Ground nut shell pellets exhibited the highest CV but lowest strength which was improved by the addition of saw dust and Leaf litter waste additives . Contrarily LLW pellets exhibited good strength but the minimum CV which was improved by GNS audition . The LLW biomass contributed as strength improver and GNS served as CV enhancer . The SWD biomass provided both strength and CV to the pellets . In case of binders a significant increase in the strength of GNS pellets was observed on rPVA addition in comparison to LLW pellets and SWD pellets whereas WCO and WLO showed a marginal reduction in strength of all the biomass pellets . The rPVA material worked as strength improving binder whereas WCO and WLO were responsible to increase the CV of the pellets .

@highlight Fuel pellets were prepared using sawdust groundnut shell and leaf litter waste.
@highlight LLW serves as strength improviser and GNS as calorific value improviser additive.
@highlight SWD serves as both strength and calorific value improvising additive.
@highlight Recovered polyvinyl alcohol serve as strength improvising binder.
@highlight Waste cooking oil and waste lubricating oil serve as calorific value improviser.
