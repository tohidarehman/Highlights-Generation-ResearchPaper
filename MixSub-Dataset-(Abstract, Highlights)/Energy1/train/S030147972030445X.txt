 Nonferrous metal mining activities produce enormous amounts of tailings that contain high concentrations of toxic chemicals threatening human health and the environment . This risk could be alleviated using remediation agents such as biochar as proposed by others . However contradictory evidence indicates that biochar can increase or sometimes decrease bioavailable concentrations depending on the selection of metals in mine tailings . Here three biochars derived from different raw stocks were used to treat mine tailings samples . Chemical analyses indicated that all biochars favored the stabilization of Cd Cr Cu Pb and Zn as well as the mobilization of As and Sb . The barley root elongation bioassay showed that the tailings toxicity was only partially diminished or even elevated by biochar treatment . Similar results were also observed from microbial enzyme assays . Further analyses showed that these toxic effects correlated well with the relative toxicity index

@highlight Biochar decreased mobility of metals and increased that of metalloids in tailings.
@highlight Phytotoxicity was diminished 55.8 or increased 20.7 using different biochars.
@highlight Microbial activities increased 28.3 or decreased 24.0 using different biochars.
@highlight Release of metalloids compromised biochar treatment on mine tailings.
@highlight Relative toxicity index can predict tailings mixture toxicity.
