 The economic dispatch problem is a basic problem of energy management in the actual smart grids operation . This paper studies a general EDP of minimizing a sum of local convex cost functions subjected to both local interval constraints and coupling linear constraint over an undirected network . To reduce the amount of computation and interaction we bring out a fresh event triggered distributed accelerated primal dual algorithm named as ET DAPDA with uncoordinated step sizes for solving the EDP . ET DAPDA incorporates two types of momentum terms into gradient tracking scheme and assumes that each node independently interacts with neighbors only at the event triggered sampling time instants . Presuming the smoothness and strong convexity cost functions the linear convergence of ET DAPDA is analyzed by using the generalized small gain theorem . Moreover ET DAPDA strictly excludes the behavior of Zeno like thus heavily reducing the interaction cost . ET DAPDA is studied on 14 bus and 118 bus systems to evaluate its applicabilities . The simulation results of the convergence rate are further compared with the prior art which proves the superiority of ET DAPDA .

@highlight This paper proposes a event triggered distributed accelerated primal dual algorithm ET DAPDA to solve EDP.
@highlight ET DAPDA guarantees faster convergence and saves computation and interaction resources.
@highlight ET DAPDA provides a more relaxed step size choice than other methods.
