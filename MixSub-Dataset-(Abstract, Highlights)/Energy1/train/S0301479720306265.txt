 An efficient adsorbent which can resolve the existing limitations of a biobed is of concern . In the present study a composite is prepared by mixing and pyrolyzing clay and plant parts . This is finally converted to clay biochar composite with enhanced porosity and adsorption capacity . Composite consists of clay with sawdust or clay with powdered dry fruit of

@highlight A novel biomix component for biobed.
@highlight Clay biochar composite bioaugmented with biosurfactant producing bacterial consortium used as biomix.
@highlight Biobed removed pesticide from agricultural runoff and pesticide was biodegraded within biobed.
@highlight Biosurfactant producing bacterial consortium enhanced the bioavailability of adsorbed pesticide.
