 A novel biochar containing highly dispersed cobalt oxides was prepared by one step pyrolysis using Co enriched Siberian Iris as the raw material and it was used for elemental mercury removal from flue gas . The presence of NO or HCl could approximately keep Hg

@highlight The biochar prepared from cobalt enriched phytoremediation plant was used for Hg
@highlight oxidation removal.
@highlight The Co
@highlight  Co
@highlight redox cycle from highly dispersed cobalt oxides in the biochar facilitated Hg
@highlight removal.
@highlight SO
@highlight reacted with active Co
@highlight to generate sulfate which inhibited Hg
@highlight removal.
@highlight NO HCl contributed to Hg
@highlight removal mainly through the Eley Rideal mechanism.
@highlight Formation of active nitrogenous chlorine species and its reaction with Hg
@highlight was hampered by SO
