 Cyanobacteria can have high lipid content are amenable to metabolic engineering and contain valuable materials such as ultraviolet protectants and antioxidants . Maximizing the production and harvesting of several valuable products at the same time is an important objective . UV exposure was evaluated as a strategy to induce synthesis of UV protectants higher lipid productivity and a high lipid saturation index in the cyanobacterium

@highlight UVA exposure led to higher lipid productivity by
@highlight UTEX LB 2716.
@highlight UVB exposure led to more saturated lipids which provide better fuel quality.
@highlight UVB stimulated greater production of UV protectants mycosporine like amino acids.
@highlight UV protectants and lipid could be recovered separately by sequential extractions.
