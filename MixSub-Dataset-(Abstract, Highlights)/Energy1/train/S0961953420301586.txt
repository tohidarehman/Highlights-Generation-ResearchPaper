 Sweet sorghum is a promising bioenergy crop that has great potential for bioethanol production due to its wide adaptability high sugar yield and drought tolerance . The objective of the present study was to evaluate the bioethanol yield potential and bagasse combustion characteristics of 13 sweet sorghum cultivars in a semiarid Mediterranean environment . The results showed that M81 E was the most promising cultivar for whole crop bioethanol production due to it having the highest total ethanol yield at 6885Lha

@highlight Cultivar M81 E achieved the significantly highest total bioethanol yield.
@highlight Cultivar Samsun attained the significantly lowest total bioethanol yield.
@highlight Cultivar Dale gave the highest juice ethanol yield with the lowest lignin and ash.
@highlight Cultivar Umbrella also had a high potential for whole crop bioethanol production.
@highlight All cultivars had bagasse moisture contents which were above the threshold 25 .
