 In this study PlackettBurman designs were applied to evaluate the effects of independent variables pH 5.57.7 temperature 30 44C headspace volume 4060 percentage of inoculum 515 and carbohydrates concentration 315gL

@highlight pH temperature and headspace affected significantly H
@highlight production.
@highlight Organics acids production maximum at pH 6.5 37C 50 headspace 10 inoculum and 9.0 g.L
@highlight total carbohydrates.
@highlight and
@highlight are predominant autochthonous bacteria in banana waste.
@highlight Enzyme genes related to carbohydrate metabolism were abundant in microbial biomass.
