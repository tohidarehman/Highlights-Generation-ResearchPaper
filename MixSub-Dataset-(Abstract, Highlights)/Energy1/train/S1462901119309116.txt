 Small scale fishing communities are expected to adapt to fish catch fluctuations linked to global environmental change . Notwithstanding impacts from severe climate events and overexploitation of fisheries resources can compromise functions and resilience of ecosystems and associated species and thereby jeopardize long term population trend stability and fisheries productivity . To date most assessments and vulnerability studies of fisheries dependent populaces have focused on global regional and national levels while studies at village and community levels where adaptive planning in the context of climate and environmental changes is important are less common . Based on data from official fishery records over a three decadal period and recent interviews with artisanal fishermen along the Tanzanian coast we assessed small scale fisheries with regard to

@highlight Long term records and artisanal fishers congruently confirmed a substantial decline in fish landings in Tanzania.
@highlight Overfishing environmental changes and destruction of habitats were perceived the drivers of fish catch declines.
@highlight Fishers adapt to declining fish stocks by changing their resource use behaviours.
@highlight Most fishers mentioned they will continue fishing in the future even if the fish landings would be further reduced.
@highlight Strategic policies should include fishers perceptions to adapt and cope with ongoing climate and environmental changes.
