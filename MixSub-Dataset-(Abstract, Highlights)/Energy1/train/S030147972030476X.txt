 This study combines electrocoagulation and cyanobacteria based cultivation for the two step treatment of brewery wastewater with the aim to develop a viable alternative to conventional activated sludge technology . The first step applied EC as a pretreatment method using different electrode materials to remove color and some pollutant load from the BW . After 30min of EC treatment decolorization of BW exceeded 80 for both electrode materials and a 100 reduction of total suspended solids was achieved . In the second step the electrochemically pretreated BW was used as substrate for a cyanobacteria based cultivation . After 15 days of cultivation total biomass concentrations reached 525.0mgL

@highlight Electrocoagulation effectively removes suspended solids that cause turbidity.
@highlight Cyanobacterial consortium removes most residual organic and inorganic pollutants.
@highlight Electrocoagulation pretreatment with iron electrodes promotes cyanobacterial growth.
@highlight Cyanobacteria accumulate residual iron aluminum performing effluent bioremediation.
@highlight Biomass is a potential bioethanol feedstock due to its high carbohydrate content.
