 In this research ammonia evaporation capacity under atmospheric and vacuum pressure conditions as well as distillation capacity of different concentrations of landfill leachates were evaluated . Simple evaporation and vacuum pressure evaporation tests showed high NH

@highlight High ammonia recovery rates can be achieved from concentrated landfill leachate.
@highlight Vacuum pressure has small effect on ammonia recovery from concentrated leachate.
@highlight Process achieved high ammonia recovery with low evaporated leachate quantity .
@highlight Ammonium nitrogen concentration in the distillate was over 100g L.
