 In an attempt to improve cost effectiveness it has become increasingly popular to adapt wildlife crossing structures to enable people to also use them for safe passage across roads . However the required needs of humans and wildlife may conflict resulting in a structure that does not actually provide the perceived improvement in cost effectiveness but instead a reduction in conservation benefits . For example lighting within crossing structures for human safety at night may reduce use of the structure by nocturnal wildlife thus contributing to barrier and mortality effects of roads rather than mitigating them .

@highlight Insectivorous bats tend to avoid lit underpasses.
@highlight Artificial light at night in underpasses reduces their effectiveness as crossing structures.
@highlight Artificial light at night likely exacerbates the susceptibility of bats to road mortality and barrier effects.
@highlight If underpasses are to improve wildlife connectivity we recommend not lighting them.
