 We use a discrete choice experiment to investigate the willingness to accept a sustainability standard by German farmers . We also evaluate how attributes in standard design increase acceptance . The estimation of a latent class logit model results in two groups of farmers differentiated with respect to attitude risk perception age education and previous participation in agri environmental schemes . However all respondents prefer to use the EU s Integrated Administration and Control System based data and a standard linked to AES . These findings suggest valuable insights for the design or revision of sustainability standards as part of the implementation of the European CAP in line with the European Union s CAP proposal for 20212027 .
