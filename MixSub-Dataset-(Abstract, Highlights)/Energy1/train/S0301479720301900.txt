 Vegetation Filters can be a sustainable solution to treat wastewater and to recover resources such as nutrients water and biomass from small municipalities and isolated dwellings . However under certain conditions the leakage of nutrients especially of nitrate can represent a limitation . The addition of two sustainable soil amendments woodchips and biochar has been tested as a strategy to improve nutrient attenuation in VFs increasing sorption sites and microbial activity .

@highlight Two soil amendments are tested in lab to improve COD P and N attenuation in VFs.
@highlight Woodchips incorporate biodegradable and non biodegradable OM reducing COD removal.
@highlight P removal is high in soil and neither woodchips nor biochar improves attenuation.
@highlight N is only attenuated in soil with woodchip by denitrification thanks to extra OM.
@highlight Biochar increases sorption but it is a minor process in COD P and N attenuation.
