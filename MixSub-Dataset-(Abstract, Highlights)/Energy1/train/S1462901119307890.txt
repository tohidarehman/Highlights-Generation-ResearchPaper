 The textile industry presents one of the most threatening patterns of production concerning the global environmental impact . In this article we investigated the textile fiber composition of women s clothing in the retail trade of Santos through information read on the labels during July 2017 and January 2018 in three types of stores department popular and thrift stores . The inspected garments consisted mainly of polyester viscose and cotton fibers although fibers such as elastane polyamide and acrylic were eventually present as fabric complements . We calculate clothes ecological footprints by multiplying the fibers proportions by their sustainability notes and adapt the results to the current Brazilian labeling system . We did not detect ecological footprints differences in types of stores nor seasons of the year . There was predominance of clothes with a high ecological footprint . Exposure of the ecological footprint to clothing labels can influence consumer purchasing decisions and encourage the development of more sustainable products . Thus we propose the application of the labeling system as an environmental management tool for the Brazilian fashion sector .
