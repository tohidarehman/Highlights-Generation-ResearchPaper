 The purpose of this study is to investigate the composition and structural changes of aspen and fir barks for thermochemical transformation and to determine the electrical capacity of the obtained carbonized barks . Significant differences of the structural and current voltage characteristics of carbonized barks were revealed . The carbonized product from aspen bark mainly consists of the amorphous carbon and the crystalline phase of calcium hydroxide the product from fir bark consists of amorphous crystalline carbon .

@highlight The structure and electrical capacity were studied for the carbonization of bark.
@highlight Distribution and content of ash in bark affect the electrical capacity of charcoal.
@highlight Specific capacity depends on the breed of bark temperature and sweep rate.
