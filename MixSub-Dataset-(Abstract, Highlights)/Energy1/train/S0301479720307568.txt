 Nowadays the production of green transportation fuels is essential for a healthy life and environment . Effective and complete removal of organosulfur recalcitrant compounds from fuel oils is crucial to meet the stringent requirements of sulfur standards . However the industry s solution is not effective in the removal of complex sulfur heterocyclic hydrocarbons . Thus the development of more efficient and ecofriendly sustainable desulfurization methods is critical as either an alternative or a complement to HDS foreseeing the production of ultra low sulfur fuels . Among the desulfurization techniques available microbial desulfurization of organosulfur hydrocarbons is attracting great attention . BDS is carried out at mild operation conditions making it energetically cheaper and more ecofriendly since it does not require hydrogen and produces far less greenhouse gases emission than HDS . In this context the behavior of
