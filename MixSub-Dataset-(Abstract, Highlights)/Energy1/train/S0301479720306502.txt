 Integrated fixed film activated sludge process is considered as one of the leading edge processes that provides a sustainable solution for wastewater treatment . IFAS was introduced as an advancement of the moving bed biofilm reactor by integrating the attached and the suspended growth systems . IFAS offers advantages over the conventional activated sludge process such as reduced footprint enhanced nutrient removal complete nitrification longer solids retention time and better removal of anthropogenic composites . IFAS has been recognized as an attractive option as stated from the results of many pilot and full scales studies . Generally IFAS achieves 90 removals for combined chemical oxygen demand and ammonia improves sludge settling properties and enhances operational stability . Recently developed IFAS reactors incorporate frameworks for either methane production energy generation through algae or microbial fuel cells . This review details the recent development in IFAS with the focus on the pilot and full scale applications . The microbial community analyses of IFAS biofilm and floc are underlined along with the special emphasis on organics and nitrogen removals as well as the future research perspectives .
