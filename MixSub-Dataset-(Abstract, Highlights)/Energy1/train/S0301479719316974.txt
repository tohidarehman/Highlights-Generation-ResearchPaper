 Aquaponics the combined rearing of fish and hydroponic horticulture has great potential for sustainable food production . Despite increasing research and investments in commercial scale systems aquaponics is not yet a successful industry and most businesses report negative returns . Aquaponic produce is thought to contain added value to the consumer and the environment . As most consumers are unaware of aquaponics and their benefits little is known of its potential market . The present study addresses this gap by analysing willingness to consume aquaponic produce at different price levels in Israel and Australia . We used econometric tools to study the effects of pricing and other factors on revenues in each country . Cluster analysis was used to define groups of potential consumers . The results indicate that 1730 of the population in both Israel and Australia would prefer to consume aquaponic produce once informed of their added value . Revenues at a given premium would be higher in Israel than in Australia and higher for a leafy green than for fish . Different segments of the population differed in their willingness to consume aquaponic produce as well as in their stated motivations when purchasing food . Conclusions highlight the importance of case specific research on consumer preferences and economic considerations preceding commercial investment in aquaponics .

@highlight Commercial aquaponics is restricted by insufficient economic development.
@highlight Israeli and Australian consumers are willing to pay a premium for aquaponic produce.
@highlight Assessing aquaponics price sensitivity depends on both culture and product.
@highlight Maximising revenues calls for price decrease in Australia and increase in Israel.
