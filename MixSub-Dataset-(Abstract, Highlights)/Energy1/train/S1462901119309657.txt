 In different parts of the world a variety of initiatives are being implemented to promote water innovation . This paper explores the role of virtual incubators in fostering water related innovations in Africa using the case of VIA Water a Dutch programme that promotes water innovation in African cities . Virtual incubators operate and provide their services primarily online . The results of this study confirm the additionality and disruptive nature of virtual incubators . In virtue of the gaps they are likely to fill in the innovation systems for water these incubators can be an effective policy instrument for fostering water related innovations in Africa . However given their limitation to perform some functions in local innovation systems virtual water incubators should be used along with other support mechanisms . The paper concludes that to realise their full potential water innovation support programmes must be locally embedded and target at least three levels the micro mezzo and macro levels . Only then can they attract full recognition and significantly influence the performance of water innovation systems .
