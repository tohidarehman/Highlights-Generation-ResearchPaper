 is an autotrophic acetogen also able to utilize xylose as a carbon source . Here we evaluated this organism s industrially relevant capability since the transformation of sugars derived from lignocellulosic materials to biofuels is of great interest . Initially the organism was challenged with different initial xylose levels to determine xylose utilization and maximum inhibitory concentrations for

@highlight is a candidate for lignocellulosic xylose conversion.
@highlight Growth associated pH conditions increase
@highlight consumption of xylose.
@highlight Unlike other acetogens 
@highlight exhibits greater sensitivity to low pH.
@highlight Adjustment of pH enabled consumption of xylose at levels found in lignocellulose.
@highlight pH adjustment resulted in improved overall ethanol yields from xylose.
