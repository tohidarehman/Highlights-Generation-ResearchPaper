 This paper addresses the cyber threat detection and mitigation in a DC microgrid distributed control system . Due to the deployment of communication and control technologies a DC microgrid resembles a cyber physical system that is highly exposed to cyber threats . A cyber threat detection technique is proposed that relies on a Kullback Liebler divergence based criterion . This criterion detects the misbehavior of a compromised Distributed Energy Resource control unit and consequently calculates an interior belief factor and communicates it with its neighboring DERs to inform them of the reliability of its outgoing information . Moreover DERs calculate an exterior belief value related to the trustworthiness of the received information from neighbors . The cyber threat mitigation technique at each DER utilizes the neighbors interior belief and its own calculated exterior belief value for neighboring DERs to slow down and eventually mitigate attacks . The proposed approach requires a communication network with mild graph connectivity . A typical medium voltage DC microgrid system is simulated to verify the validity of proposed distributed cyber secure control scheme . It is shown that using the proposed cyber secure approach the voltage of a critical bus of microgrid is well regulated and DERs can successfully distinguish cyber attacks from legitimate events .
