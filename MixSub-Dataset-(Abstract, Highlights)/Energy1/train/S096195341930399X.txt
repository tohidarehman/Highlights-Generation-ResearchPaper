 Biomass is a key element within the Europe s Bioeconomy Strategy . This paper aims at contributing to a better knowledge of the evolution and current state of biomass trade in Spain by adopting a raw material equivalent approach . Instead of measuring trade flows in actual physical quantities this approach expresses international trade flows in terms of the raw material needed to produce the traded products . The results obtained show that while raw material input of biomass increased by 3560 thousand tonnes over the period 20082016 raw material consumption decreased by 15 086 thousand tonnes . This is explained by the different pace of growth registered by raw material equivalent of exports and of imports while raw material equivalent of exports rose from 49 485 thousand tonnes in 2008 to 68 131 thousand tonnes in 2016 recording a double digit growth of 38 the increase in raw material equivalent of imports was considerably lower from 64 560 thousand tonnes to 66 106 thousand tonnes an increase of 2 . By categories biomass from agriculture was the main driver of overall trade of biomass . Two groupings deserve special mention fodder crops which accounted for one quarter of raw material equivalent of exports and cereals which represented almost one third of raw material equivalent of imports in 2016 .

@highlight Raw material input of biomass increased by 3560 thousand tonnes.
@highlight Raw material consumption of biomass diminished by 15 086 thousand tonnes.
@highlight Raw material equivalent of exports grew faster than that of imports 38 compared to 2 .
@highlight Fodder crops accounted for one quarter of raw material equivalent of exports.
@highlight Cereals represented almost one third of raw material equivalent of imports.
