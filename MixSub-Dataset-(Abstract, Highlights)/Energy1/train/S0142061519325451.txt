 The relevant integration of wind power into the grid has involved a remarkable impact on power system operation mainly in terms of security and reliability due to the inherent loss of the rotational inertia as a consequence of such new generation units decoupled from the grid . In these weak scenarios the contribution of wind turbines to frequency control is considered as a suitable solution to improve system stability . With regard to frequency response analysis and grid stability most contributions introduce wind control discuss generation tripping for isolated power systems under arbitrary power imbalance conditions . Frequency response is then analyzed for hypothetical imbalances usually ranged between 5 and 20 and assuming averaged energy schedule scenarios . In this paper a more realistic framework is proposed to evaluate frequency deviations by including high wind power integration . With this aim unit commitment schemes and frequency load shedding are considered in this work for frequency response analysis under high wind power penetration . The Gran Canaria Islands isolated power system is used for evaluation purposes . Results provide a variety of influences from wind frequency control depending not only on the wind power integration but also the generation units under operation the rotational inertia reductions as well as the available reserves from each resource aspects that have not been addressed previously in the specific literature to evaluate frequency excursions under high wind power integration .
