 Transactive energy is a control technique that uses market mechanisms to achieve desired control objectives . Several simulation studies and field demonstrations were carried out in recent years but all focused on small scale systems and purpose built simplified models which are not always capable of pointing out all the advantages and shortcomings of transactive energy methods . This work describes a co simulation framework built on a hierarchical control architecture that allows for conducting studies on the impacts of a very large scale deployment of transactive energy . The hierarchical transactive control architecture adopted in this work helps with alleviating computation and communication burden to facilitate a more effective large scale real time market operation among device level resources and the system level operators . The co simulation framework is evaluated using off the shelf simulators on an integrated power system model of unprecedented scale composed of the Western Electricity Coordination Council transmission system with tens of thousands of distribution systems deployed with flexible device level distributed energy resources .

@highlight A framework for evaluating large scale transactive energy systems is developed.
@highlight The simulated use case comprises of the WECC system with 35 000 distribution networks.
@highlight The TE mechanism could curtain 5 MW of systems peak load and reduce the peak LMP.
@highlight The proposed dispatch strategy accurately matches the ISO allocated quantity.
@highlight The spatial differences in DERs and their impacts on the bulk market were analyzed.
