 The conveyance of wastewater in sewer pipes can be severely limited by the growth of plant roots which can be controlled with herbicides . However adding herbicides in sewer lines may affect downstream biological wastewater treatment processes . The effects of three herbicides on the mortality of cottonwood tree roots and on downstream biological nitrification were determined . The results showed that Triclopyr achieved the highest root mortality followed by Penoxsulam and Dithiopyr . At concentrations used at the point of application in sewer pipes all herbicides caused nitrification inhibition and reduction in organic carbon removal in activated sludge . However no inhibition was observed at the more diluted concentrations approximately equal to levels that may reach the wastewater treatment facility . Overall Triclopyr appears to be the best performing herbicide with the highest root kill .

@highlight Effect of three herbicides on root intrusion in sewer lines was investigated.
@highlight Triclopyr showed high shoot damage to the upper portion of the plants.
@highlight Root regrowth was observed in plants treated with Dithiopyr.
@highlight Penoxsulam achieved acceptable root kill with no upper plant damage.
@highlight Herbicides did not inhibit nitrification at diluted concentrations.
