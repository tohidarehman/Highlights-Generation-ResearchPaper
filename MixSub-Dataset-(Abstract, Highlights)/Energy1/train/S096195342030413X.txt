 The key technical issues for establishing an economical and advanced deoxygenation process of vegetable oil for producting the diesel like hydrocarbons are to develop the low cost non sulfided heterogeneous catalytic systems with good performance . Herein we report two facile strategies for preparing Co based catalysts in an effort to explore the highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for the deoxygenation of laurate ester . Interestingly the deoxygenation paths can be regulated by altering the synthesized methods of the Co based catalysts . For example the Co MOF 700 catalyst prepared via pyrolysis of one cobalt metal organic framework H

@highlight Two novel Co based catalytic systems for efficiently and selectively catalyze the deoxygenation of methyl laurate.
@highlight The hydrogenolysis pathways of methyl laurate can be regulated by these catalysts.
@highlight Co MOF 700 favors the decarboxylation decarbonylation pathway while Co ZSM 5 prefers to the hydrodeoxygenation path.
@highlight The Co MOF 700 catalyst shows excellent cycle performance.
