 Commercial kitchen wastewaters are typically strong organic and fat rich effluents often identified as major contributors to fatberg formation and associated blockages in sewers . Experimental trials were done using synthetic kitchen wastewater to understand the complex reactions involved in microbial remediation in grease traps separators prior discharge in sewers . The principle organic components were varied using ranges observed in a previous study on real kitchen wastewater characterisation . A model bacterium

@highlight FOG biodegradation rates varied with wastewater composition between 5 and 26mg l h.
@highlight FOG removal decreased from 24 to 10mg l h when starch was substitute with glucose.
@highlight FOG removal was inversely related to initial COD N.
@highlight FOG removal started in the stationary phase of bacterial growth in all wastewaters.
