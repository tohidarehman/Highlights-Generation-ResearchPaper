 The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of kraft lignin on the physicomechanical qualities of briquettes produced with sugarcane bagasse and on the chemical characteristics of the bio oil obtained at different temperatures via slow pyrolysis . The ratios of kraft lignin to the sugarcane bagasse mass were 0 10 25 and 50 . The briquetting was performed at 140C temperature and at a pressure of 17MPa for 8min . The physicomechanical characteristics such as bulk density longitudinal expansion and compressive strength were determined . The combustibility of the briquettes was tested and the briquette slow pyrolysis was performed in 300C 400C and 500C for 1h . The results showed the influence of kraft lignin on the bulk density and on the mechanical strength for compression . In the combustibility test was obtained higher temperatures and more uniform burning in the briquettes with addition of lignin . In the bio oil composition obtained via pyrolysis at 500C the highest yields of phenolic compounds were obtained . The kraft lignin is a raw material with the potential to be used as both a binder in compressed products and an additive for the production of bio oil with valuable phenolic compounds .

@highlight The sugarcane bagasse with kraft lignin resulted in high quality briquettes.
@highlight Kraft lignin increase the physicomechanical and energy quality of the briquettes.
@highlight The increase of lignin in briquettes promoted more uniform combustion.
@highlight The addition of lignina resulted in increased functional groups of bio oil.
