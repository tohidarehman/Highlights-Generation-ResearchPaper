 Local energy transition processes are complex socio technical transitions requiring careful study . The use of System Dynamics in modelling and analyzing local energy transitions is especially suitable given the characteristics of SD . Our aim is to systematically categorize the different ways SD is used and useful to scrutinize local energy transitions and to see if we can discern any common themes that can be useful to researchers looking to scrutinize local energy transitions using SD . The study is exploratory in nature with peer reviewed journal and conference articles analyzed using content analysis . The six categories on which the articles are analyzed are the sector the article studies the transition that is studied in the article the modelling depth in the article the objective of the article the justification for using SD provided in the article and the levels of interaction with local . Our findings show most of the local energy transitions have been studied using simulatable Stock and Flow Diagrams in SD methodology . The important sectors in the energy field are represented in terms of SD modelling of local energy transitions including electricity transport district heating etc . Most of the local energy transitions scrutinized by SD in the articles have descriptive objectives with some prescriptive and just one evaluative objective . In terms of justification for using SD provided by the articles analyzed in this study we found four major themes along which the justifications that were provided . They are

@highlight Local energy transitions modelled using SD are analyzed.
@highlight Most studies using SD have descriptive objectives.
@highlight Capability of handling dynamicity is the strongest reason for using SD to model local energy transitions.
