 The extended grading capacitor for multi break circuit breaker is a cost effective method to suppress secondary arc . Since the integration of GC alter the topology of the system the existing adaptive auto reclosure scheme should be changed . Considering the characteristics of line voltage waveforms under various faulty conditions a novel adaptive single phase reclosing scheme is proposed based on an improved variational mode decomposition and energy entropy . The voltage signal extracted from capacitive voltage transformer is decomposed into a series of finite bandwidth intrinsic mode functions and then the energy entropy of each IMF component is computed . To avoid modal mixing the concept of quality factor is raised . In the case of permanent fault the natural component of the voltage attenuates fast due to the continuous discharge through the fault point . As time goes such component approaches zero and the total voltage becomes more smooth and regular . The EE value also decreases gradually . The EE value is considerably large for the transient fault due to the repetitive re strike of electric arc and the EE value has an oscillating trend . The fault type can be distinguished by setting a reasonable threshold . The performance of the proposed method is almost not affected by the installation mode of shunt reactor bank the fault location the shunt compensation degree fault resistance etc . Both the theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can quickly and accurately identify the fault type .
