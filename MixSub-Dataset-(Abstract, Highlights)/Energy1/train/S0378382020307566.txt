 In this study we examine the chemical stability of two disazo dyes namely Solvent Red 19 and 23 under simulated conditions . Both dyes are considered to be chemically stable under normal exploitation conditions and therefore are used extensively as excise duty components that enable a rapid visual verification of the tax levels that were imposed on fuel products as well as identifying fuel usage . However the results from this study confirmed that the colour of the samples that had been fortified with either SR 19 or SR 23 fades under the influence of external conditions such as UV A irradiation and temperature over time . The UV A irradiation was the dominant factor that was responsible for the colour of the samples to fade in two designed experiments that were carried out independently for two model systems . The analysis of the UV Vis and fluorescence spectra as well as the interpretation of the changes that were observed in the chromatographic profiles provided substantial evidence that the colour fading was caused by the photodegradation of the disazo dyes which also occurs in non polar media including fuel products . SR 19 is more stable than SR 23 .

@highlight Solvent Red 19 and 23 are unstable when exposed to UV A irradiation.
@highlight Solvent Red 19 and 23 undergo photoinduced degradation.
@highlight Solvent Red 19 is more stable than Solvent Red 23.
@highlight Recommended spectrophotometric method cannot settle the fuel counterfeiting problem.
