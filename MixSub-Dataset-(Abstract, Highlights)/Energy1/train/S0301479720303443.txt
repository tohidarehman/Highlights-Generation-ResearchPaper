 In this research a unique continuous electrochemical cell was designed and applied for the disinfection of groundwater and simultaneous Cr reduction and Cr precipitation . Discarded cigarette filters were utilized as an efficient bed for palladium nanoparticles immobilization located between porous anode and cathode made of graphite felt . The characterization of the bed was performed using FE SEM EDS BET and FT IR analysis . The results confirmed the distribution of palladium nanoparticles on the surface of DCFs . The proposed design for electrochemical cell obviated the need to divide the anolyte and catholyte because the anode was located at the outlet of the cell thereby avoiding the reaction between hydrogen radicals produced on the surface of PdNPs and oxygen and chlorine produced in the anode . The hydrogen gas produced in the cathode was converted to hydrogen radicals acting as the most prominent species for the reduction . Hydroxide ions produced in the cathode increased the pH of the solution between electrodes resulting in the precipitation of Cr with an efficiency of 96 . Furthermore free chlorine at the concentration of 1mgL
