 This research assesses the transition of a fossil fuel based electricity production jurisdiction to a renewable based electricity jurisdiction through an extensive scenario analysis . This fills a knowledge gap where a wide range of fossil to renewable electricity generation pathways is compared within a single analysis framework . To conduct this study a novel data intensive electricity system model was developed with the Long range Energy Alternatives Planning system and applied to evaluate alternative electricity generation mix scenarios to the year 2050 . A case study for Alberta a fossil fuels based province in Canada was conducted . A total of 382 scenarios were analyzed considering different renewable pathways and varying key uncertain future conditions . The greenhouse gas emission abatement and marginal greenhouse gas abatement costs of each scenario were evaluated and compared . Several renewable based scenarios resulted in significant greenhouse gas abatement at lower costs than the fossil fuel based business as usual scenario . The maximum greenhouse gas abatement possible at a net cost reduction compared to the business as usual scenario was found through a specific combination of wind hydro and solar power which resulted in over a 90 reduction from 2005 emission levels at 1.8 t of carbon dioxide equivalent abated . The results of this study provide policy insight for jurisdictions transitioning away from fossil fuel based electricity to renewables .
