 Sugarcane bagasse residue of first generation ethanol fermentation is a rich substrate for the second generation ethanol . However the processes used to release sugars from such material produce inhibitory compounds . The present study aims to elucidate the effects of inhibitory compounds present in hemicellulosic hydrolysates on the yeast

@highlight Investigation of hemicellulosic hydrolysates inhibitory compounds effect
@highlight fermentation.
@highlight Fermentation strategies adapted strains and the increase of initial cells concentration to overcome toxic compounds in hemicellulosic hydrolysates.
@highlight Xylose uptake was more inhibited than glucose uptake for both yeasts.
@highlight Increasing the initial concentration of cells improved the performance of yeasts against inhibitors.
