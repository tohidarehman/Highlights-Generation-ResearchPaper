 Although urbanization has been a fundamental feature of economic development increasingly important concerns about environmental quality have led to a wide ranging debate about the concept of urban sustainability . In this paper we examine how living in urban areas affects people s perceptions of two specific aspects of environmental quality namely air pollution and noise . Specifically for every country we develop an indicator that is based on these perceptions . The findings confirm that among European countries the effects of urban agglomerations on the households perceptions of environmental quality reflect a certain degree of heterogeneity . The proposed indicator provides new evidence about previously unexplored interactions between perceptions and macro economic factors such as income inequality public spending on the environment and public debt . Through a comparison with an objective measure of the exposure of urban inhabitants to noise and air pollution we find support for the intuition that subjective perceptions can be employed jointly with objective indicators to obtain full and comprehensive knowledge of the quality of urban environments .

@highlight We propose a perception based indicator of air pollution and noise.
@highlight The subjective indicator shows some heterogeneity across European countries.
@highlight In more unequal countries the environmental impact of cities is more severe.
@highlight Public debt is a serious constraint to improvement in urban environmental quality.
@highlight The transmission channels of taxation on environmental externalities are weak.
