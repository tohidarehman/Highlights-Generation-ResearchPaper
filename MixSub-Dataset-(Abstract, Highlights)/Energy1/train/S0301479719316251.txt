 The Mediterranean aquaculture has been developed mostly in brackish environment in inactive coastal salt production areas . This study aims to utilise Technosols made with aquaculture sediments for

@highlight Plants cultivated in unamended sediments irrigated with brackish water succumbed.
@highlight Technosols made with organic inorganic wastes improved the sediments properties.
@highlight The 180g kg of amendments application were not sufficient for plant development.
@highlight Plants grew in Technosols with 360g kg of amendments under salty water irrigation.
@highlight Aquaculture sediments can be used for plant cultivation through Technosols design.
