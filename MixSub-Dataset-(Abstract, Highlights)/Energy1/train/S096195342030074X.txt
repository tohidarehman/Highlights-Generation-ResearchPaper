 Biomass conversion into biofuels and biogas is a promising way for power and heat generation . Lately research has focused on the production of biomethane based on biomass gasification followed by methanation as an alternative to fossil natural gas . The challenge of this process remains in the intensive gas cleaning and required tar removal . In order to study tar removal from the producer gas downstream biomass gasification solidvapor and liquidvapor equilibrium must be known for different tar concentrations ranging between 0.001 and 100g.Nm
