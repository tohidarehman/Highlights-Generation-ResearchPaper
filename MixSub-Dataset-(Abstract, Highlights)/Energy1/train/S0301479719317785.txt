 This work is focused on utilizing the solid waste generated from steel industry for the fabrication of porous ceramic membrane from Linz Donawitz slag . Membranes were fabricated using uniaxial method sintered at three different temperatures like 650C 850C and 950C . Membranes fabricated with raw LD slag gave a highly basic filtrate . In contrast with this issue LD slag was modified using acetic acid and CO

@highlight Ceramic membranes are fabricated using LD slag obtained from steel industry.
@highlight Acetic acid and CO
@highlight are used to neutralize LD slag.
@highlight LD slag based ceramic membranes are prepared using uniaxial method.
@highlight Pore size of prepared MF membranes are of 3.6m8.3m.
@highlight A hybrid method was used to treat cold roll mill wastewater generated from steel industry.
