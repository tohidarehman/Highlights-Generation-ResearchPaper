 Stakeholders are critical environmental managers in human dominated landscapes . In some contexts stakeholders can be forced to personally act following their own observations and risk perception instead of science recommendation . In particular biological invasions need rapid control actions to reduce potential socio ecological impacts while science based risk assessments are rather complex and time delayed . Although they can lead to important detrimental effects on biodiversity potential time delayed disconnections between stakeholders action and science recommendations are rarely studied . Using the case study of western European beekeepers controlling the invasive Asian hornet

@highlight Current global changes can lead to time lags between science and action.
@highlight We analyse stakeholder actions and how they evolved in science disconnection.
@highlight Stakeholder actions are disconnected to time delayed science recommendations.
@highlight Science disconnected actions impact local biodiversity.
@highlight Improving risk communication to biological invasion is urgently required.
