 The removal of arsenic from water by adsorption is currently hindered by the elevated cost of conventional adsorbent materials . To overcome this limit an innovative iron coated adsorbent was produced by hydrothermal carbonization of olive pomace an inexpensive byproduct of the olive oil production . Hydrothermal carbonization experiments were performed starting from olive pomace dispersions in solutions with acidic neutral and alkaline pH in presence and absence of FeCl

@highlight The effect of pH on hydrothermal carbonization of olive pomace was studied.
@highlight Acidic pH enhanced carbonization efficiency but yielded unsatisfactory Fe coating.
@highlight Alkaline pH improved Fe coating but reduced adsorbent stability in water.
@highlight The hydrochar synthetized under alkaline conditions adsorbed up to 4.1mg g of As.
@highlight A two stage process was proposed yielding satisfactory stability.
