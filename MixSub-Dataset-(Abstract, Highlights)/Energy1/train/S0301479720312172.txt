 Sustainable land management practices can be suitable vehicles to simultaneously address the causes and consequences of land degradation desertification and climate change in land managed systems . Here we assess the potential of a variety of sustainable land management practices that beyond addressing specific and local issues assist in tackling Mediterranean Basin wide land use challenges . With this work we aim to highlight those options that simultaneously promote local and regional Basin wide adaptation . To do that we developed a novel multi objective assessment that evaluates the effectiveness of 104 practices adopted within the Mediterranean Basin and documented in the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies global database . Results indicate that agroforestry and green covers in perennial woody crops can promote multiple ecosystem services while addressing climate change adaptation . We further argue that these two practices together with reforestation assist in regulating the hydrological cycle of the Basin and in maintaining its multifunctional landscape . Lastly we reflect on potential biophysical and socio economic barriers and opportunities associated with the implementation of the three practices . Our approach provides a Basin wide integrated view that facilitates the coordination of sustainable management strategies across the Mediterranean region .
