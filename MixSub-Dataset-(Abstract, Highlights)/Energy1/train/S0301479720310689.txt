 Fragile states index reflects a country s ability to maintain stability . The main objective of this study is to analyze how climate change influences fragile states index . Firstly we aim to modify the fragile states index . We devise an index system of climate shocks which measures not climate change but also governance capacity . Meanwhile a three class index system is formulated to measure fragility of states . Afterwards we utilize MCS to modify the initial index system based on multiplication model . Furthermore the weights of MCS are obtained by Delphi method while the weights in the third level of MCFS are gotten by CRITIC Weighting Model . The weights in the second level of MCFS then are determined by Entropy Weighting Model and Group Making Method . Finally the classification standard of measuring fragility of states is calculated through System Clustering Model . And then Bangladesh is chosen to show the variation tendency of fragility based on the data between 2000 and 2015 . To further predict the fragility of Bangladesh Cascaded Neural Network Model is adopted to predict MCFS from 2016 to 2030 . Eventually we determine and define tipping points into 2 typesamelioration tipping points and deterioration tipping points . The result show that Bangladesh reached the deterioration tipping points in 2016 .
