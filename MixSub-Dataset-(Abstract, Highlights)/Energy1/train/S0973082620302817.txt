 Reducing the burden of household air pollution could be achieved with exclusive adoption of cleaner fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas . However we lack understanding of how much LPG is required to support exclusive use and how household characteristics affect this quantity . This paper used data from 90 participants in the Cardiopulmonary outcomes and Household Air Pollution trial in Puno Peru who received free LPG deliveries for one year . Households with a mean of four members that cooked nearly exclusively with LPG used an average of 19.1

@highlight Study participants in Puno used on average 19.1
@highlight None
@highlight kg of LPG per month.
@highlight LPG use was greater with pig dog ownership wealth family size and LPG vouchers.
@highlight Participants used LPG and biomass similarly but more often prepared lunch with LPG.
@highlight The current subsidy in Peru covers only 25 of rural residents LPG needs.
@highlight Programs must provide enough fuel for exclusive use to achieve potential benefits.
