 Methods of removing phosphate from wastewater with a low phosphate concentration are of great environmental significance . In this study immobilized beads were prepared by entrapping modified bentonite powder in calcium alginate and the potential of the beads for phosphate removal from wastewater was investigated . The effects of pH and initial phosphate concentration were also examined in batch experiments with Al NaBT CA beads . The optimum pH value for phosphate removal by Al NaBT CA beads was pH 3 . In addition a high initial phosphate concentration promoted phosphate adsorption . Adsorption kinetics showed that the adsorption of phosphate using beads followed a pseudo second order kinetic model

@highlight Al modified NaCl activated bentonite was entrapped in Ca alginate as an adsorbent.
@highlight The maximum adsorption capacity of phosphate was 15.77mg g for entrapped beads.
@highlight Entrapment modified bentonite in alginate beads can separate easily from wastewater.
@highlight Entrapment beads have an applicability for treating real phosphate wastewater.
