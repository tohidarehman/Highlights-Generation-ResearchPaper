 With the rapid development of spacecraft such as rocket it is increasingly important to develop high energy and sustainable fuels . Biofuels synthesized from biomass derivatives provide great convenience for sustainable development . In this work we reported a route for synthesis of high energy cyclopropane bio kerosene by cyclopropanation of myrcene with zinc carbenoid . The reaction conditions including reaction time reaction temperature solvent and molar ratio were optimized . Finally a tricyclic cyclopropane bio kerosene was synthesized with 69.8 yield under optimum conditions . Importantly this bio kerosene possesses a high specific impulse of 328.25s much better than the commercial rocket kerosene RP 1 as well as a high net heat value of 43.4MJ kg and good low temperature properties .

@highlight High performance rocket bio kerosene is synthesized from cyclopropanation of bio derived myrcene.
@highlight The yield is higher than 69 through simple and efficient cyclopropanation reaction.
@highlight Bio kerosene has higher density 0.85 g mL vs 0.81 g mL and lower freezing point 70 C vs 41 C than RP 1.
@highlight Bio kerosene has higher specific impulse than RP 1 328.25 s vs 324.73 s .
