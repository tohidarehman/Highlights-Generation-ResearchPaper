 The increasing use of pharmaceutical products also increases their release in aquatic environment . These contaminants are considered emerging pollutants and induce adverse ecological and human health effects . The antidiabetic metformin is one example that has been detected in the aquatic environment at unusual concentrations . This fact indicates that conventional wastewater treatment is inefficient on eliminating this compound . Here we show that metformin can be effectively removed from water by photocatalysis . We found the optimised conditions for pH and concentration of catalyst on the photocatalytic process . TiO

@highlight Metformin is treated by photocatalysis with TiO
@highlight ZrO
@highlight Metformin and the intermediates were identified through UV Vis spectrophotometry analysis.
@highlight TiO
@highlight ZrO
@highlight is more efficient than P25 on the degradation of metformin.
@highlight TiO
@highlight ZrO
@highlight degraded almost 50 of metformin after 30min of UV irradiation.
@highlight The treated wastewater was analysed through phyto toxicity tests.
