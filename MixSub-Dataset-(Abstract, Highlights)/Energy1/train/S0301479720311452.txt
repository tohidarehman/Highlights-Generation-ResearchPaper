 China is experiencing unprecedented industrialization and urbanization which promotes the rapid growth of iron resource consumption and in use stock . The material flow analysis model and the average use life method were applied to analyze China s iron in use stock and the IIUS reached 7.07 billion tons in 2016 in the reference scenario . Three driving factors of the intensity of IIUS were analyzed . Among them the per capita IIUS was rising and it was 5.11t cap in 2016 in the reference scenario . In addition the per capita crude steel output has stabilized which was 0.58t cap in 2016 . The intensity of crude steel use was declining and showed the inverted U shape . The decoupling indicator was applied to analyze the relationship between IIUS and economic growth . The decoupling of IIUS from economic growth was later than that of actual iron consumption and the IIUS did not decoupling from economic growth in recent years . The actual iron consumption has continued to decoupling from economic growth since 2010 and the decoupling indicator peaked at 1.76 in 2015 . The future per capita IIUS was predicted in different scenario and the relationship between future IIUS and GDP was analyzed . The per capita IIUS will reach saturation in 20302040 and the intensity of IIUS also conforms to the inverted U shape .

@highlight China s actual iron consumption and iron in use stock IIUS were analyzed.
@highlight The driving factors of the intensity of IIUS were quantified.
@highlight The decoupling indicator was first applied to analyze the relationship between IIUS and economic growth.
@highlight China s per capita IIUS will reach saturation in 20302040 in different scenarios.
