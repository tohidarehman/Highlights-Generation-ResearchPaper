 When cropland expansion encroaches on ecological land it seriously affects carbon storage which plays an important role in global climate change . Taking Hubei as the study area this study explored the effects of cropland expansion on carbon storage in both 20002010 and 20102030 in different scenarios by using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade offs model and the LAND System Cellular Automata model for Potential Effects . The results showed that cropland expansion led to a massive loss of carbon storage during 20002010 which is expected to continue during 20102030 in different scenarios . The loss is predicted to be 3.70TgC in the

@highlight Loss of carbon storage caused by cropland expansion is comparable to or greater than that from urban expansion.
@highlight Carbon storage loss caused by cropland expansion is projected to be significantly different in different scenarios.
@highlight The loss of forest and wetland is the main reason for carbon storage loss.
