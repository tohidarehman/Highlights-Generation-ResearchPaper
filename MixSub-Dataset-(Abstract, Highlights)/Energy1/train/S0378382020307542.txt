 Chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling is promising for carbon capture in fossil fuel combustion . Oxygen carriers are the key aspect for the development of CLOU technology . Four Cu based bimetallic OC were prepared by sol gel method in this work . The oxygen release and adsorption behavior of the OC were examined in alternating Ar and air . Chemical looping combustion with both gaseous and char were conducted to investigate the performance of the OC . The oxygen transport capacity remained stable in 20cycles for 80Cu20Mn 40Cu60Fe and 60Cu40Ni but a remarkable decrease was observed for 60Cu40Co . For the CLC tests with gaseous fuel only 80Cu20Mn exhibited stable CO conversion
