 This work investigates the transport behaviour of selected organophosphorus pesticides OPPs through Danube alluvial sediment in the presence of hydrochars and biochars . The investigated hydrochar obtained at three different temperatures originated from sugar beet shreds and

@highlight Organophosphorus pesticides OPPs transport in Danube alluvial sediment was studied.
@highlight Addition of hydrochars biochars increases pesticide retardation 4 to 18 times.
@highlight Biodegradation was confirmed by isolating a OPPs degrading bacterial strain.
@highlight megaterium BD5 was thus isolated from alluvial sediments for the first time.
@highlight The chars and degrading bacteria are effective agents for reducing OPPs mobility.
