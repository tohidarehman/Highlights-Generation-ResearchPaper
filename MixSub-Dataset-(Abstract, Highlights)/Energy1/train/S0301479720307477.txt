 Disinfection using chlorine has paramount importance in the treatment of either drinking water or sewage since it can kill and inhibit all waterborne pathogens but it may result in carcinogenic substances when interacting with organic matter . An eco friendly sol gel process with citrate was used to prepare the nano cubic activated nickel zinc ferrite magnetic nanostructures Ni

@highlight Chlorine as a conventional disinfectant generates by products that could be harmful to health.
@highlight Ni0.6Zn0.4Fe2O4 and Ni0.6Zn0.2Ce0.2Fe2O4 spinal magnetic nanocubes were fabricated.
@highlight The nanocubes are considered as potent antimicrobial against a wide spectrum from bacterial and fungal species.
@highlight The nanocubes can entirely eradicate some waterborne pathogenic bacteria in real sewage.
@highlight The nanocubes are considered an affordable reusable stable and and biocompatible. It also is suitable alternatives to chlorine for sewage disinfection.
