 The research was conducted to evaluate the sludge quality as fertilizer after heavy metal removal by using free nitrous acid FNA HNO

@highlight The levels of Al As and Cd in sludge exceeded Korean criteria.
@highlight Removal of As and Cd met the criteria during free nitrous acid treatment.
@highlight Al of sludge from sewage treatment plant did not decrease down to the criteria.
@highlight The low removal of Al may be related to coagulant put during sludge thickening.
@highlight Free nitrous acid treatment is better for sludge recycling than Fenton like process.
