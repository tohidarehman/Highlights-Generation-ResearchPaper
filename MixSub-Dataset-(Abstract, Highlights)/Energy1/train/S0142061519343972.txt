 This paper introduces a method for the identification of transient stability boundaries in power systems with multidimensional uncertainties . This method uses a parametric space rather than the state space to identify the critical operating states . First different transient stability indices are used to map the state space of system into the index specific parametric spaces . Then these index specific parametric spaces are characterized to identify their practicality and effectiveness to reflect the systems state space information accurately and to quantify uncertainties . Finally the transient stability boundaries are identified using the index specific parametric spaces considering multidimensional uncertainties . The indices studied in this paper are on basis of rotor angle difference transient kinetic energy and transient potential energy . This method is verified using a 16 machine 68 bus computer model of the New England Test System and the New York Power System in MATLAB and DigSILENT environments . The uncertainty in this paper is represented in up to 4 dimensions and is modeled in form of loading conditions and generation dispatch uncertainties . This method is further applicable to higher dimensions and other forms of uncertainties and has the utility for probabilistic studies and predictive analytics .
