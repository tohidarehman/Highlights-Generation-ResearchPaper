 Effective hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose is a crucial step to utilize lignocellulosic biomass for fuels and chemicals . In this study we adopted the simple Blanc chloromethylation of commercially available Amberlyst 15 to fabricate enzyme mimic solid acid for cellulose hydrolysis . The results indicated that the chlorine group in A 15 Cl adsorbed cellulose and particularly oligosaccharides through hydrogen bonding while the sulfonic acid group cleaved the 1 4 glycosidic bonds in cellulose and oligosaccharides . Due to the synergistic effect between the chlorine and sulfonic acid groups A 15 Cl effectively hydrolyzed cellulose in water achieving a 67.2 glucose yield at 170C in 2h . Moreover A 15 Cl can be readily separated from the reaction medium by an 80 mesh screen for reuse at least five times without significant loss of catalytic activity .

@highlight Enzyme mimic solid acid was fabricated by one step Blanc chloromethylation of Amberlyst 15.
@highlight 67.2 glucose yield was obtained for A 15 Cl hydrolyze cellulose at 170C 2h in water.
@highlight The good result is due to the synergistic effect between chlorine and sulfonic acid.
@highlight A 15 Cl was reused at least five times without significant loss of catalytic activity.
