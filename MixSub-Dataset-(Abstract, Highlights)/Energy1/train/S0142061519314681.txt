 Harmonics in single phase systems challenge the performance of quadrature signal generator based phase locked loops . This paper proposes a Luenberger observer based PLL to address the issue . The proposed method enhances the harmonic suppression capability when estimating the fundamental grid voltage thus leading to improved system harmonic rejection robustness . In detail the improvement is enabled by the integrated grid voltage which is mathematically established in this paper . Subsequently the observer is adopted to generate the fundamental grid voltage and its quadrature signal . The resultant two signals for synchronization are highly robust against arbitrary order harmonic disturbances especially for interharmonics and noises . More importantly as the poles of the observer can be designed flexibly fast dynamics and strong harmonic robustness can be ensure for the entire PLL system . Experiments verify the performance of the proposed LO PLL in terms of high harmonic immunity and fast dynamics .

@highlight The LO QSG has a decay rate of 40dB dec at high frequencies for both estimated signals.
@highlight The PLL with the proposed LO QSG has good harmonic robustness.
@highlight The proposed LO QSG is based on linear observer technology.
