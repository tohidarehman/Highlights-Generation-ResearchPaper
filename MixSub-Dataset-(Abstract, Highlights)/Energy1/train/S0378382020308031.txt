 Uniformity of coal and air has always been an important problem in the operation of large scale CFB boilers . The selection of inlet boundary conditions is close related to the simulation accuracy but seldom considered in the previous literatures . In this paper a new method to estimate the distributions of coal supply was proposed which was used as the boundary condition together with the experimental data to carry out combustion simulations on a 600MW supercritical CFB boiler by using the Computational Particle Fluid Dynamics method . The simulation results were validated against the critical measured data including solid concentration gas solid circulation flow rate gas temperature oxygen concentration etc . indicating that the model using the proposed boundary conditions could predict the combustion characteristics more accurately than that with common uniform boundary conditions . Based on the simulation results the influence of air coal distribution on the combustion in the furnace under different loads was investigated a series of non uniform problems were also found and analyzed . The research method and results of this paper can provide meaningful reference for the combustion simulation and operation optimization of large scale CFB boilers .
