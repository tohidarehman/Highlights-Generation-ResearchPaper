 Biomass based ethanol or acetic acid can be produced by fermentation of saccharides following wood hydrolysis . Both high saccharide yield and concentration are essential for achieving an efficient hydrolysis process . However there can be a trade off between yield and concentration during semi flow hot compressed water treatment a candidate for wood hydrolysis . This trade off is because the fast water flow rate is necessary for high saccharide yields but the large amount of water dilutes the produced hydrolysate . In this study we mixed octyl acetate which is a water immiscible solvent during hot compressed water treatment of beech wood . By adding octyl acetate a high flow rate was achieved without increasing the water flow rate and the saccharide concentration was thus improved while suppressing the decrease in saccharide yield . Furthermore lignin derived oligomers which have inhibitory effects on fermentation were removed from hydrolysate because they can dissolve in octyl acetate . We performed acetic acid fermentation using the obtained hydrolysate and found that the fermentability was markedly improved compared with the hydrolysate obtained without octyl acetate .

@highlight Hot compressed water HCW treatment of wood with added octyl acetate was assessed.
@highlight HCW treatment with added octyl acetate increased the sugar concentration 1.8 fold.
@highlight The optimal ratio of water and octyl acetate was approximately 1 1 vol vol .
@highlight Fermentation inhibitors were removed from the water phase by octyl acetate.
@highlight Acetic acid fermentability increased 4 fold with the added octyl acetate.
