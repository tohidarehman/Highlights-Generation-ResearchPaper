 Bioenergy can contribute to low carbon economy of Latin America and African countries where the biomass is a viable alternative to obtain a global energy matrix . The harvesting forest residue left on the ground of industrial tree plantations appears an option to be a biomass source to supply a combined heat and power plant . The goals of this study were to know the biomass production and the fuel quality of stumps and coarse roots from a commercial scale harvesting operation of

@highlight Biomass production of eucalypt stump harvesting.
@highlight The physical and chemical properties of stump and coarse root were studied.
@highlight Clone specie and rotation were statistically significative on biomass and energy yield.
@highlight An environmental balance in the forestry site should be studied before its indiscriminate commercial use.
