 The high presence of microplastics in different sizes materials and concentrations in the aquatic environment is a global concern due to their potential physically and chemically harm to aquatic organisms including mammals . Furthermore the bioaccumulation of these compounds is leading to their ingestion by humans through the consumption of sea food and even through the terrestrial food chain . Even though conventional wastewater treatment plants are capable of eliminating more than 90 of the influent MPs these systems are still the main source of MPs introduction in the environment due to the high volumes of effluents generated and returned to the environment . The amount of MPs dumped by WWTP is influenced by the configuration of the WWTP population served and influent flow . Thus the average of MP L disposed vary widely depending on the region . In addition to MPs disposed in water bodies more than 80 of these emerging contaminants which enter the WWTP are retained in biosolids that can be applied as fertilizers representing a potential source of soil contamination . Due to the continuous disposal of MPs in the environment by effluent treatment systems and their polluting potential separation and identification techniques have been assessed by several researchers but unfortunately there are no standard protocols for them . Aiming to provide insight about the relevance of studying the WWTP as source of MPs this review summarizes the currently methodologies used to classify and identify them .

@highlight Wastewater Treatment Plants release more than millions of microplastics per day.
@highlight Separation and identification of microplastics were discussed.
@highlight Lack of standard protocols make it difficult to compare results.
