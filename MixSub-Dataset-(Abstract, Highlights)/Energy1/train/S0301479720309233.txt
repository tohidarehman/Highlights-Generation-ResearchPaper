 The current work focuses on the production of glucose oxidase in sterilized biosolid slurries containing BS and municipal wastewater effluent . Various parameters were optimized for maximizing the GOD production and the effects of biostimulation on GOD production was investigated by adding synthetic media components . The studies on inoculum characteristics at an inoculum age of 72h and inoculum size of 20 produced high GOD activities of around 6012 U L in 25 BS media . Further the effect of ultrasonication time was determined to release BS bound GOD in order to maximize enzymes recovery . Using 1000 U L of the BS based GOD for 0.55M glucose oxidation produced the maximum H

@highlight grown on sterilized biosolids produced 6012 U L of glucose oxidase GOD .
@highlight 72h inoculum age and 20 inoculum size produced high GOD activities in 48h.
@highlight 1000 U L of GOD produced 216ppm of H
@highlight upon oxidation of 0.55M glucose.
@highlight Produced H
@highlight was utilized as bio Fenton reagent for removal of 15 pharmaceuticals.
@highlight All the pharmaceuticals except atenolol were partially removed at neutral pH in 30min.
