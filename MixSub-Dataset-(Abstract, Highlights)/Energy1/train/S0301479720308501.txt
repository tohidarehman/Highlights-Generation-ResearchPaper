 Aquaculture sustainability is restricted by environmental drawbacks such as the pollution derived from the released organic waste . Integrated multi trophic aquaculture aims to lower the input of this waste by culturing other species of low trophic level which feed on them . Despite the appealing idea of IMTA its implementation is very limited in marine ecosystems . Focusing on marine fish farming in general terms fish farm waste is not expected to constitute a relevant food source for low trophic level organisms cultured in the water column . We propose Regional Integrated Multitrophic Aquaculture as a shift of paradigm in the way IMTA is used to sequester the dissolved exported waste and derived primary production generated by high trophic level cultures . RIMTA advocates for independent allocation of cultures of low and high trophic level species within the same water body . RIMTA implementation should be economically supported through tax benefits or nutrient quota trading schemes . Moving from IMTA to RIMTA should not only foster aquaculture sustainability but also the circular economy and the ecosystem services that the low trophic level cultures provide .

@highlight IMTA implementation is very limited.
@highlight Fish farm wastes do not constitute a considerable food source for algae and bivalves.
@highlight RIMTA is designed for nutrient wastes from high trophic aquaculture.
@highlight RIMTA promotes independent location of cultures of low and high trophic level.
@highlight RIMTA uses an ecosystem based approach using basin nutrient budgets.
