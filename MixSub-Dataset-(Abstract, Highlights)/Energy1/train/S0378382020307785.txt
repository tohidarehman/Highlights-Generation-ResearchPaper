 The successful application of fixed bed chemical looping hydrogen in industrial scale demands highly stable oxygen carrier pellets . The goal of this work was the realistic long term characterization of the pelletized oxygen carriers in a fixed bed reactor environment . TGA characterization of an iron based powder sample containing 5wt Al

@highlight Storing the hot oxygen carrier in reduced condition leads to a longer material life.
@highlight High temperature gradients of up to 30 C min
@highlight during the oxidation reaction were measured.
@highlight After 100 cycles in the fixed bed reactor a decrease in oxygen exchange capacity and mechanical stability was observed.
@highlight Increased inert share or calcination temperature hardens non cycled pellets but did not improve their redox durability.
