 Edaphic microarthropods play crucial roles in soil ecosystem services . Fire is a widespread form of disturbance with severe effects on soil invertebrates . Research on the effects of fire on soil arthropods however has been mostly focused on surface active species . Information on the effects of fire on strictly edaphic invertebrates is limited . Thanks to their variable degree of specialization to the edaphic life soil microarthropods can be used to evaluate soil quality and how it is affected by disturbance . We used an index of soil biological quality based on microarthropods to assess the effects of wildfire in three habitats in a burnt upland plain in Central Italy one year after the fire event . Fire affected significantly soil biology quality . In all habitats burnt soils had a biological quality about 1.4 lower than the respective unburnt soils . Sampling period did not affect QBS ar values . QBS ar values varied among habitat types being highest in the beechwood lowest in the pinewood and intermediate in the grassland . These findings indicate that the QBS ar approach can be profitably used to evaluate the impact of fire on soil biology quality and stress the poor performance of planted conifers in terms of soil quality .

@highlight Fire is a widespread form of disturbance with severe effects on soil invertebrates.
@highlight Soil biological quality can be evaluated with an index QBS ar based on arthropods.
@highlight Fire affects soil biological quality similarly in different Mediterranean habitats.
@highlight The index reflects differences between habitats but not between seasons.
@highlight QBS ar approach can be used to evaluate fire impacts on soil biology quality.
