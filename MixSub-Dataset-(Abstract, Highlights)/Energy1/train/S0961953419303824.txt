 Flocculation is regarded as an effective convenient and promising means for microalgal harvesting of microalgal biomass . In this study three types of metal sulfates were applied as flocculants to harvest microalgae

@highlight Metal sulfates were applied as flocculants to harvest microalgae
@highlight biomass.
@highlight The optimal dosage for the three flocculants to harvest microalgal biomass was 2.5g L.
@highlight The flocculation time of 10min was found to be appropriate.
@highlight The sedimentation with 10min could achieve acceptable biomass recovery of 83 90 .
@highlight Metal residuals in flocculated biomass resulted in 3.3 5.9 reduction of extracted lipids.
