 Carbonization of anaerobic digestion digestate from an Italian plant fed with local feedstock was investigated by slow pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization the properties of pyrochar and hydrochar were compared and framed into the International guidelines for soil improvers amendments in agriculture . Experiments were carried out in newly designed thermochemical conversion systems with the aim of generating the original data necessary for future scale up and for evaluating the characteristics of the product versus existing biochar market standards . SP was carried out in a paddle pyrolysis reactor at 500C for 1h while several HTC experiments were performed in a custom made test bench investigating the influence of temperature and time on hydrochar properties . Both processes were run in batch mode . SP showed lower char yield while the maximum hydrochar yield was obtained at 200C 0.5h . Most char properties fall within the thresholds set by biochar standards . The Carbon content was slightly higher for pyrochar than hydrochar . The specific area was rather low for both chars however pyrochar area 23.10m

@highlight Chars from AD digestates were produced from HTC and slow pyrolysis.
@highlight Low amount of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was detected in the pyrochar.
@highlight HTC aqueous phase was characterized by HPLC GC MS and GC FID.
@highlight Acetic acid was the major compound in the hydrothermal carbonization water.
@highlight Most char properties fit in International standards and regulation for agriculture.
