 By applying stepwise inertial control on wind turbines a secure system frequency response after large active power imbalances in the system can be achieved . In Part I of this paper a novel approach for determining when to terminate the SIC is presented . In this context a new analytical expression for a fixed termination time is derived . In order to optimally implement the FTT concept both the parameters of the system frequency response model and the incremental power during the SIC process must be known . This paper is providing answers to these questions and furthermore proposes an advanced application strategy for the FTT concept . The new strategy improves the frequency nadirs and prevents the WTs rotor speed from violating the lower permissible limit during the SIC process . Using the least squares algorithm the unknown SFR model parameters are estimated from the frequency measured at the point of common coupling of the wind farm . The incremental active power is determined considering the effect of the incremental power on the frequency nadirs and the releasable kinetic energy of the WTs . The performance of the proposed new application strategy is verified using a modified IEEE 39 bus test system .
