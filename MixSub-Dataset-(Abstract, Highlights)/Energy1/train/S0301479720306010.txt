 Odor pollution caused by volatile compounds from waste treatment facilities is a typical nuisance and assessing its potential impacts is crucial . Challenges in odor dispersion simulation and impact assessment are attributed to the occasional and fluctuant emissions of odorous compounds and varying meteorological conditions for dispersion . This study established an approach to assessing the transfer distances and determining the separation areas of odor pollution by combining probability analysis and numerical dispersion simulation . With a waste transfer station as a case we analyzed odorous compounds from 96 samples and performed 2190 simulation rounds with different meteorological parameters throughout an entire year by using a specialized model . Ethanol dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl sulfide were identified as typical odorous compounds in terms of source intensity and detection frequency . The concentration distribution probability of transfer distances in terms of month and year and separation area determination from cumulative probability were investigated . Under most studied conditions the compound concentrations rapidly decreased after being released . From the year round perspective an ethanol concentration exceeding 1g m
