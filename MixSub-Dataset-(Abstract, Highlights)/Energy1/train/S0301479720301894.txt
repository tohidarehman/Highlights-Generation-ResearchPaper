 Soils contain one of the largest carbon pools in the biosphere with the greatest potential of C sequestration to mitigate climate change impacts . The present study aimed at comparing C sequestration potential of various land use systems including forestlands croplands agroforests and orchards in the arid region of Pakistan . Soil samples from the layers of 020 2040 4060 and 6080cm depths were collected and analysed for soil physico chemical properties namely texture pH EC NPK soil organic matter and soil organic C . Additionally the above and below ground plant biomass and C contents were estimated . Results revealed that the highest C sequestration potential 64.54Mgha
