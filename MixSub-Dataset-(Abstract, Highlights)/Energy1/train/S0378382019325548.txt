 P toluene sulfonic acid was utilized to pretreat corn stover . Changes in morphology and structure of untreated and pretreated samples were analyzed by ESEM TEM BET XRD and SXT . The characterization results demonstrated that PTSA pretreatment could markedly improve cellulase accessibility to cellulose because of the removal of lignin and hemicellulose simultaneously . The maximum glucose yield with an enzyme loading of 5FPUg

@highlight PTSA pretreatment can remove lignin and hemicellulose simultaneously under mild condition.
@highlight P toluene sulfonic acid pretreatment was an effective pretreatment process.
@highlight 67.2 of glucose yield was achieved at a low enzyme loading of 5FPUg
@highlight substrate.
