 Microalgae produce increased lipid content accompanied by a significant decrease in cell density with decreasing nitrate concentration . Magnetic fields have been reported as a factor that could accelerate metabolism and growth in microalgae culture . Thus this study aimed to optimize the influence of MF and nitrate concentration on the growth and lipid productivity of

@highlight Magnetic fields increased the growth of
@highlight Appropriate magnetic fields could reduce the requirements for nitrate addition.
@highlight MFN has a significant effect on the growth rate but not on lipid production.
