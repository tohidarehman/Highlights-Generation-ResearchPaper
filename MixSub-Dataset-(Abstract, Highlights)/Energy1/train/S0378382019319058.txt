 Carbon capture and storage has been proposed as a bridging technology between the current energy production and a future renewable energy system . One promising carbon capture technology is chemical looping combustion . In CLC the reactors are filled with metal oxide bed material called oxygen carriers . The interaction between oxygen carriers and biomass ashes is a poorly explored field . To make CLC a viable process and thereby creating carbon emission reductions more knowledge about the interactions between biomass ashes and oxygen carriers is needed .
