 A novel liquid phase plasma discharge process was developed and optimized for converting pure oleic acid to biodiesel . Independent variables including weight ratio of H

@highlight A novel liquid phase plasma discharge LPPD process was developed and evaluated.
@highlight Oleic acid was converted to biodiesel with LPPD process in 4min of discharging time.
@highlight Optimal ratios of catalyst and methanol to oleic acid were 2.38 w w and 8.02.
@highlight The conversion rate achieved by the LPPD reactor was 80.78 under room temperature.
@highlight CCD RSM was used to optimize the running parameters for the LPPD process.
