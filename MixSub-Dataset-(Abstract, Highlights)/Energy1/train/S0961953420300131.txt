 Hydrothermal carbonization as a promising thermochemical process can convert organic solid wastes into valuable products at relatively low temperatures and saturated pressures . Hydrothermal conversion generally occurs via dehydration polymerization and finally carbonization reactions . The carbon materials derived from hydrochar have high potential in various applications such as solid fuel supercapacitor fuel cell and sorbent . Although the energy densification of hydrochar was increased at higher temperatures most of the benefit was achieved at modest temperatures . Chemical structures of hydrochars include crosslinks of aromatic polymer surface porosity organic functional groups and ultimate components . All of these characteristics can be changed significantly by HTC influencing the reactivity and fuel properties of hydrochars . The reaction pathways including negative and positive effects during HTC of biomass and plastic wastes are thoroughly concluded . In particular the co HTC of chlorinated plastic and biomass can enhance the dechlorination and inorganics removal from hydrochar .
