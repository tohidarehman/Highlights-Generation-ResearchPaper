 Located deep in the Kelabit Highlands in Malaysian Borneo the remote town of Bario offers us a natural laboratory of rural electrification projects through which to understand end user perceptions of success and failure and the factors that contribute to these perceptions . We use a case study based approach and focus on three off grid energy projects a 110kW mini hydro power plant a 12kW wind turbine system and a 1.59MW solar diesel hybrid system . We find that end users primarily see the success or failure of a project in technical terms but that this narrow conceptualization masks important interactions between technical economic and institutional factors . We further find that end user perceptions of newer projects are heavily affected by their perceptions of previous projects . Our findings suggest several ways forward to improve the effectiveness of rural electrification initiatives . Firstly we should expect complex interactions between technical economic and institutional factors and build in the necessary capacity into rural electrification projects to identify and address these interactions . Secondly there is no one size fits all solution to creating the requisite capacity to deal with interactions among technical economic and institutional factors . Thirdly ongoing qualitative or mixed methods evaluations of rural electrification initiatives can help unravel what would otherwise be hidden interactions between technical economic and institutional factors .

@highlight We qualitatively evaluate off grid projects from the perspective of end users.
@highlight Outcomes are shaped by complex technical economic and institutional interactions.
@highlight Perceptions of newer projects are heavily affected by past experiences of failure.
@highlight Qualitative studies can identify and address hidden barriers to electrification.
