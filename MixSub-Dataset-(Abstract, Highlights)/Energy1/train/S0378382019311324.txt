 The saturated cyclic ethers produced from biomass derived aldehydes and 2 methylfuran are the potential diesel fuel candidates . The synthesis of saturated cyclic ethers is a two step process which involves acid catalyzed condensation of aldehydes with 2 methylfuran and the subsequent selective furan ring hydrogenation of the condensation products . Here we designed a novel recyclable magnetic solid acid catalyst such as Fe

@highlight Methyl furan and formaldehyde condensation efficiently catalyzed by solid acid catalyst.
@highlight Presence of both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites confirmed by Py IR.
@highlight The solid acid catalyst could be recovered magnetically for six successful recycles.
@highlight Selective hydrogenation of condensation products carried out under mild conditions.
@highlight Methodology successfully applied for the synthesis of several saturated cyclic ethers.
