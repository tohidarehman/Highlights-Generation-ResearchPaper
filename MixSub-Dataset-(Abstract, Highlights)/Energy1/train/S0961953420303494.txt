 Mathematical models are tools that allow the prediction and control of the anaerobic digestion process ensuring process stability and maximizing methane production . In this study the AD of food waste was evaluated in single stage and two stage semicontinuous configurations with the following organic loading rates OLR kgVSm

@highlight Modified ADM1 accurately simulates the behavior of pH methane and lactic acid.
@highlight The two stage achieved the best Re 1.53 
@highlight  4.26kJg fed VS
@highlight  and a 47 emission reduction in CO
@highlight The hydrolysis rate was 50 higher in the two stage than in the single stage.
@highlight High sensitivity was observed for kmac in low ranges for both configurations.
@highlight The parameters k
@highlight and k
@highlight showed moderate sensitivity.
