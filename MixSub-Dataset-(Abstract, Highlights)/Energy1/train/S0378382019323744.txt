 Waste plastics packaging was converted into valuable products by two step microwave cracking . The wax gas and solid were produced in the first step and the liquid gas and solid were produced in the second step . Different heating strategies including the selection of absorbers and catalyst the adjustment of heating power the mass ratio of absorber to feedstock have been proposed to optimize the products in each step . Commercial spherical activated carbon columnar activated carbon and molecular sieves type 4A have been used as absorbers and catalysts . The gas products mainly H

@highlight Proposed a two step method for recycling waste packaging plastic by microwave heating
@highlight Proposed different heating strategies in each step to optimize the cracking products
@highlight Proposed a separation of dirty and clean process to reduce catalyst deactivation
@highlight Absorbers and catalysts have been used many times to reduce cracking costs.
@highlight It provides a new design basis for catalyst absorber and waste plastic system.
