 Coking during endothermic hydrocarbon fuel cracking is a key problem that has to be considered . In this study anti coking effect was systematically studied by using water ethanol and HPW as additives on the coatings of CsOH and BaCeO

@highlight A comparative study on the decoking effect of additives which combined with coatings for the first time under supercritical thermal cracking.
@highlight The optimal combination of decoking additives and coatings is screened out.
@highlight The possible mechanism of decoking was proposed by an oxygen transfer mechanism.
