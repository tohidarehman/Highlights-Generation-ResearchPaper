 The present study evaluated the efficiency of pre selected composite amendments for immobilization and sorption of Cd and Pb in field and batch sorption experiments . The field experiment was performed in a co contaminated clay purple soil . Along with a control experiment CA 1 and CA 2 were tested at different rates including 750 1500 3000 and 6000kgha

@highlight Cd and Pb immobilizing and removal efficiency was trialed out.
@highlight SEM images revealed the structural difference between both composites.
@highlight Langmuir model was better fitted for Cd and Pb than Freundlich model.
@highlight Cd and Pb sorption was highest with composite treatments as compared to control.
