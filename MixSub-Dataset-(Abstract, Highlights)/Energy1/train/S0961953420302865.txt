 Biofuel is one of the promising alternatives for petroleum based fuels and the bioethanol produced from agricultural residues industrial wastes are a viable alternative and current trend in research . In this context this work reports the utilisation of the waste potatoes

@highlight Bioethanol produced from waste potato waste via acid and enzymatic hydrolyses.
@highlight Unexplored ultrasonic pretreatment employed to enhance the bioethanol yield.
@highlight Process modelled and optimized via BBD and ANN.
@highlight US HCl hydrolysis yielded 65.8mg L and US Enzyme hydrolysis yielded 54.1g L.
