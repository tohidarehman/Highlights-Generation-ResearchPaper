 Anthropogenic activities like industrial mining refining and smelting release substantial amounts of lead into the soil causing potential ecological menaces to environment soil productivity and food security . Present pot scale study was undertaken to investigate the effects of tree twigs derived biochar and a bacterium

@highlight Combined use of
@highlight PsJN and tree twigs biochar retrieved adverse effects of Pb in

@highlight PsJN and tree twigs biochar together improved growth physiology and grain quality parameters of
@highlight Combined use of
@highlight PsJN and tree twigs biochar immobilized Pb in soil and reduced its uptake translocation and bioaccumulation in
@highlight tissues.
@highlight Combined use of
@highlight PsJN and tree twigs biochar ameliorated Pb induced oxidative stress by intensifying antioxidant activities while significantly lowering activities of ROS.
