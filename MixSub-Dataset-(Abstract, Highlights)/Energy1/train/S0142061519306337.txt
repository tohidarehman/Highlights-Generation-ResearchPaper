 The polarity effect of the partial discharge in oil pressboard insulation under a highly non uniform electric field is remarkable . For intensive analysis of the characteristics and mechanisms of this polarity effect a non uniform electric field was simulated by a needle plate model with oil PB composite insulation . The PD statistical features PD pattern and PD pulse were studied via pulse current method the charge distribution was simulated on the basis of hydrodynamic drift diffusion model and bipolar charge transport model and the cause of the polarity effect was analysed based on the PD mechanism which is quantificationally explained via a PD circuit model . It was found that the average apparent discharge amplitude and PD repetition rate of the neg PD are higher the average equivalent frequency and equivalent time of neg PD are higher and lower respectively the pos PD pulse is unimodal and the neg PD pulse is oscillating with some secondary discharges at AC voltage or a back discharge at DC voltage and the neg PD pulse has a narrower width owning to the fast rising edge and falling edge . The PD current pulse in the coupling loop is essentially caused by the charging process of the streamer shorted defect . The cause of the polarity effect is that the positive streamer evolves slowly and can puncture the entire oil gap with an energy concentrated channel whereas the negative streamer with a diffused channel evolves faster but can not puncture the entire oil gap .
