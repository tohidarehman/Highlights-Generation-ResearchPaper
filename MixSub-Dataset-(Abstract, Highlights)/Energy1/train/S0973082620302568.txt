 This article aims to present historical rate of decoupling and based on that determine the scope for India to increase its mitigation beyond the NDC commitment . Empirical evidence on nature and rate of decoupling between energy related emission and economic growth for the period 199091 to 201213 in India is presented . In addition to estimating the magnitude of decoupling elasticity decomposition analysis is also applied to understand how the four factors activity growth energy intensity change structural change and fuel mix change are driving the change in emission in India . Decoupling elasticity and Log Mean Divisia Index methods are used for decomposition . The results indicate presence of relative decoupling in India . The industrial sector leads among the four sectors agriculture industry services and power generation in achieving this relative decoupling mostly through improvement in energy efficiency and some structural changes . Results show that even in the business as usual scenario if India acts upon individual sector level mitigation potentials it has the potential to raise mitigation ambition beyond current Nationally Determined Contributions without adversely impacting economic growth . With continued high share of coal in the energy mix it is going to be difficult to achieve absolute decoupling .

@highlight Relative decoupling is increasingly happening in India since 199091 but more can be achieved.
@highlight Industrial energy efficiency improvements explain most of the relative decoupling.
@highlight To achieve unprecedented absolute decoupling high share of coal in total primary fuel mix is a major barrier.
@highlight Untapped efficiency and fuel shifts potential can help in raising ambition beyond the current NDC.
@highlight Raising NDC ambition through sectoral actions is not in conflict with economic growth.
