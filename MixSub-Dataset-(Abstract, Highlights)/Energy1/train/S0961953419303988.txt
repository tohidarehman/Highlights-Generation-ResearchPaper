 Since the first use of anaerobic digestion technology to generate biogas in 1895 to power street lights in Britain and also as a Municipal Solid Waste Management technique in the US in 1939 significant advances have been developed to optimise the process in a sustainable manner . In practice optimising anaerobic digesters to increase biogas production dependent on a balanced pH tolerable volatile fatty acids and alkalinity levels by anaerobic bacteria . Others include maintaining suitable temperature regime providing suitable organic loading rate to prevent noxious conditions well balanced carbon to nitrogen ratio to limit ammonia build up and appropriate choice of substrates . In terms of biomass lignocellulose substrates constitute the most abundant bio resource . This resource however requires modification of the chemistry of the structure to improve its biodegradation biogas production and effluent quality . There have been attempts by most researchers to improve lignocellulose biomass utilization in anaerobic digesters through delignification to prevent non productive binding of bacteria as well as reduce the crystalline in cellulose with the aim of making the holocellulose fractions bioavailable . However none of the techniques so far applied for the purpose of optimising biogas production has attained the maximum theoretical biogas yield of 120 000650 000Lt

@highlight Co digestion as a technology to maintain nutrient balance and thus provides optimising potential to increase biogas yield .
@highlight Chemical augmentation maintains microbial cell respiration in the anaerobic digestion process.
@highlight Pretreatment of biomass opens up lignocellulose biomass and increases the surface area thereby enhances microbial absorption and degradation.
@highlight Pollutants reduction in anaerobic effluents.
