 Hybrid series parallel microgrid is a new promising structure for integrating low voltage and remote sources efficiently . DG units are connected in series as a string locally and the strings supply power in parallel . This paper proposes a locally distributed and globally decentralized control for this microgrid . Local DG units are controlled as a consistent string by distributed cooperative control and global power demand among strings is shared in a decentralized manner . The frequency synchronization and proper power sharing are achieved under both the resistive inductive and resistive capacitive loads . Moreover only local sparse low bandwidth communication networks are employed which improves the reliability and reduces the communication costs . The overall system stability is analyzed and reasonable ranges of control parameters are given . Finally the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution are verified by simulation tests .
