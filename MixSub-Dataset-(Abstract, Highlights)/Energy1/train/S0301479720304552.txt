 Due to the influence of buildings on the distribution of flood and their economic and social attributes 3D spatial information such as the size of buildings and the flooded ratio of buildings relative to their height has an increasing impact on urban flood risk . However existing flood risk assessment methods mainly use data in 2D and analysis methods are mostly 2D . In this study flood variation processes were analyzed in the form of 3D dynamic visualization by coupling an urban drainage model and a flood simulation model with 3D visualization methods . By further combining with 3D building models the 3D spatial information of buildings related to flood was obtained . In order to study the influence of 3D information on flood risk and combine with other multi source heterogeneous data for integrated analysis a 3D visualization assessment and analysis method for flood risk coupled with the projection pursuit particle swarm optimization algorithm was established . A case study from Chaohu City China was used to demonstrate the method . The results showed that the PP PSO algorithm can process high dimensional information and obtain the objective weight of each index . The 3D information from the influenced buildings had an impact on the evaluation results which needed to be considered . Through the 3D visualization analysis the overall distribution of flood risk and that around the buildings were obtained in multi perspectives . The flood risk during different rainfall return periods were analyzed intuitively and comparatively . This study furnishes a novel method for flood risk assessment and analysis by making the most of 3D spatial information .
