 Hospital wastewater are a lurking threat to environment and human health security for any given moment of time owing to its complexity and high vulnerability to cause disease outbreak . Though there are a number of treatment process for wastewater . there is a high need for employing cost efficient and sustainable method of treatment . Hence a pilot scale horizontal surface flow Constructed Wetland coupled with Tubesettler was installed at New Delhi India . This study reports comparative pollutants removal from hospital wastewater using Constructed Wetlands and associated tubesettler dosed with Hospital wastewater . A pilot scale CW system was used for treating 10m

@highlight CW removed organic matter upto 94 .
@highlight Tubesettler reduced COD by 28 and BOD by 61 .
@highlight CW effluent nitrate increased 110 and Phosphate decreased 69 .
@highlight Alkalinity increased by 52 hinting role of pharmaceutical elements.
