 This industrial scale study has tested monitored and analyzed the waste to energy yield for different ratios of mixed livestock manure and mixed vegetable waste substrates using a modern industrial scale pilot anaerobic digestion plant which consists of four interlinked digesters having a volume of 272.5m . Five substrate treatment ratios between mixed livestock manure and mixed vegetable waste have been tested and they are denoted with L1V0 L0.8V0.2 L0.6V0.4 L0.4V0.6 and L0.2V0.8 . The pilot AD plant runs in a semi continuous mode having a retention time of 30 days for each treatment and a substrate loading rate of 4000kgd

@highlight This study realized the knowledge gaps among lab and full scale AD energy yields.
@highlight A modern industrial scale AD plant was tested for waste to energy yield.
@highlight Effective mono and co digestion of substrates are possible on this plant.
@highlight Maximum energy yield was determined via 0.8 livestock manure 0.2 vegetable waste .
