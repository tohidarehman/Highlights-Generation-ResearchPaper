 Gasification reaction is not supposed to be omitted for pulverized coal MILD oxy combustion regime especially for the wet recycle . This paper numerically investigates the individual effects of steam and oxygen on pulverized coal MILD oxy combustion to have better understanding of char reaction behavior under this combustion mode . Results show that the flame temperature affected by steam is because of thermal radiation whereas that of O
