 This paper addresses the use of noise measurements when noise mapping simulations are intended to be validated . For this a discussion about the measurement uncertainty and how to include it in the process of validation is carried out . Then the contribution provided by the geo referencing error of a GPS and its impact in the uncertainty is assessed . This is achieved by means of environmental noise measurements which are conducted based on the accuracy radius given by a standard GPS . Furthermore an assessment of the approach is conducted by means of numerical simulations using the commercial package SoundPLAN . The results indicate that the uncertainty of noise measurements should be included as it restricts the validation threshold usually assumed as
