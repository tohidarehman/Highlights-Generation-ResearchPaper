 The work concerned the ignition characteristics and alkali metals release behavior during the combustion process of single coal particles with the additional different forms of K contents . The measurement was performed in O

@highlight Ignition and alkali release of coal with different additive K analyzed using spectrum and imaging.
@highlight Addition of K to coal delayed release of alkali metal atoms and gas phase ignition.
@highlight Delay in gas ignition and alkali release was longer for K
@highlight CO
@highlight than for KCl addition.
@highlight Substituting CO
@highlight for N
@highlight had more effect for KCl than for K
@highlight CO
@highlight addition in the initial combustion.
