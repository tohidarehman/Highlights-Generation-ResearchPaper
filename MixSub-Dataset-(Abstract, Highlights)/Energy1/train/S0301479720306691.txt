 In sustaining the soil quality soil salinization has become a major challenge due to the increasing salinity rate of 10 annually . Despite the serious concerns the influence of soil amendments on microbial communities and its related attributes have limited findings . Therefore the present study aims to investigate the potential of three various biochars digestate

@highlight Organic amendments have shown a greater impact on functional attributes and bacterial community structure.
@highlight Major bacterial shifts were noted in treatments with biochars and digestate mixture.
@highlight Increased bacterial diversity was observed in soils with compost amalgamations.
@highlight K and Mg
@highlight played a key role in shaping the microbiome and influencing the metabolic functions.
@highlight Co application of digestate and its biochar is one of the potential ways to improve saline soil quality.
