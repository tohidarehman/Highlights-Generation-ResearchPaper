 The pyrolysis liquid biorefinery concept involves separation of pyrolysis liquids in various fractions followed by conversion of the fractions to value added products . Pyrolytic lignins the water insoluble fractions of pyrolysis liquids are heterogeneous cross linked oligomers composed of substituted phenolics whose structure and physicochemical properties vary significantly depending on the biomass source . The catalytic hydrotreatment of six PLs from different biomass sources was investigated to determine the effect of different feedstocks on the final product composition and particularly the amount of alkylphenolics and aromatics the latter being important building blocks for the chemical industry . Hydrotreatment was performed with Pd C 100bar of hydrogen pressure and temperatures in the range of 350435C resulting in depolymerized product mixtures with monomer yields up to 39.1wt . The molecular composition of the hydrotreated oils was shown to be a strong function of the PL feed and reaction conditions . Statistical analyses provided the identification of specific structural drivers on the formation of aromatics and phenolics and a simple model able to accurately predict the yields of such monomers after catalytic hydrotreatment was obtained R

@highlight Catalytic hydrotreatment of PL yielded up to 39wt monomers based on PL intake .
@highlight The PL source has significant impact on the product properties and monomer yields.
@highlight Reaction temperature has a higher effect in the product properties than time.
@highlight PLs from pine and sunflower seed peel gave the best results after hydrotreatment.
@highlight Correlations found between feed properties and yields of phenolics and aromatics.
