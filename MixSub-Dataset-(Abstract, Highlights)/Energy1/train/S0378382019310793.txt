 Leveraging on previously observed selectivity in separating sugars from aromatics in aqueous solution via adsorption to metal organic framework NU 1000 we investigate the effect of ionic liquid cosolvent on this separation . Four ILs were investigated at concentrations of 0.4 10 and 20vol . When treated with an aqueous IL mixture containing glucose xylose coumaric acid and ferulic acid highly selective sugar aromatic separations were observed for NU 1000 at 0.4vol for both cholinium lysinate and ethanolamine acetate . In contrast amorphous carbon under similar conditions lacked selectivity adsorbing similar amounts of aromatics to NU 1000 while also adsorbing 96mgg

@highlight In 0.4vol ionic liquid IL water NU 1000 retains high selectivity in not adsorbing aromatics while adsorbing sugars.
@highlight In 10 and 20vol IL water the adsorption selectivity of NU 1000 decreases.
@highlight Large hydrophobic ILs reduce adsorption selectivity of NU 1000.
@highlight NU 1000 in IL water still shows higher selectivity than a high surface area amorphous carbon adsorbent.
@highlight Results reaffirm that an isolated pyrene linker of NU 1000 is the active site for selective adsorption.
