 This paper contributes to the growing literature regarding the role of Information and Communication Technologies as well as Innovation on driving the level of carbon dioxide emissions and economic growth in context of the 21st conference of the Parties to the Climate convention . Drawing the data from 13 selected G 20 countries during the period of 15 years our study achieves significant results . First only five factors impede the carbon emissions namely energy price foreign direct investment technology spending on innovation and trade openness while the remainder of determinants contribute to contamination of environment including financial development . Second when it comes to economic growth information and communication technological and financial development are positive driving factors . Our results do reject the absence of Environmental Kuznets Curve from our sample . Finally our study empirically suggests that the work of controlling consumption of oil and environmentally friendly process including manufacture trading in these economies will limit the amount of pollution .

@highlight GDP per capita energy consumption and financial development lead to an increase in CO2 emissions.
@highlight The effects of FDI trade openness and oil prices on CO2 emissions are negative following the pollution halo hypothesis.
@highlight There is a negative relationship between ICT innovation and CO
@highlight emissions in these selected G20 countries.
@highlight To some extent measures of ICTs and financial development tend to boost the economic growth in these countries.
