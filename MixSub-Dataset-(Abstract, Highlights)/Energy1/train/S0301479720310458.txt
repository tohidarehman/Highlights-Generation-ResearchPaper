 The concept of soil health refers to specific soil properties and the ability to support and sustain crop growth and productivity while maintaining long term environmental quality . The key components of healthy soil are high populations of organisms that promote plant growth such as the plant growth promoting rhizobacteria . PGPR plays multiple beneficial and ecological roles in the rhizosphere soil . Among the roles of PGPR in agroecosystems are the nutrient cycling and uptake inhibition of potential phytopathogens growth stimulation of plant innate immunity and direct enhancement of plant growth by producing phytohormones or other metabolites . Other important roles of PGPR are their environmental cleanup capacities . In this work we review recent literature concerning the diverse mechanisms of PGPR in maintaining healthy conditions of agricultural soils thus reducing the toxic agrochemicals dependence . In conclusion this review provides comprehensive knowledge on the current PGPR basic mechanisms and applications as biocontrol agents plant growth stimulators and soil rhizoremediators with the final goal of having more agroecological practices for sustainable agriculture .

@highlight Role of PGPR on soil health and sustainable agriculture is systematically outlined.
@highlight PGPR contain multiple beneficial traits of significant importance to crop plants.
@highlight PGPR are active players on diverse environmental cleanup strategies.
@highlight Manipulation of PGPR has great potential to increase crop productivity.
