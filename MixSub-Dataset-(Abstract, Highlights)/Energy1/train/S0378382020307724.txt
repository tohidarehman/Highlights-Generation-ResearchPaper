 Herein four asphaltenes in distinguished polarities were first fractionated from heavy crude oil by the solvent precipitation method and characterized and the effects of asphaltenes on the polyethylene vinyl acetate PPD s performance for the model waxy oil were evaluated . Results show that the asphaltenes in lower polarities contain a greater number of aliphatic groups and present a higher H C ratio hence exhibiting better oily compatibility and the greater synergistic performance with EVA in improving the waxy oil flowability at low temperatures . The competition between the co crystallization and nucleation effect of additives determines the wax precipitating temperature . Adding asphaltenes delays the wax precipitation but increases wax crystal number just below WPT especially together with EVA . According to the micro observation and isothermal titration tests EVA can adsorb onto the asphaltene aggregates to form the composite EVA asphaltene particles and the adsorption gradually reaches saturated with the EVA injecting . The composite particles act as the heterogeneous crystallizing templates for wax molecules to precipitate triggering the formation of wax crystal flocs with large size spherical like morphology and compact structure . Reducing the asphaltenes polarity strengthens the stronger interactions among asphaltenes EVA and paraffin wax molecules and hence improves the EVA asphaltene synergistic performance .

@highlight EVA and asphaltenes can dramatically improve the flowability of waxy oil.
@highlight Adding asphaltenes delays the wax precipitation but effectively increases the wax crystal number just below WPT.
@highlight DSC and ITC confirm the adsorption behavior between EVA and asphaltene aggregates.
@highlight Wax crystal flocs with large size spherical like morphology and compact structure cause the flowability improvement.
@highlight Decrease of asphaltenes polarity favors the synergistic performance of EVA asphaltenes.
