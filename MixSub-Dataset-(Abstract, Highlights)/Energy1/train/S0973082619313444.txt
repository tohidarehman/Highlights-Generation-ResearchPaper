 The penetration levels of renewable energy sources energy storage systems and electric vehicles are increasing with the increase in the demand to solve energy and environmental issues . These distributed generators and energy storages can be efficiently managed in a DC smart grid by coordinated control . This paper proposes novel management schemes for DC systems to improve the reliability of power supply and improve the introduction ratio of renewable energy sources . The proposed DC smart grid includes multiple DC microgrids . These configurations and control systems must be designed on the assumption of islanding operation of DC systems . In the islanding power system with the high penetration of RES not only the utilization of energy storage but also load shedding and RES control is important . Hence an efficient control strategy by using a storage battery fuel cell and electrolyzer units heat pump units and a photovoltaic system is presented for stable islanding operation of DC microgrid . As the most important concept a pseudo Droop control is proposed that utilizes the characteristics of the PV module . The pseudo Droop control enables the PV system to suppress the output power properly by using a simple control system without the maximum power estimation . Fault ride through protection for DC system is also adapted to the DC distribution lines . The performance of the proposed DC smart grid is demonstrated through MATLAB Simscape Electrical
