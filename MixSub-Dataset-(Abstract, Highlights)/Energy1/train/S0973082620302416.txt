 Electricity access and appliance usage are integral parts of developing a modern economy in rural areas . Unfortunately many households in rural India struggle to access reliable electricity and therefore are unable to power appliances throughout the day . We use household survey data from 10 249 households across the Indian states of Bihar Odisha Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh to explore potential drivers of electric appliance usage . By applying a series of linear and nonlinear models we find that grid connected households have more electricity available to them and use significantly more electricity to power appliances in each of four designated household appliance categories lighting cooling entertainment and housekeeping . Households using alternative power sources including solar home systems and mini grids exhibit high uptake and use of lower level appliances in the lighting and cooling categories but much less so in the entertainment and housekeeping categories . Grid access is also correlated with higher electricity availability than alternative sources . Electricity availability is shown to be a highly significant predictor for powering appliances for longer time periods in all categories but especially for more easily attainable appliances in lighting and cooling categories .

@highlight Empirical analysis of appliance usage in rural India
@highlight Grid access is associated with high levels of appliance usage.
@highlight Available hours of electricity supply per day is a major driver of appliance usage.
@highlight Improving availability of electricity supply through the grid can increase appliance usage.
