 Water systems are experiencing dynamic societal demands and extreme environmental changes . The integration of modular water systems into existing centralized infrastructures creating hybrid systems could mitigate these challenges by enabling more resilient water management . However the existence of technological alternatives has not changed the continuous reliance on centralized water infrastructure . Supportive policy instruments are key to foster the operation of modular technology within hybrid water systems . This article focuses on the role of substantive and procedural policy instruments for the successful operation of modular water systems within a hybrid water infrastructure . Based on Qualitative Comparative Analysis we can confirm the claim in the literature that relying on regulatory instruments is relevant for operating modular technology within hybrid systems . However we also find combinations of policy instruments where regulatory instruments do not matter . Furthermore we find that procedural instruments emphasizing stakeholder participation interplay with different substantive policy instruments to support the successful operation of modular systems .

@highlight Policy instrument mixes are key for the successful operation of modular water technology within hybrid water systems.
@highlight Multiple policy instrument configurations exist showing that there is no silver bullet for operating modular technology.
@highlight Regulatory instruments are relevant for operating modular technology within hybrid water systems but not omnipresent.
@highlight Participation and user responsibility support the operation of modular technology within hybrid systems by engaging users.
@highlight Information dissemination is important in the context of modular technology linking substantive and procedural instruments.
