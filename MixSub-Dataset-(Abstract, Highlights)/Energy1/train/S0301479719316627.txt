 This study aims to investigate the sewage sludge drying process by incorporating a by product formed in the pulp and paper industry as drying adjuvant . Through an innovative approach the drying kinetics was modelled and the final dried product was tested for soil applications . After the characterization phase small cylinders of SS without and with 0.15g GLD g SS

@highlight Fick s second law and thin layer models described adequately the experimental data.
@highlight The maximum drying rate was obtained for SS with GLD at 130C.
@highlight GLD contain a low concentration of potentially toxic metals but high alkalinity.
@highlight SS with GLD mixture increased the biomass content and raise soil pH.
