 DC bus voltage restoration proportional load power sharing and batteries SOC balancing are some of the most critical challenges of DC microgrids . The utilization of communication links and the central controller eliminate these problems . Nevertheless microgrids controlled in this way have low modularity flexibility reliability and high costs and complexity . This paper proposes a novel communication less control method which solves the mentioned concerns and problems . The energy storage units are controlled by local parameters in order to guarantee the system stability . In this method a unit estimates the DC bus voltage deviation and injects an AC signal to the DC bus . The droop curve of the units is shifted based on the AC signal and their SOC . The shifted values are specified such that the higher SOC units inject more power and the DC bus voltage is restored . The stability analysis and step response of the system show that the proposed method benefits from an acceptable stability and satisfactory speed . Simulation results confirm that the proposed method can regulate the DC bus voltage and reduce the units SOC imparity without any communication links and central controller .
