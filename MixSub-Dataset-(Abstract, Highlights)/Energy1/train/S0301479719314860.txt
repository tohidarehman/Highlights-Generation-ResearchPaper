 Geochemical behavior of arsenic in rice paddy soils determines the availability and mobility of As in the soils but little is known about the long term effects of paddy rice cultivation on As speciation in the soils . In this study surface soil samples were collected from a rice paddy land and its adjacent dry land with similar soil properties and known cultivation histories . The soils of the paddy land and dry land contained 378 and 423mg As kg

@highlight As associated with Fe hydrous oxides and scorodite are predominant in the soils of a paddy land and its adjacent dry land.
@highlight Paddy rice cultivation may result in a decrease in the crystallinity of Fe hydrous oxides in the paddy soil.
@highlight As in the paddy soil is more labile than the dry land soil.
@highlight Long term rice cultivation results in a decreasing stability of As in the paddy soil.
