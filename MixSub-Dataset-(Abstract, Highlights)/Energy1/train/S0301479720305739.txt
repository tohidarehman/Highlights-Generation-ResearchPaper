 Best management practices have been widely applied to mitigate non point source pollution in agricultural watersheds . However a prediction of the multivariate reduction effect of NPS pollutants by BMPs considering its stochastic nature has not been conducted . A new modeling approach combining a hydrological model and copulas was proposed to predict the multivariate effect of BMPs fully considering the stochastic characteristics of BMPs effects and the dependence structure between them . Two levels of reduction effect i.e . the multi indicator effect of a single BMP and the combined effect of multiple BMPs were simulated . The approach was demonstrated in Zhangjiachong watershed a typical small watershed in the Three Gorges Reservoir area China . Results show that copulas can effectively simulate the dependence between the univariate effects of BMPs . The approach can accurately predict the probability to achieve the reduction objective for multiple pollutants and multiple BMPs in a watershed . It provides a stochastic way to predict the multivariate effect of BMPs and has great potential to be widely applied in BMPs related decision making .
