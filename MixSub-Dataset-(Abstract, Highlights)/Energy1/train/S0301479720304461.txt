 This article shows environmental life cycle comparisons of four scenarios of manure management systems for the intensive pig farming systems in terms of materials transport energy and emissions . The MMS scenarios are categorized by different combinations of outside storage anaerobic mono co digester and algae based wastewater treatment where the conventional MMS scenario merely uses the outside storage or adopts an integrated anaerobic mono digester and the outside storage . The nonconventional MMS scenario uses an integrated anaerobic mono digester and AWWT process notably the harvested algae biomass is used to fully substitute a few ingredients of swine diets . Using life cycle assessment methodology it is validated that Scenario 3 reduces the total environmental impact by 35.5 40 as compared to Scenarios 1 and 2 and increases the nutrient recovery of nitrogen ratio from 58 to 81 . Scenario 4 uses an integrated anaerobic co digester and AWWT process where the harvested algae biomass is partially recycled to substitute the partial ingredients of swine diets and the remaining part is fed into the anaerobic co digester for improving the biogas yield to increase the algae biomass yield by 49 and also enhance the cogeneration of heat and power by 26.6 and 7 respectively as compared to Scenario 3 .

@highlight An anaerobic co digester has economic potentials by increasing biogas and harvested algae.
@highlight The harvested algae with high substitution ratio for feedstuff ensure a lower environmental impacts.
@highlight The algae based pig farming systems reduces gaseous nitrogen compound pollutants.
@highlight The energy saving paddlewheel motor is a critical option to reduce the environmental impact of HRAP.
