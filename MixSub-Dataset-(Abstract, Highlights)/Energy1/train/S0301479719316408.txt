 Cellulose and lignin as main components of crop residues have a significant influence on composting operations and composition of the final products . Both are strongly associated and lignin can be considered an important barrier during the biodegradation process of lignocellulosic materials . Saprophytic fungi are efficient lignin degraders due to their complex enzymatic system . Therefore the influence of the inoculation of saprophytic fungi

@highlight All the factors and their interactions influenced the enzyme activity and E
@highlight  E
@highlight ratio.
@highlight showed the higher enzymatic activities related to decomposition of residues.
@highlight Metallic oxides enhance the activity of LAC MnP and glucosidase.
@highlight High correlation between the activity of all the studied enzymes.
@highlight The use of fungi and additives improved the composting of residues with high C N.
