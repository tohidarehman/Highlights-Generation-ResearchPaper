 In recent years lithium slag has increased sharply with the development of lithium industry which has caused serious environmental problems . However the utilization of this industrial waste residue has been a difficult topic in lithium industry . In this paper the effects of LS on mineral crystal type ionic solid solution decomposition temperature of CaCO
