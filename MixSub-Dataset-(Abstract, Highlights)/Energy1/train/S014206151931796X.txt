 This study as the leading one proposes power based distribution locational marginal pricing to determine the active and reactive powers tariffs in distribution systems with high penetration of distributed energy resources . The main merit of the proposed approach alludes to its power based characteristics within which the price signals are in the form of linear expressions of active and reactive powers and the DERs optimization problem demonstrates a second order characteristic . Accordingly the problem of multiple solutions is not seen and the scheduling pattern of DERs powers would be exactly the same as the anticipated scheduling solution of distribution system operator . The second advantage of the proposed approach is its repetitive feature within which the optimization process in DERs side is a part of market clearing process . In this way beside preserving the privacy of DERs by increasing the number of DERs the computational burden of the DSO would not drastically increase . In the proposed method the non linear equations of distribution network and DERs are linearized based on precise approximations and tested on 38 bus distribution test system . The obtained results certify the efficiency of the established approach in alleviating the possible over voltages reducing the congestion and increasing the renewable energy share in distribution system scheduling all together ending to decrease the distribution system operation cost .

@highlight For the first time power based distribution locational marginal pricing PDLMP is proposed.
@highlight The market clearing optimization process is handled in a distributed manner.
@highlight The proposed PDLMP motivates DERs to participate in active and reactive power control of distribution network.
@highlight Over voltage and congestion in distribution network are alleviated and maximum power of PVs is harvested.
