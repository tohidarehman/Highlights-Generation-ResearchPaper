 Solid waste and wastewater from post harvest coffee processing contain high carbohydrate content which can be used in biofuel production . However the recalcitrance of lignocellulosic material in the pulp and husk in addition to the polyphenols in wastewater limits its application . The objective of this research was to evaluate the coffee processing waste for H
