 The objectives of this study were to clarify the distribution as well as the removal mechanism of antibiotic resistance genes within three sludge treatment wetlands during a loading period of two years . Three STW units were constructed and run during the loading period Unit 1 built with aeration tubes Unit 2 built with aeration tubes and reeds and Unit 3 built with reeds only . All targeted ARGs

@highlight Targeted ARGs all increased in residual sludge in STWs during loading period.
@highlight All STWs could effectively remove target ARGs
@highlight  and 16S rRNA from sewage.
@highlight The removal of microorganisms could be a major process for AGR removal by STWs.
@highlight The levels of ARGs were correlated with
@highlight and 16S rRNA in STWs.
