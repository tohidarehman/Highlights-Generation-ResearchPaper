 In this paper an iron scrap filled tube plate PV T system was designed and manufactured . Its annual performance was simulated and the simulation results were verified by experimental data . The simulation results showed that the annual output of electricity was 792.6MJ and the annual heat collection was 2558.3MJ under the standard annual meteorological data of Tianjin China . Simulation results demonstrated that the annual average generation efficiency was 15.5 and the annual average heat collection efficiency was 49.1 . Moreover the electrical power generation and heat collection efficiencies increased by 13.9 and 10.8 after being filled with iron scraps respectively . Subsequently the energy economic and environmental benefits of the new tube plate PV T system were compared with those of the traditional tube plate PV T system photovoltaic system and solar collector system . The simulation results also showed that the annual total energy savings and CO
