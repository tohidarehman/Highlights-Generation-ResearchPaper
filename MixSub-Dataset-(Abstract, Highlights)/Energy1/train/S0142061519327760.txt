 It has already been shown in the literature that power transformers may be more accurately sized by their thermal limits than by their rated power limit . In practice however thermal limits are usually considered only in operations but not at planning stage where the more usual notion of rated power is used . This paper proposes a novel method to take into account thermal limits directly at planning stage . This is made possible by quantifying separately the impact of each generator and load on the temperature of the distribution transformer . Decoupling the effect of individual generators and loads is achieved by linearizing and rewriting the analytical expression of the hot spot transformer temperature . The practical value of the method is assessed using a real world dataset by estimating the increase in the hosting capacity of the considered transformer for additional generators and loads . Significant gains are obtained when the transformer is sized by generation in particular when photovoltaic generators are involved .

@highlight A linear criterion is designed to be equivalent to thermal limits of a transformer.
@highlight This linear criterion is shown to be usable in power systems planning.
@highlight Substantial transformer sizing gain can be achieved when feeding PV plants.
