 Anaerobic digestion has received significant attention in recent years due to dual benefits of waste diversion from landfill and bioenergy recovery . Among various temperature regimes digesters operated under thermophilic condition has potential to provide several advantages over mesophilic and psychrophilic conditions which include faster degradation of organics and higher energy recovery . However the operation of thermophilic digesters requires closer monitoring and control due to an additional risk of ammonia inhibition and irreversible acidification through the accumulation of volatile fatty acids . Conventional strategies to alleviate instabilities in thermophilic anaerobic digestion process have been focused primarily on the development of robust microbiome and co digestion of complementary substrates . On the other hand emerging strategies include the integration of digesters with microbial electrochemical systems and amendment of conductive additives . This review provides a critical overview of these strategies and summarizes research gaps to guide researchers and practitioners in the future research .

@highlight Process instabilities due to ammonia inhibition and acidification are reviewed.
@highlight Methods for improving process stability in thermophilic digesters are summarized.
@highlight Research gaps associated with the implementation of these methods are identified.
