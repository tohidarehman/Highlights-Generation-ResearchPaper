 Sodium calcium sulfur and chlorine in the flue gas of coal fired boilers are the main cause of ash deposition fouling in heat exchangers . However there are still many debates on the mechanism of ash deposition fouling due to the lack of direct micro evidence . This paper aims to clarify the initial deposition fouling characteristics of a high alkali coal by computer controlled scanning electron microscopy . The results demonstrate that temperature has an influence on the deposition fouling compounds . The crystalline compounds in the samples at 900C were mainly CaSO

@highlight The initial deposition fouling characteristics of a high alkali coal were studied.
@highlight Samples were stripped by molecular force.
@highlight A 3 layer structure of deposition fouling was observed.
@highlight The mechanism of the influence of sulfur and chlorine on deposition fouling was proposed.
@highlight A series of detailed microscopic maps of the deposition fouling process was obtained.
