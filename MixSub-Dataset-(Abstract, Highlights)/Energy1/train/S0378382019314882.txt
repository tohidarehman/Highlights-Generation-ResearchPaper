 The effect of Zr on the framework structure and acid strength of doped H SAPO 34 and H ZSM 5 was studied using the density functional theory considering dispersive interactions . The activity and selectivity in methanol to olefins conversion over Zr doped H SAPO 34 and H ZSM 5 were systematically evaluated as a function of frameworks structure and acid strength . The results were compared with those of their non doped counterparts . The results indicated that doping of Zr into H SAPO 34 exhibited larger pore volume whereas the doping of Zr into H ZSM 5 had little effect on pore volume . The acid strengths of both the Zr doped were reduced . It was found that doping of Zr into H SAPO 34 led to enhanced activity whereas doping of Zr into H ZSM 5 had either little or no effect on activity . It can be concluded that the steric constraints exerted by the larger cavity are favorable for the MTO conversion . Both Zr doped H SAPO 34 and H ZSM 5 exhibited relatively higher ethylene selectivity . The acid strength of is closely related to the product selectivity during MTO conversion . The catalysts with weaker acid strengths displayed a higher selectivity towards ethylene .

@highlight The Zr incorporation in molecular sieve framework can be used to modify the acid properties of molecular sieve.
@highlight Different cavity structured molecular sieves present different catalytic activity for MTO conversion.
@highlight The weak acid strength of molecular sieves presents higher selectivity towards ethylene.
