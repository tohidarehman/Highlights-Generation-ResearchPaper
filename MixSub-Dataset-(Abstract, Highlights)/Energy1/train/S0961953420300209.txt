 Lignin forms a recalcitrant structure in lignocellulosic biomass and hence huge amount of enzymes are required for disintegrating it into their subsequent components like glucose and other by products . Thus the pretreatment is an ineluctable step in the bioethanol scheme for the delignification of biomass and also the recovery of lignin an emerging value added polymer in many industrial applications . A green facile method was developed wherein humic acid acts as a catalyst and surfactant in the alkali pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse for the step reduction in lignin recovery scheme with phenomenal properties and enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis . HA assisted experiments were performed with and without calcium chloride CaCl

@highlight A humic acidalkali based protocol was developed for fractionation of lignocellulose.
@highlight Humic acid helps bypass multiple filtrations centrifugation and precipitation steps.
@highlight Isolated lignin showed unusual properties such as varied weight distributions.
@highlight Humic acidassisted protocol also achieved an increase in the glucose yield.
@highlight A novel pretreatment scheme is proposed for the better circular economy.
