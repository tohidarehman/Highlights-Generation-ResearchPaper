 Study on selenium transformation during coal combustion will facilitate the development of emissioncontrol technologies . A fixedbed reactor was used to conduct pyrolysis and combustion experiments involving three types of coal at 6001000C . In an inert atmosphere the release ratios of Se increased slowly as temperature increased varying between 56 and 74 for different coals at 1000C . All forms of Se in coal were thermally unstable and the conversion of Se in other forms into residual and organicbound Se occurred . In an oxidizing atmosphere the release ratios of Se differed significantly for different coals at low temperatures but approached 100 at 1000C . Each form of Se in coal was released in different ratios . The watersoluble and ionexchangeable Se and carbonate and oxidebound Se were produced in the solid products . The oxidizing atmosphere was more conducive to the release of Se because the sulfide and organicbound Se was fully oxidized . Se could be converted into watersoluble and ionexchangeable form and released less in Carich coal . Sulfur prohibited Ca from adsorbing Se by forming CaSO

@highlight Se transformations during pyrolysis and combustion of coals were investigated.
@highlight An oxidizing atmosphere facilitated the release of Se from the coal.
@highlight Se forms differ in stability and may convert to other form during thermal process.
@highlight The effect of inorganic contents in the coal on Se transformation was discussed.
