 In this study pinewood sawdust was liquefied in either ethanol water co solvents or pure water at 300C for 30min and 10wt of feedstock loading with or without the use of Na

@highlight Alkali catalyzed liquefaction of pinewood sawdust was performed in ethanol water co solvents.
@highlight Maximum bio crude oil yield of 48wt was obtained.
@highlight Alkali lowered the oil yield when using ethanol water mixed solvents as the reaction medium.
