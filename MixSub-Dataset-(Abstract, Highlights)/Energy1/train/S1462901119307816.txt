 A central challenge facing the study the environmental governance is the lack of commonunderstanding of important concepts . Critical concepts such as social boundaries property rights and resource dependence are selected and measured inconsistently across research projects and field settings producing results that are difficult to compare . This stymies the accumulation of scientific evidence regarding the most effective ways to address challenging environmental problems . As members of the Social ecological systems meta analysis database project we have addressed this challenge by developing a repository of variables associated with many of the most important concepts across a range of fields related to environmental governance . In this paper we describe the infrastructure behind the repository the range of variables it includes and how it can enable scholars across a range of fields to more systematically select and measure the variables to include in their analyses .

@highlight Inconsistencies in variable selection and measurement limit social ecological studies.
@highlight These limitations relate to a suite of methodological challenges.
@highlight A new variables repository helps users diagnose and measure key factors.
@highlight Through this resource more comparable research can be done across cases.
