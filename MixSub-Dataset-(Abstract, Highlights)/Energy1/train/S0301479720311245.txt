 Aqueous phase reforming coupled to catalytic wet air oxidation has been investigated as an approach to remove phenolic compounds from wastewater converting them into valuable gases . Partial oxidation of phenol was achieved in the first CWAO stage trying to minimize mineralization so to allow a high yield to valuable gases in the second APR stage . APR runs were carried out with different mixtures of compounds corresponding to phenol oxidation pathway and representing different degrees of oxidation in CWAO stage . A range of TOC and COD removal was observed in APR stage for the single compounds with higher removal for long chain acids . Likewise long chain acids provided with the highest conversion to gases . APR of mixtures rich in acids gave the highest yield to CH

@highlight APR CWAO coupling to remove and valorise phenolic compounds bearing wastewater.
@highlight APR CWAO resulted in a similar TOC and COD removal than direct APR.
@highlight Methane and hydrogen are the main components in the gas produced by APR CWAO.
@highlight Conversion to gases and methane yield are higher in APR CWAO than in APR.
