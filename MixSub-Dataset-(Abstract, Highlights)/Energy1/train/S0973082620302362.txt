 Off grid renewable energy technologies are important in improving electricity access for rural communities . However methods for ensuring their sustainable operation are often poorly understood . In this article existing approaches for the assessment of off grid projects are examined . Reliability of the technology financial viability and community engagement are identified as the 3 key areas governing the sustainability of projects . Focusing on these areas a methodology is proposed to understand the sustainability of micro hydropower plants . A mixed methods approach including a maintenance assessment and interviews with managers operators and consumers is used to evaluate 24 sites in Nepal . Technically the results of the study showed that trained operators delivered a higher standard of maintenance however technical issues were identified that arise during the design manufacture and installation phases . The financial viability of plants was aided by charging consumers based on consumption whilst plants with a higher rated capacity tended to benefit from a larger number of productive end uses . Community engagement was fostered through the local identity of the plant however this was threatened by societal changes . Inherent features of the site such as rated power and the population density internal resilience to short term shock events and long term external development were found to affect the sustainability of plants .

@highlight Inherent site features affect the sustainability of micro hydropower plants.
@highlight Internal short term events and long term external changes affect the plants.
@highlight Threats to reliability can develop during the design manufacture and installation of technology.
@highlight Consumers are often willing to pay more but low tariffs reduce the available plant income.
