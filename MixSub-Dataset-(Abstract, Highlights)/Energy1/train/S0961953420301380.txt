 The aim of this research it is to show how the biogas anaerobic digestion from treatment of recycled pulp and paper wastewater industry can be a renewable energy . Furthermore a kinetic study of hydrolyzed COD and productions of methane from UASB digester treating RPPW for the continuous test is established . This will allow to reduce the organic matter deposited in landfills and CO

@highlight Anaerobic treatment for RPPW by UASB digester under mesophilic conditions .
@highlight Energy generated was 6.336 kJ gCOD removed and Electrical energy 510703MWh year .
@highlight 84 COD and 48 TS were removed at an OLR of 7g COD L.d .
@highlight At optimal OLR was required to produce average 46L d CH
@highlight Methane yields were 250.9 mLCH
@highlight  gCOD removed.
