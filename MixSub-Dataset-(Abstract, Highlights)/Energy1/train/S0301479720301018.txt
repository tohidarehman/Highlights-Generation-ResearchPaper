 A methodology to evaluate groundwater vulnerability was developed and tested in a case study in the Central Valleys of the state of Oaxaca Mexico a region known for intensive agricultural activities and poor water management policies . An analysis was conducted to create and evaluate scenarios reflecting anthropogenic and natural stressors on groundwater using an analytical hierarchy process and geographic information systems . Uncertainty in the vulnerability model was assessed using a Monte Carlo analysis . Five indices abstraction

@highlight Water mining recharge runoff pollution and marginalization reveal vulnerability.
@highlight A vulnerability index is developed to evaluate areas with limited and scarce data.
@highlight Pollution and withdrawals of groundwater are expected to rise in vulnerable areas.
@highlight Population growth and poverty increase vulnerability in the Central Valleys.
@highlight Policies should regulate groundwater abstraction and protect recharge zones.
