 In this paper an enhanced distributed maximum power point tracking algorithm along with an improved hybrid modulation method for a photovoltaic module level Cascaded HBridge inverter is proposed . The advantages and drawbacks of the CHB topology in distributed PV generation systems are highlighted . The main benefits are related to the higher granularity of the PV power control which mitigates mismatch effects thus increasing the power harvesting . Nevertheless heavy unbalanced configurations need to be properly addressed by means of dedicated control action . The proposed control strategy allows to overcome the operating limits of PV CHB inverter by integrating in the MPPT algorithm a limitation of the individual cell modulation index . Experimental tests carried out on a laboratory prototype of a singlephase sevenlevel PV CHB inverter evidence the effectiveness of the proposed control and modulation approach in terms of extended operating range and MPPT efficiency .

@highlight This paper is focused on the control and modulation of a PV module level CHB inverter.
@highlight An enhanced DMPPT algorithm extends the operating range of the PV CHB inverter.
@highlight In case of deep mismatch the DMPPT properly control the modulation index of each power cell.
