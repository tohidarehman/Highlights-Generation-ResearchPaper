 Future climate scenarios predict significant changes in the availability of water resources at global and regional scales . Knowledge of the possible economic consequences of this are limited by a shortage of data linking economic activity with physical water use . Matching a unique premise level dataset to economic indicators at industrial sector level this paper undertakes a decomposition of changes in industrial water demand for Scotland between 2012 and 2016 . Results highlight the importance of taking a sectoral approach as changes in sectoral water intensity are significant . Furthermore changes in the structure of the economy i.e . a move away from water intensive industries highlight further reductions in overall water consumption . By considering future scenarios for Scottish water resources this paper identifies key multi disciplinary research challenges to address the major obstacles in developing a climate ready water policy which also captures the potential economic opportunities for Scotland from an awareness of the role of water in the economy .

@highlight We decompose changes in industrial water demand in Scotland between 2012 and 2016.
@highlight Changes in sectoral water intensity a key factor explaining fall in water demand.
@highlight Role of electricity generation policies aimed at encouraging renewables important.
@highlight Future changes in water availability demand and technologies important to examine.
