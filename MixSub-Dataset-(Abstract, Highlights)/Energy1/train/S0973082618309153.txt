 Over the years a significant need has been established to develop stove testing protocols that reflect the performance of fuel stove combinations in the field better . This is particularly true for alcohol based liquid fuels widely seen as a future replacement for kerosene fuels in the informal and less affluent communities of South Africa . This paper aimed to evaluate three liquid fuelled stoves using cooking sequences derived from a typical township in Johannesburg South Africa based on a contextual testing approach which is a revised in situ testing protocol based on the Uncontrolled Cooking Test . The devices were evaluated and rated based on their intended contexts of use in South Africa using the new contextual testing protocol which was combined with the old Heterogeneous Stove Testing Protocol . Overall results showed that there are no significant differences

@highlight Evaluation of three methanol stoves using cooking sequences derived from Setswetla Johannesburg South Africa
@highlight Presentation of a contextual testing approach
@highlight No significant differences between averaged cooking sequences and the uncontrolled cooking task
@highlight Information obtained in the field on actual use conditions may be valuable to stove developers and disseminators.
@highlight Laboratory test sequence with the same power levels for cooking food produced nearly the same results as a UCT.
