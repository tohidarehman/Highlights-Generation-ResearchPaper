 Water consumption has become a serious concern in renewable fuel production as demand for biofuels increases to address environmental issues associated with the use of fossil fuels . In recent years several research groups have suggested seawater as a promising alternative to fresh water for the production of biofuels . However the use of seawater rather than fresh water in the fermentation process is still a relatively unexplored area of research . In this paper the tolerance of the marine yeast

@highlight Seawater was successfully used for bioethanol production using marine yeast.
@highlight High ethanol productivity was achieved using sugarcane molasses prepared in seawater.
@highlight Marine yeasts showed high tolerance to osmotic stresses induced by sugar and salts.
@highlight Multi stage fermentation improved the productivity of ethanol production.
