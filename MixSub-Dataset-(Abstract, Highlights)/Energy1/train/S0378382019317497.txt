 Facing increasingly severe environmental problems and substantial energy demand chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling is regarded as a highly promising technique to facilitate the application of carbon capture storage and utilization due to its inherent gas separation . Thus feasible oxygen carriers for continuous operation on the industry scale are essential . A combination of Mn and Si which is not only economic but also has few adverse effects on the environment has been tested and found to provide satisfactory CLOU behavior . But the results are relevant for several oxygen carrier applications . However the mechanical properties of these Mn Si oxygen carriers require further improvement . Thus two kinds of support materials are chosen in this study CaO and Al

@highlight 24 Mn Si oxygen carriers supported on CaO or Al
@highlight were tested.
@highlight Test was done in a batch reactor on material.
@highlight Calcination temperature had less effect on Al
@highlight as support material.
@highlight On material tested in a continuous 300W unit achieved 99.98mol conversion.
