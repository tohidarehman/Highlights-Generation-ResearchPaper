 Chromium contamination poses serious threats to the environment and human health . Thus batch and column experiments were performed to investigate hexavalent chromium removal from solution and porous media using nanoscale zerovalent iron nanoparticles stabilized by sodium carboxymethyl cellulose . Batch experiments indicated that the mass ratio of Fe CMC 1 the presence of 150200mgL

@highlight Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose modified NZVI CMC NZVI was synthesized.
@highlight Cr VI removal is enhanced with decreased pH and increased CMC NZVI and Cr VI .
@highlight Optimized CMC is needed to enhance Cr VI removal and avoid shielding effect.
@highlight CMC increases NZVI mobility and the availability for Cr VI in porous media.
@highlight Cr VI is removed by CMC NZVI via adsorption reduction and co precipitation.
