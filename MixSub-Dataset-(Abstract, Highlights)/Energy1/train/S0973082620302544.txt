 Industrial process heating has been identified as a potential field for solar thermal applications . In this paper a comparative study was carried out on the performance of an individual solar collector under laboratory conditions and performance of the collector array under field condition . Compound Parabolic Concentrator has been used as a solar collector for the application of boiler feed water preheating . The characterization of CPC has been done in liquid phase with water as a working fluid as per the standard IS 16648 2017 . The optical efficiency of the CPC is found to be 64.8 under standard test conditions . In the field total 200 number of CPCs each having 3m

@highlight There are many parameters which affect the performance of the solar collectors under actual field conditions which are often not given due consideration which creates a gap in the expected output and the actual performance of the solar field. The objective of the present study is to compare the performance of the CPC collector under standard test conditions and at actual field conditions. The study will help in designing the solar field considering the parameters responsible for lower performance under actual field conditions which will give more accurate performance results in the field.
@highlight Comparison of available test standards for testing of solar thermal collectors was done. Performance of the compound parabolic collector was tested as per IS 16648 Part 5 2017 in the test centre. Field performance of collector was evaluated while integrated with industrial process heat application. Reasons of performance deviations in standard test conditions and field operation have been analyzed which can be considered while designing the solar system to meet the required heat demand.
