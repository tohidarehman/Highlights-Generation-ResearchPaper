 Battery energy storage systems have attracted much attention as a key device for realizing the installation of photovoltaic plants in distribution networks . To improve the cost effectiveness of BESSs multipurpose utilization is required . In addition the BESSs in a distribution network are generally used over a decade or more and the role and size of BESSs may change according to the distribution networks condition such as the PVP penetration level . Consequently an ad hoc BESS installation may increase excess BESS capacity which is detrimental to cost effectiveness . Therefore a multipurpose utilization and planning method is desired for BESSs . This paper proposes a multipurpose control and planning method for BESSs to cope with the increase of large scale PVPs in distribution networks . The proposed method executes power smoothing reverse power flow prevention and state of charge adjustment without interactions between controls and it determines a suitable BESS site and type based on three indices BESS capacity the number of tap operations of an on load tap changer and a step voltage regulator and PVP curtailment . The BESS is used for power smoothing of a substation PVPs and RPF prevention at the substation . To evaluate the impact of the BESS installation on tap operation and PVP curtailment the voltage regulation methods of OLTC SVR and PVP inverters were implemented . According to the results the substation was selected as a suitable BESS site regardless of the number of PVPs and BESS type . Furthermore lithium ion battery was the preferred BESS type when PVP penetration rate was less than 67 and redox flow battery was selected as the BESS type when the PR was 100 . The simulation results indicate that the MCP method can achieve multipurpose control and determine the suitable BESS site and type .

@highlight The proposed multipurpose control and planning method determined the suitable BESS site and type.
