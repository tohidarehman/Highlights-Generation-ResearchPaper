 Within the so called bioliq process renewable carbon resources especially agricultural residues are converted to gasoline . The process chain comprises pyrolysis of the feedstocks gasification to synthesis gas gas cleaning and conversion of synthesis gas to dimethyl ether followed by conversion of DME to hydrocarbons . Construction of all process units has been completed now and the entire plant has been successfully operated in several campaigns . Thus hundreds of liters of a new alternative gasoline are available now which allow for an extensive testing . The basic characteristics of the resulting bioliq 100 fuel are described . It is rich in aromatics and a blend consisting of 90Vol . of conventional RON95 E5 fuel and 10Vol . of bioliq 100 designated as bioliq 10 has been produced which meets the DIN EN 228 standard . Initial measurements on a single cylinder research engine have been carried out focusing on efficiency and emissions . A comparison of bioliq 10 with neat RON95 E5 revealed an improved knocking behavior of bioliq 10 even by a small fraction of regenerative bioliq fuel . Particle as well as hydrocarbon emissions from bioliq 10 are significantly higher than in the case of RON95 E5 . Increased particle emissions are attributed to the higher content of aromatics . Soot reactivity has been investigated and soot from bioliq 10 exhibits higher reactivity than soot from RON95 E5 .

@highlight Produced a gasoline from straw which thermodynamic properties are similar to conventional gasoline
@highlight Improved knocking behavior compared to conventional RON95 E5 fuel
@highlight Optimization of the start of injection improve the particle emission in the vicinityof conventional gasoline
@highlight The bioliq provides soot with a higher reactivity which improves GPF regeneration
