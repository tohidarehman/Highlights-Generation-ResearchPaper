 There has been a rise in environmental collaboratives as a form of watershed governance . These collaboratives depend on a diversity of organizations acting collectively by pooling their resources yet little information exists as to why organizations decide to become involved in these initiatives . This study attempts to identify why organizations involved in watershed partnerships decide to participate by assessing external and internal motivations . We used Q method to survey 38 representatives from 32 organizations currently participating by investing time or resources in these partnerships in the Intermountain Western United States . Factor analysis revealed six distinct perspectives organizations hold that influence their decision to participate . Our findings differ from the broader environmental management literature in that internal motivations played a much larger role in organizations motivations for participation . Specific categories of internal motivations that were important included 1 Environmental Mission 2 Environmental Leadership and 3 Wildfire Information . Results suggest that diverse strategies are needed to engage potential partner organizations in watershed collaboratives .
