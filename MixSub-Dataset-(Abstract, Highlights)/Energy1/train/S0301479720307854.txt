 Coal dust diffusion during coal transportation and storage causes serious environmental pollution . The existing dust suppressant in previous studies was unable to achieve the expected effects owing to severe wind damage and rain erosion . Therefore the current study synthesized and prepared an efficient and applicable dust suppressant for coal transportation and storage . Infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope experiments were conducted during the synthesis to analyze the microstructure changes in the synthetic products . Moreover viscosity was used as the evaluation index in the single factor experiments to obtain the optimal synthesis conditions . Performance measurement results showed that the prepared dust suppressant had a strong protective effect on coal powder and could effectively resist the impact of wind damage and rain erosion . Compared with other dust suppressants the proposed dust suppressant prepared showed more evident positive effects and longer lasting action time in the quantitative test . Moreover the dried product could synergistically combust with coal powder thereby possibly mitigating the tedious post treatment process and increasing the utilization rate of resources .

@highlight Comparing with other products the prepared product could resist harsh environment.
@highlight The product has a long lasting effect and it will not cause secondary pollution.
@highlight The product is environmentally friendly and biodegradable.
@highlight The synergistic combustion of product and coal reduces waste of resources.
