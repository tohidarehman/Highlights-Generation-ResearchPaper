 The frequency behaviour of a grounding grid can not be neglected in insulation coordination studies . This paper proposes a new approach which consists of calculating the frequency behaviour of a grounding grid by means of a software which implements the electromagnetic theory building a two port component whose internal admittances are defined as rational functions in the Laplace domain and finally using this two port component for time domain fast transient simulations .
