 In urban underground environment a short conduit is commonly used to provide mechanical protection for the cable . The cable section buried in the short conduit may experience excessive thermal stresses . However the thermal rating for the cable in the short conduit is not specialized in the IEC 60287 . It has not been sufficiently addressed in the literature either . This paper proposes a quasi three dimensional thermal model for the cable installed in the short conduit . A simplified model for efficiently and effectively solving the proposed model is then developed . Based on the simplified thermal model an improved method for assessing the real time ampacity of the cable installed in the short conduit is implemented . The performance of the improved method with respect to the IEC method on thermal rating for the cable installed in the short conduit is verified by the Finite Element Analysis . The results show that the improved method outperforms the IEC method when the conduit length is less than five meters . The method is useful in real time thermal rating of the short conduit cables and paves a way to increase the utilization of cables installed in short conduits while still ensuring their reliability .
