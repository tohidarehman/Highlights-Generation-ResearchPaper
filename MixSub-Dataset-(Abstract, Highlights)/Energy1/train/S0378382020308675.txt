 Chemical Looping Gasification is a dual fluidized bed gasification technique where an oxygen carrier is used as bed material instead of sand . An optimized process could have several advantages including i one concentrated CO

@highlight LD slag successfully transported oxygen to achieve partial oxidation.
@highlight Higher char conversion rate was achieved with LD slag compared to sand and olivine.
@highlight LD slag may generate syngas with high H
@highlight  CO ratio via gasification of biochar.
@highlight generation by water splitting was indicated with reduced LD slag.
@highlight LD slag catalyze the water gas shift reaction.
