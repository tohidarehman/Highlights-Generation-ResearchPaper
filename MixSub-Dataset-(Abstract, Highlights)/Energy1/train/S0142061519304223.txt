 When it comes to renewable energy applications the Modular Multilevel Converter is considered as one of the most promising converter topologies . In this paper the MMC is used for integrating the Photovoltaic strings to the grid . The PV strings are connected to the MMC submodules through a DC DC converter which facilitates the independent MPPT implementation . For satisfactory operation of MMC it is important to maintain a balanced voltage across the SMs . In addition the total generated power by the PV strings should be uniformly distributed among the three phases . These requirements are considered as challenging tasks during different inhomogeneous irradiation conditions . The proposed method is capable of balancing the SMs capacitor voltages and at the same time inherently generating a DC and fundamental frequency components of the circulating currents inside the MMC without using a controller . These circulating current components are responsible for equally distributing the total generated power by the PV strings among all phases . As a result balanced three phase currents are injected into the grid . The proposed method is verified through extensive simulation during different irradiation conditions .
