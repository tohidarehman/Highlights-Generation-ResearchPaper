 Participation of relevant stakeholders knowledge integration responsive and emergent design and effective boundary management are four key features of transdisciplinary research . These features pose significant challenges to both undertaking TDR and evaluating its societal impact . We argue that TDRs context specificity and complexity warrant an evaluation approach that supports the coordinating team in developing these key features . In light of this this article aims to reconcile two distinct foci of TDR evaluation namely supporting transdisciplinary capacity building and impact evaluation . We share the results from a combined approach in which the authors acted both as facilitators and evaluators of a TDR project to conduct an embedded formative evaluation . Our findings show that the approach allowed for better access to the participants and sensitivity to their perspectives on impact and for enhanced understanding of complex internal and external project dynamics and how these shaped the project . This resulted in a meaningful assessment of TDRs societal impacts and enabled attributing these to specific process elements . Moreover the approach supported the coordinating TDR teams capacities for developing key TDR features . Four TDR capacities were identified

@highlight Impact assessment and transdisciplinary capacity building were combined in one evaluation study.
@highlight The two evaluation foci worked complementary and enhanced access and understanding of the project.
@highlight Transdisciplinary research impacts were identified and attributed to the research process.
@highlight The project team built transdisciplinary capacities which advanced the projects quality.
