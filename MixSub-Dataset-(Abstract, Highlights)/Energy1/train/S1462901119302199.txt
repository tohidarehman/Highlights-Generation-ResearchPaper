 The population of absentee landholders in rural areas of Australia and worldwide has risen over recent decades underpinning the need to better understand how to effectively engage this stakeholder group especially from natural resource management agencies . Prior research argues that these often difficult to reach rural actors play an important role in environmental management biodiversity conservation and cross property collaborations . Therefore this paper investigates the ways in which absentee landholders access information on land management practices the extent of their engagement with government NRM agencies and the potential for absentee landholders to engage in cross property collaboration .
