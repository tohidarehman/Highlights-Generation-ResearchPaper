 This paper investigates the impact of the oxidizing agent used in the physical activation of pyrolysis chars on activated carbons and their efficiency in tar cracking . The materials are produced from buckwheat husk which is a French local biomass . Slow pyrolysis was chosen to favor the production of raw chars . Activated chars were then prepared by physical activation under steam or CO

@highlight Oxidizing agent impact the activated carbon features and its reactivity.
@highlight Steam physical activation of pyrolysis char is better than CO
@highlight to crack the tars.
@highlight Surface area and mineral composition are key properties to crack the tars.
@highlight One of the reason of char and activated carbon deactivation is the coke deposition.
