 Rice straw is an abundant renewable and energy rich agricultural biomass . Energy recovery in the form of biomethane from rice straw can be a sustainable process . However one of the drawbacks associated with this process is the recalcitrant nature of rice straw which necessitates energy intensive expensive and polluting thermochemical pretreatment of the substrate . Fiber digesting anaerobic fungi have the ability to degrade the plant biomass . Hence the present investigation was undertaken to enhance the biodegradation and subsequently the biomethanation of rice straw by supplementing the startup inoculum with anaerobic fiber digesting fungus

@highlight Enhanced biomethanation of rice straw with
@highlight augmentation is illustrated.
@highlight facilitated 80 degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose during AD.
@highlight 315L CH
@highlight  kg VS of rice straw was obtained without thermochemical pretreatment.
@highlight Methane yield in digester operated in steady state was 95 of theoretical yield.
