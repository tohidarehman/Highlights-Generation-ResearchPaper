 This paper proposes a measurement based online distributed optimization framework for coordinating networked distributed energy resources in distribution networks focusing on the security constrained optimal dispatch of networked DERs . This framework involves an interaction between the distribution management system and DERs all of which are deemed as intelligent agents responsible for fast computation measurement and communication . Specifically the DMS identifies variations of system demand or fluctuations of power generation by measuring voltage amplitudes and branch flows throughout the feeder to build regulating signals which are transmitted to the DERs subsequently the DERs adjust their power outputs independently to reach the optimal configuration according to the regulating signals while satisfying necessary constraints . Thus the proposed measurement based optimization framework can track the time varying disturbances of a system while eliminating the approximation error caused by the linearized power flow model . Simulations on IEEE 33 bus and real world 110 bus distribution networks are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method .
