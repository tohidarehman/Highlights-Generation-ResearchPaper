 This study aims to disclose the role of molecular interactions of iso octane ethanol blend during droplet combustion . The iso octane ethanol composition which has the potential to form molecular clusters was analyzed using integer interaction modeling with mole ratio . Comparison of mole based compositions was converted to a volume base to verify empirically using the single droplet burning method . The molecular interaction analysis gave the composition close to the molecular cluster composition was 10 15 25 40 50 60 70 80 and 90 v v. Ethanol fractions of 20 and 30 v v were also tested using the same method as a mixture that do not form the molecular cluster . This study shows that the total molecular interaction forces on molecular clusters are inversely proportional to puffing events during single droplet combustion . The number of free molecules that do not form molecular clusters tends to produce micro explosions at the final stage of single droplet combustion . The research also revealed that the increasing ethanol fractions in molecular clusters tends to reduce the combustion rate constant exponentially .

@highlight The potential for molecular cluster formation is due to the interaction of iso octane ethanol molecules
@highlight Molecular interaction forces of molecular groups correlate with thermal expansion
@highlight Increasing the ethanol fraction mixture decreases the rate of combustion constant
