 Microalgae has huge potential towards biological nutrient removal but the challenges are remains in maximizing the biomass yield and so nutrient pollutant removal efficiency . In this study a response surface methodology central composite design was applied to investigate the significant process variables and its interaction effect on biomass yield of effluent acclimatized microalgae

@highlight Effect of culture condition on biomass yield in ozone pre treated tannery effluent.
@highlight has shown better remediation potential over other species studied.
@highlight Under optimized conditions the maximum biomass yield attained was 1.06g L.
@highlight Significant removal attained was 90 C 90 N 100 P 82 COD and 100 Chromium
@highlight The high lipid accumulation potential was observed for
@highlight  40 .
