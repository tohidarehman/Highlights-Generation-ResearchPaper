 Achieving urban regeneration through the creation of new green areas is a widely promoted strategy to improve the quality of life in densely built neighborhoods . De sealing actions can compensate for the creation of new built up areas as demonstrated by the EU funded Life project Save our Soils for LIFE in which guidelines for de sealing have been published . For the generation of new urban greening it is important to know the characteristics of the soils used in order to better define the most appropriate landscaping decisions and management practices . In this study the physical and chemical characteristics of topsoils and technosols were assessed in relation to growth and leaf gas exchanges in two ornamental species

@highlight Topsoils excavated from building sites should be used in urban regeneration projects.
@highlight The analysis of topsoils is important for the choice of plant species and irrigation management.
@highlight If not contaminated urban technosols can be also used as substrates for plant growth.
@highlight Technosols can show higher drainage and relatively higher nutritional content than topsoils.
@highlight optimal soil moisture is 32 in clay loam soil and 26 in a sandy loam soil.
