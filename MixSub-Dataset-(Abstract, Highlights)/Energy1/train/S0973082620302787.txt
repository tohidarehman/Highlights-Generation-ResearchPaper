 Utilization of hydro power as a renewable energy source is now of prime importance in the world . Hydropower energy is available in abundance as a renewable source . For run of river low head reaction type Kaplan turbines mostly used . In this paper a parametric study has been conducted on a complex geometry of Kaplan blade through static and dynamic computational analysis by varying the blade profile at different angles in the CAD model . Blade geometry surface and design were developed in Creo using the coordinate point system on the blade .

@highlight A robust computational model for Kaplan turbine is developed and verified.
@highlight Study and research work led to an enhancement of 5.43 in turbine performance.
@highlight A method is devised that resulted in markable financial impact on monthly savings.
