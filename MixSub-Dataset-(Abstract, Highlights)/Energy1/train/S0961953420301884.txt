 World energy consumption is increasing due both to industrial use and to increased per capita income of the population . This energy comes mainly from fossil fuel sources . Thus international public policy agendas have been encouraging the replacement of this non renewable energy source and diversification of the electrical matrix by including renewable energy . Thus the aim was to evaluate Brazilian energy potential using animal manure and sewage using governmental platform records for cattle chickens sheep swine buffalo and horses their respective average waste production and sewage collection data from Brazilian municipalities . Mathematical models based on multiple linear regressions were prepared and used to obtain electricity generating potential . As a result of the calculations a potential of 20.582 13.731 11.327 10.296 e 8.793TWh year

@highlight Brazilian energy potential using organic wastes were evaluated.
@highlight Models were prepared and used to obtain electricity generating potential.
@highlight Total annual estimated energy potential was 64.73TWh.
