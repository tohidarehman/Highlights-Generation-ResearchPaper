 With the rapid growth in population and urbanization sustainable disposal of sewage sludge has become a prominent problem worldwide . Therefore an adequate treatment is required to reduce the environmental impacts created from traditional methods such as incineration landfill etc . In this context sewage sludge was liquefied hydrothermally under sub supercritical conditions with and without catalyst K

@highlight The temperature had a negligible influence while the catalyst slightly improved the bio crude yield and quality.
@highlight Lower nitrogen content was found in catalytic bio crudes.
@highlight Approximately 80 of the heavy metals were concentrated in the solid phase.
@highlight The leaching action of citric acid not only removed 40 of ash content but also reduced 38 of the fat content.
