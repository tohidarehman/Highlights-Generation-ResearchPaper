 Artisanal and Small scale Mining activities continue to grow in many resource endowed countries with ASM generated revenues serving as a precursor to socio economic growth especially in mineral rich rural communities . However the rapid proliferation of this extractive activity into new frontiers often extends to territories where traditionally agricultural activities may already be present . Considering the destructive effects of the ASM life cycle on the environment concerns have been raised regarding the negative agricultural impacts of ASM . Thus in this paper we review the Janus faced nature of ASM as discourses have developed in the burgeoning literature . Our review reveals an emerging narrative suggesting that in some instances ASM and agriculture complement each other with beneficial consequences . Nevertheless this highly informal type of mining can have deleterious effects on agriculture through three main mechanisms land degradation and farm invasions water and mercury pollution and the

@highlight We review the complementarity of Artisanal and Small scale Mining and agriculture.
@highlight Communities can both benefit or be harmed through ASM effects on agriculture.
@highlight Land degradation water pollution and labour shifts are the main harm mechanisms.
@highlight Most ASM happens in rural agricultural communities so vulnerabilities increase.
@highlight Resources policy should ensure accommodation of both sectors in rural economies.
