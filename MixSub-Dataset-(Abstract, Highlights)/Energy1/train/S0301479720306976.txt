 Wool is a biodegradable fiber rich in nutrients and can be recycled in soil as a fertilizer for maximum benefits . The present study was planned with the hypothesis that waste wool could be used as a nutrient source or manure to forage crops and aim of this study was to identify practicable recycling options of sheep based wastes in agriculture . In our study we have compared the effect of different sheep based organic wastes on soil health crop productivity and water use . Application of waste wool in soil significantly improved the fertility status of soil and considerable improvement was also observed in organic carbon and nitrogen i.e . around 30.8 and 32.6 higher over control . The activities of soil enzymes were 1030 and 320 higher in waste wool treatment as compared to control and sheep based manures respectively . Application of waste wool not only improved soil health but produced 50 higher grain and dry fodder yield of barley over control . The improvement in physical properties of soil with waste wool resulted in higher water use efficiency of the system . Our study will help in distinguishing choices for safe use of organic wastes along with up gradation of soil health and crop water utilization particularly in nutrient poor soils of arid and semi arid region of India .

@highlight Presently no proven recycling options for 1015 of waste wool produced annually in the world.
@highlight Waste wool could be used as nutrient source and organic amendment in agriculture.
@highlight Application of waste wool to soil enhanced about 30 organic carbon and nitrogen in soil.
@highlight Waste wool application resulted in 50 higher yield and 30 water use efficiency over control.
@highlight Higher 1127 soil enzymatic activity indicates higher biological fertility of soil.
