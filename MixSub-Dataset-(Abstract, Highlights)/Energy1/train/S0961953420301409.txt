 Changes to energy systems are needed in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change . This study assessed the climate change mitigation potential in terms of temperature change over time of a new combined heat and power plant including the dynamic effect on an existing fourth generation district heating system . The climate impact of combusting forest residues was compared with combusting municipal solid waste waste wood or hard coal . A scenario with wood chip combustion and carbon capture and storage was also assessed . The district heating system in Stockholm Sweden was used as a case study for the assessment . The results clearly show climate change mitigation potential of combusting wood chips compared with hard coal and MSW with this climate benefit increasing further with BECCS . The results also demonstrate the importance of time dynamic effects in the energy system and temperature response highlighting the importance of not postponing implementation of climate change mitigation options if agreed climate targets are to be met on time .

@highlight This LCA integrated dynamic effects using the climate and energy system models.
@highlight BECCS further increases the climate change mitigation potential.
@highlight Implementation of climate change mitigation options should not be delayed.
@highlight There is value in taking an integrated dynamic perspective on energy systems.
