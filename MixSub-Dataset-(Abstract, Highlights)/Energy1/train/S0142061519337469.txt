 During emergencies alternative power system operation that utilizes local assets to energize local loads will change the face of the situation . While distributed generators such as PV or wind turbines can be utilized for generation plug in electric vehicles can act as mobile generators . Different strategies for forming dynamic and networked microgrids utilizing the local generation during emergencies have been widely proposed in literature . However the underlying communication required for optimal formation of dynamic microgrids and energy management during emergencies is not discussed . Addressing this gap this paper develops a communication based energy management system for emergency cases based on IEC 61850 standard . The IEC 61850 based communication modeling provides interoperability and serves for plug and play purposes . Furthermore for establishing communication during emergencies the concept of Cognitive Radio is proposed in this scheme . Simulation results show the feasibility of modeling and acceptability of its performance .
