 Biodiesel as an alternative fuel for petroleum derived fuel has gained significant attention from society . In this research work biodiesel is produced via simultaneous esterification and transesterification of chicken fat and skin oil over Ce supported sulfated activated carbon derived from coconut shell AC

@highlight Chicken fat and skin oil was used as a potential feedstock for synthesis biodiesel.
@highlight Sulfated Ce supported activated carbon favored biodiesel enriched product.
@highlight Reaction favored simultaneous esterification and transesterification of chicken fat and skin oil.
@highlight Sulfated Ce supported activated carbon exhibits good reusability.
