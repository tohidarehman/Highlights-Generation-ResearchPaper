 The compensation of upstream protective area should be determined carefully . This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for economic assessments on the treatment of wastewater discharged into a river basin . We explore the rational costs of compensation and the funding allocation in the Xin an River basin based on rate agreements . The compensation is determined in accordance with the total compensation model based on the opportunity cost method and allocated by the method of information entropy . In this study we identify the total compensation payment and distribution of funds in each district and county in the upstream area . Results show that the She county can receive the highest compensation and the Tunxi district deserves the lowest compensation . In addition this paper demonstrates that the existing compensation is insufficient for the reduction of water pollutants in the upstream area . Our findings contribute to the existing schemes of ecosystem services payment and improve the environmental decision making .
