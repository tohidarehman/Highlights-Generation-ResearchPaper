 A novel sorbent based separation process has been developed to selectively remove target molecules from the real fast pyrolysis pine bio oils . Specifically zeolitic molecular sieves and functionalized polymeric resins were found to effectively reduce carbonyl content and carboxylic acid number of a real pine fast pyrolysis bio oils therefore enhance bio oil stability and preserve down stream catalyst . Our results provide the first time evidence on the potential effectiveness of sorption technology strategy for dealing with real FP bio oils reducing the carbonyl rich FP oils from 7.5mmolg

@highlight This study investigated selective sorption on real fast pyrolysis oil which could improve the stability of bio oil and be beneficial to bio fuel production.
@highlight This work identified sorbent materials that enable the selective removal or reduction of carbonyl and carboxylic acid species which cause FP bio oil instability.
@highlight Surrogate study and CO
@highlight isotherms helped to understand the solvent addition effects and sorption mechanisms.
