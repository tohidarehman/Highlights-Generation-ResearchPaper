 There has been significant recent interest in local electricity trading platforms and particularly in the application of distributed ledger and blockchain technology for distributed or peer to peer energy trading in local energy communities . Several projects worldwide have demonstrated this concept on a small scale in Low Voltage distribution networks and microgrids . However previous work in this area has not sufficiently addressed the potential impacts of peer to peer energy trading and other local electricity trading mechanisms on the control operation and planning of the electricity distribution networks . Accordingly this paper presents a methodology for the co simulation of power distribution networks and local peer to peer energy trading platforms . The distribution system simulator is interfaced with a peer to peer energy trading platform which employs a blockchain based distributed double auction trade mechanism . The presented co simulation approach is demonstrated using a case study of typical European suburban distribution network . It is demonstrated in the paper that this approach can be used to analyse the impacts of peer to peer energy trading on network operational performance . The analysis presented in the paper suggests that a moderate level of peer to peer trading does not have significant impacts on network operational performance .
