 Converter transformers are key facilities in HVDC systems . The operation condition of converter transformers is more complex than that of conventional AC transformers . Because of the superposition of the voltage harmonics the valve voltage wave is more serrated than a pure AC voltage . As a result the insulation system withstands severe stress . Several tasks are accomplished in this study to obtain a better understanding of the electrical field distribution in converter transformers as well as analyze the effects of voltage harmonics on the main insulation of converter transformers . First an HVDC system with a voltage of 800kV is simulated and the voltage harmonics at the valve side are obtained . The simulation is verified based on the measurement in a real 800kV HVDC substation . The harmonics in valve winding are mainly characterized by components with frequencies of 6k 12k 12k1 and 6k1 . Then a full scaled 3D converter transformer model is proposed . The electric field of the proposed model is calculated under AC DC and polarity reversal voltages . Compared with conventional 2D models the inhomogeneity of the electric field distribution is obtained and the difference can reach 30 . Finally the valve voltage waveform is applied on the 3D model to calculate the electric field using finite element method . Results show that the voltage harmonics in valve side further deepen the inhomogeneity of electric field in insulation structures . Moreover a high value of voltage changing rate
