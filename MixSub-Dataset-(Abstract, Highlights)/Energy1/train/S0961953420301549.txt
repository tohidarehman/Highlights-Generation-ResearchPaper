 There are large volumes of forest biomass available distributed over extensive geographic areas in Australia . However it is largely a low value resource sensitive to high procurement costs . Transportation cost is typically the biggest factor in the cost of a forest biomass supply chain and is a critical factor in the planning of profitable bioenergy conversion facilities . This study presents an example of using geographical information systems to 1 evaluate the feasibility of setting up new bioenergy facilities 2 evaluate the location of existing bioenergy facilities and 3 optimize the locations of facilities in Queensland Australia . This study uses forest biomass availability estimated from 5 year harvest log volumes . The log volumes are refined to biomass energy using a model that considers forest type sustainable retention of residues on sites residue proportions of total above ground biomass and energy conversion factors . The strategic locations of bioenergy conversion facilities are defined using cluster and outlier analysis of biomass energy distribution and transportation distance using the local index of spatial autocorrelation in a GIS environment . The tactical selection of bioenergy conversion facilities is then established based on the required number of facilities and capacity together with the maximal distance for transporting the forest biomass . This study uses Queensland Australia as the study area to demonstrate the effectiveness of modern GIS tools to achieve more scientific planning in bioenergy conversion facility networks and supply chain .
