 Nitrogen fertilizers are very important for global food self sufficiency particularly for Africa where the N input in agriculture is very low . This is the first work which studies and calculates the amount of N fertilizer that each country in Africa needs to feed itself by 2050 . In this study we used five different scenarios of inorganic fertilizer N use and human diets to calculate the amount of N fertilizer needed to achieve FSS in Africa by 2050 and analyze the changes in N budget N losses and N use efficiency . These scenarios include 1 business as usual 2 equitable diet 3 an IFN input 20 less than the EqD 4 an IFN input 40 less than the EqD and 5 a 20 increase in IFN input relative to the EqD . Under the BAU scenario production trends continue as they have over the past five decades including an unhealthy human diet . In the EqD scenario the priority is to meet the local demand for both animal and plant proteins with a healthy human diet . Under the EqD scenario increasing the total N input from 35kgN ha
