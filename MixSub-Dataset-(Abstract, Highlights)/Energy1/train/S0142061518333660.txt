 With the continuous expansion of ultrahigh voltage power grids the short circuit current level is drastically rising and the hidden dangers of an insufficient circuit breaker interrupting capacity can seriously threaten the safety and stability of power systems . Fast switch based fault current limiters can play a vital role here . However FSFCLs also affect the transient recovery voltage of a CB . Hence for reliable CB interruption it is necessary to solve the matching problem between the FSFCL and the CB . In this paper considering different fault conditions a mathematical model of a CB connected to an FSFCL is established for a CB interruption characteristic analysis . On this basis using the TRV indicators the FSFCL withstand voltage and the short circuit current level as the objective function a parameter optimization design model for the FSFCL and CB is established . Furthermore in combination with a genetic algorithm a parameter optimization design method for the FSFCL and CB is proposed . The practicability and accuracy of the proposed method are validated using Simulink .
