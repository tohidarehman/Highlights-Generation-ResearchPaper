 Only seven regional MSWLF in Serbia are considered sanitary while about 3500 landfills operate without proper pollution control . This paper presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of a closed landfill and a new sanitary landfill which are located next to each other . The following methodologies for the landfill impact assessment were applied based on data from 2012 to 2017 Landfill water pollution index and Nemerow index PI

@highlight LWPI and Nemerow index show significant pollution of groundwater at old landfill.
@highlight High levels of Ni and Pb were found in groundwater leachate and soil samples.
@highlight LPI values indicate the need for improvement of landfill leachate treatment.
@highlight Hg and Cd represent a great ecological risk in landfill soil.
@highlight Cr and As should be added to the European Watch List of emerging contaminants.
