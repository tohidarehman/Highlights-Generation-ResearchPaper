 Biological transformation of municipal solid waste is an environment friendly management strategy against recalcitrant residues . The bacterial biome that inhabit said residues are responsible of decomposing both simple and complex materials . For this reason processes such as composting which favor the acceleration of the transformation of organic matter can contribute to the degradation of municipal solid waste . Not only as mere fertilizer for crops but also as methods for the recovery of solid waste . However the control of the conditions necessary to achieve an optimal process on an industrial scale is a great concern . Thus the aim of this work focuses on the characterization of the bacterial microbiome on three municipal solid waste facilities in order to deepen the role of microorganisms in the state of the final product obtained . For it an intensive metagenomic analysis as well as a battery of physicochemical determinations were carried out . The lack of adequate thermophilic phases was decisive in finding certain bacterial genera such as

@highlight Municipal solid waste are bio stabilized when converted into compost.
@highlight An adequate thermophilic stage was not found in most of industrial processes studied.
@highlight Though temperatures were no high enough microbial succession was not prevented.
@highlight Despite the difficulties on industrial scale microbiota leads to waste stabilization.
