 Roads disrupt landscape connectivity for many terrestrial mammals . These infrastructures can be barriers to movement thereby threatening population persistence . Nonetheless small mammals may use road verges as habitat or corridor thus increasing migration across intensively managed landscapes . However in well preserved habitats where road verges show a similar vegetation structure to surrounding areas their role is still unknown . Road verges would have an important role as fine scale connectivity providers for small mammals in a well preserved habitat depending on land management on road surroundings . We aimed to quantify the effects of road verges and paved lanes on the fine scale landscape connectivity for the wood mouse

@highlight Road effects on fine scale landscape connectivity were assessed for the wood mouse.
@highlight Road presence reduced landscape functional connectivity.
@highlight Road verges provided corridors for wood mice attenuating the negative road effect.
@highlight Verge vegetation cutting and surrounding land ploughing decreased connectivity.
@highlight Our results help verge vegetation management to provide corridors for small mammals.
