 Drum kiln with heat distribution pipe is a new design for vertical drum kiln . It is a small kiln for charcoal biochar and wood vinegar production . It consists of a 200l oil drum covered with fiberglass and galvanized steel as an insulator . The heat distribution pipe with slots is installed in the middle part of the kiln . There are four exhaust chimneys for smoke ventilation and wood vinegar collection . The chimneys are covered with condensers for wood vinegar condensation . Two types of biomass for this experiment were tamarind wood and corncob . For tamarind wood the drum kiln loaded about 40kg of wood with moisture content of 2024 using 1019kg of firewood . It took about 3.55h to reach maximum temperature and cooled down within 35h . In sum therefore it took about 8h for the complete tamarind wood charcoal process . The products were 1112kg of tamarind wood charcoal and 1213kg of wood vinegar . There was no incompletely carbonized wood and ash . Properties of tamarind wood charcoal were tested following ASTM D758215 and ASTM D586510 . Tamarind wood charcoal showed 5 moisture content 2021 volatile matters 68.769.8 fixed carbon 3.85.6 of ash and 3031MJkg
