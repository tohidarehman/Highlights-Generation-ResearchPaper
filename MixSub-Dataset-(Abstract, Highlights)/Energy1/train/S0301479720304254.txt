 Soil erosion on mountain trails threaten the sustainability of soils and vegetation . There is a wide theoretical knowledge about the effects produced by mountain recreational activities but particularly for soil erosion there is a shortage of field data . This is why it is necessary to properly survey the soil losses on mountain trails . The most widely applied method in scientific literature is the Cross Section field survey as is easy to apply and low cost . However there is a doubt about its accuracy and the development of the new technologies may improve the quality and accuracy of the measurements . Aerial and terrestrial photogrammetric methods are difficult to apply when vegetation is present but an opportunity arises to apply this method when fire takes place . This paper analyses the soil losses in a recently fire affected land to check the accuracy of the three methodologies to assess soil loss on mountain trails . The results obtained show an average soil loss between 1287 and 1404Mgha

@highlight Mountain trails show high erosion rates and risk soil sustainability.
@highlight There is a need to survey soil erosion on trails and to find the best method.
@highlight Average trail erosion rates were 1287.33Mgha
@highlight Three different assessment methods provided similar results.
@highlight The cross sectional method surveys properly and efficiently the soil losses.
