 The fuel composition highly affects formation of toxic pollutants in a diesel engine . The aromatics are found to be prominent fuel components that affect pollutant formation and at the same time help provide lubricity to moving engine parts . Therefore their effect needs to be addressed systematically . This article elucidates aromatic types and its content effects on fuel atomization regulated and unregulated emissions . Acoustic emission signals were also recorded for engine noise diagnosis during the exhaustive testing . Five different aromatics namely ethylbenzene methylstyrene indene tetralin and methylnaphthalene were blended in ratio of 15 20 and 25 by mass with dearomatized hydrocarbon fuel and tested in a compression ignition engine . Results reveal that unregulated emissions carbon monoxide unburnt hydrocarbon and particulate matter increase with aromatic content . However nitrogen oxides NO

@highlight Newer systematic formulated fuel are proposed.
@highlight Emission reduction is proposed with optimal selection of aromatic in formulated fuel.
@highlight Effects of fuel composition and properties on spray and emissions are discussed.
@highlight Unregulated carbonyl and PAH emission are influenced with aromatic contents.
@highlight It is equally important to study unregulated and acoustic emissions along with regulated emissions.
