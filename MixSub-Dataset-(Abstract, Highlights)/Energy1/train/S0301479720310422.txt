 Aerobic granular sludge is a type of biofilm with good sedimentation and density high biomass high organic load tolerance and toxicity resistance . Oxytetracycline is an antibiotic widely used in livestock and aquaculture and its low absorption and high residue bring many risks and harms to the ecological environment . In this study an OTC degrading strain TJ3 was isolated from AGS and identified as

@highlight An OTC degrading strain TJ3 identified as
@highlight sp. was isolated from AGS.
@highlight The optimum culture conditions of the strain was determined.
@highlight Two biodegradation products by the strain were proposed.
@highlight The performances of AGS with biologically immobilized strain TJ3 was improved significantly.
@highlight increased obviously related to the enhancement of AGS.
