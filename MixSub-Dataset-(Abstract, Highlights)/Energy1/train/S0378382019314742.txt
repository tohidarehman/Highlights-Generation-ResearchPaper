 Residential coal combustion is a major source of carbonaceous aerosol globally . Clean coal briquettes can be used for pollution emission control . In this study red mud a high alkalinity byproduct generated from the Bayer process was employed as additive in coal briquettes . Combustion tests of briquettes and raw coal were conducted to evaluate the emission reduction effects on PM

@highlight Red mud content influenced PM
@highlight  OC EC emission significantly.
@highlight Highest emission reduction rate for carbonaceous species were achieved by using red mud additive.
@highlight All subfractions of carbon showed a similar decreasing trend with the increase of red mud content.
