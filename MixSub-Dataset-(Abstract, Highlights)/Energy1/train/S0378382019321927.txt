 Solid oxide fuel cell is one of the most attractive energy conversion systems while dimethyl ether is an alternative clean fuel and thus the application of DME in SOFC has great attraction . Fuel compositions are mainly determined by fuel processing technologies which can affect the cell efficiency . In this paper the relationships among fuel composition oxygen to carbon ratio carbon deposition and cell efficiency are investigated for different DME processing technologies . According to the calculated results SOFC with steam reforming of DME has the highest efficiency at the same O C ratio and equivalent fuel utilization while for catalytic partial oxidation of DME the cell efficiency decreases rapidly with the increase of O C ratio . The efficiency of SOFC with CO
