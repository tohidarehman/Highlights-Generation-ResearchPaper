 DC filter is an important electrical apparatus to restrain harmonics in a line commutated converter based HVDC system . The used differential protection for DC filters has poor selectivity and insufficient sensitivity to identify ground faults of DC filter high voltage capacitors . Based on virtual capacitance a novel ground fault protection for DFHVCs is proposed in this paper . According to the equivalent circuit of DC filter in a LCC HVDC system virtual capacitance characteristics are analyzed under different ground faults of DFHVC . Then these characteristics are used for constructing protection scheme to identify DFHVC ground faults from external faults . A 500kV HVDC system built in PSCAD EMTDC is used to verify the performance of the proposed protection . Comprehensive simulations show that the proposed protection can reliably identify DFHVC ground fault in time domain and is immune to fault resistance fault location measurement error and DC filter structure . Moreover it is noted that the protection can identify a ground fault of DFHVC during the whole fault period and is of high reliability making it valuable and prospective for applications in LCC HVDC system .
