 Smouldering combustion a phenomenon typically researched from a fire safety perspective has recently garnered attention for its applications as a soil remediation method and more recently as a treatment process for wastes with high moisture content . This paper aims to review the fuel gas production from thermochemical conversion processes involving self sustaining smouldering combustion . It also provides an insight into the processes reactor characteristics key parameters applications and gas emissions .

@highlight Smouldering combustion is highly energy efficient and can self sustain in conditions flaming combustion is not able to.
@highlight Chemical reactions and operating parameters that affects smouldering is summarized
@highlight Gasification reactions occurs in smouldering combustion.
@highlight Alongside waste treatment smouldering combustion has the potential for the production of solid and gas products.
@highlight Further research is necessary to optimize the production of value added gas products from the smouldering process.
