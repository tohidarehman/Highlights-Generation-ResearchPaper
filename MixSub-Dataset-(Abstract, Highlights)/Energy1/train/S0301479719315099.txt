 Waste from drilling operations of oil and gas wells in the event of poor management in addition to imposing costs can lead to environmental problems . This research was aimed at providing a suitable model for collecting transferring and recycling the drilling wastes produced in the operational areas of the Iranian offshore oil company . Data analysis was performed using the Expert Choice and template selection using the analytical hierarchy process method . Based on the results of this study the method of collecting waste in a cutting skip was identified as a suitable option in the waste collecting sector . In the waste transfer sector the waste shipments from the west of the Persian Gulf to Kharg Island and the transfer of waste from the Eastern areas to Lavan island were selected as suitable options . Among the waste recycling options the thermal method with of 0.433 was chosen as a top priority .

@highlight Using AHP a suitable model for drilling wastes can be selected.
