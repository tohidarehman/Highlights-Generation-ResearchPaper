 With an estimated worldwide production of 190 billion kg per year and due to its high organic load cheese whey represents a huge opportunity for bioenergy and biochemicals production . Several physical chemical and biological processes have been proposed to valorise cheese whey by producing biofuels electric energy and or chemical commodities . A biorefinery concept in which several value added products are obtained from cheese whey through a cascade of biotechnological processes is an opportunity for increasing the product spectrum of dairy industries while allowing for sustainable management of the residual streams and reducing disposal costs for the final residues . This review critically analyses the different treatment options available for energy and materials recovery from cheese whey their combinations and perspectives for implementation . Thus instead of focusing on a specific valorisation platform in the present review the most relevant aspects of each strategy are analysed to support the integration of different routes in order to identify the most appropriate treatment train .

@highlight Cheese whey is an outstanding feedstock for bioenergy and biochemical production.
@highlight Integrating treatment processes is key for cheese whey managing and valorisation.
@highlight Dark fermentation will be the core of the future dairy biorefineries.
@highlight VFA production and extraction will benefit of favourable market conditions.
@highlight Bioelectrochemical systems can be applied for tertiary treatment and CO
@highlight recycling.
