 This paper presents an electromechanical transient modeling and simulation method for large power system with inclusion of bipolar multi terminal direct current grid . First the dynamic model of a modular multilevel converter is presented . The dynamic model of the bipolar DC grid is then established by using the companion circuit method . In particular the inductances of DC lines are carefully modeled to ensure the simulation accuracy when a DC fault occurs . Second the electromechanical transient simulation procedure for a power system with inclusion of an MTDC grid is presented . The AC and DC grids are solved alternately . Due to the difference between time constants of AC and DC grids the multi rate scheme is used to ensure the simulation efficiency . Third the proposed method is employed to simulate a real life large power system with inclusion of a bipolar MTDC grid . The simulation results validate the correctness and the effectiveness of the proposed method . Unique interaction characteristics between AC and DC grids are also revealed by the results .
