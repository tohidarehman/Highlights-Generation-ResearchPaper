 In this short communication piece we draw attention to the discussion on policies for reducing energy poverty in European Union member states . We urgently need a policy approach able to support the transition from the current rising levels of energy poverty to a sustainable community with a greener and healthier future . Analysing energy prices the policy framework and household income we conduct a preliminary investigation of energy poverty from a macro level perspective and associated policy interventions in the EU . Obtained from a non classical fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis our results clearly show that energy poverty is a product of substantial interdependence that may be summarised in two paths low or median household income and energy policy focus and high energy prices and energy policy focus . Surprisingly our findings indicate that an energy policy focus is found in EU member states with the highest levels of energy poverty . One step further we also offer an insight into the absence of energy poverty where social policy seems to play the key role . Taken together we argue that member states facing above average energy poverty are captured in an energy poverty trap whereby the existing energy policy focus does not yield the desired results and the social policy is often too costly to implement due to the problem s magnitude . Our main concern is that prioritising any of the policies may slow down the transition to a sustainable energy society . We therefore call on scientists to not only further examine the energy poverty phenomenon but to also participate in creating effective policies .

@highlight Energy policy focus is present in EU states with the highest energy poverty.
@highlight Member states with low energy poverty have social and energy policy focus.
@highlight Policy efficacy depends on the scale of the problem and situation in the EU states.
@highlight Qualitative comparative analyses enrich investigation of energy poverty.
