 Biocatalytic degradation of recalcitrant pollutants employing ligninolytic enzymes is a promising approach for wastewater treatment . However enzymes production must be improved to make biodegradation a more cost effective treatment . In this research laccase production from

@highlight Laccase activity was optimized varying temperature type and dosage of residues.
@highlight Wheat bran improved laccase activity at 35C in batch submerged fermentation.
@highlight Submerged fermentation in the airlift reactor increased six times laccase activity.
@highlight Enzymatic treatment of blue wastewater removed COD and enhanced biodegradability.
@highlight Laccase is a green and sustainable pretreatment strategy for blue wastewater.
