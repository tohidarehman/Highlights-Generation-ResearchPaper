 To investigate the effect of the organic loading rate on anaerobic treatment of monosodium glutamate wastewater a lab scale up flow anaerobic blanket reactor was continuously operated over a 222 day period . The overall performances of COD removal and methane recovery initially exhibited an increase and subsequently decreased when the OLR was increased from 1g COD L d to 24g COD L d. At the optimal OLR of 8g COD L d superior performance was obtained with a maximum COD removal efficiency of 97 a methane production rate of 2.3L L d and specific methanogenic activity of 86mg CH

@highlight Methanogenic degradation of monosodium glutamate wastewater was validated.
@highlight Optimal COD removal and CH
@highlight recovery performance was obtained at OLR below 8g L d.
@highlight Maximal glutamate removal capacity of the UASB reactor reached 18g COD L d.
@highlight and
@highlight were dominated after long term operation.
@highlight The OLR had a substantial impact on the microbial community variations in the UASB.
