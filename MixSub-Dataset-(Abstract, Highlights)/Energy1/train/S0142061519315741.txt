 The paper considers the impact of Demand Side Response events on the supply power profile and energy efficiency of widely distributed aggregated loads applied across commercial refrigeration systems . Responses to secondary grid frequency static DSR events are investigated . Experimental trials are conducted on a system of refrigerators representing a small retail store and subsequently on the refrigerators of an operational superstore in the UK . Energy consumption and energy savings during 3h of operation pre and post secondary DSR are discussed . In addition a simultaneous secondary DSR event is realised across three operational retail stores located in different geographical regions of the UK . A Simulink model for a 3 power network is used to investigate the impact of a synchronised return to normal operation of the aggregated refrigeration systems post DSR on the local power network . Results show 1 drop in line voltage due to the synchronised return to operation . Analysis of energy consumption shows that DSR events can facilitate energy savings of between 3.8 and 9.3 compared to normal operation . This is a result of the refrigerators operating more efficiently during and shortly after the DSR . The use of aggregated refrigeration loads can contribute to the necessary load shed by 97.3 at the beginning of DSR and 27 during the 30minutes of a DSR based on results from a simultaneous DSR event carried out on three retail stores .

@highlight A simultaneous DSR event for the refrigeration systems in three retail stores.
@highlight DSR event of the store trials facilitates energy savings and the planned load shed.
@highlight The aggregated loads facilitate 97.3 and 27 of load shed at start and during DSR.
@highlight The synchronised return to operation post DSR drops the line voltage by 1 .
@highlight A pressure offset at the beginning of a DSR improves the performance of the system.
