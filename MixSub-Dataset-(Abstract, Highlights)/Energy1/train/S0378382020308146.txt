 Lignin is an important sustainable feedstock for producing valuable aromatics which can be achieved by catalytic hydrogenolysis over suitable heterogeneous catalysts . Herein Ni TiN catalysts with different Ni loadings were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method . The effects of Ni loadings reaction temperature H

@highlight A Ni TiN catalyst was successfully prepared for hydrogenolysis of BPE and lignin.
@highlight The catalyst showed good activity and selectivity for cleaving aromatic C
@highlight O bonds.
@highlight The catalyst has good stability and reusability with potential for practical use.
@highlight Aromatics especially guaiacols are dominant products from hydrogenolysis of lignin.
@highlight Possible reaction mechanisms for hydrogenolysis of BPE and lignin were proposed.
