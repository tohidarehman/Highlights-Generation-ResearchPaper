 Integrated multi trophic aquaculture is well developed in seawater while the only suitable organisms for bioremediation in freshwater are bivalves . The aim of this research has been to investigate a novel system based on freshwater bivalves integrated with rainbow trout for the bioremediation of inland aquaculture systems . The Unionid species selected for the experiments was

@highlight Mussels raised at 7.5kg.m 3 were efficient in the bioremediation of aquaculture effluents.
@highlight The net reduction of total bacterial concentration by
@highlight was up to 72 .
@highlight The net reduction of bacteria reached 98 in the experiments with
@highlight Mussels were not effective in improving the transparency of water in aquaculture effluents.
