 Accuracy of sensors measuring Photovoltaic array output voltage current and the ac currents flowing between VSC and grid plays an indispensable role in efficient operation of a grid connected PV system . Erroneous measurements due to malfunctioning of aforementioned sensors can cause significant disruptions in the operation of a PV system as the impact of erroneous measurements propagate through the controllers in a PV system . In this paper malfunctioning of PV system sensors are regarded as sensor faults . This paper presents an approach for diagnosis and mitigation of sensor faults in a PV system . The fault diagnosis approach is based on the sliding mode observer based fault detection and identification theory which is capable of accurately estimating faults in sensor measurements . Estimated faults are used by the fault mitigation technique in the proposed approach to rectify the sensor measurements . The rectified sensor measurements are used by the controllers in PV system instead of possibly erroneous sensor measurements which ensure fault resilient operation of the PV system . The efficacy of the proposed approach has been validated through rigorous simulation and experimental studies .
