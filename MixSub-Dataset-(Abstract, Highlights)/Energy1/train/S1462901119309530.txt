 Public perception of climate change can either facilitate or hinder the implementation of climate policies . This perception is dependent on a number of influencing factors called drivers in ways that are still not clearly understood . Our study quantifies the relative strength of drivers of climate change perception taking into account differences in the social political geographical economic and educational identities of any considered community . In addition to investigating the direct influence of the main drivers on climate change perception we particularly examine the interactions among drivers identifying in this way indirect pathways of influence . We find that perceptions are directly influenced by the share of principles and ideals within a community and by the physical experience of weather change . Indirect influences are found to be related to the level of development of a community to its level of social interaction and to the spread of climate change information . A deeper understanding of interactions among drivers should prove especially useful for the design of effective climate change mitigation and adaptation measures .

@highlight We present a new framework to study the drivers of climate change perception.
@highlight We identify 33 community independent drivers.
@highlight We quantify the relative importance of the identified drivers.
@highlight The study of interactions among drivers reveals indirect paths of influence.
@highlight Indirect paths of influence to climate change perception are key to unravel effective climate actions.
