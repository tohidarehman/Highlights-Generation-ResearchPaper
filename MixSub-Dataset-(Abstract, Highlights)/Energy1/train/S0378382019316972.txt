 The rational design of electrodes mimicking the cellular structure of natural bio resources has been a matter of increasing interest for applications in energy storage . Due to their anisotropic and hierarchical porosity monolithic carbon materials from natural wood precursors are appealing as electrodes for supercapacitor applications due to their interconnected channels relatively low cost and environmentally friendly synthesis process . In this work a liquid phase oxidative treatment with refluxing nitric acid at 100C for 8h was performed to enhance the surface properties of beech derived graphitized carbons treated with an iron catalyst . Microstructural textural and surface investigations revealed that this strategy was successful in removing amorphous carbon and in functionalizing their surfaces . The crystallinity accessible surface area micropore volume and surface functionality of beech derived carbons were increased upon the reflux treatment . The resulting porous carbon materials were evaluated as binderless monolithic electrodes for supercapacitors applications in aqueous KOH electrolyte . A maximum specific capacitance of 179Fg
