 The study aimed at investigating the performance of anaerobic dynamic MBR for the treatment of synthetic textile wastewater . A laboratory scale anaerobic bioreactor was operated to test nylon mesh support materials with different pore sizes . The performances of the AnDMBR were evaluated with a stimulated wastewater containing 1 000mg.L

@highlight High COD and color removal were obtained in the AnDMBR.
@highlight Low effluent SS values were obtained under steady state conditions in all supports.
@highlight AnDMBR was stably operated with 20m support material in average 8.053 LMH flux.
@highlight SEM images showed that the membrane surface was completely covered with cake layer.
@highlight High concentrations of Ca P Fe Mg Al and Si were observed in the cake layer.
