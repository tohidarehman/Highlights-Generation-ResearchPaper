 Thermogravimetric analysis has been widely used to obtain inherent combustion reactivity data for biomass fuels . However fundamental information relating such data to systems that operate under conditions closer to those encountered in pulverized fuel combustion is relatively scarce . This study therefore compares the combustion reactivity of sawdust devolatilized under slow heating conditions by TGA and fast heating conditions in a drop tube furnace representative of PF combustion . The implications of devolatilization temperature heating rate and residence time were considered . It was established that the char burnout profiles of the DTF char prepared at 1300C and 600ms was similar to the 700C TGA char although the DTF char showed a lower maximum rate . Scanning electron microscope images revealed that the TGA chars retained a cell matrix structure with visible macropore network . In contrast the DTF chars displayed swollen surfaces with distributed pore networks resulting in higher BET surface areas . The activation energy of the DTF chars was smaller than those of TGA char demonstrating the presence of greater internal diffusion control . Finally it is demonstrated for the first time that the compensation effect for biomass char is considerably less than that reported previously for coal chars .

@highlight For the first time the combustion reactivity of TGA devolatilized chars was compared to DTF devolatilized chars.
@highlight Burnout profile of TGA char devolatilized at 700C 150Cmin
@highlight correlated with DTF char at 1300C 600ms.
@highlight However the maximum burning rate of the DTF char was smaller.
@highlight Compensation effect for biomass char was found to be considerably less than coal chars.
