 For existing experimental methods drying the sample to eliminate the effects of water in the pores is usually the first step to accurately measure the porosity of the coal reservoir . However drying coal with relatively low rank easily leads to changes in the pore structure . In this study we propose an improved NMR method to eliminate the signal of water in the connected pores by dipole dipole interaction and spin exchange interaction between the Mn

@highlight An improved NMR method is designed to achieve the accurate porosity of low rank coal.
@highlight Connected pores and isolated pores in coal reservoirs are distinguished.
@highlight The applicability of this method for higher rank coals was also analyzed.
