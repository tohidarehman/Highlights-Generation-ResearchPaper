 As the largest carbon emitter China has launched the emissions trading scheme in 2013 . Since then whether ETS in China really help reduce carbon emissions has become a hot button issue . By far scholars tend to offer the macro level empirical evidence and the conclusions are at best mixed . Therefore we try to reveal the effect of China s ETS from the micro level by focusing on the policy executors herein the pilot firms . Based on the data of listed firms from 2009 to 2017 we employ the Propensity Score MatchingDifference in Differences method to estimate the causal effect of ETS . The results suggest that ETS has come into play to a certain extent but the effect attenuates over time . Meanwhile the effect is more pronounced among small scale firms and non state owned firms as well as those pilot regions adopting systems of ex post allowance allocation . Therefore in the process of the national ETS ex post allowance allocation should be widely promoted and more attentions should be given to effectively stimulating the emission reduction capacity of large scale firms and state owned firms .

@highlight China s pilot ETS achieves 129.588 million tons carbon emissions reduction.
@highlight The emission reduction effect of China s ETS attenuates over time.
@highlight The policy effect is more pronounced among small scale firms and non state owned firms.
@highlight Ex post allowance allocation promotes corporate emissions reduction.
