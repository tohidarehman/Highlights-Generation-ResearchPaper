 This paper presents a resilience oriented protection scheme for TCSC compensated Line . A cross differential protection scheme is proposed to enhance the resilience of a parallel transmission line in the presence of a thyristor controlled series capacitor . The faulty phase is identified by estimating the spectral energy of the three phase currents and computed by applying an efficient powerful signal processing tool known as fast discrete orthonormal S transform . The proposed scheme is widely evaluated against various faults and dynamic power system conditions . The obtained results indicate the proposed resilience oriented protection scheme is adaptable to different power system scenarios . The scheme precisely classifies the fault with effective discrimination between internal and external faults on a transmission line and a response time of a maximum one cycle from the fault inception .
