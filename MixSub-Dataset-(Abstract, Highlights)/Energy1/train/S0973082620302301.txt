 The rural electrification based literature reports a limited knowledge of the long term socio economic changes that electricity access can bring in remote contexts and the consequent feedback on electricity demand . Such lack of understanding causes an inefficient allocation of economic resources for rural energy projects and inappropriate sizing processes . We model the multifaceted dimensions of the rural electricity development nexus by formulating a system dynamics model based on a Tanzanian case study and using 13 years of data for calibrating it . The modelled structure provides the first quantitative step in the research committed to develop an appropriate modelling framework for deriving policy insights regarding the electricity development nexus and the evolution of electricity demand for rural areas of developing countries . The simulation results show and highlight the dynamics behind the structural behaviour of some socio economic system variables the exogenous determinants and the complementary activities that allow electricity access to foster local socio economic changes which in turn supports the growth of electricity demand . Our findings allow increasing the understanding on the complex electricity development nexus and providing a novel modelling framework for projecting the electricity demand for rural settings .

@highlight We employ System dynamics to investigate the rural electricity development nexus
@highlight We develop a simulation model for long term projections of rural electricity demand in Tanzania
@highlight Calibration shows a mathematical good fit between data and model results
@highlight We find that the electricity development nexus is driven by both endogenous and exogenous dynamics
@highlight A modelling framework is provided for further policy testing on the electricity development nexus
