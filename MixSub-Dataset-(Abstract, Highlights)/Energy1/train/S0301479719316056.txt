 The paper presents a web based application developed as a medium for executing a serious game to enhance multi jurisdictional collaborative planning and decision making for mitigation of multiple hazards related to water . The gaming application is integrated into the Iowa Watershed Decision Support System designed to serve as a comprehensive multi sectoral data repository along with the simulation results of process modeling to educate and inform communities on the status of their watersheds during extreme conditions . The interactive serious gaming application was devised to encourage public engagement facilitate communication and positive relationship between watershed communities and make the decision process more attractive and transparent for the stakeholders . The web environment offers easily accessible user friendly interfaces that match the skills and knowledge level of a non technical user . Developed with adaptive design and flexible architecture the gaming application is generalizable and extendable to support hazard mitigation in other watersheds .
