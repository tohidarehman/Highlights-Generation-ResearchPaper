 Man made multi level ditches system is designed to irrigate drain and collect runoff from surrounding fields . It is not only the conduit of water and field carbon but also the linear like wetland with complex carbon cycling . However the contribution of ditches system to CO

@highlight The emission of CO
@highlight and CH
@highlight increased with decreasing ditches size.
@highlight Terrestrial external input and in situ metabolism might affect ditch C emission.
@highlight In situ source might largely contribute to CH
@highlight emission.
