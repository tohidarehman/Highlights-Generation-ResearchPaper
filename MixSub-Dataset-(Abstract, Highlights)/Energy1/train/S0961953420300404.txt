 Lignocellulose pretreated with dilute alkali and hydrolysed with cellulases was used as substrate for the processing of acetonebutanolethanol clostridial fermentation followed by the vapour phase membrane concentration of two alcohols and acetone with up to 99 degree of recovery . ABE concentrate was used for the catalytic synthesis of fuel components over a zeolite catalyst with aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons as the main products with up to 60 conversion . The zeolite catalyst was effectively regenerated from coking by hot steam treatment with up to 100 recovery in catalytic activity . The main novelties of the process are in demonstration the effectiveness of vapor phase ABE concentration its effective conversion to hydrocarbons followed by of catalyst regeneration . The process described paves the way to developing renewable technologies for the production of motor fuel components .

@highlight Production of 2nd generation biofuels from pretreated lignocellulose by ABE fermentation.
@highlight Effective recovery up to 99 and concentration up to 92wt of ABE by vapour phase membrane method.
@highlight Progressive catalytic conversion of concentrated ABE into motor fuel components up to 60 conversion .
