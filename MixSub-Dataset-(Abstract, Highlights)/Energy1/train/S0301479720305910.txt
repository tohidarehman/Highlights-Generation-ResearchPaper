 Monolayer barriers which are usually known as evapotranspiration covers have long been used as alternative final cover systems in waste landfills . Coal bottom ash was evaluated as a good alternative to soil in landfill ET cover systems to increase the bottom ash recycling ratio in the past . In a previous study applying BA promoted plant growth characteristics and improved the soil physicochemical properties particularly the soil organic carbon content . In this study we investigated the effect of BA on the SOC increase by examining the chemical and physical characteristics of ET cover systems and we compared BA mixed and pure soils . We collected two types of soil from the landfill cover namely BA mixed soil and soil alone for treatments during the 5th year after installation . Bottom ash mixed soil has four times more SOC than the pure soil at the surface soil layer but the SOC contents significantly decreased with the soil depth in BA mixed soil and no differences were found between BA mixed soil and pure soil below a 25cm soil depth . In addition there was no significant difference in the chemical composition of the SOC according to a

@highlight Bottom ash BA increased the soil organic matter OM contents of a landfill evapotranspiration ET cover.
@highlight The BA mixed ET cover showed five times greater OM contents than the single soil ET cover at the surface soil 015cm .
@highlight The higher OM contents in the BA mixed ET cover were due to the physical protection mechanism of allophane.
