 Microbially induced calcite precipitation improves the physical properties of soils by increasing the solid content decreasing the pore sizes and improving the rigidity of the particle to particle contact ending with a better mechanical and geotechnical performances of the soils . First the physical characteristics of soils in Qatar showed similar grain size distributions with most falling in the category of fine particles which is appropriate for MICP processes . MICP is ensured by the ureolytic activity of urease producing bacteria . However Qatari soils are characterized with high carbonate contents exceeding 20 high alkalinity and fluctuations of temperature and aeration . Although such properties can cause calcite dissolution as reported in literature two Qatari endogenous
