 To date little is known about the start up of photobioreactors and the progressive development of stable microalgal bacterial consortia with a view to the full scale treatment of real wastewater . Two photo sequencing bioreactors one inoculated with

@highlight Inoculum of
@highlight v. causes higher DO pH fluctuation in the start up period.
@highlight The inoculum of
@highlight stimulates the biomass productivity.
@highlight Phototrophs can grow spontaneously from real wastewater even without inoculum.
@highlight No significant differences in the treatment performance with or without inoculum.
@highlight At steady state the consortia composition with or without inoculum is quite similar.
