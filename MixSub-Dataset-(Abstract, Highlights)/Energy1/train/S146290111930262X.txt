 Palm oil is an edible oil with a high yield various economic benefits and many diverse uses . However its production has led to increased deforestation the endangerment of several species and toxic greenhouse gas emissions . The current study had two aims to generate a list of palm oil related pro environmental behaviours that general community members in Australia can do and to identify one or more behaviours from this list to address in a behaviour change intervention . Semi structured interviews with 12 experts generated a list of 11 potential palm oil related PEB . The same experts rated this list in terms of potential effectiveness in reducing the negative environmental effects of palm oil . A community sample of 300 participants rated the same PEB on likelihood of adoption and current penetration . These scores were integrated into a behaviour prioritization matrix which revealed that the most beneficial PEB to target was purchasing products containing only sustainable palm oil . This study is an essential preliminary step in behaviour change interventional research and outlines the process of selecting specific consumer behaviour related to environmental concerns . Policy based implications are discussed .
