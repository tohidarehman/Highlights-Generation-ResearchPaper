 This paper presents a novel approach to generation maintenance scheduling problem . The GMS problem is one of the main issues in the restructured power system due to its effect on the security risks and the profit of the generation company . In order to consider the risk of GMS for producers the GMS problem from the perspective of producers is modeled using non cooperative game theory and to determine the Genco s optimal strategy profile the Nash equilibrium is used . In this paper the coordinating procedure to satisfy reliability criterion and greenhouse gases reduction is done by the independent system operator . In recent years extensive researches have been fulfilled on the implementation of energy efficiency programs in the restructured electricity industry . Energy efficiency programs play a significant role in meeting our energy requirements energy security risks and GHGs problems . In this paper an economic environmental model of efficiency power plants has been applied to analyze impacts of the energy efficiency programs in the generation maintenance scheduling GMS

@highlight An economic model for energy efficiency programs on generation maintenance scheduling is presented.
@highlight The aim is to reduce emission and to satisfy reliability criterion for studied system.
@highlight GMS problem from the perspective of producers is modeled using non cooperative game theory.
