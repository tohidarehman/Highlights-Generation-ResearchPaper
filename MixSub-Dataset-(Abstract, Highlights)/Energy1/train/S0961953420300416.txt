 Cookstove researchers are paying more attention to the improvement in the combustion performance of a biomass cookstove which requires an understanding of the effects of different parameters on pollutant emissions . Five such important parameters were identified namely Inlet area ratio Primary air ratio Pot gap Fuel surface to volume ratio and Pot diameter . The work presented here comprises estimating the effects of these five parameters on the energy and emissions performance of natural draft biomass cookstove . A prototype stove was tested to quantify the effects of these parameters on chosen performance parameters like overall efficiency CO and PM
