 Dynamic rating of power transmission devices is a technology that allows better equipment utilization through real time monitoring of the weather conditions and the load . Dynamic rating of transformers is a fairly new technology if compared to the dynamic rating of power lines and has a high potential for significantly improving component utilization while lowering investment costs on installing new transformers .

@highlight Fast and cheap expansion of existing wind park by utilization of existing power transformer.
@highlight Alternative method for using good wind sites to their full potential.
@highlight More sustainable way of utilizing components in power transmission and distribution.
@highlight Several transformers connected to wind parks have been analyzed and shown to have hidden excess capacity.
@highlight Studied wind farms can be expanded by 30 to 50 of their original capacity while utilizing the same transformer.
@highlight After connecting additional capacity transformers in question would not exceed their projected lifetime.
