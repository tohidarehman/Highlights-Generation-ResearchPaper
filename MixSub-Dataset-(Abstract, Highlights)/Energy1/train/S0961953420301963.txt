 The biomass conversion into more valuable fuels represents one of the most viable routes for the exploitation of this material . Hydrothermal liquefaction is currently considered one of the most efficient processes to convert wet biomass into a bio crude which however requires expensive upgrading treatments to be used as biofuel . The use of catalysts able to directly improve bio crude yield and quality during the reaction is of fundamental importance to increase the overall process efficiency . Homogeneous alkaline catalysts are the most studied but they are not recoverable at the end of the process and so can not be reused . The use of heterogeneous catalysts allows to overcome this issue making the recovery and reuse possible maintaining anyway high activity and selectivity in the bio crude production . The aim of this review is to critically summarize the effect of heterogenous catalyst addition on the hydrothermal liquefaction of lignocellulosic biomass looking specifically at the improvement in bio crude yield and quality .

@highlight Biomass hydrothermal processes heterogeneously catalysed were critically reviewed.
@highlight Based on the effect on oil yield and quality four catalysts classes were proposed.
@highlight Transition metals and lanthanides oxides are the most active catalysts.
@highlight Main transition metals catalytic action consists in hydrogenation reactions.
@highlight Alkaline earth metals catalysts greatly improve oil yield worsening its quality.
