 Soil salinization is a major environmental hazard that limits agricultural production . Using sewage sludge and recycled wastewaters in amelioration of saline sodic soils is one of the most effective ways to dispose waste . However a very low initial permeability of soil in the freeze thaw conditions can make improvement difficult . Therefore column experiments at a soil depth of 15cm have been conducted to determine the effects of the combination of four stabilized sewage sludge doses 0 50 100 150tha

@highlight Sewage sludge adding improves saline sodic soil reclamation in freeze thaw conditions.
@highlight Recycled wastewaters with moderate saline and slightly sodic can be used advantageously in leaching.
@highlight Structure improved with strong aggregation is a necessity for high hydraulic conductivity.
@highlight Moisture management in saline sodic soil is crucial to preserving of organic matter.
