 Nitrate pollution of groundwater through spatial models is investigated in this paper by using a sample of nitrate values at monitoring wells using the data from four seasons of a year in which data are sparse . Two spatial modelling strategies are formulated at two levels in which Strategy 1 comprises three variations of kriging based models which are constructed at

@highlight Formulate Strategy 1 for spatial modelling of groundwater nitrate using Co Kriging MCoK .
@highlight Strategy 2 for probabilistic modelling of groundwater nitrate by Co Indicator Kriging MCoIK .
@highlight Inclusive Multiple Models IMM are used to improve accuracy even with sparse data.
@highlight IMM improves the results significantly compared to conventional geostatistical methods.
@highlight The model learning is that excessive nitrate is identified in the vicinity of urban areas.
