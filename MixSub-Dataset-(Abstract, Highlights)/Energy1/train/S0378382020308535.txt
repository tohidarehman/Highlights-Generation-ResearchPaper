 This study aims to report on the feasibility of enhancing light olefins production from ex situ catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass by co feeding with steam and determine the role of steam . Effects of steam on catalyst and pyrolysis catalysis reactions in ex situ CFP were investigated using a two stage fluidized bed fixed bed reactor . Carbon yield of olefins monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons increased by 23.80 after proper steam dealumination of HZSM 5 framework which suggests that HZSM 5 can be activated at the initial exposure to steam . For activated HZSM 5 olefins carbon yield increased by 35.65 and olefins to MAHs ratio boosted from 0.83 to 1.60 as steam concentration in carrier gas increased from 0 to 40 while the total carbon yield of olefins and MAHs still kept at the same level . Steam enhanced olefins production by promoting the formation of light compounds in bio oil which are the main precursors of hydrocarbons during pyrolysis inhibiting aromatization reactions during catalysis . It provides a possibility for the control of O M ratio of hydrocarbon products and the enhancement of light olefins production from CFP of biomass .
