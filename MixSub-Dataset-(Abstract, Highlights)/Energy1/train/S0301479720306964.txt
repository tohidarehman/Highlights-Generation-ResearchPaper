 Residues from passive treatment of acid mine drainage have variable chemical stability and could regenerate contaminated drainage . Stabilization solidification can prevent contaminant leaching . Residues were collected from a tri step AMD field passive treatment system operated for 6yearsat the reclaimed Lorraine mine site Quebec Canada . General Use Portland cement blended binders based on GU with pozzolanic additives were used as hydraulic binders in proportions of 100GU 20GU 80GGBFS and 50GU 50FAC respectively . Residues were mixed with wood ash and sand while reference samples were also prepared . Prior to S S raw materials were characterized . The S S effectiveness was assessed mineralogically and mechanically . Environmental behavior assessment was also performed . UCS results showed that strength increase with age . At 56 days GU and GU GGBFS satisfied Quebec s strength requirements for landfill disposal but not GU FAC while all samples satisfied USEPA criteria . The semi dynamic test showed that all elements can be immobilized successfully in GU and GU GGBFS . The GU binder had the best stabilizing performance . Based on USEPA requirements S S using GU GGBFS and FAC can be also considered for contaminant immobilization in AMD passive treatment residues . Finally the comparison between replicates using Student s t test indicated good reproducibility of S S treatment .

@highlight S S of post treatment residues from AMD using hydraulic binders was evaluated.
@highlight Use of industrial waste GGFS and FAC with GU was tested for metal immobilization.
@highlight Metals were successfully immobilized by formation of stable CSH gels.
@highlight Stabilized residues non hazardous as per USEPA regulation can be landfill disposed.
@highlight Student s t test and coefficient of variation confirmed the repeatability of the data.
