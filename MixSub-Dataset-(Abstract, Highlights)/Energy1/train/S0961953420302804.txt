 It is important prior to application of organic wastes to land that pathogen loads are reduced sufficiently to minimize dissemination to the wider environment . Anaerobic digestion for biogas production is a low cost method to reduce pathogens in agricultural wastes that provides the added benefits of energy generation . There have been claims of pathogen reduction following installation of biogas digesters in homesteads in Sub Saharan Africa . Homestead pathogen levels following installation of the different designs of biogas digester were monitored using faecal indicator organisms within small rural farms in Ethiopia . However different designs of digesters have registered varying levels of success . Of the three digester designs considered fixed dome floating drum and flexible balloon the fixed dome design achieved the highest reductions in indicator organisms coliforms

@highlight Study assessed the hygiene efficiency of commonly adopted small scale digester designs in the homesteads of Ethiopia.
@highlight Pathogen levels monitored using
@highlight  Coliforms 
@highlight with comparison to US EPA 28 acceptable standards.
@highlight The digester designs did not reduce all FIOs to below acceptable levels 28 .
