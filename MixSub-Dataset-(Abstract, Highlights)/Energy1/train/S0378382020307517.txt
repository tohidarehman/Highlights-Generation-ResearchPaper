 In this work cement bonded fine waste particles of copper ore and red mud are used as a kind of low cost oxygen carrier for potential application in in situ gasification chemical looping combustion

@highlight Fine copper ore and red mud particles are reused as OC by cement bonding.
@highlight Enhanced oxygen mobility is attained in the mixed ore OC.
@highlight The mixed ore OC facilitates char gasification and exhibits superior reactivity.
@highlight The individual combustion efficiencies for volatile matter and char are determined.
