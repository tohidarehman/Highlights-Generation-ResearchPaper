 Furanic bio oils were produced from liquefaction of corn cobs and switchgrass using 1 3 methylimidazolium chloride catalyst in acetone at 120C 5h . The biomass conversions to bio oils for corn cobs and switchgrass were 43.81.9 and 40.21.4 respectively . The bio oils were then catalytically hydrogenated in water methanol 3 1 at room

@highlight Corn cobs and switchgrass were liquefied in acetone using ionic liquid catalysts.
@highlight Furanic bio oils were hydrogenated at 23C 1 Atm. using 5 Pd C catalyst.
@highlight 61 compounds were identified in hydrogenated furanic bio oils using GCMS.
@highlight Alkene enone furan and carbonyl functions are reduced in the hydrogenation.
@highlight Effect of 5 Pd C catalyzed hydrogenation was quantified using
@highlight H NMR.
