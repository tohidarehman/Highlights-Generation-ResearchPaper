 The effect of flue gas recirculation on ash deposition and Na migration in a laboratory scale circulating fluidized bed burning Zhundong lignite was investigated . The CFB dense phase was maintained at temperature 950C whereas that of the furnace exit was adjusted to 730 and 680C respectively by manipulating the FGR flow rate . Two ash deposition probes maintained at 550C were installed in the furnace chamber P

@highlight Effect of FGR on ash deposition and Na migration during CFB combustion of ZD studied.
@highlight Ash deposits became granular particles and less sintered when with FGR.
@highlight Bottom ash was sintered and further aggravated due to more Na Fe with increased FGR.
@highlight Fly ash became discrete Na
@highlight SO
@highlight and CaCl
@highlight particles and was less sticky when with FGR.
@highlight The increase in FGR decreased ash deposition propensity but induced bed agglomeration.
