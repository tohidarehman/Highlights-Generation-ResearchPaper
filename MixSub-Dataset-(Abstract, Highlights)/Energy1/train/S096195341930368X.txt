 The potential of lignocellulosic feedstock has been widely studied mainly for biofuels production which usually requires an enzymatic step on the process . Cellulolytic enzymes have been studied as input for bioconversion and as a product from lignocellulose fermentation . The integration of these two perspectives may lead to an economically viable approach for second generation biofuels production which is nowadays difficult due to high cost of commercial cellulase . Conversely enzyme production by fermentation of lignocellulosic substrates is inexpensive and the hydrolytic activity of enzymes produced on these substrates which are to be hydrolyzed may be better than those enzymes produced on other materials such as cellulose . Many studies have defined the ideal conditions for cellulase production and saccharification processes separately . In contrast few reports have developed a unique and integrated process based on the same feedstock . This review is focused on current advances and innovation in on site cellulolytic enzymes production using plant biomass and application of the enzymes in lignocellulose conversion to fermentable sugars for biofuel production .
