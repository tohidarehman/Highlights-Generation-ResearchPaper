 The development of thermally stable Pt based catalysts with superior performance for propane dehydrogenation reactions remains a daunting challenge . In this study a series of PtSn MgAlO catalysts with different Zn and Pt contents were synthesized by the anion exchange method for the propane dehydrogenation reaction . To investigate the influence of Zn on the reaction performance and the catalyst structure the prepared catalysts were characterized with several analytical techniques including XRD TEM HRTEM H

@highlight Zn influences the structure and properties of PtSn MgAlO.
@highlight An average propane conversion of 45.2 for a period of 2h was obtained.
@highlight Propene was obtained with a superior selectivity of above 99 .
@highlight Propane conversions still attain 38.5 after 5 reactionregeneration cycles.
