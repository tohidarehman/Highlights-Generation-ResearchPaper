 Floating treatment wetlands s that can uptake nutrients and metals from water and or trap suspended solids in their roots are becoming viable options to treat urban agriculture and sewage runoffs . However current FTW designs favor aerobic processes and short term storage of metals which are ineffective in acid mine drainage environments . Many also function poorly in northern latitudes with strong seasonality and several months of sub zero temperatures . In this study we designed a novel FTWs with 20cm soil profile to test its ability to sustain anaerobic microbial processes such as iron and sulfate reduction and remain functional after freezing conditions of winter months . Three different plants

@highlight Floating wetlands survived 2 years of freeze thaw cycles.
@highlight In all cells dissolved oxygen concentration remained below 2mg L.
@highlight Sulfate reduction was prevalent within the floating treatment wetlands.
@highlight Over the two years sulfate reducing bacteria relative abundance increased by 100 .
