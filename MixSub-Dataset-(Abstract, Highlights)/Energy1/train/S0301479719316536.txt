 This study is aimed to recover the valuable metal ions from cathode materials of spent Liion batteries . Rapid microwaveassisted dissolution process is investigated here to recover Li and Co from LiCoO

@highlight Microwave irradiation led to rapid dissolution of LiCoO
@highlight in mild organic acids.
@highlight More than 85 of Li and Co is recovered in about 25min.
@highlight Co was precipitated as CoC
@highlight 2H
@highlight O and Cocitrate ascorbate.
@highlight Li was precipitated as Li
@highlight CO
@highlight and pure LiHC
@highlight O.
@highlight LiCoO
@highlight was re synthesized from CoC
@highlight 2H
@highlight O and LiHC
@highlight O.
