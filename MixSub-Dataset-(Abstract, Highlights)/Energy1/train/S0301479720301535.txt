 Diverse fields of modern environmental technology are nowadays focused on the discovery and development of new sources for oil spill removal . An especially interesting type of sorbents is those of natural originbiosorbentsas ready to use constructs with biodegradable nontoxic renewable and cost efficient properties . Moreover the growing problem of microplastic related contamination in the oceans further encourages the use of biosorbents . Here for the first time naturally pre designed molting cuticles of the Theraphosidae spider

@highlight Naturally pre designed
@highlight sp.
@highlight Theraphosidae molting cuticle was used as crude oil biosorbent.
@highlight The sorption capacity for oil spill removal from sea water distilled water and freshwater was determined.
@highlight Reusability of spider molting cuticle as biosorbent was checked through washing with n hexane in four cycles.
@highlight The mechanism of crude oil sorption by the molting cuticle was explained and reported.
