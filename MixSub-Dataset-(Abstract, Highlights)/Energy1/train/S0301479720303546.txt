 This study proposed the recycling of sewage sludge and red gypsum as potential temporary landfill cover materials . Mixtures with different SS and RG compositions were prepared and tested in determining the most suitable design mix based on the resulting physical mechanical and geotechnical properties namely the hydraulic conductivity compressive strength and plasticity . A maximum compressive strength of 524kPa was achieved for the optimum SS RG composition of 1 1 corresponding to Ca Si composition of 2.5 1 which was appropriate to form the calcium silicate hydrate gel . The SS and RG compositions did not affect the hydraulic conductivity which was in the order 10

@highlight A mixture of sewage sludge SS and red gypsum RG as temporary landfill cover was investigated.
@highlight Optimum mix at SS RG ratio of 1 1 achieved 345kPa and 10
@highlight cm s.
@highlight SS RG ratio of 1 1 corresponded close to Ca Si ratio of 2.5 1for hydration to form CSH gel.
@highlight Fe in RG contributed to the plastic behaviour of the mix.
@highlight SS RG ratio of 1 1 is appropriate for application as a temporary landfill cover material.
