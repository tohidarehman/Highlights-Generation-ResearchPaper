 Optimization of pretreatment of rice straw was carried out with sodium carbonate . Initially sodium carbonate pretreatment of rice straw followed by saccharification using partially purified cellulolytic enzymes of thermophilic mould

@highlight Pretreatment of rice straw using sodium carbonate has been optimized using statistical design.
@highlight Saccharification of rice straw released high amount of reducing sugars 728.45mg g at 60C and pH 5.0 after 48h.
@highlight FTIR and SEM analysis clearly confirmed the structural changes in rice straw after pretreatment.
@highlight Fermentation of enzymatic hydrolysate resulted in 18.07g L ethanol after 72h.
