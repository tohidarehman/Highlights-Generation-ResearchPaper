 Soil contamination due to heavy metals is a serious problem worldwide . Leather industry is one of the leading sectors in this regard in Pakistan discharging heavy metal chromium through untreated wastewater . In this study effect of biochar and elemental sulfur were evaluated on maize growth physiology redox homeostasis and Cr dynamics in tannery polluted soils . Biochar was produced through pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse at 350C and was applied at a rate of 3 along with different rates of ES 3 and 6gkg

@highlight Cr inhibited the plant growth altered physiology and biochemistry of maize grown in tannery polluted soils.
@highlight Application of sugarcane bagasse derived biochar and elemental sulfur retrieved harmful effects of Cr in maize.
@highlight Combined use of biochar and elemental sulfur ES mobilized Cr in soil and reduced uptake in plant.
@highlight Productivity of tannery polluted soils could be restored by biochar and ES interaction.
