 Biogas is known as a traditional energy source for off grid population throughout the world . And currently small scale solid oxide fuel cell systems are being promoted for off grid energy supply . Also electricity demand is increasing at a high rate due to the ever increasing population and technological revolution . Therefore promotion of off grid energy supply needs to be refocused .

@highlight Brief review of biogas impurities that may impact solid oxide fuel cell operation.
@highlight Review of biogas cleaning technologies of low and high technology readiness level.
@highlight Technical and economical comparison of different biogas cleaning technologies.
