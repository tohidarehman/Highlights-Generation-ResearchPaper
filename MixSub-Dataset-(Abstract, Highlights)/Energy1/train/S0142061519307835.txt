 Prestrike is a common phenomenon in Circuit Breakers when the moving contact approaching to the fixed contact during the closing operation . This paper focuses on prestrike modeling in SF

@highlight A multi physics model for simulation of prestrike phenomenon in circuit breakers.
@highlight Magnetohydrodynamics equations are coupled with electric circuit equations.
@highlight Motion of moving parts and temperature dependency of gas properties are considered.
@highlight Plasma arc interactions with electric circuit is numerically investigated.
@highlight The effects of resistance and inductance of the source on the arc is studied.
