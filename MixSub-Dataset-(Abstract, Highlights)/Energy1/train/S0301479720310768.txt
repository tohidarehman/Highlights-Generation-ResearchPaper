 Anaerobic oxidation of methane with denitrification as an important microbial process regulating methane emission has been widely reported in freshwater ecosystems . However the DAMO process and associated biogeochemical controls in estuaries remain poorly understood . Here we used

@highlight Salinity negatively controlled DAMO by direct and indirect effects.
@highlight Sediment NO
@highlight and NH
@highlight were the crucial factors controlling DAMO.
@highlight Denitrification exhibited a positive correlation with DAMO.
@highlight DAMO contributed 0.351.39 of N removal by denitrification and anammox.
