 The paper presents the ash deposition behavior during pressurized oxy fuel fluidized bed combustion of Zhundong coal at 0.3MPa which has never been reported before . Ash deposits collected from different positions of the probe under different atmospheres were investigated in detail . The results showed that the inside deposits i.e . the initial deposit layers on the different positions shared the similar composition and morphology . However the atmosphere had a significant impact on the ash deposition behavior . The inside deposits have more regular spheres and larger size under 30 O

@highlight The ash deposition characteristics of Zhundong coal during pressurized oxy fuel combustion were studied.
@highlight Besides the windward deposits leeward deposits and vertical deposits were sampled.
@highlight The effects of different atmospheres on ash deposition were analyzed.
@highlight The effect of the deposition temperature on vertical deposits was studied.
