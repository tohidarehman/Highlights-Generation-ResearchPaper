 China needs to balance between current population pressures and a vulnerable marine environment creating a national political outline or management strategy dubbed an ecological civilization construction . The nation s effort to protect and maintain a sustainable ocean and address the relevant economic resource and environmental issues relies on Marine Ecological Civilization construction . The quantification of MEC progress is essential to track the management performance and guide the subsequent development and implementation . This study evaluates the performance of China s MEC from 2006 to 2016 based on a comprehensive index system . Our findings are as follows During 20062016 the overall MEC performance score increased from 0.3426 to 0.4850 nationwide . Large space time variations exist among the eleven coastal regions . The Shandong and Guangdong regions showed relatively good performances whereas the Jiangsu Guangxi and Shanghai regions had low scores . A decade long change in MEC scores showed that Hebei achieved the largest increase ratio . Marine management was improved by implementing various conservation strategies by China s government . Marine education and human talent introduction deserve more attention in less developed areas such as Hainan and Guangxi and poor marine environmental quality was an urgent issue of the Yangtze river estuary economic zone . More accessible marine monitoring dataset are needed to track future space time progress dynamics towards MEC construction . Our results provide a decade long retrospect of China s MEC achievements and the quantified evaluation for each coastal region can provide valuable insight to policy makers .

@highlight Marine environment has improved a lot under the construction of China s marine ecological civilization.
@highlight A comprehensive index system was established to track the MEC progress.
