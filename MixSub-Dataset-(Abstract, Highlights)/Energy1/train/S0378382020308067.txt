 Synthetic natural gas production was systematically investigated by optimizing various operating parameters using a three stage biomass pyrolysis catalytic steam reforming catalytic hydrogenation reactor system . Several operating parameters were optimized including catalytic steam reforming temperature steam weight hourly space velocity catalytic hydrogenation temperature and hydrogen gas space velocity . In addition the influence of different metal catalysts Ni Al
