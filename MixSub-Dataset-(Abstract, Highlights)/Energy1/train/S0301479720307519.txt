 Different pre conditioning treatments were evaluated in order to stabilize red mud a waste product from bauxite processing for obtaining heterogeneous catalysts that can be employed as suitable activators of sodium persulfate for the degradation of sulfamethoxazole a model antibiotic in water . The presence of Fe

@highlight RM was suitably stabilize by sequential basification acidification and calcination.
@highlight The presence of Fe
@highlight in catalyst composition plays a key role in SPS activation.
@highlight The degradation rate of SMX was significantly slowed down in real water matrices.
@highlight Synergistic effect of ultrasounds was observed in SMX removal in real wastewaters.
