 On considering the critical issues in attaining stringent water quality standards and not creating any environmental impacts we focused for the first time the economically feasible emerging technology known as Self assembly flocculating . In which the study investigated the applicability of bioflocculant act as a surrogates on relying the removal of broad spectrum of substances under optimized conditions Dosage 90mg L pH 7 CaCl

@highlight Removal efficiency of the self assembly bioflocculant in removing the organic matters from the municipal wastewater were analyzed using advanced level techniques.
@highlight Bio toxicity assessment was performed in zebra fish exposed to municipal and treated water.
@highlight The correlatory relationship between particle size distribution and zeta potential was explained.
