 Slag is related to the melting properties of ash and is affected by both the chemical composition of the fuel ash and the combustion parameters . Chemical analysis of slag from fixed bed combustion of phosphorus poor biomass show that the main constituents are Si Ca K O which indicates that the slag consists of different silicates . Earlier research also points out viscosity and fraction of the ash that melts as crucial parameters for slag formation . To the authors knowledge very few of the papers published to this day discuss slagging problems of different pelletized fuels combusted in multiple combustion appliances . Furthermore no comprehensive classification of both burner technology and fuel ash parameters has been presented in the literature so far . The objective of the present paper was therefore to give a first description of a qualitative model where ash content concentrations of main ash forming elements in the fuel and type of combustion appliance are related to slagging behaviour and potential operational problems of a biomass fuel in different small and medium scale fixed bed appliances .

@highlight The paper presents a validated qualitative statistical model for prediction of slagging and operational problems.
@highlight The model considers combined effects of ash content ash composition and combustion appliance.
@highlight The fuel parameters K Ca Si and ash content impact the slag formation.
@highlight Combustion technologies having continuous ash discharge systems is advantageous especially for Si rich straw grass fuels.
