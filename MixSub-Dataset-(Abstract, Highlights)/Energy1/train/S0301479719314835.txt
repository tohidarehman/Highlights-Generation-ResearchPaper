 Using the social network analysis method this paper explores the characteristics of the spatial association network structure of China s provincial transportation carbon emissions from 2005 to 2015 and its driving factors . The results are as follows The spatial association of China s provincial transportation carbon emissions exhibits an intuitive network structure . The degree of closeness which were 0.2253 and 0.2333 in 2005 and 2015 respectively shows an increasing trend on the whole . However it hit the bottom in 2011 reaching a minimum of 0.2230 which is the low closeness degree inflection point . The spatial association network presents a significant core edge distribution pattern . Specifically in the central and eastern regions of China Henan and Jiangsu have degrees of up to 58.621 and 44.828 which are at the network center . However some remote regions like Jilin and Hainan have degrees of less than 20.000 which are marginalized . The geographical adjacency the expansion of the difference in R D investment and the narrowing of the difference in economic development promote the formation of the interprovincial spatial association . Therefore in the process of controlling carbon emissions from transportation the government should focus on the provinces at the network center and pay attention to the impact of the R D investment on the spatial association of transportation carbon emissions .

@highlight The evolution trend of the spatial association network structure is analyzed.
@highlight The core edge distribution of the spatial association network is described.
@highlight Henan is a key governance province in this study.
@highlight Reducing the R D investment difference between provinces is proposed.
