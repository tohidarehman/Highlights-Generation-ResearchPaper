 The present study investigated the use of algae biorefinery waste and wastepaper in the preparation of cost effective and eco friendly xerogels for the removal of congo red and Fe

@highlight Algal biorefinery and paper wastes were utilized for the development of xerogels.
@highlight Xerogels effectively adsorbed congo red and Fe II from aqueous solution.
@highlight Incorporation of alginate into xerogels affected their physico chemical properties.
@highlight The adsorption mechanism was predominately physisorption.
@highlight Temkin isotherm well suited CR adsorption while Langmuir and Freundlich best fitted Fe adsorption.
