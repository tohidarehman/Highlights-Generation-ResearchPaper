 Economic instruments for conservation are invoked as a strategy to achieve the dual goals of maintaining healthy ecosystems and improving human well being . The outcomes of such instruments are highly variable and there has been limited analysis of their social outcomes . Economic instruments for conservation can create opportunity and political leverage for minority groups or reinforce pre existing power relationships and reproduce socio economic inequalities . This research examines the equity implications of a government scheme from Brazil known as an ecological fiscal transfer looking at how institutional arrangements and local power dynamics influence the application of revenue to achieve social outcomes . A case study from the Atlantic forest explores whether the application of revenue reflects the interests of a broad community base and avoids elite capture or if decision making processes are engineered by local power actors to further specific interests . Results demonstrate how poor local institutional capacity limits the effective governance of the revenue leading to limited positive social outcomes . Furthermore incentives offered by the mechanism stimulate conservation activity which implies high costs for the rural poor . The application of a framework of good governance guides the development of recommendations for improving the social equity of ecological fiscal transfer policies . These findings reinforce the importance of the design of EFTs applied in regions of poverty if they are to promote socially equitable conservation .
