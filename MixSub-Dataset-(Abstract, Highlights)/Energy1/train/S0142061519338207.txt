 In this paper a comprehensive method is proposed to synergistically optimize the configuration and operation strategy of combined cooling heating and power systems considering configuration and strategy interact with each other . The mathematical model is established based on the energy flow and the energy balance relationship of CCHP system and traditional separate system with multi objective evaluation criterion . The optimization based on an industrial park in Shanxi is carried out to find the optimal configuration and corresponding strategy . The results show that the optimized CCHP system outperforms the SP system in cost saving energy consumption saving and CO

@highlight An integrated optimization of configuration and operation strategy is established.
