 This study investigated the effects of mineral waste extracts on laboratory scale two stage anaerobic digesters treating synthetic organic waste . MWE was prepared as aqueous extracts from different ash samples fly ash and boiler ash taken from a municipal solid waste incineration plant . At 20 days hydraulic retention time all three MWE stimulated hydrogen production in their respective acidogenic reactor by around 35 whilst no difference was seen in the methane productivity of the linked methanogenic reactors average 52745mL CH

@highlight Effects of mineral waste extracts on anaerobic digestion were studied.
