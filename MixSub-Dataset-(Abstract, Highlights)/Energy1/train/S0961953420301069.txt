 Poplars are traditionally grown on former agricultural land but forest land holds great potential for poplar production as the available area is large . However knowledge of how to establish poplars on forestland is poor . This study investigates how soil treatments and liming influence early growth of poplars during the first four years after planting . Our results suggest that soil treatments have a limited effect on survival or growth of newly established plants compared to plots with no soil treatments . Liming increased plant survival at the fourth year and highly increased plant height and diameter growth when combined with either patch or mounding soil treatments . At these treatments application of lime resulted in plant heights of 200cmat experimental site Vinssen or 150cmat site Tnnersjheden and compared to plots without lime growth is doubled These results suggest that poplar plantations on acid forest land should be established with both soil treatments and application of lime . These practices can enable poplar plantations on forest sites increasing the available area for poplar plantations in the boreal nemoral regions . Our findings also encourage further investigations of the production potential of poplar plantation on forestland and identification of genetic material suitable for forest sites .

@highlight New methods for establishment of poplar plantations at forest sites with natural acid soils are provided.
@highlight Soil treatment increased plant survival while liming had no effect.
@highlight Liming treatments alone increased plant growth while soil treatment had limited effect on plant growth.
@highlight Liming in combination with patch or mound treatment increased plant growth greatly.
