 Taking into account environmental and public health issues due to emerging pollutants and specifically to antibiotics spread into environmental compartments this work focused on the competition among three tetracycline antibiotics for adsorption sites in six different soils . Batch type adsorption desorption tests were carried out with 24h as contact time . The six soils were from two different farming areas and were selected according to pH values and organic matter contents . Binary systems were used to study competition setting the dose of one antibiotic at 200molL

@highlight Binary systems were used to study competition between three tetracycline antibiotics.
@highlight Soils with high organic matter content adsorbed close to 100 of the antibiotics.
@highlight Retention decreased in soils with higher pH and less organic matter.
@highlight Hysteresis affected adsorption desorption processes.
@highlight The results have environmental and social relevance regarding emerging pollutants.
