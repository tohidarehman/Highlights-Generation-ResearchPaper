 We report nitrogen oxides remediation using a transient pulsed plasma discharge in a water aerosol gas matrix using nanosecond high voltage pulses . While there have been many studies showing highly efficient conversion of NO to NO

@highlight Pulsed plasma in a water aerosol provides effective remediation of NO and NO2.
@highlight 100 reduction in NO and 98 reduction in total NOx were achieved.
@highlight Vibrational modes of NO2 and NO3 are found via SERS enhanced Raman spectroscopy.
@highlight NOx remediation scales with plasma power density.
