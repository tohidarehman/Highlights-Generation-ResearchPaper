 Aim of the work was to characterize the peels of novel tomato lines for the content of bioactive substances and for some parameters linked to no food use . Chlorophyll polyphenols and carotenoid content energy value theoretical biochemical methane potential through stochiometric method were evaluated . The peel color mirrored a different content of the bioactive substances the dark red fruits showed a significant increase of the carotenoid content while the peel of the black red fruits had the highest values of polyphenols . The preferential accumulation of functional compounds influenced the values of the other parameters . The colored lines compared to the red fruited control contained less carbon and hydrogen mass fractions and subsequently a lower LHV . This in turn led to a substantial difference in the estimation of the TBMP . Interestingly this production was higher in the highly pigmented line which contained a gene present in some high lycopene commercial varieties . A circular production model for exhaustive use of peel is proposed .

@highlight Wastes of tomato processing peels mainly may be re used for additional process.
@highlight Peels of new tomato lines with red yellow or black color were analyzed.
@highlight Carotenoids and polyphenols content varied greatly depending by the peel color.
@highlight The content of the antioxidant compound affected in turn the potential BMP.
@highlight Once extracted the biocompounds peels may enter in the anaerobic digestion route.
