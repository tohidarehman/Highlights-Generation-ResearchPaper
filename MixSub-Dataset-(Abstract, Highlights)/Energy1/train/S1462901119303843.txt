 This study contributes to the ongoing discussion on how to attribute and evaluate the contribution of transdisciplinary research to sustainable development . As co created knowledge is a key product of transdisciplinary research we tested the hypothesis that the extent to which this knowledge is utilized beyond the project consortia in different areas from scientific methods and insights to policy decisions and across a continuum of geographical scales can be used to identify potential impact pathways . For this purpose we developed an analytical framework that links the transdisciplinary process to six possible utilization stages which we used as indicators of the usability of co created knowledge . We gathered data from 22 research projects active in 36 countries using a survey and semi structured interviews . Our results show that even during implementation of the projects co created knowledge is utilized by multiple actors at different stages in all areas and at all scales simultaneously suggesting multiple impact pathways . Project knowledge is predominantly utilized for national level policymaking and research partners named

@highlight Non linear stages of knowledge utilization are useful indicators for impact pathways from transdisciplinary research.
@highlight It is possible to assess non linear stages of utilization of knowledge from early stages of transdisciplinary research.
@highlight Co created knowledge is used simultaneously in science and policy making and in a continuum of geographic scales.
@highlight We found preliminary evidence about the process of co creation of knowledge as empowerment tool.
