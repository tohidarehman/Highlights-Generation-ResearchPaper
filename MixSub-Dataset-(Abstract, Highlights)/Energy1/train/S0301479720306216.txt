 Waste activated sludge requires effective dewatering high biological stability and retention of nutrients prior to disposal for agricultural application . The study was conducted to evaluate the impact of pressure driven electro dewatering on improving sludge characteristics related to disposal in agriculture including biological stability pathogen availability heavy metals concentrations and nutrients content . Thickened conditioned and mechanically dewatered sludge samples were collected from two wastewater treatment plants characterized by different stabilization processes and treated by a lab scale device at 5 15 and 25V . EDW increased significantly the dry solid content up to 4345 starting from 2 to 3 of raw sludge . The endogenous value of specific oxygen uptake rate monitored as indicator of biological stability increased up to 56 and 39 after EDW tests for sludge from two WWTPs . On the other hand the exogenous SOUR decreased indicating a significant drop in the active bacterial population . Likewise a 12 log unit reduction was observed for

@highlight Sewage sludge was treated by a lab scale electro dewatering EDW setup.
@highlight The impact of EDW for promoting resource recovery in agriculture was assessed.
@highlight EDW resulted in a significant reduction of viable bacteria including pathogens.
@highlight Relevant detrimental effects of EDW on sludge biological stability were observed.
@highlight The availability of nutrients for plants in sludge was not modified by EDW.
