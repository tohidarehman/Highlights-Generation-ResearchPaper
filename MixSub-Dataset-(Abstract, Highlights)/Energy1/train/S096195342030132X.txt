 Rice is the main agricultural crop in the Philippines and central to the country s food security . One main challenge of rice farming is the management of the straw after harvest . With limited uses the rice straw is currently burned or in some cases incorporated with significant environmental impacts . However it can be an important feedstock for sustainable bioenergy and support energy access in the Philippines . The research was conducted around a 1000m

@highlight Sustainability trade offs of different business models for biogas from rice straw in the Philippines were investigated Figure 1.
@highlight Four business models for a 1000m
@highlight biogas pilot plant for rice straw where developed.
@highlight Business models with wider livelihood benefits beyond energy access had most support from farmers.
@highlight A narrow focus on energy access is unlikely to enable system integration and benefits.
@highlight Recognising support for wider livelihood activities supports energy access and vice versa.
