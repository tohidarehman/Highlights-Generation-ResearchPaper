 Granule formation has been recognized as a promising biotechnology in denitrifying phosphorus removal systems by facilitating phosphorus accumulation organisms especially denitrifying PAOs and hydraulic selection made this a more difficult task in continuous operation . This study aimed at exploring the microscopic mechanism and putting forward an effective strategy for DPR granulation under the impact of hydraulic retention time in a novel Anaerobic Anoxic Oxic Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor A

@highlight  O MBBR was feasible to shape DPR granulation by shortening HRT.
@highlight Higher P content facilitated sludge settleability and accelerated granule formation.
@highlight Stoichiometry linked with biomass composition revealed the enhanced bioactivity.
@highlight EPS composition especially T EPS stimulated sludge into stable self aggregation.
@highlight Cluster I PAOs and
@highlight outcompeted
@highlight with shorter HRT.
