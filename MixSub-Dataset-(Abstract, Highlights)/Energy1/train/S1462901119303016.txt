 The impact of collaborative research approaches on science and society has been subject to much debate and speculation . However empirically grounded analyses of the process impact link remain the exception . That includes comparing participation planning intended processes expectations and implementation . This paper delivers a theoretically informed comparison between different approaches to participation that are practised . It does so by performing a criteria guided analysis of 31 participatory sustainability studies covering different areas of study and spatial levels . This provides an understanding of how participation is translated from theory into practice what challenges occur that contradict initial aims and how these potentially influence expected effects . The results show stark divergences between planning and implementation persistent normative ideals in the planning phase echoing deliberative and emancipatory claims contrast with an emphasis on effectiveness during implementation . This leads to a systematic over representation of experts and an under representation of diverse societal actors in the studies . The focus is on producing directly measurable results rather than promoting possible societal effects . These findings facilitate a deeper discussion of which conditions and procedures could aid the design and delivery of high impact collaboration in the future .

@highlight Results show divergences between planning and implementation.
@highlight Many projects follow a consensual deliberative ideal but struggle to implement it.
@highlight Functional expert driven participation dominates despite other intentions.
@highlight Many projects insufficiently present and evaluate their participatory process.
@highlight Projects focus on measurable outputs instead of possible long term societal effects.
