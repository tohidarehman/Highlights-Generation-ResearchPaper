 Soil erosion and fine particle exports are two of the major concerns of soil nutrient loss and water quality decrease nowadays . In Mediterranean mountainous environments agricultural practices during different cropland stages likely increase sediment supplies and the export of fertilisers and pesticides out into the drainage system . In this study we attempt to evaluate the soil response to different agricultural practices implemented during the agricultural cycle by monitoring the bare soil cropland area through the use of remote sensing and applying the sediment fingerprinting technique together with the newly consensus based tracer selection method . To this purpose 128 source samples were distributed over the four main land use land covers and geomorphic elements existing in the study area . To analyse the spatio temporal variability of source contributions three sampling stations were established along the catchment and collected during two hydrological years . The consensus method was used to show the individual messages of each tracer revealing non conservative and dissenting tracers followed by a discriminant function analysis to select the best set of tracers for each mixture . Overall the unmixing model outputs displayed channel bank and agriculture as the main contributing sources for all the seasonal campaigns . Nevertheless the agricultural contribution was higher during the periods when the soil surface in croplands had no plant cover protection .

@highlight Channel bank and agriculture land use are the main sources of exported sediment.
@highlight Bare soil cropland area is directly related with sediment and elements export.
@highlight Sowing and harvesting trigger important sediment apportions.
@highlight The novel consensus method allows identifying non conservative and dissenting tracers.
@highlight FingerPro model effectively traces sediment sources during two hydrological years.
