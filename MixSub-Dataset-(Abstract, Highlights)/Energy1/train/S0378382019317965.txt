 Pd based membranes are the most studied in applications of membrane reactors in the field of high grade hydrogen production . The main issues of Pd membranes such as high cost and relatively low hydrogen permeability limit their wide development at larger scale favoring other inorganic materials such as silica to be used as membrane for hydrogen generation purification . Therefore this theoretical study aims to evaluate the performance of silica and Pd
