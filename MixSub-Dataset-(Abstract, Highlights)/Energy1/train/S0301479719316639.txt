 In this study the efficiencies of selected wastewater treatment plants to remove selected perfluoroalkyl substances during wastewater treatment processes were evaluated . For this purpose influent samples from Daspoort Zeekoegat and Phola WWTPs were initially screened for the presence of sixteen different PFASs of which only seven were detected . These include perfluorobutanoic acid perfluoro n pentanoic acid perfluorohexanoic acid perfluorooctanoic acid perfluorodecanoic acid perfluorohexane sulfonate and perfluorooctane sulfonate .

@highlight Solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography was successful used.
@highlight Activated sludge process ASP at Zeekoegat performed better than the ASP at Daspoort.
@highlight Anaerobic pond at Phola performed better than the primary settling tank at Daspoort.
@highlight Biological filter at Phola performed better than the ASP at Daspoort.
@highlight Poor removal was reported after the wetland at Phola.
