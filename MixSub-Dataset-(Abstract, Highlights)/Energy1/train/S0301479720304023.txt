 The Fundo dam was designed to store iron mine tailings in the region of Mariana MG Brazil . When it ruptured the tailings overflowed . These tailings affected the soil due to the formation of a thick crust as a result of drying and hindered the natural revegetation process . In this context the use of organic fertilizers including vermicompost is method of reducing the physical limitations on root growth caused by soil properties and changing soil metal interactions . For this reason vermicompost was added to iron mine tailings and its morphological and physiological effects on maize millet and sorghum plants were studied . The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse using 6dm

@highlight Chromium iron and manganese are at high concentrations in tailings.
@highlight Plant growth was reduced by cultivation in iron mining tailings.
@highlight The addition of vermicompost increased plant growth.
@highlight The vermicompost promoted greater investment in thick and very thick roots.
@highlight Mining tailings limitations are more related to root growth than to metal toxicity.
