 Biomass from crop residues as an alternative energy source has generated considerable interest to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions promote energy independence and promote regional development . Using disaggregate crop production data and a GIS based service area approach this study examines the available and accessible biomass from agricultural crop residues and identifies the locations and sizes of potential biorefinery sites in the Canadian Prairies . The economic constraints associated with site selections include the site s road access economical transport feasibility economies of scale for residue processing and workforce availability . In total we found twelve plants in the Prairie area six in Alberta five in Saskatchewan and one in Manitoba . The amount of total accessible biomass for the identified biorefineries is 35.39 dry million tonnes which is approximately 40 of the Prairies available biomass .

@highlight Available residue based biomass from major crops in the Prairies is 88.44 DMt.
@highlight Using service area method twelve possible biorefinery sites are identified and ranked.
@highlight Six plants are located in Alberta five in Saskatchewan and one in Manitoba.
@highlight The identified sites can process about 40 of total available biomass in the Prairies.
@highlight Canola has vast potential and 52 of accessible biomass is from canola residues.
