 The objective of this work was to determine the potential of using chicken manure as a sole feedstock for renewable biogas production under anaerobic conditions before spreading the digested chicken manure biomass on the fields as an organic biofertilizer . The chicken manure samples from four different locations of Lithuania were analysed and compared in order to better understand the chemical composition of the locally generated biomass resource . The annual quantities of chicken manure produced were investigated allowing estimation of the biogas potential if such biomass was treated anaerobically . Laboratory biomethane potential tests performed indicated the biogas potential of methane 508mLCH4 g

@highlight Chicken manure is abundant and attractive biogas feedstock due to its high biogas potential yield.
@highlight TAN build up causes system imbalances resulting in temporary biogas production drop and VFA increase in the digester.
@highlight Once the microorganisms adapted to high TAN concentration the digester produced 93 of the chicken manure biogas potential.
@highlight There is time required for the adaptation to the new ammonium concentration and digester operational conditions.
