 The ultrasound assisted depolymerization of lignin was successfully conducted over a synthesized PTA MCM 41 catalyst under different reaction conditions . Firstly the structure of the prepared PTA MCM 41 catalyst was characterized by various techniques and its acidity was determined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of pyridine adsorption and temperature programmed desorption of ammonia NH

@highlight The PTA MCM 41 catalyst is prepared for ultrasonic assisted depolymerization of lignin.
@highlight Lignin can be depolymerized in green ultrasound assisted method.
@highlight Ultrasound acoustic cavitation can effectively promote the conversion of lignin.
@highlight Ultrasound assisted depolymerization can effectively reduce the formation of bio char.
