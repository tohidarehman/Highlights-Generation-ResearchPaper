 Synthesis of biomass derived microporous activated carbon materials has fascinated attention in the emerging field of energy storage due to its high specific surface area excellent electrical conductivity low cost and environmental benevolence . Herein we report facile and cost effective method to produce porous activated carbons for the first time by physical activation method using two different biomass sources

@highlight Disordered porous activated carbon was synthesized through physical method.
@highlight Biomass from Syzygium cumini and Chrysopogon zizanioides were used as a raw material.
@highlight High specific capacitance combined with excellent rate capability was obtained.
@highlight Both device shows excellent retention of more than 90 after 5000 cycles.
