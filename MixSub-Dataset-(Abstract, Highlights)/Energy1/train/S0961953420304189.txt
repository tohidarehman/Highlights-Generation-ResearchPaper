 The coupling of thermochemical and biological conversion of biomass is a promising strategy to produce chemicals in future integrated biorefineries . Indeed thermochemical conversion such as pyrolysis is a fast process without any solvent or enzyme for the depolymerisation of biomass . In this work cellulose was pyrolyzed to produce sugars which have been then fermented by bacteria

@highlight Cellulose was depolymerized by fast pyrolysis.
@highlight Bio oil fractions rich in levoglucosan LVG were produced by staged condensation.
@highlight LVG was not metabolized by
@highlight Mild acid hydrolysis of LVG in bio oils was fast and selective.
@highlight Hydrolysed bio oils were fermented by
