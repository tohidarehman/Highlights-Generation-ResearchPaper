 The anaerobic decomposition of organic wastes might lead to the formation of organic byproducts which can then be successfully used as organic fertilizers . This study evaluated the impact of the application of two fermented liquid organic amendments commercial

@highlight Liquid organic amendments improved soil quality under microcosm conditions.
@highlight In the field scale experiment similar crop yields were obtained at equal N levels.
@highlight Fertilization regime significantly affected soil microbial composition.
@highlight The sub optimal dose of amendment enhanced prokaryotic structural diversity.
@highlight Amendment dose was the major factor impacting soil properties.
