 Because of increasing consumption and the environmental impacts the search for alternatives to fossil fuel based kerosene is crucial . Plastic waste cracking and subsequent cohydrogenation can be a promising way to produce jet fuels . The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of production of standard jet fuel from mixtures of cracked fractions of polyethylene or polypropylene and straight run kerosene on commercial NiMo Al

@highlight Waste polyolefin based jet fuel production on NiMo Al
@highlight  P catalyst.
@highlight Cohydrogenation of the mixtures of PE PP cracked fractions and kerosene.
@highlight Practically sulphur and olefin free jet fuels with reduced aromatic content.
@highlight Standard jet fuel from PP cracked fraction containing feedstocks in one step.
@highlight Further hydroisomerization in case of the PE cracked fraction containing products.
