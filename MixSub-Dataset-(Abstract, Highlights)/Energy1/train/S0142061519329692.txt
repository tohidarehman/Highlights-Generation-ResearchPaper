 This is the second paper of the two paper suite that describes development of future GB distribution networks integrating low carbon technologies and traditional and smart solutions for network reinforcement . The static and dynamic aspects of distribution networks development as well as impact on the entire GB transmission system are investigated . The overall planning concept planning assumptions and concepts most important features of steady state and dynamic studies as well as traditional and smart solutions for the network development are presented in the first paper . This paper presents the energy LCT scenarios projected LCT uptakes modelling and profiles of different types of LCTs first . Results of the distribution network development studies are given next which is followed by the results of studies that do not change development paths . The aggregated impact of all GB distribution networks on the entire electricity system is given through the analysis of system wide frequency disturbances . Conclusions related to specific studies and networks are presented in the relevant sections whilst the closing section gives generalized conclusions approved by the GB industry as answers to the key issues the future networks are faced with .
