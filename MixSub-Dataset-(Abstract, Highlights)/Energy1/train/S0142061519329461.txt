 The power dispatch strategy for onshore wind farms generally focuses on maximizing the captured power or minimizing the investment cost . However as for onshore wind farms there are some environmental impacts that need to be considered if needed . Among them the wind turbine noise is a fairly obvious environmental impact . Noise caused by wind farms may cause interference to the surrounding living environment and the power dispatch strategy should combine power production and environmental factors . Besides the amount of electricity generated by onshore wind farms is also affected by topography and power losses . In this paper an optimal power dispatch strategy of wind farms with limited WTs noise impact is proposed for a better environmental performance as well as maximizing the power generation . The new method is compared with the traditional MPPT method for single WT and the improved global MPPT method for the whole wind farm within two terrain scenarios . The case results show the feasibility and effectiveness of this novel strategy .
