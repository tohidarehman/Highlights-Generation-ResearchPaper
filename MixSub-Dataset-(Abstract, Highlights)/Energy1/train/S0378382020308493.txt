 Recently the resource utilization of food waste is receiving more attention by government and scholars . In this investigation the high temperature fast pyrolysis in the presence of hydrogen of food waste carried out by the laboratory scale downdraft tube reactor to explore the impact of operating parameters including pyrolysis temperature carrier gas flow rate 100250mLmin

@highlight The change of products yield at different H
@highlight concentrations was not obvious.
@highlight The maximum LHV value of gaseous product was 14.90MJNm
@highlight under 10 H
@highlight Food waste pyrolysis in H
@highlight significantly increased the content of H
@highlight and CH
@highlight Hydrogen in carrier gas had certain selectivity to phenols and aromatics in bio oil.
