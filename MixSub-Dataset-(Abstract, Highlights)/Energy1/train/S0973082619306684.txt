 Solar PV technology is the most promising renewable energy technology and is able to fulfill the electricity demand of the whole world even after conventional sources are completely finished . The prediction of actual electricity output from PV plants under actual outdoor conditions is tough . Performance evaluation of installed PV plants is helpful in designing and prediction of the performance of other upcoming PV plants more precisely . IEC 61724 gives the standards by which the performance of a PV plant can be judged . At present several research works based on performance evaluation of PV plants carried out in distinct locations across the world are reported in the literature . It is important to review results from various case studies on the basis of the IEC 61724 standard . In this paper the various case is reviewed on the basis of their location commissioning year capacity used technology and their performance . This will be helpful to design a PV plant knowing previous commissioned plant performance . From the review it has been found that PV plants are installed in most of the countries in the world and they are demonstrating satisfactory results . It has also been found that PV module material and panel tilt angle is very crucial for designing a PV Plant .
