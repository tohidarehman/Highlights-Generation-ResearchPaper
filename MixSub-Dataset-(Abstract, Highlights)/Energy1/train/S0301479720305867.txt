 Mismanagement of drinking water supplies can pose serious public health risks . There are many concerns about water source management among private well owners as they are often solely responsible for maintaining their wells and monitoring and testing of their own water quality . Lack of worry about contamination and a strong sense of control over risks in relation to drinking water quality have been identified as important factors that influence peoples perceptions and behaviour . In this paper we investigated how worry and perceived control moderate the influence of risk perceptions on water quality perceptions and well owners maintenance behaviours . We compare a sample of private well owners with a sample of members of Group Water Schemes and people who are supplied via the public mains to validate our results . We found that in comparison to the other groups well owners believe that water from private wells is superior and they express a higher level of control over contamination risks of their drinking water . Moreover strong feelings of control suppress their perceptions of risk in relation to water quality . However well owners who feel largely in control also maintain their well more frequently . We discuss the implications of these results for communication strategies with well owners .

@highlight Risk perceptions do not influence water quality perceptions if well owners feel in control.
@highlight Well owners maintain their wells if they worry about contamination risks.
@highlight Well owners who perceive high risks
@highlight feel in control frequently maintain their wells.
@highlight Communication strategies need to aim for realistic control levels among private well owners.
