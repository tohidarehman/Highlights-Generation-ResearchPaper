 Torrefaction models to predict solid yield enhancement factor and higher heating value of blends of coal and biomass and waste are limited in the literature . In this study Artificial Neural Network and Response Surface Methodology were used to determine the optimum torrefaction process conditions and optimum fuel blend based on the torrefaction variables . Pine sawdust sugarcane bagasse and corn cob were the biomass materials used . Three torrefaction temperatures 200 250 300

@highlight ANN and RSM were used to optimize process variables for torrefaction of waste blends coal PSD WT .
@highlight Optimum process conditions for the torrefaction were 50 50 300
@highlight C and 45min for all the blends.
@highlight Combination of Coal PSD yielded the highest HHV and EF after torrefaction.
@highlight Torrefaction is not recommended for improving the fuel quality of waste tyre.
@highlight The ANN model was more reliable than the RSM as a predictive technique for HHV and EF of the blends.
