 The feasibility of integrated recycling process by vacuum distillation and microwave assisted pyrolysis is demonstrated . This study also extends existing findings on the effects of pyrolysis process conditions on the yield and composition of the pyrolysis products . Cascade utilization of waste engine oil produced a 72wt yield of re refined engine oil and a 26wt yield of pyrolysis products . Almost the whole WEO was converted into valuable products after integrated recycling process thus enhanced the production value as well as avoiding the secondary pollution . The oil product showed significantly high recovery of the energy present in WEO . With the comparison of various traditional methods this integrated process shows a significant enhancement in the aspects of environmental and tech economical performances . The results indicate that the integrated process shows exceptional promise as a means for recycling and treating WEO .

@highlight An integrated recycling process for utilization of WEO by VD and MAP was proposed.
@highlight The influence of absorbents spatial distribution on the pyrolysis of WEO was investigated.
@highlight The integrated treatment converted almost the whole WEO into valuable products.
@highlight The integrated treatment showed good performance of energy efficiency and significantly saved the non renewable energy.
