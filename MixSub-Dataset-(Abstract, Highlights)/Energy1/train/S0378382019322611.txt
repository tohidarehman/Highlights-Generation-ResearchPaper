 Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant renewable resource existing and presently it is considered as a promising feedstock for the synthesis of green chemicals and biofuels for reducing transportation emissions and dependence on fossil fuels .

@highlight Pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse SB and oat hulls OH were studied in the thermo catalytic reforming TCR system.
@highlight The bio oil of SB and OH showed high calorific value and low water contents at 700C reforming temperature.
@highlight The highest reforming temperatures 700C of SB and OH resulted in maximum H
@highlight content.
@highlight TCR technology proved its efficiency in transferring the chemical energy from the feedstocks to the products.
