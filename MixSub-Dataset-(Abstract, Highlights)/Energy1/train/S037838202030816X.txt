 The catalytic effects of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate on the biomass pyrolysis and its mechanism for the selective production of furfural and levoglucosenone were investigated in this study . Samples were prepared with rice husk and ADP solutions with gradient concentration and pyrolyzed via TG FTIR and Py GC MS . Results showed that ADP made the decomposition of cellulose occur at a lower temperature and greatly enhanced the release of C

@highlight ADP enhanced the release of C
@highlight O groups and carbohydrates below 300C.
@highlight ADP inhibited the production of methoxy phenols.
@highlight ADP showed good selectivity for both LGO and FF.
@highlight The mechanism of ADP for selective production of LGO and FF was speculated.
