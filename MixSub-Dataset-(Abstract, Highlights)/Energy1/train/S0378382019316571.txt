 Two ethylene tar derived isotropic pitch based fibers were prepared from nitrogen distilled pitch and air blown pitch . The resultant fibers were carbonized at different temperatures to investigate the effect of the oxygen introduced pitch precursor on the properties and structure evolution of fibers during carbonization and graphitization . The tensile strength of the ABP derived carbon fibers was higher than that of the NDP derived carbon fibers below 1200C because more gas was released from the N CFs during carbonization . However the mechanical properties of the A CFs and N CFs decreased significantly at 1400C which resulted from defects that were produced by the removal of oxygen containing gas . Above 1400C the mechanical properties improved slightly and the interlayer spacing decreased with an increase in heat treatment temperature for two series fibers as a result of the rearrangement and development of microcrystallites . The A CFs had a lower Young s modulus and a higher electrical resistivity than the N CFs because the cross linked structure in the oxygen introduced pitch precursor impeded the orientation of its fibers during carbonization and graphitization .

@highlight The tensile strength of the A CFs was higher than that of the N CFs below 1200C.
@highlight Less gas was released from the A CFs because its pitch precursor contained more stable C
@highlight O.
@highlight The A CFs had a larger
