 Global supply of 1 3 butadiene is faced with a problem such as variation in chemical feedstock in recent years . Many research efforts have been made to produce BD from some renewable resources to replace petroleum . Biomass derived C4 alcohols such as 2 3 1 3 and 1 4 butanediol can be regarded as alternative resources to manufacture BD . Direct dehydration of BDOs into BD as well as two step dehydration through the corresponding unsaturated alcohols such as 3 buten 2 ol 2 buten 1 ol and 3 buten 1 ol has been proposed as an alternative BD production process . 2 3 BDO and 1 4 BDO can be directly dehydrated to produce BD over Sc
