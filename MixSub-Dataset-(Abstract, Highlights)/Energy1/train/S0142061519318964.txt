 High frequency harmonics produced by traditional single phase voltage source rectifiers frequently lead to high frequency resonances in railway power systems . The LCL type filter is well suited for suppressing such harmonics . To improve the performance of single phase LCL type VSR systems this paper proposes a nonlinear passivity based decoupling control strategy which improves the power quality of grid connected systems and is highly robust . The Euler Lagrange mathematical model of the single phase LCL type VSR system is established in a synchronously rotating frame decoupling the active and reactive power controls . Based on this model the passivity of the single phase LCL type VSR system can be analyzed and the AC current of the system can be regulated by the proposed PBD controller by adding extra damping terms . A proportional integral regulator is used to eliminate static errors in the dc link voltage . By using the proposed control strategy the single phase LCL type VSR system can have an improved quality of current injected into the traction power grid a better dynamic performance and a larger stability margin . The advantages of the proposed control strategy are demonstrated by simulations and experiments .

@highlight The proposed PBD control strategy can significantly enhance the steady state dynamic and stability performances of single phase LCL type VSR systems.
@highlight The proposed PBD controller has a merit that it contributes to a smoother and no overshoot dc link voltage response.
