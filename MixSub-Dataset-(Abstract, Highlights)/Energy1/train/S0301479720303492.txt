 Drinking water containing excess fluoride is a major health concern across the globe . The present study reports the feasibility of zirconium impregnated hybrid anion exchange resin for treating fluoride contaminated groundwater . The HAIX Zr resin was prepared by impregnating ZrO

@highlight HAIX Zr resin selectively removes fluoride and can be easily regenerated.
@highlight HAIX Zr resin shows higher defluoridation capacity than commonly used adsorbents.
@highlight The presence of bicarbonate adversely affects fluoride removal by HAIX Zr.
@highlight Exchange of OH
@highlight with F
@highlight is the possible fluoride removal mechanism by HAIX Zr.
