 In this paper the changes in solid phase carbon structure and the formation of carbon nanotubes in the process of K catalyzed pyrolysis of bituminous coal were investigated . The results showed that the content of carbon nanotubes in K catalyzed coal pyrolysis products increased with the extension of residence time . When the residence times were 0 30 and 90min the yields of carbon nanotubes in the coal pyrolysis products were 1.98wt 6.85wt and 10.16wt respectively . It was found that the aromatic carbon C

@highlight Carbon nanotubes were directly synthesized from K catalyzed coal or coke pyrolysis.
@highlight Type of carbon structure in coal required for carbon nanotubes growth was determined.
@highlight Formation mechanism of carbon nanotubes from K catalyzed coal pyrolysis was proposed.
