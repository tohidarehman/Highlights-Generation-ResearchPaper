 Modern buildings are operationally classified as fully naturally ventilated fully mechanically ventilated and conditioned or intermediary . Each strategy implies the selection of different internal comfort models and controls e.g . adaptive thermal comfort operable windows in FR and static thermal comfort non operable windows in AC and different energy consumption and carbon emissions with FR being the least and AC being the most . In each instance the choice of strategy is dictated by the designer with little choice for the occupants . Here we ask the question what operational mode would occupants select given complete freedom We examine this question using real concurrent data from three offices of similar size and use . In each occupants have complete freedom in adopting FR AC or a series of intervening MM strategies . We use monitored data on window and air conditioning operation combined with internal and external thermal conditions to create validated computer models for each office . We discover the true operational mode of each office by comparing the computer model against 23 different scenarios using Dynamic Time Warping for binary and Euclidean distance for continuous operative temperature time series . Strikingly results demonstrate that while each office used divergent strategies across the seasons the indoor conditions were very similar and attainable through NV alone . This suggests that while a purely NV strategy is likely to deliver indoor thermal comfort understanding occupant motivation and educating them on the impact of AC operation is needed to minimise energy use .

@highlight We evaluate the energy performance of mixed mode office buildings.
@highlight We investigate what operational mode occupants would select in a mixed mode office.
@highlight We evaluate multiple behavioural patterns for the AC an NV systems.
@highlight We show that occupant priority could change how buildings are being designed.
