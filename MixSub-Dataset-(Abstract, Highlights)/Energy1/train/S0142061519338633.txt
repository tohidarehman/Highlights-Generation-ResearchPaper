 Resonant grounding distribution networks operate with low fault currents during single phase to ground faults . This mode offers a continuous power supply but causes intensifying fault location problems . Overcurrent relays fail to work and most of the existing location methods are inapplicable . This paper proposes a method based on low frequency signal superposition to locate SPG faults in RG distribution systems . In this method a soft open point a high profile power electronic device applied in flexible distribution networks is used as a signal superposition device which enhances its existing functions of power and voltage regulation . It superimposes a 25Hz symmetrical three phase voltage onto the network after SPG faults occur . The 25Hz zero sequence currents along lines are subsequently gathered to determine the fault section . The main feature of the method lies in the adaptive current criterion for fault section location . The analysis of the zero sequence currents in the low frequency RG subsystem indicates that the criterion is not sensitive to line parameters network structure fault resistance or distributed generation . Comparative simulation tests with the S injection method in PSCAD confirmed the validity and superiority of the proposed method .
