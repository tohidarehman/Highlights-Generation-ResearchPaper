 Phenolics drive the global economy but they also pose threats to soil health and plant growth . Enzymes like peroxidase have the potential to remove the phenolic contaminants from the wastewater however their role in restoring soil health and improving plant growth has not yet been ascertained . We fractionated efficient peroxidases from leaves of an invasive species of Mesquite

@highlight Regardless of phenolic types Mesquite peroxidases at 1U g soil remediate soil.
@highlight Mesquite peroxidases restore soil phosphatases urease dehydrogenase activities.
@highlight Biochemical fertility index of contaminated soil is restored by peroxidase.
@highlight Mesquite peroxidases reduce phtotoxicity assist plant growth in contaminated soil.
@highlight Using Mesquite peroxidases can help in managing
@highlight invasion.
