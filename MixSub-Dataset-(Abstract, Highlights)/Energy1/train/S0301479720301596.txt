 This work presents the degradation of ampicillin in aqueous media by sonochemical advanced oxidation processes . Initially effects of frequency power and operation mode on the antibiotic degradation by sonochemistry were analyzed . Then under the suitable operational conditions pollutant degradation and antimicrobial activity evolution were monitored . Afterwards computational calculations were done to establish the possible attacks by the hydroxyl radical to the ampicillin structure . Additionally the antibiotic degradation in synthetic hydrolyzed urine by ultrasound was performed . Finally the combination of sonochemistry with Fenton and photo Fenton was evaluated . Our research showed that ampicillin removal was favored at low frequency high power and continuous mode exhibiting an initial degradation rate of 0.78Mmin

@highlight Ampicillin AMP sonodegradation was favored at 375kHz and 24.4W in continuous mode.
@highlight Antimicrobial activity removal was related to attacks of HO
@highlight to penicillin core.
@highlight Based on computational analysis thioether lactam and amine on AMP are attackable by HO
@highlight Combination of sonochemistry with Fenton based systems accelerated AMP degradation.
@highlight A high potentiality of ultrasound to eliminate AMP in hydrolyzed urine was found.
