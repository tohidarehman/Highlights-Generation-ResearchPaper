 Small reservoirs as the preferred blue green engineering infrastructure for use against intensive runoff processes have risen in number in Central Europe during the past three decades . However the modelling of sediment siltation is not included in reservoir planning . The unknown temporal sedimentation of a reservoir can lead to the lifespan of the construction being uncertain . The aim of this study is to present a relatively simple process for local managers to model siltation and consequently accurately estimate the lifetime of a small reservoir . Three empirical models were applied to two small catchments in Central Europe . This paper takes advantage of real measured and modelled sedimentation during 2012 and 2017 presenting two different terrain measurement approaches . Our study emphasizes the importance of the R factor value . The temporal development of the R factor is dependent on climate change and the R factor value has been rising steadily during the last decades . The annual mean R factor has increased 1.04 times due to changes in precipitation patterns between the periods 19611980 and 19972016 . These changes can explain possible growth in the levels of incoming sediment into reservoirs . We identified the correlation

@highlight The USPED erosion model is suitable for the assessment of reservoir siltation rate.
@highlight The infilling process in small reservoirs is relatively slow.
@highlight The current rate of climate change potentiates erosion processes.
@highlight The R factor is rising with significant disturbances in year on year comparisons.
