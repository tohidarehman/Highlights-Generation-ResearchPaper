 This paper presents a detailed evaluation of the grid voltage disturbance rejection capability using three kinds of controllers inserted into the current control loop of the series converter that composes a single phase unified power quality conditioner . The mentioned controllers are evaluated and compared to each other to give subsidies to the designer in choosing the one that performs better since static behaviour of the UPQC is directly affected with the presence of grid voltage disturbances . Firstly the classical proportional integral controller is discussed . After that in order to improve the performance of the conventional PI controller multi resonant terms are added resulting in the PI MR controller . Finally a state feedback controller composed of an error integrator and multi resonant terms named SF MR controller is employed where the state feedback controller gains are calculated using an increased model of the controlled system . Independent of the three current controllers implemented in the series converter the parallel converter of the UPQC will always be controlled to operate using the SF MR controller . Mathematical models stability and sensitivity analyses are presented and discussed in detail . Furthermore experimental results are presented to comparatively evaluate the static UPQC performance involving the PI MR and SF MR controllers as well as the well known conventional PI controller .
