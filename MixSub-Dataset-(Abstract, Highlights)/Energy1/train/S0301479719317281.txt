 Traditional orchard meadows are among the most valuable cultural and agricultural systems for nature conservation in Europe . They comprise scattered fruit trees over a highly diverse herbaceous layer and provide a wide range of ecosystem services . However they are strongly endangered due to farmland intensification and abandonment . Livestock grazing is known to promote grassland diversity but it may also cause tree damage through debarking . In this study we evaluated the effect of different grazers on fruit trees in 42 traditional orchards of the Rhenish uplands . Overall we found that 70 of the study trees showed debarking damage although most of them were slightly damaged . Most debarked trees showed accumulated damage over time and only 8 of the study trees were damaged during the last year . The probability of strong debarking was higher in orchards grazed by cattle and horses than on those grazed by sheep . Importantly unsustainable levels of cumulative debarking caused a decay of crown development which may strongly affect fruit production . Additionally lower tree densities favored higher levels of debarking intensity but did not affect the probability of occurrence . Individual tree protection was an effective practice in decreasing trunk debarking . The impact of grazing animals on trees might represent a useful indicator to assess the sustainability of each grazing system and should be taken into account in future agriculture and conservation policies .

@highlight Seventy percent of the study trees showed cumulative debarking damage.
@highlight Most of the damaged trees 40 were slightly damaged 110 of the trunk debarked .
@highlight Only 8 of the study trees were damaged during the last year.
@highlight Cattle and horse grazed orchards had higher strong debarking than sheep ones.
@highlight Individual tree protection was an effective practice in decreasing trunk debarking.
