 Increased social and environmental vulnerability to extreme climatic events and inherent aggravation of environmental and social problems has placed climate change adaptation as an urgent challenge for decision makers . Understanding and using climate change information to advance the implementation of climate friendly policies further compounds this challenge . A rich scholarly literature focusing on climate change adaptation endorses that investing in mechanisms that narrow the gap between climate change information production and its use is crucial to increase adaptive capacity . Based on this assumption this paper investigates the extent to which two collaborative projects that functioned as boundary organisations in Brazil and Australia increased access to information and enabled the continual and continuous usefulness of produced knowledge for climate change adaptation . Considering the distinction between usable and useful information we applied six criteria to guide the data analysis and extract key lessons from each project . Our findings confirm that face to face interactions are more likely to result in research having the societal impact that is being increasingly required by research and funding bodies . Our findings also indicate that two key systemic changes are critical for the long term influence of boundary organisations for advancing climate change adaptation . These include changes to the science knowledge production process and shift in the political culture .

@highlight There is a distinction between usable and useful knowledge for climate change adaptation.
@highlight There are challenges to ensure boundary organisations have long lasting impacts.
@highlight Two systemic changes are proposed to advance knowledge usefulness.
