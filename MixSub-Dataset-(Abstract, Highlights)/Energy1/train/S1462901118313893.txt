 Whether a new policy is adapted to a new social ecological reality depends on the complex interactions that play out from the policy process itself . The established theories of the policy process do not directly or explicitly address the actors ability to influence . This study attempts to fill this gap by developing a model of actors capacity to influence which allows us to analyze the casual relationship between actors influencing capacity and its effects on policy decision making . This paper provides an in depth study of the 2010 Brazilian Solid Waste Policy a policy process characterized by high conflict that took almost 20 years to be approved by Brazilian Congress . It maps the actors capacity of influence over the course of ten years to understand how this influence is related to policy dynamics and policy contents . The study involves document analyses and interviews with relevant stakeholders . The findings identify the important role of influential actors in causing moments of paralysis and in fostering instrumental design . The insights on actors capacity of influence and its effects contribute to our understanding of the complex dynamics of the environmental policy process .
