 The extensive application of antibiotics and the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes shade health risks to human and animal . The long term effects of sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline on denitrification process were evaluated in this study with the focus on nitrogen removal performance microbial community and ARGs . Results showed that low concentration SMX and TC 0.2mgL

@highlight Denitrification performance deteriorated at low concentrations of antibiotics.
@highlight The antibiotic inhibition on denitrification was reversible.
@highlight was mainly devoted to denitrification under antibiotics pressures.
@highlight Antibiotics addition promoted the increase in antibiotic resistance genes ARGs .
@highlight Most ARGs were significantly correlated to
@highlight I1 especially efflux pump ARGs.
