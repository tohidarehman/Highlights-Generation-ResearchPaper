 Thermal dissolution carbon enrichment method proposed in our previous work has been proved to effectively separate biomass wastes into carbon rich target products and a byproduct . In consideration of its improved gasification reactivity and concentrated minerals the residue possesses great potential for high performance activated carbon preparation and further application for the supercapacitor . Therefore in this study the residue was firstly activated into porous carbon and then utilized as supercapacitor electrode . Meanwhile the activated carbons prepared from raw biomass with or without thermal pretreatment were also produced for comparison purpose . Results showed that the activated carbon prepared from residue has highest specific surface area of 2764m

@highlight Residue from TDCE method was ideal precursor for both AC and EDLCs preparation.
@highlight The AC yields and physical properties were improved after pretreatments.
@highlight The electrochemical performance of EDLCs was enhanced after pretreatments.
