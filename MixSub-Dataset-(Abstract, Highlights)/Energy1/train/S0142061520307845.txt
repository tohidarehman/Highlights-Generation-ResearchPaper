 Energy building techniques have gained significant attention for the potential to achieve local energy sustainability . Different from the research on individual energy management for zero energy buildings requiring sufficiently large renewable energy systems due to the mismatch of energy loads and generations this paper investigates the coordinated energy management for a community of energy buildings with peer to peer energy sharing to promote community energy efficiency . Specifically the energy buildings have controllable heating ventilation and air conditioning units and renewable energy installations . In the coordinated energy management in a peer to peer mode the buildings determine their energy sharing profiles and related payments within the community while the sharing energy balance and payment balance are required to be satisfied . Since the buildings are self interested the problem with peer to peer energy sharing is modeled as a noncooperative game with global constraints . Then the existence of the game equilibrium is illustrated and a distributed algorithm is proposed to seek the game equilibrium . A 6 building case and a 30 building case are carried out to verify the energy efficiency economic benefits and the scalability of the proposed peer to peer energy sharing management model .
