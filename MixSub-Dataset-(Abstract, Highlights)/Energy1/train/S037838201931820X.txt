 The impact of Biodiesel impurities on the non catalytic and catalytic reactivity of Diesel soot was evaluated under model DPF regeneration conditions . Temperature programmed oxidation measurements confirmed that Na and K depositing into soot or on the surface of the catalyst enhanced the oxidative reactivity of soot under both O

@highlight Impact of Biodiesel impurities on non catalytic and catalytic reactivity of soot
@highlight Na and K have a positive effect on DPF regeneration.
@highlight Alkali metals increase structural defects of soot and reduction ability of catalyst.
@highlight P exhibits a promotion on soot ignition under NO
