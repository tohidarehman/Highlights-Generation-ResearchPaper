 Nature based measures understood here as measures such as floodplain restoration that use ecosystem processes to meet societal challenges are increasingly advocated as promising solutions for managing flood risks . A suitable instrument to implement NBMs are flood risk management plans stipulated by the EU Floods Directive . While prior research suggests several governance challenges for NBM uptake in FRMPs little is known so far regarding the actual extent of NBM uptake and its role in decision making of flood risk management . Germany with a coherent water policy framework but state specific implementation conditions provides a suitable case study for exploring the decision making practices that are used in the planning process for FRMPs by German federal states with different water governance characteristics . The aim of this study is to analyze the actual uptake of NBMs in German FRMPs and to explore potential factors of the FRMP preparation and decision making practices explaining this uptake . Our explorative research design is based on a document analysis method which assesses the contents of FRMPs of three German federal states .

@highlight Paper focuses on nature based measures NBM in flood risk management plans FRMPs .
@highlight Actual uptake of NBM in three German states is assessed via document analysis.
@highlight NBM uptake in FRMPs is generally low with divergence across states.
@highlight Uptake relates positively to stream order low flood risks and expected benefits.
@highlight Uptake could be enhanced by use of best available data and participatory methods.
