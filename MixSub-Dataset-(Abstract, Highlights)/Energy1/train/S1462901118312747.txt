 The Paris Climate agreement of 2015 implies that a large portion of the worlds coal oil and gas resources must be left non combusted in order to meet the goal of limiting climate change to 2 C. As a result of this commitment some of the national and corporate owners of fossil fuel reserves will be required to leave their reserves in the ground . However which reserves should be left in the ground and when and how should reserve owners be compensated Using the oil reserves in Ugandas Albertine Graben as a case study we show that Ugandan oil development is likely to be cost effective but unlikely to be consistent with the Paris Treaty commitments . We argue that Western nations should compensate Uganda for their foregone oil revenues and we propose a mechanism called climate easements for such compensation .
