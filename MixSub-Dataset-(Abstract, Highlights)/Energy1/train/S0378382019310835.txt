 Palm oil is largely produced in Thailand and sufficient to utilize as a biofuel feedstock through hydrodeoxygenation . In this work a new bifunctional catalyst consisting of nickel phosphide supported on zeolite mordenite in sodium form was prepared by sequential impregnation and characterized extensively by several techniques to understand the reduction behavior phases and distribution of nickel phosphides on the support . Nickel and phosphate precursors were transformed to Ni

@highlight Nickel phosphide on NaMOR was tested in hydrodeoxygenation HDO of palm oil.
@highlight The catalyst contained a mixed phase between Ni
@highlight and Ni
@highlight P with bifunctionality.
@highlight The mixed phosphide phase gave high yield and selectivity toward C
@highlight  C
@highlight alkanes.
@highlight The NaMOR support contributed a formation of isoparaffins.
@highlight The optimum condition to yield the largest HDO was at 425C and 50bar.
