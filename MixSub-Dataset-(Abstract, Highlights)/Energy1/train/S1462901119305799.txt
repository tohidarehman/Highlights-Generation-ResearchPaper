 The relationships among social capital and collective actions for nature conservation and management were analyzed across five case studies characterised by specific land use dynamics in the South American continent . Data on SC and CA were obtained through a semi structured questionnaire to groups of selected social actors . Multivariate statistical analysis was used to identify SC components and to evaluate SC across actors and cases . The results reaffirm that i the multidimensional nature and complexity of SC ii Higher levels of SC are related to higher levels of CA iii social actors with developed internal and external SC can better counter adverse conditions through CA compared to actors who only have one type of SC iv vulnerable social actors do not necessarily have a higher SC or engage in more CA despite their higher dependence on natural resources v those who hold more power or influence in the territory have higher levels of SC and CA vi vulnerable actors often carry out civil community economic and judicial actions while dominant and structuring actors carry out more educational technical and political actions . Therefore the formation and maintenance of SC of the most vulnerable actors and those who support them must be a priority for political action in order to counteract the asymmetric power relations that lead to the exclusion and marginalization of many rural actors .

@highlight We explored social capital SC and collective actions CA links.
@highlight Higher levels of SC are related to higher levels of CA.
@highlight Vulnerable actors do not necessarily have a higher SC or engage in more CA.
@highlight Actor with more power in the territory have higher levels of SC and CA.
@highlight Vulnerable actors often perform civil economic and judicial actions while dominant actors technical and political actions.
