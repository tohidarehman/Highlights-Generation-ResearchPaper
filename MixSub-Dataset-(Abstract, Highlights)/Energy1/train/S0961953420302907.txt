 This research evaluated the dual production of bioenergy in heterotrophic cultures of cyanobacteria . Process performance parameters carbon balance single cell oil production biofuel quality volatile organic compounds generation and sustainability metrics and impact indicators were assessed . The results showed biomass productivity of 1.03kg m d. Biomass and VOCs were the main products formed from the conversion of the substrate in the bioreactor . For single cell oil production it is possible to obtain 0.18kg m d of lipid with this bioprocess . It was determined the fatty acid profile and the quality of biodiesel properties meeting the requirements established by national and international standards . Besides the 22 volatile compounds identified presented the energy potential of 122 205.00kJ kg and a power generation rate of 10 580.5kg m

@highlight A bioprocess to simultaneously produce two bioenergy sources has been demonstrated.
