 Polyethylene is one of the most widespread plastic materials . Nevertheless due to its recalcitrance against biological degradation and the presence of toxic additives landfilled and carelessly disposed PE products have caused serious pollution in the natural environments . In this work we aimed to investigate the growth characteristics of

@highlight The degradation of polyethylene by a marine strain
@highlight IRE 31 was observed by SEM and FTIR analysis.
@highlight The marine bacteria
@highlight IRE 31 shows potential to break down plastics in the ocean.
@highlight Phylogenetic analysis of
@highlight IRE 31 shows a close relationship with several known plastic degrading bacteria.
