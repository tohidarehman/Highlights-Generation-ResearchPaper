 This article provides an overview of how systematic review methods have been used to evaluate public policy . It argues that these methods can be applied to the evaluation of environmental public policy but that certain challenges need to be addressed in order to fulfil the SR methods potential . The article reflects upon two methodological challenges confronting systematic reviewers how data from the articles should be synthesised and how to take societal contexts into account . Analysing how these challenges have been addressed in practice contributes to the theoretical discussion about the usefulness of different synthesis methods and the role of context . Three lessons are drawn as to how systematic review methods can become useful when applied to the evaluation of environmental public policy namely to anticipate the heterogeneity in the literature from the beginning in terms of both research design and operationalisation of key concepts to consider the purpose of the review when deciding whether to take a single or multi context approach and to be methodologically innovative when applying the systematic review methods to complex policies .

@highlight A review of SRs that have investigated public policy was undertaken.
@highlight SR methods can be applied to environmental public policy but methodological challenges need to be addressed.
@highlight Heterogeneity in the literature should be anticipated and considered when planning an SR of public policy.
@highlight Contextual differences should be considered to identify the best way to take this into account in the synthesis.
@highlight Methodological innovations are required to enable SRs to be used to evaluate complex policies e.g. environmental policy.
