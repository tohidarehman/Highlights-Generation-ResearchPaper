 In this paper a cooperative market mechanism is proposed to define the energy transactions and market price in multi microgrids . The proposed model can be used for both the grid connected and isolated MMG as well as models with several MG owners . We use a cooperative approach that guarantees the existence of the optimal solution while the Nash equilibrium points can not ensure the Pareto optimality of the solution in the competitive approaches . Microgrids send their bids offers to the market operator and the devoted energy will be announced to MGs in order to set the production of their resources . Various energy production units such as renewable energy resources dispatchable energy resources Energy Storage Systems and demand response program have been taken into account . Moreover an incentive based demand response program motivates the consumers to take part in the market and benefit from the deployed market . Scenario generation and reduction methods are used to consider various uncertainties in the power system . The proposed model is formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming and solved by GAMS software . Several case studies are tested and the simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed model .
