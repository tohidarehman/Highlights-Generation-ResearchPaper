 Accurate estimations of flood waste generation are a crucial issue in disaster waste management . Multilinear regression of related parameters has been recognized as a promising technique for flood waste estimation . There are two types of flood waste estimation methods pre event predictions using factors related to regional properties and rainfall hazards and post event predictions using damage variables due to floods such as the number of damaged buildings . Previous attempts to establish these models used deterministic approaches however probabilistic methods have never been applied . Considering the large degrees of uncertainty in waste generation from floods a probabilistic approach can provide a more accurate model compared to models developed by the conventional deterministic approach . This study applied Bayesian inference to develop a flood waste regression model in South Korea . The aims of the study are as follows to analyze the characteristics of coefficients estimated by the Bayesian approach evaluate the performance of the prediction model by Bayesian inference and assess the effectiveness of Bayesian updating in a flood waste estimation . According to the results the coefficients obtained via Bayesian inference showed a more significant
