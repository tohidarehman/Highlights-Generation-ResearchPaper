 The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbial structure and phylogenetic diversity under the influence of nutritional conditions and hydraulic retention time in fluidized bed reactors operated in short HRT for linear alkylbenzene sulfonate removal from laundry wastewater . After each phase biofilm samples from FBR8 and FBR12 were submitted to microbial sequencing by Mi Seq Illumina . Higher LAS removal rates were observed after 313 days achieving 993 in FBR12 and 9312 in FBR8 . Different modifications involving genera of bacteria were observed throughout the reactors operation . The identified microorganisms were mostly related to LAS degradation and nitrogen conversion such as

@highlight Hydraulic retention time affected the microbial community establishment.
@highlight Nitrate and ethanol addition induced microbial shifts in diverse taxonomical level.
@highlight Laundry wastewater addition influenced on microbial stratification.
@highlight Several genera related to LAS degradation were identified in both reactors.
