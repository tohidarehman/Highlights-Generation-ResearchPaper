 The contribution of land uses in sequestering soil carbon is a key question of research in tropical regions where C emissions due to land use changes extreme rainfall events and high temperatures can aggravate the global issue of climate change . In the present study different pools of soil organic C were assessed from shifting cultivation lands

@highlight Impact of different land uses on soil organic carbon SOC pools has been evaluated.
@highlight Results show that Tea gardens had impact in conserving SOC pools.
@highlight Active carbon pool ACP has significant correlations with total organic carbon TOC .
@highlight Tea gardens had maximum TOC stock followed by rubber coffee and
@highlight lands.
