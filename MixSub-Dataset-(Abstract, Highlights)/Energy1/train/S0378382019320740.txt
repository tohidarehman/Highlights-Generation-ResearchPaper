 Staged coal combustion is a promising solution to the alkali induced slagging issue . It innovatively separates coal pyrolysis and char combustion into different reactors . This study investigated migration and transformation of sodium during staged coal combustion of two Zhundong coals in a fixed bed apparatus . Behavior of sodium during coal pyrolysis and char combustion are integrated . Carbon coating on sodium species was experimentally confirmed for the first time by low temperature oxygen plasma ashing and ultrafine grinding . Up to 62wt of initial water soluble Na in ZJ coal and 51wt in WCW coal were coated with the carbon matrix during coal pyrolysis . Coated water soluble Na appeared from 500C and its amount reached a peak value at around 700C followed by decrease over 7001000C . Thermoplastic behavior of coal during pyrolysis is expected to play an important role in the formation of coating which hinders pretreatment of sodium . During char combustion all coated water soluble sodium species were exposed and participated in the subsequent release . Part of them can also react with minerals to generate insoluble and HCl soluble sodium species . Char combustion is the main period of the sodium release while coal pyrolysis is the principal period of the generation of HCl soluble Na .
