 Lignins were extracted from different hydrolysates from the cashew apple bagasse . The hydrolysates in turn were obtained by pretreating the CAB with diluted acid acid alkali and alkaline hydrogen peroxide . Lignin removal levels with AA and AHP were of 98.0 and 96.9 resulting in high extraction yields and highly thermostable lignins . The lowest lignin yield was observed with the acid only pretreatment . The FT IR results showed that there was no significant difference between the main structures of the lignin isolated from the DA and AHP pretreatments when compared to sugarcane lignin the only exception being the lignin from AA . An

@highlight Three methods were evaluated to extract the lignin from cashew apple bagasse.
@highlight Acid alkali and alkaline pretreatments promoted higher extraction yield.
@highlight C HSQC NMR revealed the structure of the lignins.
@highlight Acid alkali lignin showed a higher thermal stability and surface area.
@highlight The lignins extracted can be used to produce high value added products.
