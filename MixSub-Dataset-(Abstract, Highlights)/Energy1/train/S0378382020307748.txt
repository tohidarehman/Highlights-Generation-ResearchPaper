 In this study Ce modified SCR catalysts under different Ce loading amounts and different calcination temperatures were prepared by sol gel method aiming for simultaneous removal of nitrogen oxide NO

@highlight SCR catalysts of different Ce dosages and calcination temperatures were prepared.
@highlight Ce modified V W Ti type SCR catalyst could remove over 90 benzene and toluene.
@highlight NO removal efficiency kept higher than 75 in SCR temperature window.
@highlight Catalyst after Ce modification improved the porosity.
@highlight Ce modified catalyst owned better oxygen mobility and acid site distribution.
