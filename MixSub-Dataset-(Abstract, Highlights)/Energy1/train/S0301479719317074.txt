 The chlorophyll breakdown to pheophorbide is determined by biotic factors such as grazing or senescence . So far much of the information on chlorophyll breakdown is available from sediments but information from the water column is limited . This study addressed chlorophyll breakdown pathways on a seasonal basis from eight major ports representing freshwater estuarine and marine ecosystems . The distribution of chlorophyll and its breakdown fractions exhibited distinct spatial and seasonal variations . Fresh water and estuarine ports are characterized by high biomass high pheophytin and low pheophorbide whereas marine ports by low biomass low pheophytin and high pheophorbide . Pheophytin and pheophorbide distribution were biomass independent and dependent respectively . The pheophorbide pheophytin ratio indicated a potential proxy for determining the dominant breakdown pathway i.e . herbivory dominant or not dominant . However CHl BP is taxa specific and grazer s feeding habits . The ratios exhibited apparent differences between different ecosystems i.e . the higher ratios in marine followed by estuarine and freshwater systems . The diatoms contribution to total phytoplankton was more in marine followed by estuarine and freshwater systems . The low and high ratios suggested the prevalence of chlorophyll breakdown via senescence and grazing mode respectively . We proposed that such scaling will have implications in the ballast water management BWM during voyages post voyage discharge including treated water using approved BWM systems and the nature of ports potential discharge point and algal bloom research .

@highlight Assessed chlorophyll breakdown pathway ChlBP from different ecosystems.
@highlight Pheophorbide Pb pheophytin Pp were biomass dependent independent respectively.
@highlight Pb Pp ratio up to 0.4 0.9 and 11.2 for freshwater estuary marine ecosystems respectively.
@highlight High low Pb Pp ratio suggests ChlBP via herbivory senescence respectively.
