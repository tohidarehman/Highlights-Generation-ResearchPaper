 Non noble metal catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of biomass using biomass derived formic acid as hydrogen source is one of promising strategies for relieving fossil energy crisis . Since acidic FA would destroy and deactivate naked active sites developing heterogeneous catalysts with stabilized structure and activity that are qualified in harsh conditions is highly desirable but challenging . Herein mesoporous N doped carbon encapsulated Co catalysts are synthesized through a facile carbonization of Co

@highlight Cobalt confined by mesoporous N doped carbon was used for CTH of furfural with formic acid under base free condition.
@highlight The optimized Co N C 700 shows 100 furfural conversion as well as 99 furfuryl alcohol selectivity at 150
@highlight C for 6 h.
@highlight Only 3.5 equiv. formic acid is enough for achieving high yield of alcohol.
@highlight not only affords low conversion but also leads to over hydrogenation of alcohol and generation of furfuryl formate.
@highlight Co N C 700 is scalable tolerant to acid and could be recycled 5 times without deactivation or leaching.
