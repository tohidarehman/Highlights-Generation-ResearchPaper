 The increasing risk of fossil fuels depletion due to surging energy demand has accelerated the search of alternative renewable sources . Lignin one of the major components of lignocellulosic biomass is the only abundant renewable natural resource for aromatic compounds . In this work the effects of metals and process parameters were discussed via the catalytic hydrogenolysis of O 4 lignin model compound 2 phenethyl phenyl ether . The best results were obtained over Rh Nb

@highlight Rh Nb
@highlight exhibits the best result in the hydrogenolysis of O 4 model compound.
@highlight 98.2 yield of aromatics was obtained over Rh Nb
@highlight under 0.1MPa H
@highlight pressure.
@highlight Almost 100 selectivity to aromatics was observed for other aryl ether compounds.
@highlight 86.7 selectivity to aromatics was achieved in the hydrogenolysis of lignin.
