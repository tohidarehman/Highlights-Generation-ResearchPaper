 The influence of addition of amines and dopants on the properties of mesostructured aluminas synthesized using either Tergitol 15 S 9 or Triton X 114 surfactants was investigated . Selected MAs were evaluated as supports for Co and Ru Co catalysts and their Fischer Tropsch synthesis performance assessed at 493K 2.0MPa and H

@highlight Mesoporous aluminas MAs prepared with non ionic surfactants and different amines.
@highlight Effect of doping MAs with Zr or Ce depends on surfactant amine combination.
@highlight Doping with Zr raises the activity of Co Al
@highlight for Fischer Tropsch synthesis FTS .
@highlight Adding Ru further enhances the FTS activity and C
@highlight selectivity of Co Zr Al
