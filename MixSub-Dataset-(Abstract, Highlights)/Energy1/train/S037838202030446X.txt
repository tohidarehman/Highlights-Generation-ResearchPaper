 Transition metal chalcogenides have received much attention as active photocatalysts for environmental remediation . Additionally the removal of sulfur containing substances such as thiophene has become a requirement in fuel processing technology . Herein we have synthesized MoS

@highlight Sol gel prepared MoS
@highlight nanoflakes on rGO by a simple process.
@highlight Light absorption and charge separation enhanced by adjusting the rGO amount.
@highlight Optimized MoS
@highlight @rGO showed 100 photooxidation of TP after 75min irradiation.
@highlight MoS
@highlight @rGO can show applicability for fuel process technology.
