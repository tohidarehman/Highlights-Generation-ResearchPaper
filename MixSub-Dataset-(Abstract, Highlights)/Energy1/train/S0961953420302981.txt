 The use of biodiesel derived glycerol as a carbon source for single cell oil production is a biorefinery engineering strategy that aims to valorize the by product waste and make the microbial lipid production process more cost effective . This work aimed to improve the capacity of

@highlight The present study describes an alternative way of crude glycerol valorization to produce large amounts of lipids.
@highlight Higher lipid content was obtained while increasing biotin and citric acid at an early stage.
@highlight A biochemical approach for higher lipid content was developed which relied on the strategic addition of biotin and leucine.
@highlight By overproducing specific enzymes with metabolic precursors a potential platform for biodiesel was established.
