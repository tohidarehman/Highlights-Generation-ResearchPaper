 Pulp and paper mill sludge is a waste stream derived from the pulp and paper making industry comprised of organic and inorganic material in the form of cellulose hemicellulose lignin and ash . In South Africa approximately fivefour hundred thousand wet tonnes are produced per annum and is currently disposed via landfilling or incineration . However these disposal methods raise environmental and financial concerns . This waste stream is an attractive feedstock for fermentable sugars mainly glucose recovery and can be redirected for valorisation as a feedstock for microbial fermentation to produce value added products . Sugar recovery by enzymatic hydrolysis as opposed to acidic hydrolysis is a promising approach but is hampered by the lignin and inorganic material found in pulp and paper mill sludge . Several treatment steps to reduce or remove these components prior to enzymatic hydrolysis are assessed in this review . Pretreatment improves hydrolysis of cellulosic fibres and ensures a substantial yield of sugars .
