 Acids present in bio oil are considered to be effective agents to remove alkali and alkaline earth metallic species from biomass therefore affecting biomass pyrolysis . This study assessed whether phenols in bio oil have a similar effect with the pyrolysis characteristics of leached bamboo investigated using water and two typical phenolic compounds phenol and guaiacol . Results confirmed that phenols have an important role in the removal of AAEMs removing 96.496.6 of K 84.685.4 of Mg 77.281.9 of Na and 66.769.1 of Ca . TG FTIR results showed that phenolic leaching enhanced the pyrolytic release of volatile components of bamboo H
