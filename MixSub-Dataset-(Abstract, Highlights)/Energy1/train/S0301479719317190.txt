 An acid recovering nanofiltration membrane with both acid resistance and selective acid permeability was fabricated via a water based coating process for the recovery of hydrochloric acid . To achieve this a thermally cross linked branched polyethyleneimine layer was introduced to a loose polyethersulfone NF membrane by dip coating of b PEI and an epoxy linker and heat treatment in a sealed oven with a high humidity atmosphere . The resulting membrane displayed a positive surface charge with a zeta potential and exhibited a rejection performance order of MgCl

@highlight An acid recovering nanofiltration membrane was developed.
@highlight The cross linked PEI layer was introduced via a water based coating process.
@highlight The PEI coated membrane displayed a positive surface charge.
@highlight PCM7.52 1 was achieved with Mg rejection above 95 and Cl permeation above 70 .
@highlight PCM7.52 1 maintained selective separation performance for a month.
