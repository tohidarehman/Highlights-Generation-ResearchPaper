 Based on a unique micro level dataset of 30 689 mining enterprises from 2008 to 2011 this paper uses the non radial directional distance function to calculate the unified efficiency index and energy environmental performance index for China s mining enterprises . The double bootstrap method is then used to test how tax incentive policies affect the UEI and EEI of China s mining enterprises . The results show that the UEI and EEI of Chinese mining enterprises first decreased and then increased over the sample period overall Chinese mining enterprises had low energy and environmental efficiency especially the coal mining enterprises private mining enterprises and mining enterprises in the central and western regions . Tax incentives positively affect the energy and environmental efficiency of mining enterprises especially the efficiency of coal mining enterprises non state owned mining enterprises and mining enterprises in the central and western regions . Our results remain robust after using the propensity score matching estimator . There is a positive feedback between tax incentives and energy and environmental efficiency more efficient mining enterprises receive more government incentives . Further analysis shows that although tax incentives do not reduce the total energy consumption of enterprises reducing the energy consumption of enterprises can improve their UEI and EEI . In addition R D investment profitability and resource taxes all contribute to improving the UEI and EEI of mining enterprises .

@highlight How tax incentive policies affect the energy and environmental efficiency is tested.
@highlight Chinese mining enterprises had low energy and environmental efficiency.
@highlight There is a positive feedback between tax incentives and enterprises efficiency.
