 Conventional treatment of residual resources relies on nutrient removal to limit pollution . Recently nutrient recovery technologies have been proposed as more environmentally and energetically efficient strategies . Nevertheless the upcycling of recovered resources is typically limited by their quality or purity . Specifically nitrogen extracted from residual streams such as anaerobic digestion effluents and wastewaters could support microbial protein production . In this context this study was performed as a proof of concept to combine nitrogen recovery via electrochemical reactors with the production of high quality microbial protein via cultivation of methanotrophs . Two types of AD effluents i.e . cattle manure and organic fraction of municipal solid waste and urine were tested to investigate the nitrogen extraction efficiency . The results showed that 3151 of the nitrogen could be recovered free of trace chemicals from residual streams depending on the substrate and voltage used . Based on the results achieved higher nitrogen concentration in the residual streams resulted in higher nitrogen flux between anodic and cathodic chambers . Results showed that the extraction process has an energy demand of 9.97 14.44 kWh kg N depending on the substrate and operating conditions . Furthermore a mixed culture of methanotrophic bacteria could grow well with the extracted nitrogen producing a total dry weight of 0.490.01g L. Produced biomass contained a wide range of essential amino acids making it comparable with conventional protein sources .
