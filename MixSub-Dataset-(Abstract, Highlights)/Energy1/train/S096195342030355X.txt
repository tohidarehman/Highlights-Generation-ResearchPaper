 Anaerobic digestion is one of the sustainable processes for biogas production especially if some of the classic substrate is replaced with lignocellulosic biomass . The presence of lignin makes plant biomass degradation less efficient . Lignin mineralization is an enzyme dependent process catalyzed by complex ligninolytic enzymes which are produced by white rot fungi . In our study

@highlight Miscanthus was used as co substrate in anaerobic digestion of chicken manure with sawdust.
@highlight and
@highlight are not capable to delignify Miscanthus.
@highlight Complete kinetic study of selected anaerobic digestion was conducted.
@highlight Mixture mass ratio and digestion temperature have an effect on methane production.
