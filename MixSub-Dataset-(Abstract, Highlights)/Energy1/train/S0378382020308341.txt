 A general catalyzed carbonization approach was demonstrated to prepare mesoporous carbon with low cost biomass waste . The effects of pyrolytic temperature iron content and biomass type on biochar were investigated . Additionally the formation mechanism of the porous structure and the graphitic crystallite structure of biochar derived from biomass pyrolysis with iron were explored . Results showed that mesoporous graphitic carbon with broad pore size distribution was obtained at 700800C via catalyzed carbonization . The degree of graphitization and pore volume could be changed by the addition of iron . Moreover five types of biomass waste were selected as a carbon resource to demonstrate the applicability of the developed methodology . Our approach showed good adoptability for mesoporous graphitic carbon to agriculture and forestry waste transformation and is excellent for the utilization of biomass for bio carbon contained materials .
