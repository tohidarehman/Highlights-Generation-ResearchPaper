 This paper proposes a conditional value at risk based two stage model predictive control method for efficient dynamic load restoration decision making in the coupled transmission and distribution system with renewable energy . The CVaR values are employed to describe uncertainties of the load and source sides . It benefits on line load restoration with uncertainties by fast uncertainty management and prediction error correction . In order to improve the computation of the multi step load restoration optimization in the coupled TS DS system a two stage load restoration model is constructed with the first stage relaxed multi step optimization and the second stage single step tracing optimization . By solving linear programming mixed integer linear programming and mixed integer quadratic programming problems the proposed CVaR based two stage MPC method achieves on line receding horizon load restoration of the coupled TS DS system facing with load source uncertainty . The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using the IEEE 118 and IEEE 33 test systems and a real world coupled TS DS system .
