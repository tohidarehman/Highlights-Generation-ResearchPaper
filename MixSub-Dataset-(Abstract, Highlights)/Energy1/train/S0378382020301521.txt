 This study assessed the electricity generation potential of biogas from organic fraction of municipal solid waste collected for disposal from 2004 to 2018 in 31 provinces of China using landfill gas to energy and anaerobic digestion technologies . Economic feasibility assessment of the technologies was carried out using Net Present Value and Levelized Cost of Energy methods . In addition environmental impact of waste management options based on global warming potential was assessed under three scenarios . Key findings showed that electricity generation potential of anaerobic digestion technology was higher in all the provinces . Economically the results showed that both projects are feasible in all the 31 provinces . However anaerobic digestion project proved to be highly feasible with more positive net present value and lower levelized cost of energy . Sensitivity analysis showed that both projects are infeasible with a discount rate beyond 20 . The results also showed that landfill gas without energy recovery has high global warming potential . It was realized that on the average landfill gas to energy technology could reduce global warming potential by 71.5 while anaerobic digestion technology could reduce global warming potential by 92.7 . This study will offer scientific guidance for investment in anaerobic digestion and landfill gas to energy projects in China and other countries .

@highlight Techno economic and environmental analysis of power generation from biogas is done.
@highlight Anaerobic digestion technology has the highest power generation potential.
@highlight Landfill gas to energy technology can reduce global warming potential by 71.5 .
@highlight Anaerobic digestion technology can reduce global warming potential by 92.7 .
@highlight At a discount rate exceeding 20 both projects are economically infeasible.
