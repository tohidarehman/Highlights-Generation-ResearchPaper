 One of the links in the environmental management chain is the environmentally friendly utilization of the emerging post industrial waste and improvement of the methods of processing thereof . The aim and novelty of this research was to evaluate the potential of fungi to purify wastewater containing post industrial lignin i.e . waste originating from the pulp and paper industry .

@highlight Lignocellulosic composts are a source of potentially ligninolytic fungi.
@highlight strains can modify post industrial lignin with ligninolytic enzymes.
