 With the implementation of smart distribution technology the real time pricing scheme has emerged as a critical subject for energy management systems . In this paper we propose a bilevel optimization model that computes a transactive price signal representing the impact of wholesale market locational marginal prices on retail customers demand response participation . At the upper level of the proposed model the electricity utility company determines the optimal energy procurement and transactive price signals for demand response aggregator . At the lower level each DRA adjusts its electricity consumption profile using the transactive price signals . The adjusted DRA consumption profile is fed back to the upper level problem as the iteration continues . The interactions among DRAs are simulated as a non cooperative game . The proposed model is transformed into a mixed integer quadratically constrained programming through using the Karush Kuhn Tucker conditions . The generalized disjunctive programming is introduced when linearizing the bilinear terms in KKT conditions by applying piecewise McCormick relaxation and big M disjunctive constraints . The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and the proposed solution method .

@highlight The proposed model combines the Stackelberg game with the non cooperative game.
@highlight A new pricing model is proposed to shave the total load profile.
@highlight The piecewise McCormick relaxation method is used to address the bilinear terms.
@highlight A new method is proposed to linearize the AC power flow.
