 Composites containing bio based materials like banana fiber and poly are potential food packaging materials . We carried out an environmental life cycle assessment of coffee jar lids made from high density polyethylene PLA and banana fiber to assess their environmental performance . We considered differences in the type of blend origin of the banana fiber feedstock and banana fiber pretreatment conditions . Irrespective of the scenario a lid made from 40 banana fiber and equal amounts of HDPE and PLA performed significantly better in all 18 impact categories when compared to a lid made from 100 PLA . By contrast the same lid performed significantly better in 3 impact categories only when compared to a lid made from 100 HDPE . Thus environmental performance of the biocomposite strongly depends on which polymer base is replaced by the banana fiber in the composite . Replacing PLA with banana fiber is generally expected to bring environmental benefits .

@highlight Environmental performance of new biocomposite lids strongly depends on polymer base.
@highlight 40 banana fiber lid performs environmentally better than poly lactic acid one.
@highlight 40 banana fiber lid performs better in 3 impact than high density polyethylene lid.
