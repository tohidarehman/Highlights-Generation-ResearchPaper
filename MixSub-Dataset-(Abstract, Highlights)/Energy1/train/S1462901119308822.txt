 Despite numerous efforts to promote and implement more integrated approaches coordination problems persist and impede sustainable water governance and management . This paper introduces a framework for guiding a transdisciplinary diagnostic approach to address such coordination problems . The approach aims at addressing some of the challenges identified in scientific scholarship and water governance practice by combining context specific participatory assessments of individual cases with comparative case analysis guided by a generic conceptual framework . The focus is on implementation processes at regional and local scale and their embedding in a multi level water governance system and a specific environmental and societal context .
