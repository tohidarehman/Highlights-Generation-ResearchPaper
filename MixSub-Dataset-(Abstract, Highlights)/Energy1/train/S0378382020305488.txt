 The upgrading of heavy coker naphtha under conditions of the industrial fluid catalytic cracking unit has been investigated with the aim of obtaining light olefins and a gasoline fraction suitable to be used in the blending of motor fuels . The experiments have been conducted in a riser simulator reactor at 500 and 550C catalyst to oil mass ratio 6 g

@highlight Catalytic cracking is assessed as an upgrading route for heavy coker naphtha
@highlight Commercial catalyst properties condition the distribution and composition of the products
@highlight A yield of propylene of 5wt and of butenes of 3.3wt with strong acid sites
@highlight Gasoline fraction yields a 90wt with moderate acid strength and mesoporous matrix
@highlight Gasoline wt 25 aromatics 10 naphthenes 21 olefins 28 n and 15 iso paraffins
