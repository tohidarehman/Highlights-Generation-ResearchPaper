 Based on the diffusion of innovation theory this paper aims to explore the potential factors that influence user satisfaction with new energy vehicles . Furthermore we introduce the term personal environmental awareness and attempt to examine its contingent effects . A moderated hierarchical linear regression analysis method is conducted to analyze the data collected from a field survey of 335 early drivers of NEVs . Empirical results show that experiences related to usefulness experience of ease of use total cost driving range and infrastructure readiness are important factors that influence user satisfaction with NEVs . In the case of moderating effects we found that PEA might strengthen the positive effects of experienced usefulness experienced ease of use driving range and infrastructure readiness in terms of user satisfaction with NEVs . However the moderating role of PEA in the relationship between total cost and user satisfaction is not statistically significant . Our research findings might provide some useful insights for market managers academic researchers and policy makers .

@highlight New energy vehicles NEVs in China get cold reception.
@highlight User satisfaction with NEVs is affected by several factors.
@highlight Personal environmental awareness plays an important contingent role.
@highlight Government and vehicle manufacturers should jointly promote the diffusion of NEVs.
