 The stability of carbonate products resulting from microbially induced carbonate precipitation under acid rain is under question . The present study investigated the stability of CaCO

@highlight Stability of CaCO
@highlight from microbial precipitation under acid rain is often in question.
@highlight Microbial CaCO
@highlight stability was studied in soil under simulated acid rain SAR .
@highlight SAR were set at pH 3.5 to 7.0 to stress soils continuously for two months with MICP.
@highlight Illumina sequencing identified ureolytic bacteria in SAR treated soils with biostimulation.
@highlight FTIR and XRD revealed pronounced precipitation of CaCO
@highlight even with SAR stress of pH 3.5
