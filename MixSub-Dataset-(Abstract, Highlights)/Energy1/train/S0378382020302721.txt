 Biomass combustion for heat and power generation is one of the best ways for substituting fossil fuels . It is necessary to develop in situ temperature and emissivity measurement technology for biomass volatile flame . In this study combustion experiments on three biomass pellets of pine wood rice husk and fir wood were carried out in a laboratory biomass burner at two A F flowrates . A multi wavelength radiation thermometry method was proposed to calculate temperature and wavelength dependent emissivity based on Rayleigh approximation . The results showed that the temperature and emissivity of pine wood combustion were higher than those of rice husk and fir wood volatile flames . Though the emissivity of rice husk was less than that of fir wood the temperature of rice husk combustion was higher than that of fir wood due to the latter s higher moisture content . The temperatures measured by the spectrometer system agreed well with the thermocouple data . The normalized emissivities of the three different biomass show the same trend indicating the radiative properties of biomass volatile flames do not change with biomass species and combustion conditions .
