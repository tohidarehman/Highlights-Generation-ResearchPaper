 The present work investigated the production of Green Diesel through the deoxygenation of palm oil over Ni catalysts supported on l

@highlight An increase of temperature benefits the overall reaction only up to a critical value.
@highlight The optimum reaction temperature differs between catalytic systems.
@highlight The catalysts tested herein promote mainly the deCO
@highlight and deCO deoxygenation paths.
@highlight All catalysts suffered varying degrees of sintering during reaction.
@highlight The carbon formed on to the spent catalyst surface was a very thin graphitic shell.
