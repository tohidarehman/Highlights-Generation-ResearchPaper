 Phosphorus is one of the most restrictive essential elements to crop growth and development due to less availability in the soil system . Previous studies have reported the synergistic effects between molybdenum and P fertilizer on P uptake in various crops . However an induced long term effect of Mo on soil P dynamics in the rhizosphere and non rhizosphere has not been reported yet in leguminous crops . In this study a long term field experiment was conducted to explore the P transformation characteristics and bioavailability in Mo deficient and Mo enriched soil under leguminous cropping system . The results indicated that long term Mo application increased the plant dry matter accumulation from MarchSeptember . In rhizosphere soil the percent decrease in pH under Mo treatment of the soybean crop was recorded more during September as compared to broad bean crop . Under Mo supply H

@highlight Mo application showed a complementary effect on plant dry matter yield and uptake of P in the leguminous cropping system.
@highlight Understanding the characteristics of the rhizosphere can rapidly deliver info on the P acquisition efficiency.
@highlight Available P and microbial biomass P were higher in the Mo enriched soil.
@highlight The higher P concentration in soils was primarily indorsed to the organic P hydrolysis by the enzymes.
@highlight From the perspective of P nutrient management Mo application could mediate the rhizosphere biochemical process.
