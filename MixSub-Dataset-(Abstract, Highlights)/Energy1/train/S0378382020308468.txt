 This paper investigates the time and space dependent dynamics of the movement and heat transfer of the bed inside the reactor during the biomass gasification process in a downdraft system . Measurement technology that uses radiographic methods is proposed and described . In general the rate of bed subsidence decreases with time . However the bed movement is highly diversified in the air nozzle area . In this region the mean velocity of the bed is slightly faster than at the beginning of the process due to high temperatures and intensive oxidation in the burning zone . Unexpectedly the radiographic markers can be visibly separated into two groups the center region group and the wall region group . This is likely to be the effect of limited air coverage in the center region of the gasifier . The velocity difference of the two groups amounted to 10 1 at the air nozzle level with the wall region group being faster . Determination of particle velocity combined with temperature measurements allows us to estimate the heating rate in the gasifying system work conditions . The actual heating rate for the investigated installation was roughly estimated to be 130C min in the wall region of the gasifier .
