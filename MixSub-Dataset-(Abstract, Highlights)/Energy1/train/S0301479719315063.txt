 Sepiolite is a clay mineral with great potential to stabilize soil heavy metals . A two year field experiment was conducted to explore the optimum use of SEP to immobilize soil Cd and to promote the consumption safety of rice grown in a typical paddy field in Southern China . SEP was applied once or twice over the two year study at three levels before rice planting . The results showed that SEP effectively reduced rice grain Cd concentrations by 4749 in the first year and by 4450 in the second year due to the residue effect . Application of SEP for two consecutive years reduced the rice grain Cd concentration by up to 75 achieving a safe level 0.2mgkg

@highlight Sepiolite reduced soil Cd availability and translocation in rice plants.
@highlight Sepiolite reduced Cd concentration and Cd Zn ratio in rice grain.
@highlight The effect of sepiolite is dose dependent with 0.5 being the optimal dose.
@highlight Sepiolite is effective to remediate Cd contaminated soil and improve rice safety.
