 Energy storage is one of the most critical factors for maximising the availability of renewable energy systems while delivering firm capacity on an as and when required basis thus improving the balance of grid energy . Chemical and calcium looping are two technologies which are promising from both the point of view of minimising greenhouse gas emissions and because of their suitability for integrating with energy storage . A particularly promising route is to combine these technologies with solar heating thus minimising the use of fossil fuels during the materials regeneration steps . For chemical looping the development of mixed oxide carrier systems remains the highest impact research and development goal and for calcium looping minimising the decay in CO

@highlight Calcium and chemical looping can potentially be deployed at commercial scale within the next two decades.
@highlight Both technologies have the potential for energy storage either by means of sensible heat or as chemical energy.
@highlight A critical requirement for such development is construction and testing of suitable pilot and demonstration plants.
@highlight Both technologies can be combined with solar power to provide thermochemical energy storage.
