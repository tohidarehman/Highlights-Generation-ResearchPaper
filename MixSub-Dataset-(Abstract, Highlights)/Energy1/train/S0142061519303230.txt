 Considering different configurations of a protected network in relays coordination offers higher reliability security and sustainability . However overcurrent relaying in N 1 contingency states stands as a complicated problem especially in interconnected sub transmissions systems with distance relays . To overcome this challenge the current paper proposes a coordination scheme in which dual setting directional overcurrent relays and low bandwidth communication links are jointly deployed instead of conventional DOCRs . By doing so more flexibility and extensibility is provided in the coordination process . Moreover in order to direct the relays settings toward optimal solutions a new dynamic objective function is devised . This approach strengthens the controllability of relay settings in different conditions by pulling the variables towards the feasible region . The proposed formulation considers both standard and non standard relay characteristics and demonstrates a nonlinear programming fashion which is solved by chaotic particle swarm optimization algorithm . Results approve that D DOCRs in conjunction with distance relays can successfully maintain a proper coordination in N 1 contingency states supported by the proposed dynamic approach .
