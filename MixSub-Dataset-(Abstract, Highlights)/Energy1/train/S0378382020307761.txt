 Due to the limitations on carbon emissions many countries are seeking potential clean renewable and sustainable energy and fuels . Conversion of lignocellulose biomass to liquid fuel is one of the research hotpots because biomass is a renewable and sustainable resource . This paper outlines an attractive strategy for the production of liquid transport fuels from lignocellulose biomass . Specifically hemicellulose and cellulose are converted to C5 and C6 alkanes and C8C15 alkanes via C5 C6 platform molecules and lignin is converted to arenes and cyclanes via phenolic monomers and dimers through hydrodeoxygenation . The focus is to review the state of the art technologies for the preparation of platform molecules the synthesis of light heavy alkanes lignin depolymerization and catalytic hydrodeoxygenation . In addition major challenges and promising prospects are also pointed out for the future development of the conversion of lignocellulose biomass to liquid transport fuels .
