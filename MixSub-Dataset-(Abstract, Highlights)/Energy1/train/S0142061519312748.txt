 Operation planning models for hydro dominated power systems usually use low temporal resolutions due to the excessive computational burden thus ignoring short term characteristics of such systems . As a result in systems coupled with wind energy such models may fail to accurately capture wind variability and may not appropriately take into account potential consequences of uncertainty on the system operation . This paper addresses this drawback by controlling the cost associated with the operation of a hydro dominated power system equipped with wind power and batteries via a risk measure and formulating the short term load balance as probabilistic constraints in order to hedge against potential extreme wind power scenarios . The risk averse scheme is embedded in the stochastic dual dynamic programming framework . Simulation results for a case study on a real industrial setting show that hedging the system against the short term volatility of wind power contributes to mitigating the risk of excessive operations costs or load curtailments and that the consideration of the decision maker risk profile contributes to decreasing the variability of the solutions . In addition the results of the application also illustrate the potential of the scheme to assess the energy situation of a country or a region under the penetration of wind energy and batteries deployment .

@highlight We propose a methodology for the management of hydrodominated power systems coupled with wind energy and energy storage.
@highlight The methodology enables leveraging the reliability of the system against the short term volatility of wind power.
@highlight The risk profile of the decision maker is taken into account in the operating cost and the load balance constraints.
@highlight The proposal is applied to the Colombian power system under different likely wind integration scenarios.
