 Biomass gasification is a promising approach for bioenergy conversion . Usually biomass gasification is facing interruption in feedstock supply due to seasonal availability of biomass . In biomass gasification formation of tar also affects the gasification efficiency . Therefore in this study catalytic air co gasification of two palm wastes was investigated for syngas H

@highlight Catalytic air co gasification of palm waste was studied in a downdraft gasifier.
@highlight Effect of operational variables was investigated on syngas and CH
@highlight yields.
@highlight Three mineral catalysts Portland cement dolomite and limestone were used.
@highlight Maximum syngas was obtained from limestone followed by Portland cement and dolomite.
@highlight Influencing factors order was temperature catalyst loading blending ratio.
