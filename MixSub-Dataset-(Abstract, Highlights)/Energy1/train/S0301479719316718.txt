 The study evaluated plants with phytoremediation potential that occur spontaneously in an area of copper mining tailings in Southern of Brazil . Eleven plant species were investigated for heavy metal concentrations in its biomass . All species showed copper concentrations greater than 100mgkg

@highlight Eleven plant species different were identified in copper mining tailings.
@highlight The indigenous plants found showed tolerance to toxic metals.
@highlight Most species have the potential for phytoextraction or phytostabilization of Pb or Cu.
@highlight The plants have the possibility of being applied in the recovery of mining areas.
