 Temperature is one of the main factors that influence field establishment of forest species . In high altitude tropical regions and in subtropical regions the occurrence of frost represents an important restriction in the trajectory and continuity of ecological processes . Thus we aimed to characterize frost damage in nine native forest species under different silvicultural management schemes in plantations for the restoration of a riparian forest area in southern Brazil . The experiment was carried out in the Quarta Colnia State Park and seedlings of nine native tree species representing the Subtropical Seasonal Forest . Frost damage was measured using a visual damage scale based on the frost damage experienced in the winter of 2016 . In addition to evaluate the resilience of the species height and diameter data were collected over the duration of the experiment . The species

@highlight Lack of knowledge about cold tolerance is a gap in forest restoration.
@highlight Silvicultural management ensures greater resistance to frost.
@highlight We identified two pioneer species with a high degree of frost tolerance.
@highlight High frost tolerance was associated with rapid plant growth and establishment.
@highlight This study is a basis for other restoration projects in subtropical regions.
