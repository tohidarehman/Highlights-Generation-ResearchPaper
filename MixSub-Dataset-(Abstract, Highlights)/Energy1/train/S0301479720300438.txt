 Bisphenol A is a toxic environmental pollutant commonly found in wastewater . Using non toxic materials and eco friendly technology to remove this pollutant from wastewater presents multiple advantages . Treatment of wastewater with clay minerals has received growing interest because of the environment friendliness of these materials . Bentonite is a 2 1 layered phyllosilicate clay mineral that can support nano metal catalysts . It can prevent the agglomeration of nano metal catalysts and improve their activity . In this article a green catalytic nano zero valent iron bentonite composite material
