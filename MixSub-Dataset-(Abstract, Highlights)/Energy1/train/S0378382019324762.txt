 Although thermal cracking of triglyceride is one of the potential technologies to produce drop in fuel from biomass resources product oil of the triglyceride thermal cracking consists of straight chain hydrocarbons and fatty acids which degrade fuel properties . In order to convert the product oil into drop in fuel single stage upgrading catalyzed by Pt supported on solid acid was studied on the basis of experimental data from autoclave test reaction . Primarily catalytic isomerization of tetradecane was carried out for investigating an upper limitation of the reaction temperature . Also Y zeolite mordenite and AlSBA 15 were used as the supporting material in order to examine effects of their acidity on catalysis for the tetradecane isomerization . Then catalytic hydroisomerization of 1 tetradecene was verified at the limited temperatures and under . Finally a mixture of 1 tetradecene and oleic acid as a model product oil of the triglyceride thermal cracking was employed for the autoclave test reaction . To the best of our knowledge the present work is the first successful result for catalyzing simultaneously all the reactions required for the post upgrading of the triglyceride thermal cracking process .

@highlight Single stage upgrading of product oil from triglyceride thermal cracking was tested.
@highlight Pt solid acid bifunctional catalysts were employed for model reactions of upgrading.
@highlight Hydroisomerization of 1 tetradecene occurred simultaneously with hydrocracking of oleic acid.
@highlight Pt MOR catalyzed hydrocracking of oleic acid faster than Pt Y.
@highlight Pt AlSBA 15 was less active than Pt MOR and Pt Y.
