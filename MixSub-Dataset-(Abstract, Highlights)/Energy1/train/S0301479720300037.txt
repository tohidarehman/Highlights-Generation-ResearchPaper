 The water footprint concept has been widely applied to the agriculture sector however little attention has been given to industrial products . In this paper the concept of water footprint is applied to a large steel plant located in a semi arid basin in the central part of Iran . The limitations of existing research including the lack of any advanced approach for assessing the virtual water of personnel s food working in the plant and the lack of providing independent data sources are addressed . An improved water footprint model of steel production is proposed based on the water footprint network methodology and the life cycle assessment framework . Ideas from food ecological footprint are applied to measure the water footprint of personnel s foods . The case of Iran demonstrates that the water footprint of steel production is considerably large compared with other industrial products . The results highlight the relevance of production line technology energy efficiency measures and human management on reducing the water footprint of steel products . The paper adds to a growing body of literature on environmentally friendly steel production .
