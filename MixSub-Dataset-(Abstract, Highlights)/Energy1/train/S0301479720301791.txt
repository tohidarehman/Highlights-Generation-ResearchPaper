 On line performance indicators of a microalgae bacteria consortium were screened out from different variables based on pH and dissolved oxygen on line measurements via multivariate projection analysis aiming at finding on line key state indicators to easily monitor the process . To fulfil this objective a pilot scale high rate pond for urban wastewater treatment was evaluated under highly variable conditions

@highlight A stable functional bacterial community was stablished in less than 10 days.
@highlight It took 19 days to develop a microalgal community assimilating nutrients.
@highlight pH and DO derived variables reproduce the strong dynamics of the process.
@highlight On line key state indicators that are easily measured were found.
