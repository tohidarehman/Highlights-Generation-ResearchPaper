 Continuous expansion of agriculture for the production of biofuels may be considered a potential source of greenhouse gas emissions due to the ever increasing amount of waste and fossil fuel dependent materials involved . Agricultural waste utilization through the circular bioeconomy concept offers a pathway to reduce GHG emissions . Palm oil production for instance produces palm kernel shells and palm oil mill effluents as wastes in enormous amounts . PKS and POME account for 60 of solid and liquid waste generated from the mill . In this work the feasibility of a circular palm bioeconomy is explored where waste PKS is directly converted to activated carbons in a cost effective one step technique 550C 10mLmin

@highlight Solid and liquid waste from a palm oil mill was converted to value added products.
@highlight Lipases were immobilized onto palm kernel shell derived activated carbons.
@highlight Immobilized lipases were used in converting palm oil mill effluent to biodiesel.
@highlight A palm bioeconomy rationale adds value to waste from the oil palm industry.
