 A series of heterogeneous acid catalysts are synthesized by supporting phosphotungstic acid on bamboo activated carbon and applied in catalyzing esterification for biodiesel production . With the activation of phosphoric acid the obtained catalyst possesses the total acid density of 2.02mmolg

@highlight PWA anchored to bamboo based AC catalyst is prepared for biodiesel production.
@highlight Microstructure of catalyst is greatly improved through H
@highlight PO
@highlight activation.
@highlight PWA BAC possesses satisfying catalytic stability during the reused cycles.
@highlight Co adsorption of reagents improves the adsorption strengths.
@highlight Activation energy is significantly reduced with the existence of acid catalyst.
