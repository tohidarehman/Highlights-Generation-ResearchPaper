 The goal of this research is to develop a partial delignification process for corn stover that simultaneously improves accessibility of enzymes to cellulose and recovers hydroxycinnamic acids as a value added product from the lignin . We recover HCAs from corn stover with a mild base extraction employing sodium hydroxide ethanol and water . The total HCA yield was 33.5wt on a lignin basis and approximately 6wt on a corn stover basis . This partial delignification pretreatment allowed 85wt of total available glucose to be recovered by enzymatic hydrolysis using an enzyme loading that is only 10 of the level recommended for recovering sugars from lignocellulosic biomass . Technoeconomic analysis indicates that recovery of HCAs could reduce the selling price of ethanol by 0.26L

@highlight Hydroxycinnamic acids were extracted from corn stover via alkaline pretreatment.
@highlight Hydroxycinnamic acids yield was 6wt on a biomass basis.
@highlight The pretreatment makes corn stover more susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis.
@highlight Recovery of HCA from corn stover improves the economics of cellulosic ethanol.
