 The promotion effect of Mo addition to alumina supported Mn based sorbents for high temperature desulphurization was explored . A series of Mn based sorbents with fixed Mn loading and different Mo loadings were prepared by the wet impregnation method and both fresh and used sorbents were characterized with respect to their physical and chemical properties . The sorbents were active for H

@highlight High temperature desulphurization using solid sorbents represents an interesting alternative to low temperature processes.
@highlight Mn based sorbent is promising due to thermal stability and sorption kinetics.
@highlight Mo addition improves the performance of the Mn based sorbent.
@highlight The best sorbent investigated 15Mn8Mo showed good capacity and stability over repeated sorption and regeneration cycles.
@highlight Mo addition leads to the formation of MnMoO4 which is plays a role in the sulfur capture process.
