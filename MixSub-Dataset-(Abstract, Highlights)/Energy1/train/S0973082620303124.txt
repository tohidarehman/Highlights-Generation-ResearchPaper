 This study uses a static computable general equilibrium model to examine the potential economic impacts of ethanol production in Uganda . We introduce an ethanol sector in the 2016 17 Uganda s social accounting matrix using maize cassava sugarcane and molasses as feedstocks . Furthermore we evaluate the suitability of each feedstock . By simulating a 10 blending mandate we find that factor employment and total output would increase with a sluggish rise in commodity prices . Real GDP would grow moderately and household income increase mostly for the rural households . Household welfare would decline because of a counter financing tax on gasoline . A reduction in gasoline imports is likely to improve the trade balance and despite the ensuing decline in import tax revenues government income would still rise . Our results are suggestive of ethanol production as a potential pro poor project for Uganda . Both sugarcane and maize are more growth enhancing compared to cassava . The use of only molasses from the sugar industry may result in negative impacts since it is already an input in other activities . We also observe that using an average of multiple feedstocks would be more sustainable . Moreover it would allow a more balanced growth while reducing upward price pressures .

@highlight We model the potential impacts of ethanol production in Uganda using a static CGE
@highlight Ethanol is a potential pro poor project as reflected by the growth in household income.
@highlight There are high prospects of an improved trade balance from promoting ethanol.
@highlight An average of multiple feedstocks would be more sustainable.
