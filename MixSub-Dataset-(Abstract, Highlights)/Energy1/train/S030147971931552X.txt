 In this paper a facile one pot bottom up approach has been developed for the rapid preparation of graphene nanostructures and Ni graphene hybrid composites . Under the aid of ultrasonic irradiation the graphene nanostructures were prepared via reducing hexachloro benzene C

@highlight The samples can be easily prepared by an ultrasound assisted bottom up route.
@highlight Adding appropriate amount of the Ni NPs can enhance the SSA of the samples.
@highlight NGC 25b has large SSA 1349.1m
@highlight  and high
@highlight value 963.04mgg
@highlight  .
@highlight The samples have strong adsorbability adaptability and recyclability for RhB.
