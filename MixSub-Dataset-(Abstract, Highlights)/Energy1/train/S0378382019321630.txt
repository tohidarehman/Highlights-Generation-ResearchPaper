 Phosphorus modified ZSM 5 shows catalytic activity for the cracking of alkanes to produce light olefins such as ethylene and propylene . Here we investigated the effect of the carbon number of straight chain alkanes

@highlight Light olefins were obtained from cracking of straight chain alkanes over P ZSM 5.
@highlight Light olefin yield increased with increasing carbon number of the reactant.
@highlight P ZSM 5 converted
@highlight  octane to ethylene and propylene with high yield.
@highlight Cracking over P ZSM 5 produced a high propylene to ethylene ratio.
