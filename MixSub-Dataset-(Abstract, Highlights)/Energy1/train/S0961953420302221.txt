 Industrial plants using DFB biomass gasification are on the verge of profitability . These plants should be operated more economically in order to support the industrial applications for renewable technologies of this kind . Since some parts of such plants are typically difficult to control a state of the art control strategy is analyzed here in the context of its potential for increased economic efficiency . The DFB gasification plant HGA Senden in Ulm Germany is considered on an exemplary basis here . A process analysis reveals a high potential in the synchronization of product gas generation and utilization . At the present time a relevant surplus of product gas is burned in an auxiliary boiler for synchronization purposes and regular manual adjustments at the fuel feed are necessary by the plant operators . For this synchronization a novel control strategy is developed that actuates the auxiliary boiler and the fuel feed simultaneously . The novel control strategy was experimentally validated for a period of over one month . Due to this long term evaluation the fuel consumption was reduced by 5 and the manual adjustments of the fuel feed that were necessary on average every 30min were eliminated . As a result DFB gasification plants can be operated more economically by applying the novel control strategy for synchronization of product gas generation and utilization .

@highlight State of the art control strategy requires regular manual adjustments.
@highlight Novel control strategy eliminates the before required manual adjustments.
@highlight State of the art control strategy requires additional fuel.
@highlight Novel control strategy reduces the fuel consumption by 5 .
@highlight Results are proven by a long term evaluation at the 14MW plant HGA Senden.
