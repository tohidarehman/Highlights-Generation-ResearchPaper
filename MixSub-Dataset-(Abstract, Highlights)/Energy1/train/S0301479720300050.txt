 Research around hydrothermal carbonization has seen a huge development in recent years materializing in the first pilot and industrial plants . Even though HTC reactions are slightly exothermic the overall process entails energy consumption to both reach operating conditions and tackle heat losses . To face this issue and to develop a zero energy process this work proposes an innovative solution the coupling of an HTC reactor with a solar concentrator designed to fully cover the HTC energy needs . A 300ml stainless steel HTC reactor was constructed and positioned on the focus of a parabolic dish concentrator consisting of one parabolic mirror of 0.8m
