 The Indonesian Government in the last decade attempted to increase modern energy consumption through the implementation of the Liquid Petroleum Gas conversion program and the construction of numerous power generators . The attempt hoped to increase access to modern energy . This study investigates the Government modern energy projects by assessing both the accessibility and affordability of modern energy consumption in urban rural areas and across different income level households . This study measured the changes in energy access in different household categories as well as the energy burden of each household category using descriptive statistics . The present study confirmed the roles of access and income in energy spending using multiple regression analysis . The result showed that household access to modern energy significantly increased in all household categories . However access to rural households and low income households still needed improvement . Besides there was no proof of energy poverty in low income households . The results also revealed that modern energy access income and head of household education were the major determinants of energy spending especially for low income household and rural areas . Hence if Government wants to improve energy consumption households are willing to consume modern energy if the supply is available . However the education and financial ability will also be main consideration in determining energy consumption level .

@highlight The modern energy program significantly improved modern energy access in Indonesia in the last ten years.
@highlight Indonesia s share of energy spending was still below 10 even for low income household.
@highlight Modern energy access income and head of household education were the major determinants of energy spending.
@highlight Government need to encourage LPG access to rural areas and consider improving education to increase electricity consumption.
