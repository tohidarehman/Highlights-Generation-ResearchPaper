 shell was stored under three temperature and relative humidity conditions for 32days and subsequently compressed into pellets to investigate the influence of storage on pelletization and pellet properties . The characteristics of stored CAS energy consumption during pelletization and pellets properties were analyzed . After storage the hemicellulose content of the CAS was decreased slightly and thus increased water resistance . The stored CAS was more easily pyrolyzed and exhibited higher stability towards combustion . In addition lower and more stable energy was required for the stored CAS to produce pellets with higher single pellet density and strength compared with that required for the control CAS . Therefore the storage process is conducive for improved pelletization and pellets properties in industrial applications .

@highlight Dry matter loss was increased with increasing storage temperature and humidity.
@highlight Reduced hemicellulose content enhanced water resistance of CAS after storage.
@highlight Pyrolysis and combustion characteristics of stored CAS were improved 
@highlight Compaction energy consumption for pelletization reduced 57.33 after storage.
@highlight Increased CAS plasticity and surface roughness improved pellet properties.
