 This paper investigates the performance of 25wt Ni GDC catalyst supported on ceramic monolith and open cell foam towards the conversion of CO

@highlight CO
@highlight methanation intensification exploiting Ni GDC monolith and foam catalysts.
@highlight Uniform thin and high strength coated layers obtained by In Situ SCD method.
@highlight The structured catalysts show high methane productivity and stability at high temperature.
@highlight The monolith catalyst optimises temperature management at high space velocities.
@highlight The foam catalyst is promising for methanation at low temperature.
