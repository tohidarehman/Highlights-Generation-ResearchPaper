 The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster and the decommissioning of over a hundred nuclear reactors worldwide led to the increase in the demand for efficient water treatment technologies to remove radionuclides such as

@highlight Polyacrylonitrile Dicalcium phosphate dihydrate nanofiber was first fabricated.
@highlight PAN DCPD NFs were highly wettable by and mechanically suitable in water.
@highlight PAN DCPD NF adsorbent exhibited good Sr
