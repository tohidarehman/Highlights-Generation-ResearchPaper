 An activator corn straw biochar was produced and applied in persulfate based oxidation to remove benzopyrene in polluted aqueous solution and soil . Polluted aqueous solution remediation results showed that at pH 7 approximately 88.4 of BaP was removed by 10mM of persulfate activated by 1.6g L of biochar and degradation played a dominant role . Polluted soil remediation results demonstrated that the activated persulfate solution by biochar can remove 93.2 of BaP . In remediation of BaP polluted soil increasing biochar dosage and persulfate concentration accelerated BaP degradation to some extent while excessive biochar or persulfate inhibited the degradation of BaP probably due to the unnecessary SO

@highlight Corn straw was used as a low cost material to prepare biochar for soil remediation.
@highlight Biochar could effectively activate persulfate to degrade BaP in soil.
@highlight Both adsorption and degradation contributed in BaP removal.
@highlight Biochar tolerated the influences of background electrolytes during soil remediation.
