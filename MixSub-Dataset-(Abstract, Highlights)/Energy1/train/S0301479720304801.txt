 In this study the feasibility of producing electrolytic iron from red muds in a strongly alkaline medium at 110C was studied . The red mud samples from a French industry were characterized by various techniques to determine their chemical and mineralogical compositions . The main phase in the red mud investigated was hematite Fe

@highlight Red mud reduces to iron by electroreduction of Fe OH 
@highlight or solid Fe
@highlight to Fe.
@highlight The deposit produced by electroreduction from alkaline media is high purity iron.
@highlight Current yield of Fe deposition from red mud is high only below 100 A m
@highlight Aluminosilicates contained in red mud largely hinder the electroreduction.
