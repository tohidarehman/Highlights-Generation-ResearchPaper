 Conventional approaches to environmental governance and management are limited in their responses to uncertainty and complexity of social ecological system change . Prevailing neoliberal and efficiency based mindsets tend to focus on avoiding risk and creating fail safe systems . In the last decade resilience thinking has emerged as a means to transition from risk averse and command and control governance approaches towards those that are more adaptive innovative and collaborative . To examine the practical usefulness of a resilience thinking approach we used a complex multi layered case study of Tasmanian coastal governance . Drawing on the diverse expertise and a variety of key governance actors we identified crucial problems being experienced with the Tasmanian coastal governance regime and discussed potential contributions of resilience thinking to address them . Thematic analysis of the results revealed three major contributions resilience thinking provides a way to think about change and uncertainty is compatible with proactive and entrepreneurial leadership and effectively considers issues of scale in the decision making process . We conclude by offering practical suggestions towards devolved leadership and improved cross scale collaboration and consider the possibility of a hybrid resilience and risk based approach to coastal management and governance .
