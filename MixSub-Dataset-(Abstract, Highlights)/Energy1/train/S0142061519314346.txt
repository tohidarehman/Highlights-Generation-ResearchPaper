 This paper proposes a novel Power Flow method based on Composite Newton Cotes formula . The proposed method aims to be robust and efficient enough to properly manage ill conditioned power systems . Self adapted mechanisms for tuning the parameters of proposed PF method are provided . The proposed method is tested on several ill conditioned systems ranging from 3012 to 27 318 buses at loadbase and heavy loading conditions . Moreover its ability to handle the generators reactive limits is also tested . The obtained results prove that the proposed method is remarkably robust and more efficient than other well known Power Flow techniques .
