 Fe attapulgite powder Ni AP and Fe Ni AP were prepared by thermally decomposing iron pentacarbonyl nickel tetracarbonyl and different molar ratios of IPC to NTC onto AP in ethoxyethane respectively . Their activities for the catalytic hydrocracking of dimethane were compared under the same conditions . As a result the activity of Fe Ni S AP for DNM hydrocracking is significantly higher than that of other catalysts used . DNM conversion is near 100 over Fe Ni S AP with Fe Ni 2 1 . Over the catalyst H

@highlight Fe Ni S AP is effective for catalyzing the cleavage of bridged linkages.
@highlight More organic matter in R
@highlight was converted into SP
@highlight CHC procedure.
@highlight SP
@highlight is rich in arenes and arenols while SP
@highlight is dominated by nonnitrogen ketones.
