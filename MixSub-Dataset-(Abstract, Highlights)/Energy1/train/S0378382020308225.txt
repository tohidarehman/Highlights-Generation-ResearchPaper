 A novel external mixing atomizer capable of producing a non conical spray was proposed and investigated in this work . The charge coupled camera and phase Doppler particle analyzer were used to study the macroscopic and microcosmic spray characteristics of the liquid aircraft kerosene respectively . The spray angles from the front view and side view were achieved . The results show that the spray angle of this external mixing atomizer can be significantly different in the two perpendicular directions but the discrepancy gradually decreases with the increase of the air flow rate . In addition the distributions of Sauter mean diameter and mean axial velocity component U

@highlight A novel external mixing atomizer was designed and investigated in this work.
@highlight The non conical fuel spray of the external mixing atomizer is achieved.
@highlight Central region of the fuel spray is dominated by the airblast atomization.
@highlight Outer region of the fuel spray is dominated by pressure swirl atomization.
