 The solid residue of gasification or gasification char is in many cases considered as a waste material inevitably generated during the operation of gasifiers . However it is a good candidate to substitute synthetic catalysts for tar reforming and it is a carbon rich material with a good potential for carbon negative applications as biochar . In this work a wood derived gasification char was tested for the upgrading of producer gas generated from pilot scale gasification of wheat straw . The effect of a char bed in combination with partial oxidation was assessed under different conditions . The presence of the char bed markedly reduced the total tar concentration but the bed material suffered deactivation . Partial oxidation prolonged the activity of the char bed by promoting reforming reactions at the surface of char particles and further reduced the tar content below 1g Nm

@highlight Residual char from wood gasification was applied to pilot scale tar reforming.
@highlight Effects of char bed and partial oxidation on producer gas quality were evaluated.
@highlight The presence of steam and partial oxidation prevented deactivation.
@highlight The properties of char were assessed before and after the hot gas treatment.
@highlight Spent char showed improved recalcitrance for terrestrial carbon sequestration.
