 The former consensus on a link between energy consumption and improved well being of a country has been scrutinized by scholars for decades and is succinctly for the time being a contested thesis . Until the 1970s the relation of energy to well being was defined as linearly proportional and in a later period still as an increasing logarithmic function . Recent empirical research falsified the assumption of an overt link between well being and increased energy consumption in countries with high per capita energy usage .

@highlight First evidences for a Well being Turning Point WTP supporting a well being degrowth beyond high energy footprint threshold.
@highlight The WTP is a novel argument to support degrowth from energy perspective.
@highlight The WTP can be neither fully proven nor falsified with current data
@highlight The WTP is not visible when the fitting was population weighted.
@highlight The WTP is not visible if oil exporting countries and some small countries are excluded.
