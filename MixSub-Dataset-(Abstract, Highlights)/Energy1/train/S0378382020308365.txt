 Reforming of toluene which is a model compound of gasoline with model exhaust gas of gasoline engine was carried out with Ni catalyst . The Ni Mg Al catalyst prepared from hydrotalcite like precursor compound showed higher performance than Ni Al

@highlight Ni catalysts was applied to reforming of toluene for model EGR system.
@highlight Hydrotalcite like compound derived Ni Mg Al catalyst was superior to Ni Al
@highlight The activity of Ni Mg Al was higher than Rh CeO
@highlight with the same active metal cost.
@highlight Larger H
@highlight formation rate was obtained at low toluene feed ratio to model EGR gas.
@highlight The deactivation was more significant under higher partial pressure of toluene.
