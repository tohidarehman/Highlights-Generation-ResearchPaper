 Aqueous phase reforming can be used as an efficient method to purify and obtain added value from rather dilute side waste streams of process waters containing e.g . alcohols or sugar alcohols . Such side streams often have none or even negative value due to purification costs which contributes to the economy of the process . Xylitol was here used as a model compound . The desired product in the current study was hydrogen which can be used for valorizing by products via hydroprocessing or as a bioenergy source . In addition to hydrogen some alkanes were also obtained which are prime sources of bio energy for power production . The current work focused especially on the influence of the reaction conditions on the xylitol conversion and hydrogen selectivity which has not been reported previously . The influence of reaction conditions on the aqueous phase reforming of xylitol on Pt Al

@highlight Biohydrogen and some alkanes were obtained for use in biofuels biochemicals and bioenergy production.
@highlight Practically full conversion was achieved in a trickle bed reactor system.
@highlight The liquid to gas ratio and operating pressure influenced significantly the conversion and to some extent also selectivity.
@highlight Temperature influenced the conversion significantly however the influence on selectivity was not very significant.
@highlight The activation energy for xylitol conversion was determined for the first time being 79.3kJ mol.
