 The microstructure tuning of bulk catalysts would significantly influence their physical chemical properties for the subsequent applications . In this work the three dimensionally ordered macroporous bulk catalysts were successfully fabricated by employing the poly as hard template . The prepared bulk catalysts were characterized by means of techniques such as TG DTG XRD low temperature N

@highlight 3DOM bulk catalysts were successfully fabricated by employing the PMMA as hard template.
@highlight The unique pore system could supply available active sites and facilitate the diffusion process.
@highlight The prepared 3DOM bulk catalysts exhibited relatively high surface area and structure stability.
@highlight The preparation process and structure activity correlation of catalysts were investigated.
