 In order to clarify the key factors of problems in combustion of herbaceous biomass soluble and insoluble fractions of corn stover wheat straw and rice straw pre and post combustion were prepared and examined . Elemental contents components of the samples and mass loss heat effect at heating stage of the samples were measured using X ray fluorescence X ray Diffraction and simultaneous thermal analysis . Supplementary STA experiments on water soluble fraction of raw biomass mixtures of KCl K

@highlight Congruent melting of KCl and K
@highlight SO
@highlight occurs at 680C in combustion of herbaceous biomass.
@highlight The content of Cl dominates the mass loss of KCl in biomass ash below 900C.
@highlight Change of solubility from pre to post combustion varies significantly with elements.
@highlight Transformations of KCl are critical changes of inorganics during combustion of herbaceous biomass.
