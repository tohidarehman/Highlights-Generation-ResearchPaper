 We describe resource assessment of rivers and a canal in the Upper Blue Nile Basin Ethiopia for hydro kinetic turbines . Various hydrodynamics methods are coupled with hydrological methods with the aim of transforming the measured flow rate or discharge into velocity data to determine the power density the available power per square meter of vertical flow area . We estimate the PD over the length of the rivers and canal and estimate the power density variation over the months of the year . The Gumara Gilgel Abay and Bahirdar Abay rivers in the Blue Nile Basin were studied along with the Koga irrigation main canal . Historical databases of yearly monthly and daily averaged discharge were used . The key elements of this analysis are converting discharge into velocity for PD determination and the period over which the velocity is averaged compared to the averaging time used to determine the HKT power curve . All software used in this work is publicly available . To predict PD ARC GIS was used to estimate the reach length and cross section from raster Digital Elevation Models . The hydraulic modeling of the velocity was done using HEC RAS software . Field measurements were conducted to validate the hydrodynamic model . The result of the study was cross sectional area average water velocity
