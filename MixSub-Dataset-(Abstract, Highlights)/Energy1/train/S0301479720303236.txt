 The purpose of the present study was to explore the power of the Health Belief Model to explain water conservation behavior in Northeastern Iran . The research population consisted of farmers who were farming in Neyshabur plain in Khorasan Razavi Province in northeast of Iran . A cross sectional study was conducted among 235 farmers recruited using a multistage random sampling design . To collect data the questionnaire was used which its validity and reliability were confirmed . The results of a structural equation modeling indicated that perceived susceptibility perceived benefits and cue to action accounted for approximately 41 of the variance in farmers water conservation behavior . Moreover the perceived benefit was the strongest predictor of water conservation behavior while perceived severity perceived barriers self efficacy and general beliefs not significant on behavior . These results confirmed the practicability and effectiveness HBM for examining water conservation behavior among farmers in Iran .

@highlight HBM is a useful tool for investigating water conservation behavior.
@highlight Perceived susceptibility perceived benefits and cue to action were predictors of water conservation behavior.
@highlight Perceived benefits were the strongest determinants of behavior.
@highlight Perceived severity perceived barriers self efficacy and general beliefs had no influence on behavior.
