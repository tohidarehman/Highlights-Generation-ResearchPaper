 One of the requirements for a resilient distribution system with distributed generators is to restore as many critical loads as possible during a power supply outage of the main power grid . During the outage period the distribution network is divided into microgrids and continuously provides power to loads . However the uncertainty of renewable DGs output which can not be predicted perfectly increases the difficulty of optimal operation of MGs . In this paper an MG scheduling method is proposed based on robust model predictive control for the resilience enhancement of distribution networks . The DGs energy storage devices and switches are optimally coordinated to maximize load restoration . First an RMPC based two layer MG scheduling model considering the worst case scenario is established to schedule the structure of the MGs and the output of the DGs simultaneously . Furthermore the original model is transformed into a single layer programming problem using strong duality theory . The solution of the RMPC based model can guarantee the reliability and feasibility of MGs within the predefined uncertainty sets of the DGs . The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated with the modified IEEE 37 node distribution test system .
