 The livestock sector has a large influence on direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions with potential negative impacts on climate change . We quantify the environmental impacts related to the introduction of a voluntary animal based policy supported by the European Union the Measure 14 of Rural Development Programmes 20142020 on animal welfare . In particular we focus on methane and nitrous oxide emissions and on carbon based and nitrous oxide emissions from land use change . Our case study is the dairy sector of the EU Member States . We found that the animal based measures have limited environmental impacts although marked differences exist across Member States .

@highlight Animal based policies correct market failures but may have side effect on environment.
@highlight Direct and indirect environmental impacts are heterogeneous across EU Member States.
@highlight Animal based policies would contribute although marginally to meet the EU 2020 target of 20 cuts in GHG emissions.
