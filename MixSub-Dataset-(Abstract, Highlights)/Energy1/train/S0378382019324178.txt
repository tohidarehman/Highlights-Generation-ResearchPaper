 Partial hydrogenation of soybean oil derived fatty acid methyl esters was performed to improve oxidative stability of biodiesel . The reaction was tested in a semi batch reactor at 100C 0.4MPa . The effect of Pd particle size on activity and

@highlight Hydrogenation activity and
@highlight selectivity were varied to Pd particle size.
@highlight Large Pd particle size catalysts 6.17.8 nm provided 2 to 3 fold higher TOF compared with small particles 2.74 nm .
@highlight Higher selectivity towards desired C18 1 FAMEs was obtained over small Pd particle size catalysts 2.74 nm .
@highlight The 0.5Pd MCM 41 catalyst with the smallest Pd particle size 2.7 nm showed the highest
@highlight C18 1 selectivity.
@highlight Partial hydrogenationis a potential technique to improve biodiesel oxidative stability with satisfactory cold flow property.
