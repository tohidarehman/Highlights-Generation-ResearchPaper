 Waterlogged soils and sediments contaminated with potentially toxic elements constitute a complicated case of degraded areas their management requires understanding of the dynamic redox driven PTE mobilization . Such studies about PTE redox induced dynamics in fishpond sediments are still scarce but of great importance concerning environmental and human health risk . We studied the redox potential E

@highlight Flooding fish farm sediments caused a significant decrease in their pH.
@highlight Dissolved As Co Cr Ni Se Zn and DOC Fe Mn increased under low E
@highlight High E
@highlight leads to an increase release of Cu Mo V and specific UV absorbance.
@highlight Anaerobe aerobe microorganisms gram negative positive bacteria fungi are found.
@highlight The results are important for a sustainable management of degraded waterlogged sediments.
