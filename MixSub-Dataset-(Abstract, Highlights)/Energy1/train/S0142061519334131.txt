 The future all electric ship requires a resilient shipboard power system that can withstand extreme events without substantial damage and maintaining critical capabilities . For superior capability to sustain disruptions numerical measures of resilience provide assistance to engineers in making planning and operational decisions . This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the resilience characteristics of an SPS using correlation based feature selection to identify the system attributes that are the best predictors of performance during contingencies . Such attributes are typically chosen in the design stage and are not subject to modification during operation . The selected features are adjusted and their ramifications on the SPS performance are evaluated under the same contingencies . Results show quantitatively how a change of relevant attributes can improve or degrade the system performance in terms of unserved load and minimum recovery time .

@highlight All electric ships can be made more resilient by appropriate design choices.
@highlight Feature selection approach can quantify effect of factors on resilience.
@highlight Case studies show that the modification of certain parameters can affect system performance during extreme events.
@highlight Features and performance indicators should reflect the desired characteristics of a resilient shipboard power system.
