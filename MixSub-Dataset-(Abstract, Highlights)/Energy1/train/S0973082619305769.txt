 Wet processing is the most energy intensive subsector in the textile industry . The complex nature of specific energy consumption warrants a closer look at the independent parameters impacting the SEC . Energy audits were conducted in twelve knit fabric processing plants processing fabric quality of 160180g per square meter in South Asian countries to normalise independent parameters like fabric characteristics geographic location and production processes . Energy consumption profiles SEC independent parameters impacting SEC resource conservation measures and their predicted impact on SEC were evaluated . Also the values for annual baseline Greenhouse Gas emissions and predicted emission reduction were calculated . The most energy intensive fabric dyeing section consumed an average 32 of plant s electrical energy and 69 of the plant s steam . The baseline SEC of 3984GJ t was predicted to be reduced to 2958GJ t by implementing the RCMs . The baseline SECs had high correlation with values for plant capacity utilisation and heat rate for power generation . Priorities were established on the different areas for resource conservation for different plant configurations . The specific emission was predicted to reduce from 2.1 4.3 tCO

@highlight Energy diagnosis of twelve knit fabric based wet processing plants were studied.
@highlight Fabric dyeing is the most energy intensive section 69 of steam consumption.
@highlight Developed framework for quantifying replicable resource conservation measures RCM .
@highlight Specific energy consumption SEC can be reduced by about 18 40 .
@highlight Benchmarking plant performance should factor these replicable RCMs along with SEC.
