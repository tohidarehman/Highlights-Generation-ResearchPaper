 Organic matter composition changed due to land use land cover and hydrology modification has distinctive linkage towards sustainable environment management in tropical river systems . It is crucial in small river systems which experience delay of freshwater flow to the estuaries due to headwater damming also LULC alteration along the entire basin . In order to understand this fundamental linkage in tropical Zuari river estuary we analyzed multi proxy data of organic carbon to total nitrogen ratio C
