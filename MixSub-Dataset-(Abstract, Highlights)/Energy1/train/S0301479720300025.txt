 The present study tests the potentiality of a novel microwave based regenerating permeable reactive barrier system as combined treatment for Cs contaminated groundwater . Granular activated carbon was selected as adsorptive materials in batch and column MW regeneration experiments . Experimental and modeling data were elaborated for technical and economic considerations in order to assess the MW PRB feasibility jointly with essential information regarding its real field applicability . Batch experiments investigated the effects of 10 adsorption MW regeneration cycles under different MW irradiation conditions applied electric field 200460Vm

@highlight A novel permeable reactive barrier coupled with microwave MW PRB is evaluated.
@highlight MW PRB is assessed for the treatment of simulated Cs impacted groundwater.
@highlight MW regeneration of granular activated carbon is investigated at laboratory scale.
@highlight Techno economic analysis of MW PRB system was compared with conventional PRB.
@highlight Saved costs encourage the implementation of proposed MW PRB system.
