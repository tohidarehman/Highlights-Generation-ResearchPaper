 Two types of chitosan based composites were synthesized under microwave irradiation and characterized as advanced catalysts of enhanced photocatalytic activity under the visible light . The morphological investigation reflected the formation of ZnO and Ce doped ZnO at stunning micro flowers of nano limps . Additionally the optical studies reflected a reduction in the bandgap of ZnO from 3.3eV to 2.85eV and 2.5eV after supporting it onto chitosan chains and after doping it with cerium respectively . The synthetic composites were applied in photocatalytic removal of malachite green dye under a visible light source . The synthetic CH ZnO and CH CeZnO showed enhancement in the photocatalytic removal of M.G by 54 and 87 respectively as compared to the pure ZnO . The synthetic composites are of high stability and can be reused for five photocatalytic degradation cycles at stunning removal percentages . The main oxidizing radicals during the removal of M.G by CH ZnO are the generated electron hole pairs as well as the hydroxyl radicals . The effective species in CH CeZnO photocatalytic system are the photogenerated hydroxyl radicals followed by the electron hole pairs .
