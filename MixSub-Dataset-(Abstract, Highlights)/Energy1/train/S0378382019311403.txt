 This study examines the integration of commercial liquid fuels production from biomass using the alcohol to jet pathway into a conventional kraft pulp mill operation . Mill assets including feed handling and supply chain infrastructure power and recovery systems and potential equipment retrofitting opportunities are utilized by a fuel production unit through lignocellulosic ethanol fermentation and alcohol to jet processing . Potential economic benefits of integrating the energy recovery system of the pulp mill with the biomass pretreatment systems are evaluated through energy and mass balances of the integrated facility . Process variations explored within this model include the use of hemicellulose pre extraction or black liquor fractionation modifications to digester operations and the scale of a mill retrofitting project . The production of liquid fuels is found to provide a relative reduction in energy use compared to pulp production . With the low energy costs provided by this design maintaining a high yield throughout the conversion process and the reduction of capital costs offer the best opportunities for further improving economics . Although the economic viability of a realistic biorefinery is not directly evaluated in this study the aim is to identify technical barriers and opportunities for development of integrated strategies for implementing proven biofuels production technologies .
