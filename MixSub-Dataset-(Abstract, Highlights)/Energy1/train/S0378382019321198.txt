 Aiming to reduce the emission of particulate matter during biomass combustion we investigated the effects of pyrolysis temperature and feedstock type on the chemical properties of biochar and PM emission characteristics during subsequent combustion . Wood and manure based char samples were prepared at pyrolysis temperatures ranging from 200 to 500C and combusted in a laboratory scale tube furnace at 850C . Due to the removal of volatile matter the total PM emission factor of the wood char decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature becoming negligible with pyrolysis at temperatures over 400C . For manure char although pyrolysis removed VM and reduced the total PM EF from 12.52.7 to 5.82.9mg g fuel the high ash content precluded any effect on the emission of ash derived PM . The occurrence of ash derived PM resulted from release of Na Mg K and Ca and was enhanced at higher combustion temperatures . We demonstrated that the pyrolysis of low ash biomass effectively reduces the risk of PM emission . However the efficacy of thermal treatment of high ash biomass is limited but might be improved with further treatment such as ash removal .
