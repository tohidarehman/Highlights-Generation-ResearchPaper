 The importance of faecal sludge management is gaining recognition . However methods are still lacking to reasonably estimate the quantities and qualities that need to be managed which makes the planning for and implementing of management solutions quite difficult . The objective of this study was to collect and analyse Q Q of faecal sludge at a citywide scale and to evaluate whether SPA DET data could then be used as predictors of Q Q of faecal sludge . 60 field samples and questionnaires from Hanoi and 180 from Kampala were analysed . Software tools were used in an iterative process to predict total solids and emptying frequency in both Hanoi Vietnam and Kampala Uganda . City specific data could be predicted with types of SPA DET data as input variables and model performance was improved by analysing septic tanks and pit latrines separately . Individual models were built for TS concentrations and emptying frequency . In addition a model was built across both cities for emptying frequency of septic tanks based on number of users and containment volume indicating predictive models can be relevant for multiple cities . Number of users containment volume truck volume and income level were identified as the most common variables for the correction function . Results confirm the high intrinsic variability of faecal sludge characteristics and illustrate the importance of moving beyond simple reporting of city wide average values for estimations of Q Q . The collected data and developed scripts have been made available for replication in future studies .
