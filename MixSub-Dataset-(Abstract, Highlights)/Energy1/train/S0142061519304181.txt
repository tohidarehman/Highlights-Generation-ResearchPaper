 Estimation of low frequency oscillation modes is important for taking remedial actions to ensure the small signal stability of the power system . This paper proposes three approaches to estimate the model order of low frequency oscillations using ringdown data from Phasor Measurement Units . The first approach uses a sequential cumulative sum test on the eigenvalues of the autocorrelation matrix of the signal data to estimate the model order . The second approach estimates the model order based on the eigenvalue contribution in the trace of the autocorrelation matrix . The third algorithm uses sum of squares of the eigenvalues to estimate the model order . All the methods are compared to ascertain their efficacy in estimating the model . The algorithms are tested on oscillation data obtained for WSCC 9 bus system simulated on RTDS and the field data from a generating station in India .
