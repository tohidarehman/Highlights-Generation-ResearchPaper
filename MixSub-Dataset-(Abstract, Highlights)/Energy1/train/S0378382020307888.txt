 Separation of olefin from fluid catalytic cracking naphtha is a high way to protect the research octane number from a loss during hydrodesulfurization . Solvent extraction is a promising way to separate olefin and extract sulfides simultaneously . In order to realize effective separation of olefin from FCC naphtha this paper focused on the development of a kind of high efficient solvent and optimization of corresponding operation conditions for olefin separation . The results showed the combined solvents consisted of sulfolane and

@highlight A newly combined solvents were developed to separate olefin and sulfides from FCC naphtha.
@highlight The solvents have high separation capability for olefins.
@highlight The solvents are stable cheap and well recyclable.
@highlight Optimal separation conditions of combined solvents were reported.
@highlight The study helps to upgrade clean gasoline without loss of RON.
