 The enhancement effect of supercritical water on scrap tire depolymerization was investigated based on structural feature of SCW using the reactive force field molecular dynamics simulation and density functional theory method . The results show that SCW acts not only in clusters but as non bonded H

@highlight Enhancement effect of supercritical water SCW on scrap tire ST depolymerization was revealed.
@highlight SCW performed as clusters and non bonded monomers in the interaction with ST.
@highlight More liquid products could be obtained in a low density SCW surrounding.
@highlight Microscopic pathways of ST depolymerization with SCW and H
@highlight  CO formation were descripted.
@highlight For more oil and H
@highlight  the optimal water rubber mass ratio ranged from 4 to 6.
