 One of the solutions for the problems regarding increasing water scarcity and pollution of water resources can be wastewater reuse . Constructed wetlands are a sustainable and cost effective technology for wastewater treatment . If they are able to produce effluent of a needed quality they can be a valuable addition for wastewater reuse schemes . This review studied 39 treatment systems based on CWs and it assessed their characteristics and performance on pollutant removal . Moreover their potential to reach the new European Union standards for agricultural wastewater reuse was evaluated . The results showed that the combination of CWs with additional technologies can further increase their performance and provide better removal efficiencies in comparison with conventional horizontal and vertical subsurface flow CWs . Particularly hybrid systems showed a better removal of organic matter and bacterial indicators than single stage CWs . For most of the systems considered the concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand and total suspended solids in treated effluent were below the limits for agricultural reuse . However that was often not the case with

@highlight Additional technologies increase performance of conventional constructed wetlands.
@highlight The multistage treatment systems can optimize overall removal efficiency.
@highlight Seasonal variations and substrate types can affect pollutant removal.
@highlight Effluent disinfection is recommended for wastewater reuse application.
