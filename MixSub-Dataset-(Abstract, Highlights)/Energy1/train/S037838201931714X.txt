 Floating beads rich in silica aluminum oxide are hollow glass microspheres that can be obtained from fly ash by flotation . Floating beads have the advantages of high yield low cost and easy access in the power plants or industrial kilns and are used as the sorbent for reducing the fine particulate matter emissions during pulverized coal combustion in this work . The pulverized coals mixed with floating beads are burned in an electrically heated drop tube furnace at 1573K . The size distribution and yield of PM are analyzed by an electrical low pressure impactor . The results indicate that the internal mineral elements especially Na K Ca and S form a large amount of PM during pulverized coal combustion and floating beads can efficiently reduce PM formation via chemisorption and physisorption . With floating beads addition the yield of ultrafine mode particles PM

@highlight Chemisorption and physisorption of fine PM on the floating beads on are investigated.
@highlight The surface reaction between mineral vapors and floating beads particles reduces PM
@highlight emission.
@highlight The particles collide and coalesce on the surface of floating beads can efficiently reduce the yield of PM
@highlight Amounts of active sites and free silicon dioxides present in floating beads can promote the capture of fine PM.
