 Because of environmental benefits wind power is taking an increasing role meeting electricity demand . However wind power tends to exhibit large uncertainty and is largely influenced by meteorological conditions . Apart from the variability when multiple wind farms have geographical adjacency their power generation also displays strong correlation . Thus scenario generation considering the spatiotemporal relationships is a useful tool to model the stochastic process . In this work we propose a wind power scenario generation framework based on the conditional improved Wasserstein generative adversarial network . The framework includes a cluster analysis to establish the classification rule a support vector classifier to predict labels a conditional scenario generation process based on improved WGAN and finally a scenario reduction procedure . We demonstrate that the clustering analysis and SVC based labeling model can provide accurate classification results and the scenarios conditioned on input labels can not only follow the marginal distribution of each category but also capture the spatiotemporal relationships . We also illustrate that by adding a gradient penalty term to the discriminators loss function to enforce the Lipschitz constraint the quality of scenarios is better than that of the existing method .

@highlight Labeling model conditional scenario generation and reduction are proposed.
@highlight The conditional WGAN GP is trained to generate scenarios for multi wind farms.
@highlight The generated scenarios have mode diversity and follow the statistical resemblance.
@highlight The proposed method is better than the WGAN using weight clipping.
