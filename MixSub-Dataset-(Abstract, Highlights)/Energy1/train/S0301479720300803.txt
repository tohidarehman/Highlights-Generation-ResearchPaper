 This paper examines the short run and long run effects of economic sociological and energy factors on environmental degradation in 28 European countries . In so doing we employ Panel Vector Autoregressive and Fully Modified OLS approaches on data from 1990 to 2014 in a STIRPAT framework . Key empirical results indicate that these factors may contribute to environmental improvement in the short run however there are adverse implications in the long run . Specifically economic factors including economic growth trade openness and foreign direct investment cause environmental degradation in the under analysis economies . The sociological factors as measured by the population growth and the level of urbanization also show a negative impact on the environmental degradation in the short run but in the long run both population size and urbanization increase environmental degradation . These findings are in line with the concerns raised by
