 Despite increasing scientific understanding of the global environmental crisis we struggle to adopt the policies science suggests would be effective . One of the reasons for that is the lack of inclusive engagement and dialogue among a wide range of different actors . Furthermore there is a lack of consideration of differences between languages worldviews and cultures . In this paper we propose that engagement across the science policy interface can be strengthened by being mindful of the breadth and depth of the diverse human nature relations found around the globe . By examining diverse conceptualizations of nature in more than 60 languages we identify three clusters inclusive conceptualizations where humans are viewed as an integral component of nature non inclusive conceptualizations where humans are separate from nature and deifying conceptualizations where nature is understood and experienced within a spiritual dimension .

@highlight We examined diverse conceptualizations of nature in more than 60 languages.
@highlight Inclusive and non inclusive natures imply humans as part of or separate from nature.
@highlight Deifying natures depict nature within a spiritual dimension.
@highlight Diverse conceptualizations of nature influence environmental policy and future scenarios.
@highlight Acknowledging this diversity is key to representative environmental governance.
