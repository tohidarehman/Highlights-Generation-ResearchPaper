 A centralized controller for a DC linked hybrid microgrid requires costly communication infrastructure . To minimize the costs in this paper a sparse distributed controller is formulized by introducing an

@highlight Control of DC linked hybrid microgrids is a complex and costly problem.
@highlight Sparse distributed design reduces the required communication links and cost.
@highlight The proposed fast distributed controller design yields a near optimal solution.
