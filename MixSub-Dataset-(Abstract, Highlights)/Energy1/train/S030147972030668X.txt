 This paper presents four case studies in which forest data catalysed shifts in public policy and corporate activities . Brazil greatly reduced deforestation during the period between 2005 and 2014 Cameroon introduced a structured forest concessions regime Viet Nam achieved their forest transition and corporate operations around the world invested in supply chain management to alleviate deforestation concerns . We break the problem solving required for these achievements into four steps problem recognition proposal and choice of solution putting the solution into effect and monitoring results . At each of these steps we consider the relevant forest data . Data helped place issues on policymaker agendas supported reaching sound decisions and enabled quantitative targets . Policy instruments for implementing change were built around available data and forest monitoring helped evaluate progress . The details of these successes can be an inspiration to those interested in improving collection of data on forests that can effectively support decision making and better policies . There have been impressive recent improvements to many developing countries national forest monitoring capabilities . The successful examples of data application presented and evaluated here provide insight into how these new data can be effectively leveraged .

@highlight Forest data can underpin problem solving and thus catalyse positive change.
@highlight Brazil Cameroon and Viet Nam built diverse policy instruments on forest data.
@highlight Corporate decision making draws on data for supply chain management.
@highlight Investigation of these four successful cases provides insight into how to leverage forest data effectively.
