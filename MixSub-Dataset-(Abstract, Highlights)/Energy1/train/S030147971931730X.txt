 ManganeseAluminum powders were recently reported to show high efficiency and fast reaction rates as decolorization materials for azo dye aqueous solutions . This work presents a detailed study of different aspects of this material . Firstly the influence of the crystalline phase and the microstructure was studied by comparing the efficiency of powders obtained by different production protocols . Secondly the decolorization efficiency was investigated on various types of dyes including real textile wastewater samples . The analysis of the treated water and the particles showed that the main reaction mechanism was the breaking of the azo dye molecules although important adsorption on the metallic surface was observed for some colorants . Finally the reusability of the particles and the reduction of toxicity achieved during the treatments were assessed . The simple production and application methods the high efficiency and the use of environmentally friendly metallic elements are the main advantages of ManganeseAluminum powders compared to other high efficient decolorizing metallic materials .
