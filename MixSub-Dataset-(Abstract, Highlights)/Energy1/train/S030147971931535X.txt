 Mitigating the environmental impact of nonpoint source pollution from intensively managed urban and agricultural landscapes is of paramount concern to watershed managers . Golf course turfgrass systems which receive significant fertilizer inputs have been cited as significant sources of nutrient loading to groundwater and surface water but a contemporary synthesis of golf course nutrient export rates is lacking . This review of nitrogen and phosphorus loss from golf courses and the factors affecting it aims to support watershed management efforts and decision making . We discuss previous literature reviews examine seven golf course studies that quantify nutrient export from delineated drainage areas and analyze the results of 40 turfgrass plot experiments . Studies were collected systematically and selected based on predetermined inclusion criteria . Combining evidence from both watershed and plot scale studies typical inorganic N and P losses from golf courses via leaching and runoff are on the order of 212kgha
