 Lake ice is an essential and integral part of the cryosphere and freshwater systems . The formation of lake ice affects the physical hydrological and biological conditions of ecological systems . Global warming may contribute to even shorter periods of ice cover in the lakes of the Frigid Zone which adversely affects the growth of phytoplankton and primary productivity . This study was conducted for the purpose of evaluating the growth of phytoplankton and factors involved in 28 ice covered lakes across the Songnen Plain in the Northeast of China to understand how they take part in the whole ecosystem functioning . A total of 1026 water samples were collected in April September and January during the period 20142018 . In the frozen period the concentration levels of dissolved organic carbon total nitrogen and total phosphorus were all comparable with the spring and autumn . Despite the limited light availability and low temperature the phytoplankton survived in sub ice waters during winter with a low concentration of chlorophyll
