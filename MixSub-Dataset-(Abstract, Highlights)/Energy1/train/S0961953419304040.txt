 Organic solid waste is one of the most promising feedstocks for the implementation of the circular economy principles in waste management . Its anaerobic treatment can indeed promote organic matter conversion into a number of value added products as well as energy carriers . However the identification of sustainable strategies to handle organic solid waste in a biorefinery framework still poses technological as well as economic challenges . The aim of this study was in enhancing the potential of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste to produce bioenergy and biochemicals by combining dark fermentation with a formic acid pretreatment . Hydrogen yields up to 31.6 ml g

@highlight Formic acid pretreatment was studied to enhance the organic solid waste bioconversion.
@highlight Acid concentration temperature and time were varied following a factorial approach.
@highlight Results pointed out the key role of acid concentration.
@highlight Process parameter adjustment promotes the generation of different intermediates.
@highlight The proposed approach addresses circular economy in organic solid waste management.
