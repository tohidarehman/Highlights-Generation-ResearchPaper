 High investment cost is still by far a critical barrier to allocating battery energy storage system in the electricity grid at an economical scale . On the other hand utilizing thermostatically controlled loads through demand response programs is considered as a cost effective way to manage renewable energy intermittency and improve grid efficiency . The thermal buffering capacity of air conditioned households can imitate the physical energy storage system and consequently be viewed as the virtual energy storage system . This paper proposes a two stage planning model for the optimal allocation of the distributed wind turbine shared BESS and the optimal dispatch of individual VESS in a smart grid . Based on the sharing economy a novel energy banking model is presented in this paper . Customers give up their individual BESS ownership but have a collective arrangement in which participants mutualize access to power dis charge services and pay a rental fee . Energy exchange may be performed directly on a peer to peer basis or indirectly through a mediator . The proposed model is verified on the modified IEEE 14 bus system . Additionally this paper investigates the coordination strategy of BESS and VESS to mitigate the fluctuation of renewable energy .
