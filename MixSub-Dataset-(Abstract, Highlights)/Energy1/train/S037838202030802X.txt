 Despite the fact that there are many works treating new analytical approaches to monitor the transesterification reaction to produce biodiesel only a few of them are able to quantify the minority but important compounds such as monoglyceride and diglyceride directly in the reaction medium for online quantification . Overcoming the lack of analytical applications in the biodiesel production the present work proposes a new utilization of low field proton nuclear magnetic resonance LF

@highlight Online monitoring of transesterification reaction by NMR NIR presents encouraging prospects.
@highlight Mobile NMR enables online quantification of minor compounds on biodiesel production.
@highlight Online quantification of FAME TG DG and MG directly in the reaction medium.
