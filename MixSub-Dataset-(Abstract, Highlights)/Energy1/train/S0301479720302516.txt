 Groundwater is key to economic growth in the Mediterranean region . This is particularly true of areas such as southern Spain where aquifers underpin social development by supplying water to a booming tourist industry . Intensive groundwater use raises sustainability concerns as pumping often exceeds the long term recharge rate . Climate change and population growth are likely to exacerbate the water supply challenge in the coming years due to the expected decrease in rainfall and to increasing competition among users . This paper examines some of the main aquifers in the Costa del Sol region one of Spain s leading tourist destinations where intensive groundwater extraction has led to water table drawdowns and the desiccation of all major springs . A numerical model was developed and calibrated for the purpose of evaluating the likely evolution of the system in the future . Downscaled scenarios from global circulation models were coupled with population growth forecasts to establish a range of plausible water management scenarios . Given the relatively small size of the aquifers and the limited recharge rate the current pumping patterns appear unsustainable . Results suggest that drawdowns in excess of 150m could take place within the next decade thus compromising domestic supplies .

@highlight A distributed model was applied to simulate water level evolution in Mijas range.
@highlight Three management scenarios were developed and tested for the 20152035 interval.
@highlight Climate change and current water management will produce an unsustainable situation.
@highlight New sources of water supply are needed to guarantee drinking water in Mijas area.
