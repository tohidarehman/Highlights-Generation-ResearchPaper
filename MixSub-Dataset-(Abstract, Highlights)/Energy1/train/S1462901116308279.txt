 This paper presents an historical perspective on the interaction between conservation science and policy . Drawing on a synthesis of studies of the history of conservation and combining this with work in science policy and related fields it considers the implications of a shift beginning in the 1960s in the politics of expertise . Before that time scientific evidence and interpretations were usually discussed within restricted arenas of experts and policymakers . After the 1960s they instead increasingly became matters of public debate . This shift had several consequences for conservation . It encouraged scientists and other advocates to present conservation as a strictly scientific matter that was based on authoritative quantitative and transparent and therefore publically defensible processes . Conservation science itself evolved to emphasize spatial concepts and practices that could provide the basis for rule based replicable procedures for determining conservation priorities . This account therefore illustrates the insights to be gained from reconsidering the history of conservation in terms of our understanding of the evolving status and social roles of expertise .

@highlight Conservation science and policy evolved together throughout the twentieth century.
@highlight Science policy relations were redefined when expertise shifted from private to public.
@highlight With this shift conservation advocacy became defined in strictly scientific terms.
@highlight Conservation science emphasized spatial concepts and rule based replicable procedures.
@highlight Historical synthesis can help explain relations between science and policy today.
