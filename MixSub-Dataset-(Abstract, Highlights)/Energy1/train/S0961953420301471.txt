 This work studied the mixing processes in the full scale research biogas plant of the University of Hohenheim by applying a biodegradable tracer . Two different mixing setups were used to gain a deeper insight into the mixing processes in a continuous stirred tank reactor equipped with mechanical agitators . For this study a submersible motor mixer and a propeller incline shaft agitator were used to investigate the importance of propeller correspondence .

@highlight A Biodegradable tracer was used to study the mixing behaviour in a full scale CSTR.
@highlight Spatially and temporally resolved measurements were conducted.
@highlight Mixing time and energy demand decreased immensely by operating an additional mixer.
