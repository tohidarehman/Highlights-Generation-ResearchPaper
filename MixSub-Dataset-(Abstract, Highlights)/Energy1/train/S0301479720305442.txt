 Globally the management of invasive plants is motivated by a desire to improve ecosystem services and critical habitat for imperiled species . To reduce invader populations and impacts it is important to document the social and ecological basis for the management that has been employed and areas where a greater level of coordination among stakeholder groups could improve efforts . We present a conceptual model that builds on current thinking for how best to connect these four stakeholder groupsto foster stronger citizen lobbying for impacted resources science based governance legislator driven noxious weed laws and funding for management and science knowledge co production by scientists and managers and co management by managers and resource users . In light of our model we present two case studies based in Nebraska and Utah U.S.A. involving a common North American wetland invader
