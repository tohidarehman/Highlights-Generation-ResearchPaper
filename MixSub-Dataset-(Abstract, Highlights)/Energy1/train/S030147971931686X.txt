 The removal of trace antibiotics from the aquatic environment has received great interest . In this investigation NaOH activated graphite felt was characterized by multiple methods including scanning electron microscopy X ray photoelectron spectroscopy contact angle linear sweep voltammetry and electron paramagnetic resonance . The NaOH GF was then used as the cathode in the electro Fenton process for oxytetracycline degradation the experiment was carried out in an undivided and light proof beaker with a Pt anode and a NaOH GF cathode at pH 3 . The results showed that the modification with NaOH enhanced the antibiotics degradation efficiency of graphite felt by increasing the oxygen reduction capacity and hydroxyl radicals yielding rate . Complete OTC removal was achieved at 5.17mAcm

@highlight Cathode of graphite felt activated by NaOH promoted Oxytetracycline removal.
@highlight Decay of OTC with low concentration agrees with a pseudo first order kinetics.
@highlight Hydroxyl radicals produced in electro Fenton process was captured by EPR.
@highlight Six degradation pathways of OTC were detected in special order by electro Fenton.
