 Global environmental change and other site specific pressures are threating coral reefs and the livelihoods of dependent coastal communities . Multiple strategies are used to build the resilience of both coral reefs and reef dependent communities but the effectiveness of these strategies is largely unknown . Using the Western Indian Ocean as a case study this paper combines published literature and expert opinion elicited through a multi stakeholder workshop to assess the intended and realised social and ecological implications of strategies commonly applied in the region . Findings suggest that all strategies can contribute to building social and ecological resilience but this varies with context and the overall strategy objectives . The ability of strategies to be successful in the future is questioned . To support effective resilience policy development more nuanced lesson learning requires effective monitoring and evaluation as well as a disaggregated understanding of resilience in terms of gender agency and the interaction between ecological and social resilience . Opportunities for further lesson sharing between experts in the region are needed .
