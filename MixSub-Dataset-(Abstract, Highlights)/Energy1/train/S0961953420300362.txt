 Forest biomass is an interesting option for bioenergy generation however sustainability aspects should be carefully considered . In this context the nutrient exportation is a key factor for reach a sustainable biomass production by an adequate harvest decision about what tree s fractions will export less nutrients of farms . In this work biomass production per fraction and nutrient export for three eucalypt species

@highlight High density eucalypts plantations are a promising source of biomass for bioenergy.
@highlight The higher the planting density the higher biomass and nutrient extraction.
@highlight Nutrient use efficiency is independent of planting density.
@highlight The harvest of all tree components endanger the soil nutrient availability.
@highlight Harvesting stemwood without debarking improve soil nutrients sustainability.
