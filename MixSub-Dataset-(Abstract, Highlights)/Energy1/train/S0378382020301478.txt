 The present study explores a comprehensive investigation of diesel blow by particulate matter particulate number and nitrogen oxides emissions for cold and hot start operations in a six cylinder turbocharged diesel engine . A wide range of oxygenated blends of fuel bound oxygen ranging from 4 to 8 was used in the study . A reference diesel was also used for the comparison of the emissions results with those of oxygenated blends . Waste cooking biodiesel and an oxygenate diethylene glycol dimethyl ether having three times higher cetane number than diesel and high fuel bound oxygen was used to make the oxygenated blends for examining the effect of fuel oxygen on diesel blow by PM PN and NOx emissions . Carbon monoxide total unburned hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide CO

@highlight Relative to diesel all oxygenated blends reduced blow by emissions.
@highlight The oxygenated blends lowered particulate emissions at cold and hot starts.
@highlight Particulate number emissions were also reduced notably with the oxygenated blends.
@highlight Compared to diesel all oxygenated blends increased nitrogen oxides emissions.
@highlight The blends show minor changes in energy rate exergy rate and exergetic cost.
