 The oxidative desulfurization process is a potential technology to complement the actual hydrodesulfurization process to reach the ultra low sulfur level in diesel fuels . In this work oxides of MoWFe based catalysts were prepared and tested in the ODS process to study the promoting effect of Fe species on the catalytic activity and the interactions between Mo W and Fe . Al

@highlight New MoWFe based catalyst was tested in the oxidative desulfurization process ODS .
@highlight Catalytic activity of MoWFe was higher than monometallic and bimetallic catalysts.
@highlight A synergistic effect was observed between Mo and W species.
@highlight Fe promoting effect generates highly active Mo and W species.
@highlight Ultra low sulfur content can be reached using MoWFe based catalysts.
