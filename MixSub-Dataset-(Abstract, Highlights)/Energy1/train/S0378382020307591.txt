 Long chain oxygenated liquid fuels have similar physicochemical properties with diesel fuel and its oxygen can promote combustion and reduce PM2.5 . An approach for the preparation of the precursor from lignocellulose suitable for C

@highlight Levoglucosan and ethyl pyran glucoside from cellulose ethanolysis could be totally converted.
@highlight Concentration of 1 1 diethoxyethane significantly decreased in water ethanol mixtures.
@highlight Yield of carbonyl compounds in liquid products could afford 47.4 under optimal conditions.
@highlight ZnO was the best catalyst for the preparation of the carbonyl compounds with H.
