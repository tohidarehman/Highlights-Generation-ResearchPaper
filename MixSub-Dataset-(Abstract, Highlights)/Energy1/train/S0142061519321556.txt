 Increasing penetration of renewable energy sources with intermittent generation calls for further flexibility requirements for efficient as well as the safe operation of power systems . Considering the significant growth of distributed energy resources in distribution systems a promising approach to fulfill such requirements is to deploy local flexibility sources at the distribution level . Nonetheless due to the monopoly nature of electricity distribution business effective regulations are required to direct distribution companies toward fulfilling such goals . Accordingly this paper aims at proposing various policies to motivate distribution companies to enhance the flexibility of their networks . In order to assess the effectiveness of these rules we present a novel multi stage distribution expansion planning model considering flexibility requirements . In this model installation of conventional dispatchable distributed generation units and battery energy storage systems as well as demand response programs are considered available flexibility sources for distribution system planners . The proposed framework is applied to a test distribution network with 18 nodes and the obtained results are thoroughly discussed . Finally a sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the effects of the key parameters of the proposed model on expansion planning of the test system .

@highlight Various policies to motivate distribution companies to enhance the flexibility of their networks are introduced.
@highlight The capabilities of local energy resources and energy storage systems to improve the flexibility of distribution systems are examined.
@highlight A new framework for expansion planning studies of energy distribution systems considering flexibility requirements is proposed.
@highlight The expansion planning model is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming MILP problem.
