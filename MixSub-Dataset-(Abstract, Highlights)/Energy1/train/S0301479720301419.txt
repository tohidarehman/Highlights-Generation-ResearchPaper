 Green roofs are expanding internationally due to the well documented benefits they provide for buildings and cities . This requires transferable knowledge of the technological aspects influencing green roof design particularly substrate properties . However this is made difficult due to differences in substrate testing methods referred to in green roof guidelines and standards . Therefore we tested a green roof substrate using laboratory based methods from European North American and Australian green roof guidelines and standards to determine how these methods vary in characterising substrate physical properties . Further we compared the results from the laboratory based methods with measures of bulk density and WHC in green roof platforms to determine whether standard methods accurately represent substrate properties

@highlight We evaluated variation in substrate properties among standard laboratory tests.
@highlight Differences in compaction accounted for differences in properties among tests.
@highlight Tests with low compaction produced results closer to simulated
@highlight conditions.
