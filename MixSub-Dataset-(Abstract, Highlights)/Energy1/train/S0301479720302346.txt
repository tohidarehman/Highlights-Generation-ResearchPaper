 Cobalt based Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks have shown a great potential for radical production by activating peroxymonosulfate . However improve the stability of ZIFs in the reaction remains a significant challenge . In this work ZIF 67 was synthesized and protected by coating with a layer of silica furthermore the yolk shell

@highlight ZIF 67 was synthesized and protected by coating with a layer of silica.
@highlight Co containing carbon was obtained by subsequent pyrolysis of
@highlight Both catalysts shows higher RhB removal efficiency and stability than that of ZIF 67.
@highlight The effect of reaction parameters such as pH catalyst and PMS dosage were analyzed.
@highlight was identified as the dominant active species for the degradation of RhB.
