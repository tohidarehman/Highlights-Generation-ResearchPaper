 Solar home systems have seen rapid growth and have proven to be a viable source of electricity for households due to their capability to reach remote users that do not have access to grid systems . Based on a comprehensive literature review of 139 papers focussing on SHSs in Sub Saharan Africa this paper highlights the key trends research gaps and policy recommendations . The literature was categorised into four themes institutional technology viability and user centric . The review finds that the current primary themes of research are technology user centric and viability . This highlights the need for further research into the institutional barriers of SHSs as well as the regulatory frameworks and incentives needed to increase their adoption . The most popular topics discussed in the reviewed literature included SHS business models SHS design the energy demand of end users and barriers to SHS adoption . The authors also identified paucity of research in countries with low electrification rates highlighting new locations for SHS research .
