 Phosphorous fertigation with high salinity water drip irrigation would be an effective measure to relieve soil and water pollution caused by the excessive application of P fertilizer and achieve synergistic saving of both limited fresh water and non renewable P resources . However the emitter clogging issues of drip fertigation systems seriously restricts the utilization of this technology . This study proposes an approach to reduce emitter clogging in HSW drip fertigation systems by choosing the appropriate type and concentration of P fertilizer . The effects of two new types of P fertilizers and a traditional P fertilizer were assessed at three fertilization concentrations on the clogging behavior of four types flat emitters . The results indicated that the application of MKP aggravated the clogging of emitters in comparison with non fertilization . While the addition of two new types of P fertilizers effectively alleviated emitters clogging by inhibiting the formation of carbonate although precipitation of phosphate silicate and quartz increased . Moreover under the equal application amount of P fertilizer UP and APP were more effective in relieving clogged when applied at a low concentration with long term running and high concentration with short term running mode . The results could pave a way for reducing the pollution in agricultural production and conserving freshwater and non renewable P resources .

@highlight Emitter clogging was assessed in drip fertigation systems high salinity water.
@highlight The application of UP and APP effectively relieving emitter clogging issues.
@highlight APP should be applied at a high concentration with short term running mode.
@highlight UP was more effective at a low concentration with long term running mode.
