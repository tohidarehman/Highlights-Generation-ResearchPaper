 The last decades have seen changes in the water innovation landscape in Africa with many countries introducing innovative approaches to managing water resources and the provision of water services . However little knowledge exists on how water innovators operate in this changing environment . The objective of this explorative study is to shed light on the dynamics of water innovation in African cities . We draw on the experience of 12 water innovators from Kenya Mozambique and Ghana complemented by insights from key actors in the national innovation systems of the three countries . The study finds that the dynamics of water innovation in African cities are manifested at different levels the innovation itself the innovating entity and the innovation system . The three countries have made efforts to create an enabling environment for innovation but many system gaps still exist that need to be addressed . Fragmentation of the water innovation systems and securing scale up capital and long term investment for water innovation appear to be the most important bottlenecks . The former could be addressed by actively promoting interactive learning based approaches to innovation the latter by developing new financing models that allow water innovators and financiers to share the risks and benefits associated with water innovations .

@highlight Dynamics of water innovation are manifested at three levels innovation itself innovating entity and innovation system.
@highlight Fragmentation of innovation systems and lack of scale up capital are the most important bottlenecks for water innovation.
@highlight Interactive learning based approaches and risk sharing financing models are key to addressing water innovation gaps in Africa.
