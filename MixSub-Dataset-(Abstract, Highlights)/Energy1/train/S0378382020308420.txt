 In situ catalytic cracking of coal tar coupling with steam reforming of ethane over activated carbon supported nickel was conducted to improve light tar yield . The results show that the content and yield of light tar under ethane steam reforming atmosphere increase by 58.7 and 62.2 with Ni AC respectively and phenol oil raised by 112.5 compared with the non upgrading tar . Compared with the upgrading process under N

@highlight In situ catalytic cracking of coal tar with SRE over Ni AC improves light tar yield.
@highlight Light oil content in tar obtained under SRE reaches 2 times that under non upgrading.
@highlight Benzenes and phenols in upgrading tar from ethane steam are higher than that from N
@highlight Isotopic trace reveals that Ni AC can simultaneously catalyze tar cracking and SRE.
@highlight Radicals from SRE combined with tar cracking radicals avoid tar excessive cleavage.
