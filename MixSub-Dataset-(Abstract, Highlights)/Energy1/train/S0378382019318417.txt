 A non isothermal heterogeneous steady state model was developed for a packed bed reactor for steam methane reforming employing a multi scale approach . The model consists of two dimensional fluid phase mass and heat transport equations accounting for axial and radial dispersion in the reactor tube as well as accounting for mass and heat transfer resistances at the fluid solid phase boundary calculated using empirical equations . Reaction mass and heat transfer in the catalyst particle are directly coupled with the fluid phase equations using a 1D pellet model thus avoiding the use of a catalyst effectiveness factor for reaction . The performance of the packed bed reactor is compared using three pressure drop equations the Ergun equation which neglects wall effects and the Eisfeld Schnitzlein and Di Felice Gibilaro correlations which include them . This multi scale model also accounts for the effects of temperature pressure and molar change of gas species due to reaction on superficial velocity using a separate equation . The impact of neglecting these effects through simplified models is evaluated .

@highlight Two dimensional tube and one dimensional pellet models coupled together.
@highlight Steam methane reforming simulated under typical industrial conditions.
@highlight Wall effects had little influence on conversion temperature at conditions studied.
@highlight High conversion and large change in moles so include the effect on velocity.
