Considerable work has been performed on CE in various sectors such as in electronic sector construction sector automotive sector etc . However CE in the water sector is gaining rapid attention because of imbalance in water resources and the prevailing linear approach . The aim of this study is to review the world wide growth of CE concept in the water sector from an economic environmental social and technical perspective . 98 publications were selected by systematic literature review and categorized in economic environmental social and technical criteria including a combination of multiple criteria . In this study the world wide status of CE implementation in the water sector is assessed and strategies to encourage and enhance CE implementation are proposed . The six BS8001 2017 principles and 6Rs of waste management are critically analyzed for deriving recommendations and successful implementation of CE in water sector . Finally challenges and opportunities to implement CE in the water sector in India are discussed .
