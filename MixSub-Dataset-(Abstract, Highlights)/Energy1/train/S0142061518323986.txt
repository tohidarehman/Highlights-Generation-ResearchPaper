 Transient behavior and response of wind turbines have been extensively studied in the context of the low voltage ride through for many years in which the identified transients are mostly associated with circuit responses whereas underlying stability issues relevant to converter control yet remain concealed . Recently small signal analyses of grid tied converters have shown that the phase locked loop may interact with other converter controls when synchronized to nonideal grids if not properly treated it may lead to oscillations . Enlightened by this this paper will explore the PLL effects on the stability of a Type IV wind turbine however from a large signal analysis viewpoint . To achieve this a nonlinear reduced order model focusing on the transient interaction of PLL and the faulty grid is developed rigorously from the model assumption to verification . Based on this the grid synchronizing stability provoked by grid faults is identified and the mechanism of which is revealed through the equal area principle . Then impacts of system parameters on GSS margin are quantitatively evaluated by calculating the critical clearing time and the acquired knowledge could be useful guidelines for PLL parameter design . Finally all the analyses are verified by a switching model of the Type IV wind turbine system in PSCAD EMTDC .
