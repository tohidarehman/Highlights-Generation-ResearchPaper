 This article reviews the scientific literature on trail erosion and the magnitude of the erosive processes that occur on mountain trails due to recreational activities mainly due to hiking . This work is necessary as a result of the increase in hiking and biking in forest scrubland and grasslands and the soil and vegetation degradation induced by these activities . We analysed results that have been compiled in the scientific literature as well as other issues such as the geographical and temporal distribution of the research the methods applied the journals where the research was published the types and quantity of uses of the pathways and the measures undertaken for damage mitigation . This paper highlights that there is a need for harmonization of methods . The results show that soil erosion rates are highly variable high and non sustainable . Trail erosion research is growing at a rate of 3 papers per year and is published in a small group of scientific journals . Six journals published 47 of the papers on trail erosion which show a high concentration in environmental journals . There are few papers published in the soil science and geomorphology disciplines although the research topic and the science background are in these two disciplines . Reported world soil losses from trails ranged from 6.1Mgha

@highlight Trail erosion is important due to increased recreational activities in mountains.
@highlight Measurements are carried out by different methods and need harmonization.
@highlight Soil losses in trails ranged from 6.1Mgha
@highlight to 2090Mgha
@highlight Trail erosion has mainly been investigated in USA and is a new topic around the world.
@highlight There is a need to develop sustainable trails and soil erosion control strategies and mitigation.
