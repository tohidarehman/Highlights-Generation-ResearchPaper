 The use of series capacitors in long distance transmission lines leads to subsynchronous oscillation which affects the stability and safety of power systems . The accurate detection of the SSO phenomenon within a short time is a necessary to avoid the harmful effects of SSO on power systems . This paper first presents an overview of previous SSO detection methods . An effective secure and improved SSO detection method based on the voltage signal is proposed and consists of two stages namely analysis and decision . In the analysis stage the voltage magnitude signal passes through a first order bandpass filter to only pass the subsynchronous frequency and a new method for detecting the oscillation is added to avoid erroneous judgments and to make the method secure . In the decision stage the best decision is taken based on the received data from the analysis stage . The robustness and speed of the improved SSO detection method are tested with the induction generator effect subsynchronous control interaction and torsional interaction . Simulation results indicate that the improved method can effectively and quickly detect the SSO phenomenon . The improved method is compared with the traditional method with different SSO types and is proven to be faster than the traditional method in all cases . In this study the IEEE first benchmark model is adapted with a doubly fed induction generator wind farm to study the SSO phenomenon . MATLAB SIMULINK software is used to validate the results .
