 In semi arid regions soil phosphorus dynamics in cereal legume intercropping are not yet fully elucidated particularly in relation to integrated application of fertilizers . To this aim we investigate the effects of different fertilizers on various P fractions in relation to the rhizosphere microbial processes in a cowpea maize intercropping system . Field experiments were conducted during two consecutive years in a split plot design by establishing cowpea maize alone or intercropped onto the main plot while the sub plot was treated with four types of fertilization i.e . no fertilizer addition organic amendment mineral fertilizers and multi nutrient enriched compost . Our results showed that NPKEC fertilizer increased NaHCO

@highlight Multi nutrient compost NPKEC was tested for P fertility under cowpea maize cropping.
@highlight In all cropping systems NPKEC increased labile inorganic P 6293 than control.
@highlight Intercropping with NPKEC reduced non available inorganic P by 29 over NPK fertilizers.
@highlight Type of fertilization steers intercropping related rhizosphere microbial P processes.
@highlight Multi nutrient compost enhanced competitiveness of intercrops in semi arid agroecosystem.
