 The dissolution of carbon from coke into molten iron is a critical factor influencing melting efficiency and lining erosion of blast furnaces . To gain an in depth understanding of this process the wetting and spreading behaviors of molten iron in contact with a graphite substrate were studied using high temperature vacuum wettability test equipment and a microstructural analysis method . The results show that the initial contact angles of molten iron on a graphite substrate and the equilibrium contact angles increase with increasing initial carbon content showing a certain dependence on the carbon content in the molten iron . The initial stage of interaction between the molten iron and graphite substrate is a non wetting state which transitions to a wetting state during the spreading stage at high temperatures . A spherical cap structure is formed because of interfacial effects . The results show that the penetration of carbon into the molten iron decreases with increasing initial carbon content . Finally the wetting and spreading mechanisms are illustrated on the basis of interfacial energy analysis . It is mainly controlled by dissolution in the initial stage of wetting and spreading then transfers to reaction driven control .
