 The hydrogenation of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds derived of hydrocarbon fuels is crucial to avoid the current environment pollution harmful to human health . Also the hydrogenated products can be used as chemical intermediates additives and in other chemical processes . The search of efficient and cost effective catalysts for the hydrogenation of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds is a current challenge in the industrial and scientific community . In this study trimetallic unsupported MMoW sulfide catalysts were synthetized and tested in the liquid phase biphenyl hydrogenation at 300C and 5.5MPa of H

@highlight MMoWS catalysts M Fe Co Ni Cu were tested in the biphenyl hydrogenation.
@highlight NiMoWS and CoMoWS improved the biphenyl conversion at higher atomic molar ratio.
@highlight Biphenyl was converted 100 using Ni 0.70 MoWS.
@highlight Ni 0.70 MoWS promoted the clean production of bicyclohexyl and cyclohexylbenzene.
@highlight NiS crystals and stacked curve shape MoWS
@highlight phases promoted high catalytic activity.
