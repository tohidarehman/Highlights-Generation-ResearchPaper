 In this paper an advanced interval type 2 fuzzy logic proportional integral controller has been proposed for torque and voltage control loops of rotor side converter of doubly fed induction generator . The gains of PI controller are determined and tuned by interval type 2 fuzzy logic method according to system operating condition . Thus the adaptive nature of type 2 fuzzy logic and robust nature of PI controller are combined eventually which exhibits good steady state and dynamic responses . The performance of the proposed controller has been evaluated for different operating conditions of DFIG such as severe fault and voltage sag with reference to varying wind speed . Real time simulations are developed for DFIG based wind energy system to validate the proposed controller using the OPAL RT digital simulator . The performance of the proposed controller is examined through a comparative analysis with its traditional fuzzy logic PI counterpart . The transient analysis of DFIG with interval type 2 fuzzy PI shows the improved results subjected to three phase fault and voltage sag as desired by the grid codes .
