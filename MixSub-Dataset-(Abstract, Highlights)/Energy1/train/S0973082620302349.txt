 How beneficial is basic energy access typically lighting and mobile charging for rural households Despite research on the economic impacts of basic energy access few studies have investigated how it changes household behavior . Here we report results from a randomized controlled trial in rural Uttar Pradesh India which identifies the behavioral impacts of providing solar lanterns to households that normally rely on kerosene as their primary source of lighting . Eighty nine of the 184 households participating in the study were given a free high quality solar lantern . Comparing changes in responses from the baseline questionnaire and an endline questionnaires administered six months later we find that the lanterns reduced energy expenditures improved lighting improved satisfaction with lighting more use of lighting for domestic activities and improved satisfaction with lighting for domestic activities . Overall our results show that basic energy access can offer substantial benefits within the households even if broader rural economic transformation is not plausible .
