 A new method for preparing carbon materials using bio oil heavy components has been proposed and their hydrogen capacity at low temperature was explored . The effects of different templates and mass ratio of template to bio oil on specific surface area pore size distribution and yield of carbon materials were studied . The thermal decomposition pathway of calcium citrate was proposed . Carbon materials prepared by calcium citrate have larger specific surface area 1688m

@highlight Bio oil was used as carbon containing precursor for producing carbon materials.
@highlight Crystal form and quantity of templates affect the microstructure of carbon materials.
@highlight Gases released by templates during carbonization contribute to pore formation.
@highlight Hydrogen adsorption capacity of carbon materials mainly depends on microporosity.
@highlight Hydrogen adsorption of the prepared carbon materials fits Langmuir adsorption model.
