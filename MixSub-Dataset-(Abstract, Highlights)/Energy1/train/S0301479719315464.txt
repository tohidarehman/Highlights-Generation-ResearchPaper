 In NW of the Iberian Peninsula the incidence of anthropogenic fires is very high and due to the climatologic and topographical conditions burnt soils are prone to high erosion risks . In recent years several environmental management techniques have been applied after some wildfires but there are still few field studies about their effects on soils and most of them are short term . Aiming to fill this gap of knowledge sixteen properties useful as soil quality indices pH WHC total N

@highlight Two Burnt Area Emergency Rehabilitation treatments seeding mulching were studied.
@highlight Burnt soils with or without BAER treatment were compared with an unburnt soil.
@highlight Sixteen properties useful as soil quality indices were measured after four years.
@highlight Seeding and especially mulching mitigate fire impacts on half of soil variables.
