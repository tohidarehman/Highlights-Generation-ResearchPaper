 Transient stability analyses are one of the key tools used to ensure grid stability and safeguard security of electricity supply as well as to comply with different countries grid interconnection agreements . Transmission and distribution system operators require validated wind turbine models to perform these studies . This is becoming increasingly important in current power systems because wind energy penetration is constantly expanding and its integration has a significant impact on power grid planning and operation . The definition of generic wind turbine models by international standard IEC 61400 27 1 first released in February 2015 aims to deal with this issue . Therefore since the validation process of the most widely used model defined by this standard and one of the most technically advanced the generic type 3 wind turbine i.e . the doubly fed induction generator has only been conducted using non specialised software tools in the field of electrical engineering the present paper addresses the validation process of this WT when simulated in one of the leading electric power system analysis software tools DIgSILENT PowerFactory . The model is subjected to voltage dips of varying magnitude and duration under both full and partial load conditions . The results are compared to field measurement data according to IEC 61400 27 1 guidelines and validation errors are estimated .

@highlight A Type 3 wind turbine model based on recent Standard IEC 61400 27 1 is validated.
@highlight Leading software DIgSILENT PowerFactory used as the modeling tool.
