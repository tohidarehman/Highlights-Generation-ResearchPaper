 In large scale power system the frequency response for disturbance exhibits spatial and temporal characteristics of which a proper model for the propagation mechanism is not clear . In this paper the disturbance power propagates along the transmission line and is treated as external excitations for the distributed generators . The dispersion of disturbance power causes the spatial temporal features of frequency dynamics . The propagation is mainly divided into electro magnetic and electro mechanical stages . The process is modulated by the Kirchhoff laws and swing equation with the temporal and spatial distribution . The disturbance power generators inertia and line parameter determine the propagation model . A combination of First Order Plus Delay Time and Pad Approximant are proposed to extract the propagation delay . The mathematical solution of propagation delay is obtained for a one dimensional ring system and a two dimensional system . Numerical results are presented to verify the proposed models on a one dimensional 32 machine ring system two area four machine system and WECC 179 bus system .

@highlight The propagation model is built on the disturbance power interacting with the discrete system which is fundamentally different from the wave theory on the continuum model.
@highlight The disturbance propagation is mainly divided into electromagnetic and electromechanical stages.The process is modulated by the Kirchhoff laws and swing equation with the temporal and spatial distribution.
@highlight A combination of the Pad Approximant and FOPDT is taken to model the mathematical solution of disturbance propagation time.
