 This study focuses on the extraction of phenolic compounds from spent coffee grounds by coupling hydrothermal delignification with ultrasound assisted extraction . The hydrothermal treatment was carried out at three different temperatures and two residence times . The ultrasound assisted extractions were performed onto dry hydrochars and slurry fraction prior treated with three solvents water methanol and a water methanol mixture . The results show that ultra sound assisted extraction applied to the hydrochars using methanol as a solvent lead to the highest extraction of total phenolic content . The hydrothermal process conditions strongly affect the following extraction the mildest the delignification process conditions the highest the extraction of phenols from hydrochar . The hydrochars show also good energy properties in terms of fuel ratio energy yield and HHV values and this is promising for their usage as solid biofuels .

@highlight Hydrothermal delignification HDL converts coffee spent grounds into hydrochars.
@highlight The Higher Heating Values up to 28.5MJ kg were found for the hydrochars.
@highlight At 260C and 3h FC content is 2.4 times greater than in initial feedstock.
@highlight Ultrasound assisted extraction is an ecologic and fast method for phenol extraction.
