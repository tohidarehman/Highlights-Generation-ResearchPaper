 Components of the environment such as soil and vegetation are directly destroyed by ion type rare earth mining processes resulting in serious ecological problems . The destruction of land resources and ecological restoration in areas with rare earth ore have become key considerations in the sustainable development of the ion type rare earth element industry . In this paper ion type rare earth ore areas in 6 counties in southern Jiangxi are taken as the research area . HJ 1B CCD and Landsat TM OLI remote sensing data from 1995 to 2017 are used as data sources and based on normalized difference vegetation index analysis and regression analysis the statuses of rare earth element mining land destruction and restoration in these 6 counties in southern Jiangxi are analyzed . To reduce the NDVI error related to sensor differences between different datasets an NDVI transformation equation is constructed for the HJ 1B CCD and Landsat TM OLI data according to a regression analysis method and the accuracy of the transformation equation is assessed with the root mean square error . The results show that there is a significant positive linear correlation between the NDVI data from HJ 1B CCD and those from Landsat TM OLI the obtained transformation equation has a high precision and can eliminate the influence of the differences in data sources on NDVI . The spatial and temporal distribution analysis of rare earth mining shows that the rare earth mining area in 6 counties in southern Jiangxi was highest in 1995 2006 and 2017 and the total mining area was over 7km

@highlight Obtain information on the complex changes in the distribution of RE mines.
@highlight An NDVI transformation equation is constructed for the HJ 1B and Landsat TM OLI data.
@highlight The spatial distribution of RE mining is relatively dispersed.
@highlight There are still large areas of REE ore that have not been reclaimed after mining.
