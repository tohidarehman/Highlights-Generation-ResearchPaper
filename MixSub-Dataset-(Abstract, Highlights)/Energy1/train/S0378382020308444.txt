 In this study the main ignition and combustion characteristics have been compared for droplet groups of a coal water slurry containing petrochemicals as well as oil surrounded by water droplets . Thus in a combustion chamber we simulated the ignition and combustion conditions of a heterogeneous fuel aerosol that can be formed when jets of different liquids cross or when multi component flows delaminate . It was shown that a decrease in the distance between droplets reduces the gas phase and heterogeneous ignition delay times of oil and CWSP by 30 on average . The evaporation times of water droplets decrease by approximately 25 if the distance between them increases in the combustion chamber . It was established that the ignition delay times of oil and coal water slurry containing petrochemicals increased by 2040 and 4070 respectively when a combustible liquid droplet was in the center with six water droplets around it . The experimental results are a database for the development of efficient technologies of injecting multi component fuel into combustion chambers .

@highlight Decreasing the distance between fuel droplets accelerates ignition.
@highlight Steam water layers around fuel droplets increase the ignition delay times.
@highlight Temperatures of CWSP and oil drops surrounded by water droplets differ slightly.
@highlight Temperatures around CWSP drops with water droplet cloud and without it differ by 70280.
