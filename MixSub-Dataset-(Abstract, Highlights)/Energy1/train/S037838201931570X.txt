 Effects of calcium cerium and lanthanum on the catalytic performance of HZSM 5 nanoparticles in the methanol to olefin MTO conversion were investigated . Each samples with the target Si Al 400 was synthesized producing nanoparticles about 300nm . The reactor MTO performance of catalysts at methanol WHSV 8g was evaluated at the temperatures of 390 440 and 490C . Based on the yield of ethylene and propylene Ce Ca HZSM 5 showed the best catalytic performance . The metal modification of HZSM 5 resulted in the improved yield of ethylene and propylene which the effect on the yield of ethylene was stronger . Another advantageous feature of metal modified catalyst was the reduction of sensitivity of the yield of propylene to temperature . With decreasing temperature from 490 to 390C the yield of propylene decreased from 0.16 to 0.13 over Ce Ca HZSM 5 which is significantly more narrow than HZSM 5 . The main improved characteristic in the performance of the modified catalyst was substantial decrease of coke precipitation as determined by TG analysis . Ce Ca HZSM 5 was found to be more stable than parent HZSM 5 over 100h time on stream although its initial conversion was lower at the conditions of experiment .

@highlight The sensitivity of the yield of propylene to temperature was reduced over metal modified catalysts.
@highlight Ca incorporated coked catalysts showed substantial decrease of TGA weight loss from 19 to ca. 4 .
@highlight Yield of ethylene and propylene over the promoted catalysts remained unchanged with increasing MeOH WHSV from 4 to 8 h
@highlight Long time 100 h activity test of the promoted Ce Ca HZSM 5 showed improved stability.
