 Thermal energy storage and recovery in a double pipe latent heat storage system with variable wave length wavy channels were examined . The presence of wavy channels with variable wave length makes it possible for the desired aggregation of the solid waves inside the Phase Change Material domain . The PCM and the moving water are placed in the outer and inner sides respectively in the vertical double tube heat storage unit . Different configurations of variable sinusoidal wave length were studied compared with fixed wave length as well as straight channel unit . The wave amplitude temperature and Reynolds number of water were also analysed . The significant effects of channel waviness with variable wave length are presented results in higher heat transfer inside and to from the PCM domain . Increasing the water temperature and Reynolds number as well as wave amplitude result in a shorter melting solidification time . Based on the results of the selected case the time of melting solidification reduces by almost 70.8 42.8 respectively compared with straight wall case . Furthermore the heat storage recovery rate is 8.3 3.0W for melting solidification respectively for the selected configuration which is equal to 2.4 1.7W for the straight channel case .
