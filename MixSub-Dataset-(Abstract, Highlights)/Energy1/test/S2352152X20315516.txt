 Lithium ion batteries have been widely used in various electronic devices but numerous accidents related to LIBs frequently occur due to its flammable materials . In this work the thermal runaway process and the fire behaviors of 22 Ah LiFePO

@highlight The fire behaviors of 22 Ah LiFePO
@highlight  graphite batteries are investigated.
@highlight A heating plate is developed to induce the Li ion battery to thermal runaway.
@highlight The temperature of cell and flame heat release rate and other key parameters are quantified.
@highlight The relationship between thermal runaway and fire behaviors is analyzed.
@highlight The mechanism and phenomenon related to SOCs are discussed based on the energy balance of the cell.
