 A series of electrospun nanofiber mats have been fabricated from polyacrylonitrile precursor followed by treatments with pyrolytic heat and KOH solutions . The heat KOH treated electrospun nanofiber mats were investigated to serve as electrodes for iron based redox flow batteries . The morphology porosity wettability and cyclic voltammetry have been studied for the treated electrospun nanofiber mats . The KOH treatment effectively reduced the fiber diameter increased the mat porosity and enhanced the surface wettability . Specifically the heat 4M KOH treated electrospun nanofiber mat has 300nm of fiber diameter 92 of porosity and 20 of contact angle . Compared with the electrospun nanofiber mat treated with heat alone the heat 4M KOH treated electrospun mat increases the anodic peak current in cyclic voltammogram of Fe
