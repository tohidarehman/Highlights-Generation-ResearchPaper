 With high theoretical capacity and energy density lithium sulfur batteries have gained a competitive edge for promising applications but they still face challenges like poor conductivity of sulfur and volume expansion . Herein combining the advantages of multidimensional carbon materials S C composites consisting of sulfur and Activated Carbon Carbon Nanotubes Graphene were obtained in a closed system at 155C and 3D electrodes were prepared using porous aluminum as current collectors . The as obtained electrode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1256 mAh g at 0.1C about 200 mAh g higher than that of the electrode using traditional non porous aluminum current collector . As NPAl is substituted by PAl the oxidation peak current density of S C composite is increased from 3.59 to 4.95 A g and the charge transfer resistance is decreased from 32.03 to 17.37 . In comparison with the very poor performance of S C using NPAl at 60C the initial discharge capacity of S C using PAl can reach 803 mAh g at 1C rate with a capacity retention rate of 71.7 after 50 cycles while the corresponding stress decreases to 10.35MPa . The improved mechanisms of S C composites using PAl were discussed . Porous aluminum is attractive to improve the electrochemical performance and safety of batteries .
