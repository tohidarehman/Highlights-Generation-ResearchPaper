 Doping is the most effective strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors . Herein we report the doping effect of Magnesium on structural instability of Ni Co LDHs as the supercapacitor electrode material . The morphology of different compositions of magnesium are studied . The derived material with the Ni Mg ratio of 1 1 displayed an excellent specific capacity of 624Cg

@highlight Proposed the doping effect of s block magnesium element on the electrochemical properties and structural integrity of nickel cobalt hydroxide as electrode material for supercapacitors.
@highlight Mg
@highlight being a Lewis acid provides the excess oxidation states in the Ni based materials and Mg sites with oxidation states proves to be active sites.
@highlight Different stoichiometric ratios of magnesium and nickel are studied amongst which Ni
@highlight Mg
@highlight  LDHs reveals the highest capacitance of specific capacity of 624 Cg
@highlight at the current density of 10 Ag
@highlight The method used to prepare Mg doped nickel cobalt layered hydroxide is electrodeposition which is industrially viable so assures reproducibility.
