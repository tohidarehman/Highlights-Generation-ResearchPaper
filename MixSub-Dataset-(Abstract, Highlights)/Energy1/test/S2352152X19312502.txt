 Other than upgrading the energy storage technology employed within electric vehicles improving the driving range estimation methods will help to reduce the phenomena known as range anxiety . The remaining discharge energy of the battery affects the remaining driving range of the vehicle directly and its accurate calculation is crucial . In this paper a novel approach for the RDE calculation of the battery is proposed . First a stochastic load prediction algorithm is prepared via a Markov model and Gaussian mixture data clustering . Then the load prediction algorithm is connected to the battery second order equivalent circuit model coupled with a bulk parameter thermal model . Based on the extrapolated load and the battery dynamics the battery future temperature conditions future parameter variations and its internal states are predicted . Finally the battery end of discharge time is prognosed and its RDE is calculated iteratively . In order to prove the proposed concept lithium ion battery cells are selected and the performance of the method is validated experimentally under real world dynamic current charge discharge profiles .
