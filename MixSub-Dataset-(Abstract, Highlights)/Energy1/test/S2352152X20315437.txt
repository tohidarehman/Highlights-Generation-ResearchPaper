 An ultrafast synthesis method is proposed for a boron and nitrogen co doped porous carbon using biomass material as a precursor through a combination of a microwave assisted hydrothermal method followed by a pyrolysis process . Compared with a conventional hydrothermal carbonization method the MHT method exhibits unparalleled advantages such as a high energy efficiency and a uniform and ultrafast reaction . The pore structure elemental composition and electrochemical performance of the materials from the two methods were studied and compared . The results showed that when water was used as the solvent a porous texture with a surface area of 823 m

@highlight Cost effective porous carbons from sword bean shells were synthesized.
@highlight N and B heteroatoms have been successfully incorporated into the porous carbon.
@highlight MHT method is much better for supercapacitor due to the superior pore structures.
