 Energy Consumption and take advantage of renewable sources become a major concern in last two decades and is being addressed by various researchers to overcome energy challenges . Phase change materials are widely utilized in thermal energy storage systems to resolve energy crises . On the other hand tendency to phase change materials has many limitations such as liquid leakage during phase transition procedure low thermal conductivity and low surface area which affect phase change material thermal performance . Shape stabilization with regard to nano structures is an efficient approach to reduce phase change leakage improve physical characteristics and thermal performance due to high capillary tension and specific surface area . Shape stabilization will encompass phase change material by using a matrix encapsulation and solid solid phase change material process . This paper gives an inclusive detail on nanostructure shape stabilized phase change material strategies introduction including different classes with regard to thermophysical properties and multipurpose applications . In addition advantage and drawbacks of mentioned works will be discussed and ultimately optimum and superior processes will be proposed .
