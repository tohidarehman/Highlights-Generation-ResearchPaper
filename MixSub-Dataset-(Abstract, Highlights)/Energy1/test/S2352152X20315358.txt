 Buildings account for high energy consumption worldwide especially in humid areas while the solar assisted desiccant cooling system as a suitable alternative to the conventional vapor compression cooling systems is selected due to the low energy consumption and environmental protection . The present paper assessed the transient performance of a new solar desiccant air cooling system enhanced by phase change material and Maisotsenko cooler . The photovoltaic thermal solar collector is applied as a heat source of the regeneration section and the PCM of the solar system provides the required energy of the air cooling system in the nighttime as the main advantage of the proposed solar system . Simulation is done in a hot and humid climate . The system performance under different climate conditions is thermodynamically evaluated for a small office building . The effect of the Maisotsenko cycle is investigated on the provided thermal comfort . Moreover five warm months are studied to perform the seasonal analysis and amongst them for the analysis of the proposed system performance August due to the largest cooling load is chosen . The maximum values obtained for the system with the value of
