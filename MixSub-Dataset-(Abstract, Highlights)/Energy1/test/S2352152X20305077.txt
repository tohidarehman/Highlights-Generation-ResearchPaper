 Performance of the zinc bromine redox flow battery is correlated to the surface properties of the positive electrode . Herein we have modified the graphite felt electrode by thermal treatment and plasma treatment under oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres . These treatments induced specific changes to the electrode surface . Under the experimental conditions thermal treatment increased overall surface area whereas the O

@highlight Graphite felt activated by thermal as well as plasma treatment
@highlight Increase in surface area as well as functional group increases the performance of zinc bromine flow battery
@highlight Performance of the flow battery is dictated by the interaction of polybromide phase with the oxygen functional groups
@highlight High amount of oxygen functional groups is beneficial especially for high current density cycling
