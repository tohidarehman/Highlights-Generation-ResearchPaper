 In the existing literature the importance of control methods used to manage the operation of thermal energy storage systems increased in the last years . However the application of smart control strategies is still far to become a significant part of the available scientific publications . Within the employed techniques model predictive control appeared as the most promising method to control thermal energy storage systems . Therefore in this paper the application of this control strategy is widely studied . Regarding this analysis significant literature gaps that have to be studied more in detail are found in the current scientific publications . The main goal of this study is to find out these gaps through a bibliometric approach identifying the key knowledge areas using both databases Web of Science and Scopus . Results show that the main knowledge gaps in the literature are the ones related with a validation of model predictive control its implementation in smart grids an optimized sizing and management of the physical parts of the system an accurate weather forecasting and to exploit as much as possible the available renewable energy resources . Moreover the tendency in publications during the whole period the main authors countries and organisations are analysed .

@highlight A detailed bibliometric study about TES systems controlled by MPC was carried out.
@highlight All the scientific publications were obtained using Web of Science and Scopus.
@highlight The main gaps in the existing literature of TES MPC were identified.
@highlight Further research is required to exploit the potential of MPC applied to TES.
