 The investigation of interdependency among energy carriers in different energy networks is beneficial for network operators in minimizing the operation cost of the whole networks and supplying the energy demands continuously . This study aims at evaluating the effectiveness of considering interconnections among energy sources which is known as multi carrier energy systems on the operation of the energy networks . The proposed scheme aims to analyze the gas power heating and water energy sources and their interdependencies in operation of multi carrier energy networks considering the gas and power networks constraints and interdependent constraints of all the energy carriers . Accordingly the role of combined heat and power technology gas fired power plants pumped storage systems gas storage heat buffer tank and wind turbines as well as the power and gas network constraints are studied in the current work . The operation of multi carrier energy systems in the presence of the above mentioned technologies are studied to meet daily power gas heating and water loads . The proposed scheme is implemented in a case study to evaluate the practicality and performance of the scheme which is analyzed by providing two cases for the selected multi carrier energy network .
