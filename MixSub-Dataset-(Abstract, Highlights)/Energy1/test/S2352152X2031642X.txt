 The usage patterns of EVs is a great concern in Shanghai as the city with the largest number of EVs . Their usage patterns are investigated based on time series association and segmentation of historical static EV data from the real world . The results show that both BEV and PHEV are mostly used as commuting vehicles with an average speed of EVs of less than 25km h and about 80 of EVs travel within 60km per day . Although there is no big difference between the speed of EVs and other models during the morning and evening rush hours low speed EVs have a significant environmental advantage over fuel vehicles . About 30 EVs have a relatively concentrated charging time between 21 0024 00 while PHEVs with small battery capacity still present a small charging peak at about 9 00 in the morning in order to continue to travel with electricity on the way home . The charging locations in urban center are more intensive than those in suburban areas and EVs are charged more frequently in summer than in winter . It is necessary to optimize the layout of charging piles and orderly charging of EVs in the case of no capacity expansion of power transmission and distribution lines . The actual electricity consumption per 100km of BEV or PHEV is greater than that provided by the manufacturer due to air conditioning energy consumption and complex driving conditions . The results are helpful to promote the development of EVs and layout of charging piles .

@highlight Most of EVs are used as low speed and close range commuters in Shanghai.
@highlight Charging EVs at low night time is beneficial to both EV owners and the power grid.
@highlight PHEVs charge in the morning to meet the return trip which is unfriendly to the grid.
@highlight The actual energy efficiency of EVs is higher than that provided by manufacturers.
@highlight It is necessary to optimize the layout of charging piles and orderly charging of EVs.
