 Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage is an electrical storage device . It stores the available energy in the form of electromagnetic fields . The features of SMES include relatively high power density fast response time very quick full discharge time high cycle efficiency and long lifetime . SMES is suitable for short term storage in power and energy system applications so that it can play an important role in the increased use of intermittent renewable energy . This paper presents modeling and design of a high efficiency multi stage SMES system supplied by either a photovoltaic source or Constant Voltage Source . The multi staging process is a new concept for extending the SMES discharging time and improving their efficiency . The system is proposed as a standalone hybrid system that stores the PV energy in the form of an electromagnetic field . At power interruptions the system can supply the connected loads for a specified period depending on the number of stages . The proposed model is simulated in Matlab Simulink environment . The paper presents a comparative study between single and multi stage SMES systems supplied by either PV or CVS source . The obtained results show that increasing the number of stages leads to an increase in the system efficiency with a high increase in discharging time . The proposed system can be used as Uninterruptable Power Supply for isolated or grid connected applications .
