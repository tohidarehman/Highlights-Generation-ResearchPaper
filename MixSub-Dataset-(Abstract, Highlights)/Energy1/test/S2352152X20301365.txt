 The electrochemical characteristics and temperature difference are crucial for a battery module but they are seldom taken into account in the previous works of multistage fast charging focusing on reducing charging time and temperature rise for a single battery . A multilayer electrochemical thermal coupled model incorporating parallel connected cells inside each battery is developed for a serially connected battery module using two stage fast charging patterns with different charging current rates in two charging stages to study the electrochemical characteristics temperature difference and state of balance . Results show that the shift of C rate causes a sudden change in the magnitude and spatial distribution of local current density and in the magnitude of solid phase Li
