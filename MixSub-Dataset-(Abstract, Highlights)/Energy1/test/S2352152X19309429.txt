 In a near future electric vehicles will constitute considerable part of transportation systems due to their important aspects such as being environment friendly . To manage high number of EVs developing hydrogen storage based intelligent parking lots can help power system operators to overcome caused problems by high penetration of EVs . In this work a new method is applied to get optimal management of IPLs in an uncertain environment and provide optimal bidding curves to take part in power market . The main purpose of this work is to get optimal bidding curves with considering power price uncertainty and optimal operation of IPLs . To model uncertainty of power price in the power market and develop optimal bidding curve the opportunity deterministic and robustness functions of the information gap decision theory technique has been developed . Obtained results has been presented in three strategies namely risk taker risk neutral and risk averse corresponding to opportunity deterministic and robustness functions of the IGDT technique . In order to demonstrate the effects of demand response program each strategy is optimized with and without DRP cases . The mixed integer non linear programming model is used to formulate the proposed problem which is solved using the GAMS optimization software under DICOPT solver .
