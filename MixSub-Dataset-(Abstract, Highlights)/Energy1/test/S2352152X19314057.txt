 The dense cloud like tiny bundles consisting of CuS nanoparticles were prepared successfully by a simple facile one step chemical bath deposition method . The CuS electrodes at three different time periods such as 5 10 and 20h were prepared and their crystallographic phase structural morphological and the composition of the as prepared electrodes are studied in detail . The CuS 10h electrode possessed the dense cloud like structured nanoparticles on the surface of the Ni foam created pathways in a more efficient manner that allows the swift mobility of electrons ions . Moreover the electrochemical behavior and performance of the electrodes are carried out in a 3M KOH electrolyte in the three electrode system . The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge discharge results confirm that all the fabricated CuS electrodes exhibit the battery type behavior . As a battery type material the binder free CuS 10h electrode exhibits the enhanced specific capacity of 164.053mAhg
