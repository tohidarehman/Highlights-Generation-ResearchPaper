 In this study the porous bamboo material was obtained by removing the intercalated substance between the fibers through a simple delignification process and was used as support matrix by impregnating a reversible thermochromic compound to prepare a shape stable bamboo based composite reversible thermochromic phase change material . Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy and X ray diffraction analysis of bamboo and DB showed that lignin was removed from bamboo by the delignification process . The open porous structure founded in scanning electron microscopy micrographs allows the rapid impregnation of TBB to achieve reversible thermochromic and phase change storage properties . The reduction in surface roughness and contact angle leads to an increase in the hydrophilicity of the DB for the subsequent impregnation of the TBB into the porous structure of DB . DB also showed good mechanical properties and thermodynamic stability . The effects of different proportions of the color developer and the solvent in the compound TBB on the reversible thermochromic and phase change energy storage properties of TBB DB were investigated . TBB DB1 4 50 showed a better reversible thermochromic properties and energy storage properties . As for TBB DB1 4 50 the FTIR XRD thermal stability analysis showed that there is no chemical reaction occurred during the entire impregnation process which is conductive to the reversible thermochromic phase change energy storage characteristics of TBB DB1 4 50 . The color of TBB DB1 4 50 changed from rose red to white as the temperature increased . Compared with DB TBB DB1 4 50 showed endothermic and exothermic peaks and its
