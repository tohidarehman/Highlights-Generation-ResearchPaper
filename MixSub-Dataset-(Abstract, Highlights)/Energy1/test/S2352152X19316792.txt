 This study presents a novel strategy based on Bayesian support vector regression for the estimation of the specific heat capacity of nitrides ethylene glycol based nanofluid . The nanoparticles considered are aluminium nitride silicon nitride Si

@highlight SVR model for specific heat capacity of nitrides EG based nanofluids is developed.
@highlight SVR model parameters were optimized using the Bayesian optimization algorithm.
@highlight The model inputs are mass fraction molecular mass of NPs temp size of NPs.
@highlight Proposed model exhibits improved prediction accuracy compared to existing models.
