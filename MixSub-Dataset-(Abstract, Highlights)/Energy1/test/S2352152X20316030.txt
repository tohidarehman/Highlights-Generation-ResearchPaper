 In this study a novel system comprising of a two stage organic Rankine cycle driven by geothermal energy and coupled with a proton exchange membrane electrolyser is investigated and optimized from thermodynamic and exergoeconomic viewpoints . Various working fluids are considered so as to ascertain the effects of thermophysical properties on the performance of the system . The electricity output from the two stage organic Rankine cycle is employed to produce hydrogen through electrochemical reactions in the proton exchange membrane electrolyser . The effects are assessed on key parameters of variations in geothermal water temperature and the pressure ratio of high pressure organic Rankine cycle turbine . Considering three distinct cases a thorough optimization is performed utilizing a genetic algorithm . It is concluded that a 2 3 percent point improvement in energy efficiency as well as a 35 to 41 increase in hydrogen production and a 9.5 to 12 reduction in cost per unit exergy of hydrogen can be achieved via optimization . R123 is shown in the optimization to perform the best among the considered working fluids with isopentane performing second best .
