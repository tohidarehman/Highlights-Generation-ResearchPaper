 The continuous increase of greenhouse gas emission and the growing cost of fossil fuels are two motive forces to utilize energy sources more effectively . The agricultural greenhouses are developed to supply the food resources safely and with the higher quality especially in off season periods of year . In developing countries like Iran the fuel usage of the greenhouse is very high and there is a large margin for improving heating systems . The waste heat recovery system

@highlight The waste heat recovery system with PCM studied experimentally.
@highlight The heat recovery system is a cross flow gas heat exchanger.
@highlight The study case is a greenhouse of 2066 m
@highlight in the city of Isfahan.
@highlight Adding the HRS the improvement of energy efficiency is 140 and 33 .
