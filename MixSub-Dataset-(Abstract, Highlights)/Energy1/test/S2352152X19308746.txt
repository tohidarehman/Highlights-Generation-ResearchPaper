 Experimental investigation and multiobjective optimization are used to find optimum combinations of pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient during R 404A evaporation inside corrugated tubes . The mass velocity of refrigerant was between 280.5 and 561kgm

@highlight The evaporation of R 404A inside corrugated tubes were experimentally investigated.
@highlight Evolutionary algorithm was used for optimization of artificial neural networks.
@highlight ANNs were used for prediction of heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop.
@highlight Pareto based optimization of R 404A evaporation was performed.
