 According to the temperature requirements of pharmaceutical cold chain logistics the aim is to develop phase change materials with a phase transition temperature of 2 C 8 C. In this study a mixed solution of tetradecane and lauryl alcohol was selected as the base liquid . In view of the low thermal conductivity of organic phase change materials expanded graphite was added to TD LA to improve the thermal conductivity . This study also developed a new type of cold storage equipment for vaccine which can monitor the temperature of the vaccine in real time on the user s mobile phone . The cold storage equipment is equipped with a special cold storage box of vaccine . The vaccine reagent tube can be placed in the storage hole of the cold storage box . It can ensure that the cold storage agent in the cold storage box releases and transmits the cold quantity more evenly among the goods . Coupling the developed low temperature phase change material with the cold storage equipment can ensure that the vaccine is always in the required low temperature environment in the process of transportation for a long time to ensure its quality .
