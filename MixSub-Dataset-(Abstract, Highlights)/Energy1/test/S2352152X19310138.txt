 The thermal analysis of melting and solidification processes of Rubitherm 55 in a vertical shell and tube based latent heat thermal storage unit is presented in this study . To resolve the low heat transfer rate issue within the phase change material due to its low thermal conductivity hybrid enhancement methods are considered . Heat pipes are placed horizontally to act as a bridge between the heat transfer fluid and the phase changed material stored in the shell . In addition nanoparticles with high thermal conductivity are added to the phase change material . Aluminum oxide silver copper and copper oxide are the nanoparticles used for this study . The effects of various parameters such as the heat pipes quantity nanoparticles type and concentration are studied on the overall performance of the system . It was concluded that embedding heat pipes significantly decreases the melting and solidification times . It was also shown that increasing the nanoparticles concentration decreases the melting or solidification time as well as the stored or released energy per unit of mass . However the significance of the effect of type of nanoparticles was dependent upon the quantity of the heat pipes in the storage unit .
