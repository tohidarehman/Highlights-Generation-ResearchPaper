 The prompt and effective suppression of lithium ion battery fires presently remains a challenge . In the present work apparatus is constructed to investigate the extinguishment and cooling effectiveness of a single LIB dodecafluoro 2 methylpentan 3 one C

@highlight A strategy with fire suppression and cell body rapid cooling for lithium ion battery after thermal runaway was experimentally studied.
@highlight The cooling and suppression mechanisms with C
@highlight O and water mist were investigated.
@highlight The cooling efficiencies and mechanisms of water mist with different delay times working pressures and additives were studied.
