 Latent heat storage is considered to be a promising technique for thermal energy storage due to its high energy storage density and nearly constant working temperature . However the phase change materials used in LHS usually suffer from low thermal conductivity . In this work the expanded graphite was applied to support n eicosane via vacuum impregnation to prepare C20 EG composite PCMs . The DSC analysis indicated that the C20 EG

@highlight High latent heat composites were obtained by using EG as a support matrix.
@highlight The composites has much higher thermal conductivity than pure C20.
@highlight The composite with 15wt. EG shows excellent electro to heat conversion performance.
