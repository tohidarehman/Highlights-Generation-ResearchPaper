 The operation of solar driven air conditioning systems is limited to the availability of solar radiation . Consequently to achieve extended cooling period energy storage is necessary . This study presents performance evaluation and charging and discharging characteristics of an absorption energy storage coupled with solar driven double effect water lithium bromide H

@highlight Conducted thermodynamic study of solar driven double effect absorption system with storage.
@highlight Obtained COP of the integrated absorption chiller storage system of 1.35 and exergy efficiency of 25 .
@highlight Charging and discharging characteristics of absorption energy storage are analyzed.
@highlight Obtained storage density of 444.3MJ m3 from the absorption thermal energy storage system.
@highlight The storage density is 1354 higher than integrated systems based on single effect configuration.
