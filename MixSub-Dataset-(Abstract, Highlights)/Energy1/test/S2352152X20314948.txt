 In order to investigate the thermal failure propagation behaviors of lithium batteries a sequence of full scale burning tests were conducted . The results showed that the average mass loss and total heat release of an individual cell are 5.8g and 31.9kJ respectively . The battery pack fire exhibited intermittent propagation behaviors due to the heat interaction between the cells . An obvious domino phenomenon with a chain like increase in temperature rise and propagation speed could be observed during the thermal failure propagation process . The temperature of the cell surface is about 700 1000 C during the combustion process . Several cells burned simultaneously and exacerbated the burning rate resulting in the larger mass loss rate and the heat release rate for the larger battery pack . The average mass loss rate is 0.69g s for 66 cells and 1.0g s for 1010 cells respectively . Moreover the increasing combustion efficiency appeared in the larger battery pack . The effective heat is 2.0kJ g for single cell 3.2kJ g for 66 cells and 3.9kJ g for 1010 cells . This study can provide a theoretical reference for the fire safety design of large lithium battery energy storage equipment .
