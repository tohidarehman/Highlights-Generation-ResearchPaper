 In this experimental and theoretical study an attempt has been made to examine and compare the techno economic performance of a conventional solar still and CSS augmented with ultrasonic fogger cotton cloth . For experimentation two identical CSS having 1 m

@highlight Modified technique of ultrasonic fogger and cotton cloth tent has been studied.
@highlight Due to augmentations an enhancement of 53.12 in the yield has been observed.
@highlight Proposed moderation has 58.45 improvement in the exergy efficiency.
@highlight Modified still has 27.46 lower distillate cost per liter than conventional.
