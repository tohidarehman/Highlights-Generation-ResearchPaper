 Four different LiBr based composite materials have been synthesized with silica gel or activated carbon as host porous matrix . High salt contents were incorporated in these composites 37wt and 53wt for silica gel LiBr composites 32wt and 42wt for activated carbon LiBr composites . The performance of these materials in conditions representative of the applications of sanitary hot water production and space heating demonstrates the very high potential of the silica gel LiBr 53wt composite . It exhibits an unprecedented energy storage density of 261kWh m

@highlight Chemically stable composites with 32wt of lithium bromide have been synthesized.
@highlight The energy storage densities of the 4 composites show their relevance for residential applications.
@highlight High energy storage density up to 381kWh m
@highlight was measured for silica gel LiBr 53wt .
@highlight The composite silica gel LiBr 53wt is stable after 10 sorption desorption cycles.
@highlight Tests on lab scale prototype confirm the interest of this composite for heat storage.
