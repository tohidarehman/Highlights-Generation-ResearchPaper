 Regenerative graphene oxide with two dimensional loose structure is obtained from carbon rods of waste dry batteries by freeze drying post processing method . This not only reduces resource waste but also generates a new device for energy storage . Transition metal sulfides are in situ grown on Re GO surface as high performance electrode material for supercapacitors . Facile synthesis of the three dimensional nanoflower structure

@highlight The material derived from used dry batteries saves the waste of resources.
@highlight The in situ grown nanoflower
@highlight has ultrahigh specific capacitance.
@highlight Assembled ASC shows high energy and power density and superior cycling stability.
