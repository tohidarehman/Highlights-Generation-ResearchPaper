 Incorporation of phase change materials in construction materials increases thermal mass of the buildings and reduces diurnal daily fluctuations of indoor air temperature . Direct impregnation is a cheap and easy method to embed PCM into the wood . The main shortcoming of this way is that the amount PCM is depleting over time that leads to degradation of the structure thermal mass and its capacity to store heat . In addition the presence of PCM in construction materials increases the flammability of the structures . In this study ultraviolet curable coating was used to improve containment of RT21 and propyl ester in wood and to reduce its flammability . Long exposure to storage temperature of 50 C and room ambient temperature indicated that significant improvement was achieved in PCM retention in the wood through UV coating on the wood surface . Blending ammonium polyphosphate into the lacquer improved fire safety of the PCM impregnated wood as indicated by reduced ignition time and heat release rate from cone calorimeter test . Reduction in peak heat release rate by 20.5 and 37.4 was observed in RT21 and propyl ester respectively .

@highlight PCM impregnation into wood via vacuum condition increases building thermal mass.
@highlight Wood surface treatment using UV curable coating improves PCM retention in wood.
@highlight UV curable coating does not inhibit water molecules from passing through.
@highlight APP improves flammability of PCM containing wood but increases smoke production.
@highlight Ester based PCM is more stable with good heat capacity and reduced flammability.
