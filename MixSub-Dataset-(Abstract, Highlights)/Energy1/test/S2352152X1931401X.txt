 Simple and effective modification method of commercial AGM using atmospheric plasma etching was reported for practical use in AGM battery applications . In order to enhance electrical performance and durability by improving degree of absorption of AGM for electrolyte solution plasma treated AGMs AGM X Y were fabricated by adjusting RF power and treatment time . In general BET surface area and the degree of adsorption for electrolyte solution of plasma treated AGMs increased with increase of RF power and plasma treatment time . However on the contrary too high RF power and long treatment time disturbed improvement of various properties which would stem from smoothing of fiber surface and hydrophobic change by etching gas . The AGM 200 10 separator which was treated with RF power of 200W for 10min showed outstanding BET specific surface area 1.96m

@highlight The simple modification method of AGM using atmospheric plasma etching was investigated.
@highlight The plasma treated AGMs AGM X Y showed highly degree of absorption.
@highlight The AGM X Y separator showed much better electrical performance and durability.
