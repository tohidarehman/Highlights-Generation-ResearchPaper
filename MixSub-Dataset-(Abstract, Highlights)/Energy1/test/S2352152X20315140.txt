 In this study we present the actual electrochemical performance of a highly stable hybrid supercapacitor device based on faradic type binder free nickel ferrite NiFe

@highlight NiFe
@highlight nanoparticles based binder free supercapacitor device has been presented.
@highlight Novel technique was used to directly grow NiFe
@highlight nanoparticles on substrates.
@highlight Role of various current collectors on supercapacitor properties were investigated.
@highlight NiFe
@highlight based binder free cathode exhibited specific capacity of 398 C g at 1 A g.
@highlight Device showed 98 retention of its specific capacity after 6500 cycles at 5 A g.
