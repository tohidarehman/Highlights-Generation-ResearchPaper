 Copper oxides nanosheets and nanowires were directly grown on a copper sheet by a single step voltammetry process in an alkaline solution . The transition from the out of plane nanosheets to high aspect ratio nanowires is triggered by the change in the voltage sweep rate . The scan rate changes the growth mechanism from nucleation and coarsening at the slow scan rate for nanosheets to an oriented oxide nanowire growth at high scan rates . Polycrystalline copper oxide nanostructures contain both Cu and Cu oxide phases which were characterized by the FEG SEM XRD XPS Raman and TEM analysis . The copper oxides nanosheets and nanowires electrodes delivered the maximum specific areal capacitance 320mF cm
