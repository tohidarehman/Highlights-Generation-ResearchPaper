 For providing cooling heating and electricity loads of buildings with high thermal efficiency and low energy consumption an innovative cascaded organic Rankine cycle an electrical chiller and an ice thermal energy storage system are integrated with a gas engine . CORC heat recovery and power generation system with two high and low temperature loops uses the gas engine exhaust as heat source and generate electricity in an innovative heat recovery cogeneration plant . VCR ITES provides the cooling demand . It shifts the electricity consumption from on peak hours to off peak low load hours . The electricity consumption of VCR ITES is estimated based on variable cooling load during a year and not based on the cooling load at the hottest day in the year . Thermo economic modeling and multi objective optimizing the new proposed integrated system are performed to find the required capacity of equipment . After optimizing procedure three 393kW gas engines are selected . Results for CORC show that HT loop with R11 working fluid generated 75.6kW and LT loop with R152a working fluid generated 72.9kW power output . Moreover the thermal efficiency of CORC as well as overall thermal and exergy efficiency of integrated system were 23 68 and 63 respectively . The innovative CORC with dual loop configuration had higher net power output higher thermal efficiency and lower investment cost per unit of power output in comparison with a single loop ORC and other dual loop ORCs . VCR ITES also had 44.2 lower energy consumption 43.9 lower emission and 64 lower electricity cost in comparison with that for simple VCR system . Results for the proposed integrated system are also compared with that for the traditional system the reduction in annual cost of buying electricity from the grid was 1.3510
