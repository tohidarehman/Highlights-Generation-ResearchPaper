 In the present study solar still performance has been investigated under different operating conditions such as coating the basin liner by TiO

@highlight Modified solar still with nanolayer coating in the basin liner is studied.
@highlight Mixing TiO
@highlight nanoparticles with the coating to be used in basin area liner.
@highlight Efficiency of the system is 57.16 in summer and 36.69 in winter.
@highlight Average daily yield of solar still is 5.39 L in winter and 7.89 L in summer.
