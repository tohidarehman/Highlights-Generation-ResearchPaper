 Today knowledge of battery energy storage systems has experienced a rapid growth resulting to the numerous grid applications . The utility scale batteries assembled in containers can be transported in the grid . Despite numerous benefits this feature has been overlooked . In previous studies battery movement is modeled based on a specific transfer method such as a truck or train . Accordingly by changing the method of transporting the battery the problem should be re modeled and also it is not possible to schedule the battery movements by combining two transfer methods . In this context this paper proposes a new battery movement scheduling in the distribution networks . To this end optimal charging or discharging power in addition to the bus location will be determined for any time period of operation . In the proposed model only distance between buses is important and how the battery is transferred is not important . accordingly battery transfer may be performed using one transmission method such as a truck or a combination of two methods . Reactive power contribution by the battery power losses and bus voltages of the network are also counted by maintaining linear structure of the model . This guarantees practical application of the formulation for the real life distribution grids . Results of implementing the model on a test system indicate distinct superiority of the mobile BESS with respect to the stationary installations .
