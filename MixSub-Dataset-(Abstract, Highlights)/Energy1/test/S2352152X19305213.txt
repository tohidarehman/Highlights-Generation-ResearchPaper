 Temperature response thermal decomposition and gas generation are important metrics for evaluating thermal runaway hazards of lithium ion batteries . In this paper the hazards associated with thermally abused LiNi

@highlight Three hazard metrics for thermally abused lithium ion batteries are assessed.
@highlight Temperature response profiles of lithium ion batteries at four different SOCs are obtained.
@highlight Thermal decompositions of 90 SOC and 100 SOC lithium ion batteries are analyzed.
@highlight Gas analysis for thermally abused batteries at different SOCs are performed.
@highlight 26 gases were detected in the gas products of the 100 SOC battery.
