 As an alternative approach for natural gas storage at relatively low pressure and ambient temperature Adsorbed Natural Gas has aroused tremendous interest in recent years . However still there is a great challenge to find a suitable adsorbent with a high capacity for gas storage . Here in this study we reported how to prepare an activated carbon with high methane CH

@highlight Providing activated carbons from low cost and abundant coal tar pitch precursor.
@highlight Investigating the effect of modifications on structural properties of coal tar pitch.
@highlight Improving CH
@highlight storage capacity of activated carbon by modification of coal tar pitch.
@highlight Excellent performance of activated carbon over CH
@highlight charge discharge dynamic tests.
