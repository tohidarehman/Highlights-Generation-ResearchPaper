 Supercapacitors based on three dimensional porous kenaf stem derived carbon covalent organic framework COF LZU1 polyaniline array composites were fabricated . The spherical COF LZU1 was formed by dehydration condensation reaction between 1 3 5 benzene tricarbaldehyde and 1 4 p phenylenediamine and simultaneously bonded to the 3D KSC surface which improved the stability of composites . Then PANI array was grown on 3D KSC COF LZU1 by chemical oxidation polymerization to form 3D KSC COF LZU1 PANI composites . Scanning electron microscopy Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy etc were used for characterizing 3D KSC COF LZU1 PANI composites . SEM images showed that a lot of spherical COF LZU1 with diameter of 1 m was uniformly dispersed on the inner wall of the 3D KSC and PANI was arrayed on the 3D KSC COF LZU1 . FTIR and Raman spectroscopy proved that PANI arrays were successfully polymerized on 3D KSC COF LZU1 . Galvanostatic charge discharge test of 3D KSC COF LZU1 PANI composites showed a specific capacitance of 583.0 mF cm

@highlight Three dimensional porous carbon 3D KSC covalent organic framework COF polyaniline PANI array composites were fabricated for supercapacitors at normal temperature and pressure.
@highlight Biomass porous carbon materials provide PANI with a large specific surface to avoid accumulation and facilitate charge transport.
@highlight The morphology of PANI is regulated in an array shape to shorten the diffusion distance.
@highlight COF LZU1 rarely reported for supercapacitors has a regular morphology and excellent stability.
@highlight 3D KSC COF LZU1 PANI is directly made into electrodes and used in supercapacitors which has promising development prospects.
