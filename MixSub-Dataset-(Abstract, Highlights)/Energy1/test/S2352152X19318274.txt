 Phase change materials found to be a promising solution in the field of thermal energy storage . However the low thermal conductivity and form stability over cycles of charging and discharging of PCM are challenges to address . In the proposed study a novel and low cost biochar PCM hybrid latent heat energy storage material have been developed and tested . The biochar is prepared from aquatic invasive weed plants by using a batch type pyrolyser . The characteristics and properties of the novel energy storage material have been evaluated using various experimental and analytical methods . The methods include Brunauer Emmett and Teller Scanning electron microscope X ray powder diffraction Differential Scanning Calorimetry Thermogravimetric analysis Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermal conductivity tester . The study also put forward the optimized proportion of biochar and PCM in hybrid thermal energy storage material . The new material shows superior thermal conductivity over pure PCM as well as better stability due to the high carbon content and porosity of the developed biochar . Simple Impregnation method has been used to prepare form stable composite material which has good thermal and structural stability . The best mixing ratio is found to be 6 4 with minimum leakage of PCM from the composite . The sample prepared through this method yield all the desirable properties as compared to other developed samples . The chemical properties of the composite remain the same as the pure PCM which confirms no chemical interaction between the PCM and biochar . The heat of fusion is calculated to be 179.4J g. The thermal conductivity of the PCM is enhanced up to 13.82 times with the addition of water hyacinth biochar as a supporting matrix . The addition of aluminum metal powder further increases the thermal conductivity by 17.27 times higher than that of PCM alone .
