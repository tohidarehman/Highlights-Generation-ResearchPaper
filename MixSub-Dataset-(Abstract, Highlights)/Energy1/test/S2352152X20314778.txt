 In current transient modeling discharging of PCM based on FEM has been scrutinized . Due to importance of phenomenon near the solid front time linked mesh has been employed and to reduce the thermal irreversibility copper oxide nanomaterial was dispersed into H

@highlight Discharging of PCM based on FEM has been scrutinized.
@highlight To reduce the thermal irreversibility CuO was dispersed into water.
@highlight Utilizing greater
@highlight can reduce the discharging time by about 7.58 .
@highlight Using platelet shape can reduce the solidification time about 5.96 .
