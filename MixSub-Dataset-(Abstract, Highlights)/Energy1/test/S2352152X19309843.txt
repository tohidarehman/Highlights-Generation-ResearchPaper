 The Electric double layer capacitor or super capacitors are becoming increasingly popular for their high specific power and for integrating that feature with batteries which have a high specific energy . Due to the above reason we have attempted to understand how to use super capacitors and characterized them so that both battery and super capacitors can be used together or for low power green energy applications like various electronics gadgets how to use only super capacitors . In this paper we described the known properties of a super capacitor relative to a conventional lithium ion battery . The structural design of the Super capacitors and also various engineering based applications related to consumer electronics transportation

@highlight Importance of super capacitors and how it will implemented in electrical energy storage system for consumer electronics transportation field.
@highlight Describes the super capacitor properties and compare with the properties of the lithium ion battery.
@highlight A mathematical expression has been developed in order to determine if the feed back loop is required or not required depending on the parasitic of all the components used to build that DC DC converter.
@highlight To enhance the efficiency and to reduce the charging time of super capacitor we proposed an algorithm having gamma function based charging methodology for super capacitor.
