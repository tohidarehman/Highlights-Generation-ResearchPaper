 In this study a new methodology has been proposed for optimal allocation and optimal sizing of a lithium ion battery energy storage system . The main purpose is to minimize the total loss reduction in the distribution system . The optimization process is applied using a newly developed type of Cayote Optimization Algorithm . The proposed technique includes two different approaches . In the first approach the optimization for allocation and the sizing are performed one by one and in the second approach the optimization has been done simultaneously . To analyze the proposed system four different scenarios have been analyzed which include different conditions without with PVs and also using single two BESS . The results showed that using two BESS can reduce the total error of the distribution system . the results also showed that using PVs can also decrease the total losses . Finally the proposed approach based on ICOA is compared with Firefly Algorithm Whale Optimization Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization to show the proposed method s prominence efficiency .
