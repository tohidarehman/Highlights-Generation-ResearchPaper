 The use of biomimetic red blood cell shaped capsules for latent heat thermal storage is a novel concept . The RBC shape provides a much higher heat transfer rate than that of other shapes . However the heat transfer characteristics of external flows around RBC shaped capsules and the optimal attack angle are unknown . In the present work forced convection of external flows over an RBC shaped PCM capsule was numerically studied in a steady state laminar flow region with Reynolds number in the range of 20200 and compared to that of a conventional spherical capsule . Moreover the local Nusselt number surface average Nusselt number and drag coefficient at various Reynolds numbers and attack angles of RBC shaped capsules were investigated . The surface average Nusselt number of the RBC shaped capsule was found slightly smaller than that of the spherical capsule with a maximum disparity of 12.04 . The drag coefficient of the RBC and spherical capsule both decreased with the increase of Reynolds number and the disparity between them was very small . 0 attack angle was recommended for the RBC shaped capsule layout as it had the lowest drag force with a relatively high average Nusselt number .
