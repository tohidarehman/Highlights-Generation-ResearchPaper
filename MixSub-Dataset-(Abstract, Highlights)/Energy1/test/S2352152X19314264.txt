 Novel leady oxides with different particle sizes are prepared via pyrolysis of lead citrate in rotary kiln and subsequent ball milling . The mechanism of how particle size influences the phase transition route of novel leady oxides during soaking process is investigated . PbO with larger particle size is converted to 3PbOPbSO4 and 3PbOPbSO4 is then partially transformed to PbOPbSO4 while PbOPbSO4 are gradually converted to PbSO4 . PbO with smaller particle size is directly converted to PbSO4 and 3PbOPbSO4 is partially transformed to PbOPbSO4 . Phase compositions after the soaking process determine the PbO2 content in positives plates because PbO2 is the oxidation product of PbSO4 in the sequent formation process . Particle size of leady oxides determines the initial capacity of testing cells through affecting the soaking process and a linear correlation between the initial capacity and PbO2 content in positive plates is obtained . Therefore leady oxides with larger particle size requires higher sulfuric acid density 1.045g cm
