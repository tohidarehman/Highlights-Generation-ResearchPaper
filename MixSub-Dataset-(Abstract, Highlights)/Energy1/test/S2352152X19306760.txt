 State of charge of an electric vehicle battery pack is a crucial information for the driver . The accuracy of the SoC estimation algorithms is often limited by the computational resources of the electronic hardware . Ensuring that required performances are maintained between the design stage and the implementation in a low cost microcontroller is critical . The growing demand for light EVs increases the need for precise and computationally light algorithms for low cost Battery Management System . This paper proposes a novel SoC estimation method that deals with accuracy and simplicity . A disturbance observer based algorithm is developed to offer a simple solution that reduces the computational time while achieving similar performances of other well known SoC estimators . The new estimator has been implemented into an on board system to be more representative of the real computational resources . The validation of the algorithm has been done with a customized hardware in the loop system that emulates the battery electrical signals of the BMS sensors . The validation uses a real vehicle speed profile recorded on a three wheel light EV . The performance of the proposed method has been compared to the other estimators . The results indicate that the DOB algorithm SoC estimator can achieve a faster and more accurate estimation than the conventional approaches .
