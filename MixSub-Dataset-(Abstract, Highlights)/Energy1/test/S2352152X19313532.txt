 The free convective flow of a Nano Encapsulated Phase Change Material suspension in an eccentric annulus is investigated numerically . The inner cylinder is heated and kept at a temperature higher than that of the outer cylinder . The core of the NEPCM particles is made of nonadecane while the shell is made of Polyurethane . The nanoparticles are dispersed in water as the base fluid . The equations governing the flow and heat transfer of the NEPCM suspension in the annulus are developed and written in the non dimensional form . The numerical solutions of these equations are obtained using the finite element method . The validity of the numerical method is ensured by comparing its predictions to the results of previously published studies . The main outcomes point out to the impact of the volume fraction of the NEPCM particles and Stefan number on the thermal and hydrodynamic characteristics of the suspension . A 5 volume fraction represents the optimal value for heat transfer enhancement . Heat transfer is also enhanced when the fusion temperature of the NEPCM core is far from the temperatures of the hot and cold walls . Furthermore increasing the annulus eccentricity and moving the inner cylinder towards the top tends to inhibit heat transfer in the annulus .
