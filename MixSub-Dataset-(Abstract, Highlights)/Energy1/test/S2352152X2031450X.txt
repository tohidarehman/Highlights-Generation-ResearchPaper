 The microgrid system with a high share of Renewable Energy Sources is the need of hour . The RES provides clean economical and never ending active power support to the system . However the inertia deficiency is the negative side of RES based systems as it adversely affects the dynamic performance of the microgrid and may lead to severe consequences like loss of synchronization and instability . For addressing the issue of inertia deficiency several techniques were already proposed for emulating the virtual inertia . Among these the Derivative Control Technique is quite popular because of its simplicity and effectiveness . The previous research work utilizes the Energy Storage System for providing virtual inertia support through DCT during load imbalance . However such a system neglects the possibility of extracting virtual inertia support obtained from RES . This paper proposes a novel technique for tapping the virtual inertia potential of RES by cultivating the the derivative control mechanism and further improves the dynamic performance of the system . Further the efficiency of the proposed system is evaluated through time domain simulations under different scenarios and compare it with conventional and ESS based systems .

@highlight An extended application of derivative control method is proposed.
@highlight A novel method is used for extracting virtual inertia support from both energy storage system ESS and solar PV.
@highlight Frequency stability of the microgrid system improves under variable load condition.
@highlight Different levels of RES penetration are considered for testing the effectiveness of proposed work.
