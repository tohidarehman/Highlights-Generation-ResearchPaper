 The positive electrodes of lead acid batteries are typical thick electrodes where the mass transfer is limited . Therefore the improvement of the mass transfer inside positive electrode can effectively enhance battery performance . In this article the rice husk based porous carbon is applied as an additive in positive electrodes of lead acid batteries . The addition of RHPC can increase the content of 3BS 3PbOPbSO

@highlight The pores of rice husk based porous carbon RHPC can enhance the mass transfer in the positive electrodes a typical thick electrode of lead acid batteries.
@highlight The porous RHPC additive in positive electrode is beneficial to increase the content of 3PbOPbSO
@highlight O 3BS with decreased crystallinity and particle size in cured electrode.
@highlight The porous RHPC additive can improve the formation efficiency the conductivity and the electron transfer rate of positive electrodes after formation.
@highlight Due to the effects of RHPC on positive electrodes the specific discharge capacity of the positive electrodes especially at high rates was improved.
