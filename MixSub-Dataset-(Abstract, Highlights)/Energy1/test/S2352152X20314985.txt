 Currently the introduction of phase change materials in building materials is recognized as a popular technique for reducing interior temperature fluctuations and improving the energy efficiency of buildings . Conventionally PCM in construction materials is different with bulk PCM as it incorporates impurities and acts as a binary mixture . For this reason physical models to describe heat transfers inside such materials are highly requested . This paper presents four physical approaches that can be applied to examine heat transfer in impure PCM dispersed inside a building material . These models have been successfully verified and tested using experimental results from the literature . A significant hysteresis is observed during the phase transition as a result of thermal gradients within the composite material as well as the non symmetric enthalpy profile as a function of temperature .

@highlight Physical models to analyze thermal behavior of composite PCM under sinusoidal heat flux.
@highlight Impurities in the PCM leads to an asymmetrical melting and freezing processes inside the composite material.
@highlight Impurities in PCM affect considerably the temperature variation inside the composite material.
