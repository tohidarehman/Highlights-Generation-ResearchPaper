 Phase change materials better known as PCMs have become an effective energy efficient building retrofitting technology . The selection of PCM is one of the main aspects that affect the energy consumption of PCM integrated building . In the present study a new parameter is proposed i.e . Measure of Key Response index for selection of PCM and for stating the effect of PCM thermophysical properties on the thermal performance of PCM integrated roof for different climatic zones of India . This parameter depends on ceiling temperature time lag decrement factor and heat gain of a PCM integrated roof . With the design of the experiment method and range numerical simulations of PCM integrated roof in three climatic zones of India are carried out . Experimental design using Response Surface Methodology is used to produce the set of experiments to determine the optimum PCM.The effect of different PCM properties on the thermal performance of the building is demonstrated using range analysis . The results of this study show that the proposed index is useful for identifying optimum PCM and effect of different PCM properties for different climatic zone . It is also observed the order of thermophysical properties and optimum PCM varies for each climatic zone .

@highlight PCM selection and effect of its thermophysical properties is established.
@highlight A new term is proposed i.e. Measure of Key Response index MKR index .
@highlight Numerical simulations of PCM integrated roof in three climatic zones of India are carried out to establish the usefulness of MKR index.
@highlight The melting temperature and thermal conductivity of PCM play a significant role in the selection of PCM.
