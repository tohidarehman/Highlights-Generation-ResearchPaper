 While samples of laboratory grade are typically measured to determine the relevant properties of phase change materials in applications cheaper PCM of technical grade are generally used . Therefore the influence of different basic raw materials from technical to laboratory grade on the maximum storage capacity of the popular CaCl

@highlight The maximum storage capacity of four different CaCl
