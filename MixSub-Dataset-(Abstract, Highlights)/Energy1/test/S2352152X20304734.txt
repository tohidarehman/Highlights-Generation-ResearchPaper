 Three types of 18 65 cylindrical lithium ion cells with different positive active materials negative active material graphite average particle sizes and electrode designs were tested using an accelerated low earth orbit CubeSat power profile cycle . Each design yields a unique energy density power capability and cycle life . Each cell type was tested in a 3P group configuration at 10C in atmospheric pressure and under vacuum . Cell groups were operated in their respective pressure condition until they failed to successfully execute the accelerated LEO cycle . In atmospheric pressure and vacuum both NMC groups failed due to internal resistance growth . The atmospheric pressure NCA group failed due to excessive internal gas build up triggering the current interrupt device to electrically disconnect . The NCA group in vacuum failed from both IR growth and capacity degradation . The LFP groups both in atmospheric pressure and vacuum have completed approximately 5078 LEO cycles or 2800 equivalent cycles of initial measured coulombic capacity and are still operational with 19 and 21 capacity degradation from their initial measured coulombic capacity respectively .

@highlight Tested three diverse 18 65 battery chemistries in 3P groups for the CubeSat application in vacuum 0.2 kPa and atmospheric 101 kPa environments at 10C.
@highlight The high power low energy density LFP cell outperforms both NCA and NMC cells in energy efficiency cycle life and operational status.
@highlight Performance of both NCA and NMC cell groups are more temperature sensitive than the LFP cells.
@highlight Findings indicate that the underutilized high power LFP cell chemistry can be ideal for LEO CubeSat applications.
