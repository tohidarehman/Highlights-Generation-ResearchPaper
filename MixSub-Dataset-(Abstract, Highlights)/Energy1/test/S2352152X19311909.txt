 Aging of lithium ion pouch cells causes significant cell thickness growth and can consequently lead to high loads onto the cell stack and module frame in automotive application . In order to investigate force evolution and its interaction with aging cells must be cycled under mechanically representative bracing conditions . Known test setups for single cell testing from literature fail to meet important requirements . A realistic module stiffness must be simulated by highly plane parallel plates to achieve a homogeneous load onto the cell . The cell shall be sufficiently and homogeneously cooled . Additionally the realistic bracing procedure as in industrial assembly and simultaneous measurements of cell displacement and force must be conducted . This paper presents the design and validation of a pneumatic cell press which meets all of the above requirements and is able to universally simulate the stress strain characteristics of any module by feedback control . The homogeneity requirements were scrutinized by two dimensional temperature and pressure measurements . Small deformations of the setup under loads of up to 45kN are measured and corrected for . Several cycles of an automotive cell under constant force and module stiffness simulation of 300kNmm
