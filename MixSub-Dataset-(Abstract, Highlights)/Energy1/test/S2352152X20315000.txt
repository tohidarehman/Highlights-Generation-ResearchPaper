 Battery supercapacitor hybrid devices have become a bridge to unit high specific energy and power but they are usually limited in applications by low specific energy of the electroactive materials . Hierarchical bimetallic selenides are regarded as promising materials to break the restriction because of their superior conductivities synergistic effect and more electroactive sites . Here we first apply a bimetallic zinccobalt selenide to a BSH device as a battery type electrode material . Its 3D structure consists of hierarchical sea urchin like microspheres whose surfaces are covered by very rough and porous needle like nanorods . Benefiting from the unique hierarchical structure the ZCS delivers a satisfied specific capacity of 1419 C g
