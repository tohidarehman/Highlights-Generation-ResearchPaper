 Although cobalt zinc based bimetallic oxides are regarded as auspicious pseudocapacitive electrode materials owing to their high specific capacitance and rich electrochemistry however relatively large capacitance fading during charge discharge process and low energy density hinder their real applications . In this work we rationally designed a bimetallic oxide ZnCo
