 This study investigates a reversible solid oxide fuel cell system coupled with an external waste heat source for use of electrical energy storage . Steam from waste fueled boilers is used as an external heat source over temperatures ranging from 150C to slightly over 550C . We considered three fuel recirculation configurations that represent the different temperatures of recirculated fuel . We also investigated the effect of different devices including a recycle blower and ejector . Our results showed that fuel recirculation increases the overall round trip efficiency up to 6.0 points when waste steam is at 500C . However recirculation at the highest temperature did not lead to the highest efficiency improvement in the ejector systems . Instead the warm ejector configuration our intermediate temperature case resulted in the highest efficiency . Furthermore the warm ejector configuration showed efficiencies close to those of the blower system at a wide range of operating current densities . We also determined a range of external heat source temperatures that is favorable or workable for specific ejector system configurations so that the fuel recirculation configuration could be designed accordingly to achieve best performance .

@highlight RSOFC coupled with waste steam with different fuel recycling methods was analyzed.
@highlight Effect of external heat source temperatures on fuel recirculation was analyzed.
@highlight Fuel recirculation by ejector can result in same system efficiency with by blower.
@highlight Fuel recycled at intermediate temperature showed the highest round trip efficiency.
@highlight Using ejector each waste steam temperature range suits specific system scenarios.
