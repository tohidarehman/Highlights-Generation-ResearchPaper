 Recently rational design and synthesis of two dimensional nanoflake based architectures have attracted great attention in energy storage systems due to their unique properties such as high specific surface area superior electrical and thermal conductivity . Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks with 2D structure can be synthesized by a facile aqueous method and be used to obtain 2D metallic binary metallic oxides . In this paper graphene oxide and Zn

@highlight Zn Co Oxide Graphene Oxide hybrid with 2D structures is obtained by annealing Zn Co ZIF Graphene Oxide precursor which was synthesized by a facile aqueous method with Graphene Oxide.
@highlight Zinc oxide and Graphene Oxide increased specific surface area and the dispersion of Co
@highlight in Zn Co Oxide Graphene Oxide.
@highlight Zn Co Oxide Graphene Oxide electrode shows high specific capacitance good rate capability and cycling stability.
