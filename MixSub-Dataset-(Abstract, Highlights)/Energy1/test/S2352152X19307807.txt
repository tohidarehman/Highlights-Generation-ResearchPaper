 Thermal energy storage has become more and more important to improving the overall efficiency of energy systems by utilising the wasted energy . This study was aimed to develop a chemical heat storage system using magnesium hydroxide

@highlight CHS system was developed to cover wasted heat energy of IC engine.
@highlight The experiment were conducted to verify the performance of the system.
@highlight The stored energy depends on the engine load.
@highlight The stored energy was used to heat the engine intake air.
@highlight The proposed applications of CHS were discussed.
