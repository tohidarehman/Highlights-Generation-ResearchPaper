 The surging demand for thermal energy storage directs considerable attention towards the development of phase change materials . This study has the objective to develop a eutectic PCM for effective cold thermal energy storage . The work involves preparation thermophysical property analysis and experimental studies of a novel binary eutectic mixture . The technique of Differential Scanning Calorimetry is used in determination of thermophysical properties of the prepared eutectic . Results show that the 80 20 eutectic composition of lauryl alcohol and cetyl alcohol with melting temperature of 20.01C and latent heat of 191.63Jg
