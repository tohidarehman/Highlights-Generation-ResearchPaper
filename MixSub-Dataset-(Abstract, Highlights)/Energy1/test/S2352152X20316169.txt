 The deployment of distributed behind the meter batteries operating on a peak shaving mode could benefit the electricity network by providing optimal and location specific services increasing the penetration of intermittent renewable sources and deferring costly network upgrades . However the quantitative assessment of the benefits of load peak shaving and its impact on the distribution network remains a challenge . The present paper introduces a metric of five indexes to evaluate the technical performances of load peak shaving . This metric is applied on a case study based on a photovoltaic and battery system application for a test house in Northern Ireland whose electricity demand is representative of the average UK demand profile . Two peak shaving strategies are compared with a more usual self consumption mode and the impact of the battery size is evaluated . Peak shaving management strategies show promising performance by reducing peaks by more than 98 while still decreasing the yearly consumption by 15 and avoiding 75 of the photovoltaic generated energy to be exported back to the grid . The economic analysis compared the net present values achieved under two different tariff policies . Using a peak shaving incentivising tariff remunerating customers 0.24 per kWh of peak shaved allowed to maintain profitability with a capacity cost of up to 400 kWh compared to only 150 kWh for a usual flat tariff scheme . Such an incentive is a step forward in promoting customers to purchase a larger battery and to operate it in a way that benefits the grid operator .
