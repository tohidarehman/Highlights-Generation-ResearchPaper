 Layered double hydroxide is commonly employed as supercapacitor electrode due to its high theoretical and experimental capacitance but limited by its easily agglomerated structure . Herein a three dimensional nickel cobalt layered double hydroxide on carbon fiber cloth is synthesized via an

@highlight NiCo LDH CFC was synthesized by
@highlight hydrolysis conversion of MOF.
@highlight 3D nanostructure increased electroactive sites.
@highlight The NiCo LDH CFC exhibited excellent electrochemical properties.
@highlight Hybrid supercapacitors were assembled and delivered a high specific capacitance.
