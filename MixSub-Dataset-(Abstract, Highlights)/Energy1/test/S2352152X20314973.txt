 This work is conducted with the aim of improving overall specific capacity of polyaniline with incorporation of minimum amount of TiO

@highlight Fabrication of PANI nTiO
@highlight composite electrodes for supercapacitor at a very low temperature 05C .
@highlight Degradation of PANI is expected to be lesser at lower starting temperature.
@highlight An enhanced capacitive value is achieved with very small amount of nTiO
@highlight which makes them very attractive for use in the fabrication of cost effective and chemically stable pseudocapacitors.
