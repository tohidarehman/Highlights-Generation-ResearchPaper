 More advanced battery diagnostic approaches are required for a safer and more reliable operation of today s and future battery technologies . For the purpose of evaluating a battery s internal conditions Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has proven to be a powerful tool but nowadays it is only used in laboratory setups . It could provide valuable information about the battery s internal states if instead it is applied online in an actual battery application . Therefore we have developed an efficient algorithm which is designed to run on a battery management system continuously carrying out measurements of the electrochemical impedance by iteratively evaluating measurements of battery current and voltage . Furthermore the algorithm adapts the parameters of an equivalent circuit model to best match the battery s impedance hence providing characteristic measures of a battery s internal conditions . The algorithm is implemented in a generic form which severs as a baseline that can be adjusted to more specific requirements and circumstances in corresponding battery applications . The scope of this work focuses on an introduction of the generic algorithm as well as a proof of concept . The later was carried out in two steps . First the algorithm was run against a battery model . Subsequently the algorithm was validated utilizing measurements from a real battery cell . In this case laboratory electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements served as reference . The algorithm was able to estimate impedance with a high accuracy in both tests . A high accuracy was also achieved for the parameter estimation however its accuracy decreases with large superposed DC current rates .
