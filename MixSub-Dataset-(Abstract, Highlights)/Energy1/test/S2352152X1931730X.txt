 The inherent intermittency of wind and solar generation presents a significant challenge as we seek to increase the penetration of renewable generation in the power grid . Increasingly energy storage is being deployed alongside renewable generation to counter this intermittency . However a formal characterization of the reliability of renewable generators bundled with storage is lacking in the literature . The present paper seeks to fill this gap . We use a Markov modulated fluid queue to model the loss of load probability

@highlight This paper addresses the problem of sizing of energy storage for reliable grid integration of renewables.
@highlight Demand and supply uncertainty are jointly modelled as functions of a background Markov process.
@highlight Crisp sizing estimates are obtained using large deviations theory.
@highlight We present a case study using real world wind power data to demonstrate the applicability of our results in practice.
