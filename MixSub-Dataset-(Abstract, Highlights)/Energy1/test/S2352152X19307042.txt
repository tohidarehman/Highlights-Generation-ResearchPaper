 This paper presents an effective method to estimate the state of charge of a Lithium ion battery . This parameter is very crucial as it indicates the performance and health of the battery . The battery SoC estimation equivalent circuit provided in MATLAB has been modified by adding the 3 RC pairs in series with its internal resistance . The values of the RC pairs have been calculated mathematically by solving the circuit model based on charging and discharging dynamics of the battery . The values of these parameters have also been optimized using a lsqnonlin function . The SoC of the battery is estimated using the combination of coulomb counting and open circuit voltage methods to minimize the error in estimation . The obtained SoC is further corrected for errors using ANFIS based algorithms . The effect of temperature has also been accounted for modelling the battery and in SoC estimation . These obtained SoCs for 3 cases i.e . without RC with RC pairs and then tuned with ANFIS based optimization are compared for the same load . The parameter calculation method adopted here results in an efficient and accurate model that keeps track of correct battery SoC . The complete system is validated in real time using hardware in the loop laboratory setup .
