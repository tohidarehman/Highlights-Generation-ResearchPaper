 Pure SnO and Mn doped SnO nanoparticles have been successfully prepared by simplest route of the hydrothermal method . Prepared nanoparticles have been characterized by various analyses to understand structural optical morphological elemental composition Photoluminescence and electrochemical behaviours . The powder X ray diffraction pattern analysis confirms the formation of crystalline nature of pure and Mn SnO and its tetragonal structure . Functional group and elemental composition of prepared nanoparticles are confirmed using FTIR and EDX . The electrochemical performances of the prepared materials as working electrodes are analyzed by electrochemical workstation analyzed parameters such as cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge discharge . From this study maximum specific capacitance C
