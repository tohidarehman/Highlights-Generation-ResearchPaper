 Today in developed megacities municipal waste incinerators are a practical solution although they require a relatively high initial investment . On the other hand E Transport is growing in metropolitans along with the Renewable Energy Sources . This study proposes an Urban Micro Grid consisting of a Waste to Energy Combined Heat and Power generation unit and series of Plugin Electric Vehicles . The main purpose is to provide ancillary services through the incorporation of PEVs as fast responsive storages . The parking lots may aggregate to form PEV clusters and make bilateral contracts with WtE CHP to be able to participate in the regulating power markets . A Crow Search Algorithm is developed for the UMG operation . In addition a data analysis section is provided focusing on the behavior of urban drives to extract the realistic probabilities for PEVs available during the daytime . Moreover the power market of Denmark east is considered for the case study of Copenhagen . The results confirm that in case the UMG succeeds in selling the products in the regulating up market the economic value per MW is remarkably enhanced and the total profit is escalated .
