 Due to the penetration of renewable energy sources with probabilistic natures into microgrids optimal scheduling and reconfiguration processes are associated with uncertainty . This paper presents the stochastic profit based optimal day ahead scheduling of a reconfigurable microgrid as a new generation of the conventional microgrid . The proposed algorithm finds the optimal RMG s topology from the profit maximization point of view the optimal hourly MG s unit set points like micro turbines and energy storage and power exchange with the main grid simultaneously . The generated power of wind turbine and PV panel as well as load demand are considered as uncertain parameters . To solve the profit maximization problem of RMG time varying acceleration coefficients particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed . Also to ensure simulation accuracy in the presence of high level uncertainties the autocorrelation model is used based on actual data for the uncertainty of renewable power output . The feasibility and applicability of the proposed framework are demonstrated on a 69 bus radial RMG with various distributed generators in different cases . The results show the effectiveness of the proposed model .
