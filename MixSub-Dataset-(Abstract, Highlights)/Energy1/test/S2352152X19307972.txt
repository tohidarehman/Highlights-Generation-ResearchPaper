 The operating temperature of a steam turbine is limited to 565C by the molten nitrate heat transfer fluid therefore molten salt CSP technologies require alternative salt chemistries such as chloride . The prevention of high temperature corrosion on containment materials plays a critical role and a corrosion mitigation plan is needed to achieve the target plant lifetime of 30 years . This paper performed a materials screening test using a eutectic ternary chloride molten salt composed by 20.4wt . KCl 55.1wt . MgCl

@highlight Material screening tests have been carried out in a eutectic ternary chloride molten salt.
@highlight Linear polarization resistance technique was successfully applied in the materials tested.
@highlight The best corrosion resistance was obtained for HR224 alloy obtaining an alumina protective layer.
