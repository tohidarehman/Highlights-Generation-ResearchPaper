 Using data from the 2018 Labor Force Survey this paper analyzes wage differentials by field of study among Vietnamese university graduates . In contrast to previous findings we find that many fields even more technically and quantitatively oriented disciplines such as engineering science math computer science and business finance afford lower earnings than do the arts humanities disciplines . The differences are statistically significant and in many cases large even after controlling for other individual and regional characteristics . Also the differences are greater among female than among male graduates . Our results shed light on the value of various types of human capital represented by the various disciplines . Such findings offer useful policy implications for policymakers and educational managers .
