 While a growing number of teachers use information and communication technology for work tasks outside the formal working hours and premises research is inconclusive how this relates to their work life balance . Following calls to examine the antecedents and moderating mechanisms of such behavior the present study aims to examine how technology acceptance relates to work related ICT use after hours and work life balance as well as how employees integration preference affects these relationships . Data was collected among 288 secondary school teachers in Flanders concerning their use of digital learning environments beyond school grounds and school hours . Structural equation modelling shows that social influence reduces teachers work life balance mediated by WIA . While there was no support for other technology acceptance factors or the moderating role of integration preference performance expectancy of the DLE and integration preference were associated with a higher work life balance . Hereby this study contributes to research on WIA by integrating the technology acceptance framework with boundary theory and work life research . Overall the findings show that DLE have an impact on teachers work life balance independent of technological factors or their personal preference underscoring the importance of school policies that cement the use of DLE in the private domain .

@highlight Teachers use digital learning environments after hours in response to social influence from peers.
@highlight The use of digital learning environment after hours has an adverse impact on the work life balance of teachers.
@highlight This adverse impact occurs independent of teacher s individual preference for integration work and life domains.
@highlight Results endorse school policies that cement the use of digital learning environments in the private domain.
