 Measuring the success of mobile government is a significant challenge faced by the public sector today as governments are increasingly using mobile technology to provide public services to citizens and m government endeavors have often fallen short of their potential . To address this gap we draw on DeLone and McLeans updated information systems success model in order to develop an m government success model that theorizes service quality as comprising online and offline service quality and further uses perceived value to measure net benefits . The results of a survey of 286 m government users in China indicate that information quality and online service quality but not system quality are positively associated with citizen satisfaction which in turn is positively associated with perceived value . The results also show that the relationship between online service quality and citizen satisfaction is positively moderated by offline service quality while citizen satisfaction partially mediates the relationships between information quality online service quality and perceived value . This study extends the updated IS success model by differentiating between online and offline service quality as well as by introducing the notion of perceived value . Our results provide guidance to researchers and practitioners regarding the role of service quality and perceived value in measuring m government system success .

@highlight Respecifying the updated IS success model and extending it into the m government context.
