 In Spain each student class is assigned a tutor teacher who is also responsible for individually following their tutoring students performance guiding them in personal issues and regularly meeting their families . Although tutors may suppose an important support for students during their school life their close personal relationship may also influence the teaching and learning process in additional ways . This research analyses whether the fact that the tutor teaches a particular subject makes any difference in students academic achievement in that subject and if this differential achievement is conditioned by tutor student family relationship or not . With this objective we employ a rich administrative census database from the most populated region of Spain using student fixed effects within students between school subjects . Our main results show that tutors seem to be only slightly inclined to over mark their tutoring students being this small bias conditioned by their relationship with the student .
