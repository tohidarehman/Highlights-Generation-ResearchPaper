 Social media provide novel opportunities for street gangs to operate beyond their traditional borders to sell drugs recruit members and control their territory virtually and physically . Although social media have contributed to the means available to street gangs today it does not mean that every gang agrees on their use . Drawing on different perspectives on gangs using a multi method design in a London borough the current study shows that social media have polarized gangs resulting in two distinct types of digital adaptation . The proposed division of digitalist and traditionalist gangs is rooted in Thrashers dictum that no two gangs are alike and explains how some gangs prefer to keep a low profile thus avoiding social media use . Digitalists by contrast prefer to use social media as a way to gain reputation and territorial expansion . They use it to brand themselves and to appear attractive for recruits and customers alike . These differences can be theoretically explained firstly as a generational gap meaning that younger gang members prefer the use of social media and secondly by how well established a gang already is as newer gangs need more attention to establish themselves .

@highlight An empirical study on how social media have affected gangs from the perspective of five distinct types of participants.
@highlight Digital technology divided gangs into traditionalists who consciously abstain and digitalists who fully engage.
@highlight Gang evolution matters While established gangs choose aA a traditionalist approach newer gangs become digitalists.
@highlight Generation gap matters Established older members gain less from social media attention than younger counterparts.
@highlight Younger members are more at home in the digital world than older gang members.
