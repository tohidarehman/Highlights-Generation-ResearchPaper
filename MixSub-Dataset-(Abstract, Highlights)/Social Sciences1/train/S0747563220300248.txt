 Prosocial exchange systems support cooperation and exchange in support of more sustainable forms of consumption . While often assumed that exchanges within such systems are reciprocal it remains unproven as to what extent reciprocity occurs . This study uses data from a live service Streetbank.com to present an analysis of direct and indirect reciprocal relationships over 4 and half years . The dataset contains behavioural data relating to 5053 acts of offline non monetary exchange . The analysis categorised different forms of exchange that took place giving lending and skill sharing . These exchanges were then analysed for direct and indirect reciprocity . The results show that instances of reciprocity are rare and when present often span more than one type of exchange . The conclusion is that reciprocity can not be assumed to be the norm in prosocial exchange systems . Practically design and deployment should not be predicated on reciprocity . Furthermore any means to encourage reciprocity should make patterns of exchange visible and do so across hybrid forms of exchange .

@highlight Direct and indirect reciprocity between users of a popular prosocial exchange system are examined.
@highlight Reciprocal relationships are rare 1.58 across three forms of prosocial behaviour giving lending and skill sharing .
@highlight Results challenge the idea that prosocial exchange is motivated and sustained through generalised reciprocity.
@highlight Network analysis reveals users interact through fragmented chains of dyads rather than channels for indirect reciprocity.
