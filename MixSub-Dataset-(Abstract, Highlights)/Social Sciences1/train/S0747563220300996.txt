 What we see influences our emotions . Technology often mediates the visual content we perceive . Visual angle is an essential parameter of how we see such content . It operationalizes visible properties of humancomputer interfaces . However we know little about the content independent effect of visual angle on emotional responses to audiovisual stimuli . We show that visual angle alone affects emotional responses to audiovisual features independent of object perception . We conducted a 223 factorial repeated measures experiment with 143 undergraduate students . We simultaneously presented monochrome rectangles with pure tones and assessed valence arousal and dominance . In the high visual angle condition arousal increased valence and dominance decreased and lightness modulated arousal . In the low visual angle condition pitch modulated arousal and lightness affected valence . Visual angle weights the affective relevance of perception modalities independent of spatial representations . Visual angle serves as an early stage perceptual feature for organizing emotional responses . Control of this presentation layer allows for provoking or avoiding emotional response where intended .

@highlight Increased visual angle increased arousal and decreased valence and dominance ratings.
@highlight The visual angle weights the affective relevance of visual and auditory content.
@highlight Only high visual angles significantly modulated arousal responses to visual content.
@highlight Only low visual angles significantly modulated arousal responses to auditory content.
