 Advances in information and communication technologies have led to the revolution in retail industry through integrating multiple available channels to enhance seamless customer experience promoting a shift from multichannel to omnichannel business . This phenomenon has gained increasing attention in both academia and industry due to growing challenges to serve customers effectively . This study adopted a mixed method approach to firstly conceptualize omnichannel customer experience and develop a survey instrument . Then this study draws on the innovation diffusion theory to develop a nomological model that posits perceived compatibility and perceived risk as key linking mechanisms between omnichannel experience and omnichannel shopping intention . To achieve our research objective we collected two data sets including pretest and model test . We found that the constructs that represented our omnichannel experience conceptualization were good predictors of perceived compatibility and perceived risk which further impact customers shopping intention . This study provides a rich conceptualization of an instrument for omnichannel customer experience that can serve as a springboard for future research to investigate the antecedents and impacts of omnichannel experience and can be used as a guide to design effective omnichannel retailing strategy .

@highlight Omnichannel customer experience has been conceptualized as a multi dimensional construct.
@highlight The key determinants of omnichannel customer experience have been identified.
