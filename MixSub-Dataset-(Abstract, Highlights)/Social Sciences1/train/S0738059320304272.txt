 Around the world especially in rapidly developing countries many higher education institutions of various forms are being established . In China many new universities have been created including by upgrading existing tertiary education institutions . This process creates economic displacement with livelihood consequences and social impacts on existing employees and local communities . Using the proposed University of Groningen campus in Yantai China as a case study we consider the social impacts that were experienced or were likely to be experienced by the employees of the pre existing institution . Existing employees experienced many negative impacts from economic displacement . They were not satisfied with the compensation offered their views and interests were not adequately considered and many were afraid to express their concerns . The institutions involved in the project failed to fulfil their corporate social responsibility and environmental social and governance obligations to ensure no harm .
