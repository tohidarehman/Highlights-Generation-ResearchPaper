 Competition is often incorporated into game based learning . Accordingly we developed an academic English competition cloze test in which there were two modes i.e . real competition and virtual competition . On the other hand the effectiveness of real competition and virtual competition is still uncertain . To this end we conducted two empirical studies to address this issue . Study One examined the impacts of real competition while Study Two investigated students reactions to real competition and virtual competition . The results from Study One indicated that students made improvement between each task and between the post test and the delayed test in the context of real competition . The results from Study Two showed that learners with virtual competition significantly had better learning performance and spent more time for undertaking the practical tasks than those with real competition . Furthermore learners with real competition and those with virtual competition showed different learning behavior . Based on the results of these two studies we proposed a framework which can contribute the understandings of the impacts of real competition and virtual competition on game based learning . Implications for educational practice are discussed .

@highlight We investigated learners reactions to virtual competition and real competition.
@highlight Real competition was not always advantageous to learners.
@highlight Learners with virtual competition demonstrated good performance.
@highlight Lag Sequential Analysis was applied to analyze learning behavior.
@highlight Learners behave differently in virtual competition and real competition.
