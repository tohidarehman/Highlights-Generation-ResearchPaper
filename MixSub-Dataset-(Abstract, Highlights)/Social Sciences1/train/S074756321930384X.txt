 Based on a uses and gratifications perspective on media use in this paper I analyze the important role played by dating sites for men who have sex with men in their efforts to find offline sexual partners . To do so I conducted two quantitative surveys . In Study 1 I compared the online dating behavior of 12 328 MSM from Germany and Austria with the availability of offline sexual gay venues and how frequently MSM visit such venues . In Study 2 I used a global sample of 30 789 MSM to compare the frequency and recency of online dates of men living in countries that support male homosexuality and those in countries that criminalize it . The findings suggest that MSM specific dating sites can serve as a substitute for offline sexual gay venues The recency of online dates is slightly higher in rural areas and in countries that criminalize male homosexuality . However meeting men through dating sites is the main method used by MSM to recruit sexual partners even among those who live in cities where offline sexual venues are available and who visit them on a regular basis . The findings are discussed with respect to potential further gratifications delivered by computer mediated communication particularly the opportunity to verbalize and negotiate upcoming sexual encounters .
