 This study was to explore the relationships between students visual behaviors and cognitive structures as well as between their visual behaviors and information processing modes in the reading of controversial reports on a socio scientific issue . An eye tracking technique was used to record students visual behaviors while reading and the flow map method was adopted to understand the cognitive structures and information processing modes of a sample of 23 volunteer university undergraduate and graduate students . One controversial issue about genetically modified foods was selected as the topic of the reading material . The content involved various types of reasoning information such as background reason data and inference presented on one page . The results showed that some significant relations between students visual behaviors and cognitive structures and between their visual behaviors and information processing modes . Moreover the regression analyses indicated that the proportion of fixation duration on the inference information was the best predictor of the cognitive structures . Furthermore the information of empirical data can help students define the controversial issue and repeatedly shifting fixations away from the reading content is the most significant visual attention characteristic to predict the comparing and the inferring modes for processing the controversial issue . Future studies and applications are discussed .

@highlight Cognitive processes in controversial SSI reading is explored by eye tracking.
@highlight Flow map was used to understand cognitive structures and process modes.
@highlight Paying attention to inference information is benefit for cognitive structures.
@highlight Re checking data information is important for defining a controversial issue.
@highlight Re moving attention away from reading content may predict deeper thinking.
