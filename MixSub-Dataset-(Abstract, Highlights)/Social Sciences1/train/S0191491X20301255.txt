 This study investigates how school level standardized testing policy at Grade 1 is directly and indirectly linked to math achievement in primary grades . Using nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Cohort data drawn from the U.S. the sample consists of 6774 children nested in 925 elementary schools . Findings from a multilevel full structural mediation analysis indicate that despite childrens short term gains at Grade 1 the positive effects of frequent testing policy at Grade 1 do not persist in Grade 3 . In contrast school level standardized testing policies were negatively associated with math achievement at Grade 3 mediated by procedural instructional approaches . The findings provide empirical evidence on the validity of standardized testing in primary grade mathematics and offer implications for teachers educational policymakers and researchers .

@highlight Frequency of testing was associated with math instruction.
@highlight Frequency of testing had a negative long term effect on math achievement.
@highlight Math instruction mediated the link between testing and math achievement.
