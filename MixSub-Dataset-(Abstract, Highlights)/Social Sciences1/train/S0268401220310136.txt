 Contact tracing apps are presented as a solution if not the solution to curb pandemics in the Covid 19 crisis . In France despite heated public institutional debate on privacy related issues the app was presented by government as an essential benefit for protecting health and lives thus avoiding both politicians and citizens to feel morally responsible and looking guilty and as essential to recover our freedom to move . However we argue that while detection of cases have still not been reported after 10 days and one million app downloads a situation comparable to Australia who launched its app a month before the adoption of the app generates important risks to our informational privacy surveillance and habituation to security policies . It also may create discrimination distrust and generate other health problems such as addiction and others as 5G technology continues to be deployed without prior impact studies . Finally the smartphone app against covid epidemics appears as an extreme case of the privacy paradox where the government plays on the immediate benefits and downplays long term concerns while inducing a technology of self . Contact tracing apps may become an emblematic case for digital transformation and value changes in the western world .
