 Natural disasters have caused significant financial and economic losses . One prominent way to combat these losses is crowdfunding . Donation based crowdfunding platforms have been the backbone for disaster relief operations but the engagement of donors with these platforms needs significant attention . This study aims to understand how gamification is used as a tool for understanding the behaviour of donors on crowdfunding platforms for DRO . The study uses the Civic Voluntary Model to propose the conceptual framework and collects empirical data from 321 respondents to test the hypothesis . The study uses information quality and voluntariness as moderating variables and the model also controls for ownership of the crowdfunding platform and previous experience of donation . The results confirm that gamification positively impacts the behaviour of donors which then leads to higher participation in crowdfunding channels . Both information quality and voluntary behaviour of donors have significant moderating effects that help in understanding the behaviour of donors and their participation in crowdfunding platforms . The results indicate that previous experience of making donations does not have a significant impact on the behaviour and actions of donors . The study thus brings a fresh perspective to using game mechanics along with understanding the quality of information on crowdfunding platforms to attract and sustain donations in DRO .
