 Wearable activity trackers hold great potential for facilitating self regulated health behavior thereby improving physical fitness and preventing cardiovascular diseases . Unfortunately many users discontinue tracking after only a few months mitigating large scale health effects . To identify usage barriers and psychological mechanisms resulting in tracker abandonment decisions it is essential to characterize former users regarding their abandonment reasons as well as former tracker usage patterns . Within the present research we reviewed past literature on wearable activity tracking attrition and developed an online questionnaire for assessing abandonment reasons . Results from 159 former users revealed insights into the relative importance of abandonment reasons former users usage patterns evaluation of personal quantification and tracker acceptance . Correlational analyses showed that intensity of tracker usage and data interaction current physical activity and tracker acceptance were related to specific abandonment reasons . Moreover abandonment due to perceived data inaccuracy uselessness and loss of tracking motivation were linked to negative attitudes towards personal quantification . Furthermore permanent abandonment decisions were particularly related to loss of tracking motivation . Based on the results we derived six design guidelines for supporting continued tracker usage .

@highlight We examined reasons for tracker abandonment via online questionnaire.
@highlight Most important reasons Demotivation and factors interrupting depriotizing tracking.
@highlight Former users characterized by intense prior usage.
@highlight Abandonment decision of most former users not permanent.
@highlight Data inaccuracy uselessness demotivation harmful for acceptance and continued use.
