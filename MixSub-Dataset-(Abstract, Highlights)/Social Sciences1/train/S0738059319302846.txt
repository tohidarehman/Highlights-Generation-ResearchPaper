 The present study aims to determine how much the quality of teaching varies among and within under performing schools . 1266 classroom observations were conducted in 260 schools across Chile . An index of teaching quality was constructed to analyze its variance . It was found that only 4.8 of the variance is explained by the teachers school . This suggests that the variance in the quality of teaching is not among schools but within teachers from the same school . These results are important for public policy especially in the field of professional development as they suggest that best practices can be found at under performing schools .

@highlight There is high degree of variability within schools.
@highlight Only 4.8 of the variance is explained by the teachers school.
@highlight In underperforming schools there are teachers with good practices.
