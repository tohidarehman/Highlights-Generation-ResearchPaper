 This paper presents evidence on literacy trajectories for children in Ghana who enrolled in a Complementary Basic Education programme taught in mother tongue and transitioned into government schools . At the point of transition we find that children who enrolled in government schools where the language of instruction differed from instruction in their mother tongue did not perform as well in literacy . After a year in government schools those taught in another local language caught up . By contrast those who transitioned into English did not . Our evidence reinforces the benefits of mother tongue and local language instruction for progress in literacy .

@highlight We model foundational literacy trajectories from complementary education into government schools.
@highlight At the point of transition into government schools children who moved into a different language of instruction did not perform as well in literacy.
@highlight Those who transitioned into another local language were able to catch up after one year in government schools. However those who transitioned into English did not.
@highlight To achieve sustained literacy for all children local language should feature prominently in instruction in government schools.
