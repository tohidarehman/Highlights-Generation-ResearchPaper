 Using two waves of Indonesian Family Life Survey data this paper investigates effects of parental chronic illness on educational attainment of children in Indonesia . Studies on this nonpecuniary cost of adult morbidity are rare in the literature despite its significance in future wellbeing of people in developing countries . This paper is distinguished from existing related studies in that it accounts for the duration of illness in the estimation of the effects . The results show that girls whose father suffers from chronic illness for a longer duration achieve significantly lower educational levels between 2007 and 2014 compared to children of their same age cohort with healthy parents . In contrast boys are unaffected by the fathers duration of chronic illness . Furthermore this paper finds no evidence that mothers duration of chronic illness affects educational attainment of children in Indonesia .

@highlight Girls with sick fathers attain significantly lower schooling than their age cohort.
@highlight One year of paternal chronic illness is linked to 2.5 months lower schooling.
@highlight Boys are found to be unaffected by the duration of parental chronic illness.
@highlight Mothers illness has no effect on educational outcomes of children.
@highlight No evidence that girls with sick fathers increase their labor hours.
