 Social media interactions are popularly implicated in psychological changes like radicalization . However there are currently no viable methods to assess whether social media interactions actually lead to such changes . The purpose of the current research was to develop a methodological paradigm that can assess such longitudinal change in individuals social media posts . Using this method we analyzed the longitudinal timelines of 110 Twitter users who had expressed support for Daesh and we compared them to a baseline sample of twitter timelines to investigate the factors associated with within person increases in conformity to the vernacular and linguistic style of tweets that supported violent extremism . We found that conformity to both extremist group vernacular and linguistic style increased over time and with mobilizing online interactions . Thus we show how to detect within person changes over time in social media data and suggest why these changes occur and in doing so validate a methodological paradigm that can detect and predict within person change in psychological group memberships through social media interactions .
