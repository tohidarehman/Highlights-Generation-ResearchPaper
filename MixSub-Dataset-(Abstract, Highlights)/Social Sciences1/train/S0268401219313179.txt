 This study furthers investigation into exactly how Social CRM is different from traditional CRM and models the interrelationships between its capabilities . It is underpinned in dynamic capabilities theory to explain how social media as a resource all organizations use can lead to differing performance outcomes . It is underpinned in seminal research into traditional CRM but which does not cater for the disruptive nature of social media . We outline how S CRM is a second order dynamic capability consistng of a set of first order integrative dynamic capabiliies that when properly interrelated lead to performance outcomes . We particularly model the role of S CRM front and back office technology capabilities customer engagement initiatives and social information processes in driving customer relationship performance . Findings show that S CRM is different from traditional CRM in a range of ways in the front and back offices and provide a framework for researcher and managers in information systems and marketing to operate at strategic and tactical levels within S CRM while being congisant of both .
