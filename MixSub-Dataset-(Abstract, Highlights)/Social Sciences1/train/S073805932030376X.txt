 Secure Childrens Homes accommodate some of the most vulnerable children in society and yet they have evaded sustained academic attention . Consequently little is known about childrens education in this type of setting . Through the lens of institutional ethnography this paper explores how experiences of education inside one Secure Childrens Home in England are shaped by the institution . This approach makes visible that while the small scale of the setting is of value the mix of children accommodated for qualitatively different reasons is problematic for both the delivery of education and the childrens engagement in learning .
