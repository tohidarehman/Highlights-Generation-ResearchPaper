 The split attention effect seems a robust finding in the literature and shows that complex learning materials consisting of text and pictures lead to better learning when they are spatially integrated instead of spatially separated . In the current study two experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of distance and signaling on the split attention effect . In Experiment 1 a 22 design was used in which spatial distance and signaling were manipulated while in Experiment 2 it was tried to replicate the split attention effect previously observed with the learning materials used in Experiment 1 . In contrast to our hypotheses spatial distance and signaling did not influence mental effort ratings and transfer performance in Experiment 1 . Moreover no split attention effect was found on retention transfer or mental effort ratings in Experiment 2 . As no split attention effect was obtained with the learning materials it is not possible to examine the effects of distance and signaling on the split attention effect . Concluding the current results raise doubts about how robust the split attention effect is and demonstrate the importance of replication studies .

@highlight Two experiments examined learning from spatially separated text and pictures.
@highlight In Experiment 1 increased distance and signaling did not influence learning.
@highlight Experiment 2 found no benefits of spatially integrating text and picture.
@highlight Apparently spatial separation does not always impede text picture learning.
