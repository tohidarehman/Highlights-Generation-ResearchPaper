 The affluent markets of developed countries have become very competitive . Therefore companies are trying to explore market opportunities at the segment of low income people termed as Bottom of the Pyramid . With the proliferation in popularity and reduction in the price of smartphones there is a potential market opportunity for smartphone producing companies at the BOP segment . The companies need to identify the factors influencing smartphone adoption at the BOP in order to explore this market opportunity . The current study extends the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology with Perceived Monetary Value to investigate the antecedents of smartphone adoption at the BOP . Empirical analysis has shown that Performance Expectancy Effort Expectancy Social Influence and Perceived Monetary Value predict the Behavioral Intention and BI and Facilitating Conditions predict the Use Behavior . Findings from this study can be used by the managers of the companies targeting the BOP segment in pricing marketing and product specific decision making process . The policymakers can also analyze the results of this study for successful implementation and delivery of Information and Communication Technology based services for the BOP segment .

@highlight There is scarcity of studies related to technology adoption at the BOP.
@highlight We propose a framework which extends UTAUT with Perceived Monetary Value PMV .
@highlight Factors of UTAUT and PMV are found to impact smartphone adoption at the BOP.
@highlight Age and Experience moderate a few relationships proposed in the framework.
