 Smartphone use while driving causes car crashes injuries and high death rates . To date there is little research into what motivates frequent smartphone use while driving . In this study we draw on psychological research indicating that personality profiles defined as constellations of multiple personality traits influence individual beliefs and behaviors . We apply fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis to survey data to derive profiles of drivers who use their smartphone frequently while driving . Our results indicate that personality profiles affect smartphone use behavior while driving and that three equifinal profiles i.e . distinct constellations of the big five personality traits influence frequent smartphone use while driving . Interestingly a single trait can be low in one profile and high in another profile and depending on the other traits both profiles might reflect drivers using their smartphone frequently . We contribute to the literature that frequent smartphone use while driving is to some degree grounded in personality and that just looking at singular traits can yield misleading results . Complementing these theoretical insights by post survey interviews we can reveal distinct measures that reduce frequent smartphone use for each of the three profiles .
