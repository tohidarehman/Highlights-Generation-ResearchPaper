 The present research examined to what extent virtual reality was an effective tool to induce a complex positive other oriented emotion gratitude . We hypothesized that receiving the help of a virtual benefactor should generate a feeling of gratitude but also social benefits . In two studies we showed that this virtual social interaction induced a feeling of gratitude in contrast to a control condition . Furthermore in both studies being helped by a virtual confederate led participants to be more inclined to offer social support to their benefactor in contrast to the control condition . The beneficial effect of the gratitude induction on social support intentions was mediated by the virtual confederate s perceived warmth and by enhanced perceived interpersonal closeness . Finally the expected benefits of gratitude were observed for both ingroup and outgroup benefactors . Implications of these findings for emotion induction well being and intergroup contacts are discussed .
