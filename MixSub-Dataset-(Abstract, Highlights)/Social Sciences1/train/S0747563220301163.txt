 Cyberbullying at work takes many forms from aggressive and threatening behavior to social ostracism . It can also have adverse consequences on general well being that might be even more severe for people whose identities are centrally based on social media ties . We examined this type of identity driven social media use via the concept of social media identity bubbles . We first analyzed the risk and protective factors associated with cyberbullying victimization at work and then investigated its impacts on well being . We expected that workers strongly involved in social media identity bubbles would be in the worst position when faced with cyberbullying . Data include a sample of workers from five Finnish expert organizations
