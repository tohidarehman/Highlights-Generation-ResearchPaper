 Despite the growing popularity of crowdworking platforms crowdworker engagement and its antecedents are still unexplored . This paper investigates how social support in professional crowdworking online communities affects worker engagement in micro task crowdworking . We know from organizational settings that social support is a central antecedent of work engagement as it creates a sense of identification and enhances experienced meaningfulness of work which in turn affects engagement . In MTCW this social antecedent is challenging as the work setting rarely provides workers with social support from requesters or platforms . However workers frequently participate in professional crowdworking online communities that function as an alternative source of social support . So far it remains unclear whether and how this type of social support contributes to crowdworker engagement . We argue that social support from professional crowdworking online communities enhances group identification among crowdworkers as well as experienced meaningfulness of doing crowdwork thus fostering engagement . We conducted a two wave survey with 181 micro workers showing that affective social support in online communities enhances crowdworkers identification and experienced meaningfulness thereby indirectly affecting engagement in MTCW . We contribute to theory and practice on how to create positive work experiences on virtual platforms by highlighting the importance of professional online communities .

@highlight We studied how social support in online communities increases crowdworker engagement.
@highlight Affective social support from online communities significantly increases engagement.
@highlight Group identification and experienced meaningfulness fully mediate this relationship.
@highlight Instrumental social support has no significant effect on crowdworkers engagement.
