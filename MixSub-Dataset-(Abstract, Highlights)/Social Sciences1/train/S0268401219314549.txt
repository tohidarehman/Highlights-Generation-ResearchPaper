However very little empirical research that focuses on small and medium sized enterprises has been conducted to date . This study examines factors that affect social commerce adoption by SMEs .

The results from a survey of 181 SMEs in Saudi Arabia indicate that trading partner pressure in the environmental context followed by top management support in the organisational context and perceived usefulness in the technological context have the most significant influence on behavioural intention to use social commerce . The research contributions and conclusion as well as limitations and future research directions are presented .
