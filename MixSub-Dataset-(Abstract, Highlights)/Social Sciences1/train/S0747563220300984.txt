 Although algorithms have been widely used to deliver useful applications and services it is unclear how users actually experience and interact with algorithm driven services . This ambiguity is even more troubling in news recommendation algorithms where thorny issues are complicated . This study investigates the user experience and usability of algorithms by focusing on users cognitive process to understand how qualities features are received and transformed into experiences and interaction . This work examines how users perceive and feel about issues in news recommendations and how they interact and engage with algorithm recommended news . It proposes an algorithm experience model of news recommendation integrating the heuristic process of cognitive affective and behavioral factors . The underlying algorithm can affect in different ways the user s perception and trust of the system . The heuristic affect occurs when users subjective feelings about transparency and accuracy act as a mental shortcut users considered transparent and accurate systems convenient and useful . The mediating role of trust suggests that establishing algorithmic trust between users and NRS could enhance algorithm performance . The model illustrates the users cognitive processes of perceptual judgment as well as the motivation behind user behaviors . The results highlight a link between news recommendation systems and user interaction providing a clearer conceptualization of user centered development and the evaluation of algorithm based services .
