 The present study is a validation study asking the question if the method of using thinking aloud protocols for investigating learning effects is appropriate as the process of thinking aloud could play a crucial role in cognitive processing by prompting self regulative processes and could therefore interfere with learning . The present work uses the negative learning effect of seductive details to investigate this research question and is thereby also offering a new perspective from research on self regulation on the discussion of the seductive details effect . 120 university students learned with a digital learning program that was varied by the two factors thinking aloud and seductive details in the 2x2 factorial design study . Results show that TAPs affect visual information processing measured by eye movement subjectively perceived cognitive load and retention performance but not comprehension or transfer performance . Moreover the seductive details effect is confirmed to be stable also under the TAPs condition as no interaction effects were found . These findings have several interesting theoretical and practical implications that are discussed from three viewpoints the methodological the research on seductive details and the self regulation perspective .

@highlight TAPs negatively affected recall but not comprehension and transfer.
@highlight TAPs affected visual information processing with higher text perception.
@highlight Learners learning with TAPs invested significantly more mental effort.
@highlight The Seductive Details effect was found to be robust against using TAPs.
@highlight TAPs only seem to be a valid method for certain learning investigations.
