 Artificial intelligence is playing a key supporting role in the fight against COVID 19 and perhaps will contribute to solutions quicker than we would otherwise achieve in many fields and applications . Since the outbreak of the pandemic there has been an upsurge in the exploration and use of AI and other data analytic tools in a multitude of areas . This paper addresses some of the many considerations for managing the development and deployment of AI applications including planning unpredictable unexpected or biased results repurposing the importance of data and diversity in AI team membership . We provide implications for research and for practice according to each of the considerations . Finally we conclude that we need to plan and carefully consider the issues associated with the development and use of AI as we look for quick solutions .

@highlight Consider a CAIO as a key role to lead the use of AI in COVID 19 response.
@highlight Methods are needed to manage unpredictable unexpected or biased data.
@highlight Repurposed AI offers promise for rapid availability of applications.
@highlight AI accuracy rates achieved in development may be lower in real life use.
@highlight Diverse AI team membership is meant to attain the best system performance.
