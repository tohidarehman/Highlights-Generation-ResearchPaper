 Almost all German universities complain that the math skills of students entering the higher education system do not meet the level demanded by universities . This is a major problem particularly in math related study programs such as economics engineering or science . To bridge the gap almost all universities offer some remedial math courses . However there is only weak empirical evidence for the effectiveness of these courses in Germany . This paper aims to fill this gap by evaluating a remedial math course given within the Economics Department of a German university . A key finding taking a math remedial course on a regular basis will enhance students math skills and increase the probability of passing the final math exam by 35 percent .
