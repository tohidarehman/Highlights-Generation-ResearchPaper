By incorporating the strategic and institutional perspectives of legitimacy into Savass service delivery structure this study developed a triadic framework that accounts for different contextual determinants related to the external market environment and the institutional environment to investigate the formulation of IT governance mechanisms . A survey involving 329 town level governments in Beijing China was done to validate our research model . The results illustrate that the demand supply market forces have direct impacts on IT governance mechanism formulation in local governments . Institutional pressures exert a mediating effect by transiting the supply market force into governments actions . Our triadic framework reveals a dynamic service delivery structure contributing to Savass service delivery structure and IT governance research .
