 Previous research on stress and media use mainly concentrated on between person effects . We add to this research field by additionally assessing within person associations assuming that experiencing more stress than usual goes along with more nomophobia and more passive and active Facebook use than usual cross sectionally and over time and by exploring potential age differences . We conducted a secondary analysis of three waves of a representative multi wave survey of adult Dutch internet users
