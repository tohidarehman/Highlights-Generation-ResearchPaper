 To diagnose the English as a Foreign Language reading ability of Chinese high school students the study explored how an educational theory the revised taxonomy of educational objectives could be used to create the attribute list . Q matrices were proposed and refined qualitatively and quantitatively . The final Q matrix specified the relationship between 53 reading items and 9 cognitive attributes . Thereafter 978 examinees responses were calibrated by cognitive diagnosis models to explore their strengths and weaknesses in EFL reading . Results showed strengths and weaknesses on the 9 attributes of the sampled population examinees at three proficiency levels and individual learners . A diagnostic score report was also developed to communicate multi layered information to various stakeholders . The goodness of fit of the selected CDM was evaluated from multiple measures . The results provide empirical evidence for the utility of educational theories in cognitive diagnosis and the feasibility of retrofitting non diagnostic tests for diagnostic purposes in language testing . In addition the study also demonstrates procedures of model selection and a post hoc approach of model verification in language diagnosis .

@highlight Advanced readers demonstrated high attribute mastery across 8 attributes.
@highlight Mid level students fell behind the advanced readers on the retrieving attribute.
