 The advancement in mobile technology has enabled the application of the mobile wallet or m wallet as an innovative payment method to substitute the traditional functions of the physical wallet . However because of pro innovation bias scholars have a focus on the adoption of technology and very little attention has been given to the resistance of innovation especially in the m wallet context . This study addressed this absence by examining the inhibitors of m wallet innovation adoption through the lens of innovation resistance theory . By applying a sophisticated two staged structural equation modeling artificial neural network approach we successfully extended the IRT by integrating socio demographics and perceived novelty . The study has unveiled the noncompensatory and nonlinear relationships between the predictors and m wallet resistance . Significant predictors from SEM analysis were taken as the ANN models input neurons . According to the normalized importance obtained from the multilayer perceptrons of the feed forward back propagation ANN algorithm we found significant effects of education income usage barrier risk barrier value barrier tradition barrier and perceived novelty on m wallet innovation resistance . The ANN model can predict m wallet innovation resistance with an accuracy of 76.4 . We also discussed several new and useful theoretical and practical implications for reducing m wallet innovation resistance among consumers .

@highlight We extended IRT with perceived novelty and socio demographic variables.
@highlight A two staged SEM ANN approach was used to rank the normalized importance.
@highlight The ANN model predicts m wallet resistance with 76.4 accuracy.
@highlight Education and perceived novelty have negative effects on m wallet resistance.
@highlight Usage risk value tradition barriers have positive effects on m wallet resistance.
