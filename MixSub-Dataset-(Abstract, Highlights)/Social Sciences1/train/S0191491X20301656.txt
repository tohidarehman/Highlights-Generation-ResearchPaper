 In this study we seek to understand which form of peer assessment is most effective in helping pupils progress in their speaking skills when the peers discuss the feedback they are giving in subgroups or when they provide it in writing and individually . We also want to analyze what the students say for what purpose and what elements of oral communication skills they talk about when they provide feedback . The sample consisted of 42 pupils aged 1011 years in two conditions written feedback condition and discussed oral feedback condition . Results indicated that the pupils in the discussed oral feedback condition progressed more than their peers in the written feedback condition . In addition in the written feedback condition the majority of comments were mainly descriptive observations with a few prescriptive comments . On the other hand in the discussed oral feedback condition the comments were mostly suggestions .
