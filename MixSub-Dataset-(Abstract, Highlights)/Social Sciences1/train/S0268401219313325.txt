 Depression is one of the most common mental health problems worldwide . The diagnosis of depression is usually done by clinicians based on mental status questionnaires and patient s self reporting . Not only do these methods highly depend on the current mood of the patient but also people who experience mental illness are often reluctantly seeking help . Social networks have become a popular platform for people to express their feelings and thoughts with friends and family . With the substantial amount of data in social networks there is an opportunity to try designing novel frameworks to identify those at risk of depression . Moreover such frameworks can provide clinicians and hospitals with deeper insights about depressive behavioral patterns thereby improving diagnostic process . In this paper we propose a big data analytics framework to detect depression for users of social networks . In addition to syntactic and syntax features it focuses on pragmatic features toward modeling the intention of users . User intention represents the true motivation behind social network behaviors . Moreover since the behaviors of user s friends in the network are believed to have an influence on the user the framework also models the influence of friends on the user s mental states . We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on a massive real dataset obtained from Facebook and show that the framework outperforms existing methods for diagnosing user level depression in social networks .
