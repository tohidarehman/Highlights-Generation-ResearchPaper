 Analyzing test taking behavior allows researchers to investigate the steps and actions resulting in the specific test outcome . The underlying assumption is that test taking behavior is a valid indicator of the tested ability . The aim of this paper is to scrutinize this assumption in the context of complex problem solving by analyzing individual differences in test taking behavior and their relation to individual differences in established correlates of CPS ability . We investigated a sample of Finnish students who achieved the maximum score on five CPS tasks and worked on an additional intelligence measure . We logged the number of interactions with the CPS tasks and time on task . Students showed significant variance in both time on task

@highlight Test taking behavior in complex problem solving CPS tasks differs across test takers.
@highlight We scrutinize the assumption that test taking behavior is a valid indicator of ability.
@highlight Students showed significant variance in behavior even without variance in CPS test scores.
@highlight Behavior significantly predicted students GPA.
@highlight When adding intelligence the relation behavior and GPA was reduced to negligible effects.
