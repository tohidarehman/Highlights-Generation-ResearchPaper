 The goal of this study is to investigate how flow experience and diverse smartphone activities play a role in influencing people s perceived boredom during free time . Through a telephone survey data were gathered from a probability sample of 653 smartphone users . Results indicate that the more people who engage in pleasure seeking short lived and diversionary hedonic activities the stronger the feeling that their physical involvement is lacking . Eudaemonic activities such as information seeking significantly predicted a lack of meaningful involvement while utilities significantly predicted a perceived slowness of time and lack of mental involvement . Findings also revealed that people achieve flow state when they use a smartphone for entertainment information seeking and sociability especially when they feel bored sense a lack of meaningful involvement and want their free time to last . Furthermore the interaction effects found in the study provide a more nuanced view about the ways in which eudaemonic smartphone activities can interact with flow experience to regulate perceived boredom in free time . This study suggests that app designers should recognize the role of newly developed hedonic and eudaemonic functions of the smartphone which may significantly alleviate perceived boredom in free time .
