 Virtual reality is spreading rapidly as an emerging communication tool in organizations . The present research examines when and why leaders might prefer interacting with their subordinates virtually via computer avatars rather than through face to face interactions . We examine this question in the context of monitoring and seek to understand the underlying psychology that drives leaders preference for interacting via avatars . Across two experiments we tested our predictions that contexts that require frequent monitoring increase leaders preference for interacting via avatars and this preference is driven by concerns about negative social evaluation . Results supported our predictions indicating that contexts requiring frequent monitoring increase leaders preference for interacting via avatars and this effect was due to increased concerns about negative social evaluation . We also explored the role of personality on this effect . Theoretical implications for the psychology of leadership in the digital era and the adoption of novel technologies are discussed .

@highlight We examine when and why leaders use avatars vs. face to face to interact at work.
@highlight Leaders prefer interacting via computer avatars in frequent monitoring situations.
@highlight Anticipated concerns about negative evaluation drives this effect.
@highlight Typicality of frequent monitoring did not eliminate the effect.
@highlight We explore how personality factors influence leaders preference for avatars.
