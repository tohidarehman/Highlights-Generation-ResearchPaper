 In the high paced and dynamic clinical setting of an emergency department a physician s ability to manage mental resources and mitigate the effects of cognitive overload is critical to patient safety . Although the ability to regulate cognitive assets during crises is seen as the hallmark of expertise in a resuscitation setting the specific psychological strategies used by these domain experts and the patterns of their expression remain unknown . This study aims to combine traditional cognitive load rating scales with physiologic data from newer wearable devices to measure cognitive state of physician team leaders during real life resuscitations . Eye tracking galvanic skin response and heart rate measures were captured from five expert physicians during five trauma resuscitations . Physiologic measures were correlated with psychometric scores collected using a cued recall debriefing protocol . Results varied between participants and trials overall skin conductance response amplitude and frequency and eye tracking metrics showed the strongest correlation to Paas scores . Regression analysis revealed that a quadratic model is more representative of the psychometric physiologic relationship than a linear model for most measures . The findings of this experiment support existing evidence that multiple physiologic measures should be employed to most accurately measure cognitive load in a real world setting .

@highlight Physician cognitive load can be quantified during authentic trauma resuscitations.
@highlight Wearable sensors measured gaze pupil size galvanic skin response and heart rate.
@highlight Self reported cognitive load was assessed via 1st person video debriefing protocol.
@highlight Physiologic and psychometric metrics of cognitive load were variably correlated.
@highlight Integrating several physiologic markers more accurately quantifies cognitive load.
