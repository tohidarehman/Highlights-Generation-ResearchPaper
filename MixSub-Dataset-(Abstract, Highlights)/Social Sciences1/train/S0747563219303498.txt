 Research on technology usage and acceptance has demonstrated that women and men use technology differently and also differ in their self perception regarding technology . Gender role beliefs according to which women are expected to be less interested in and less capable of using technologies than men have been discussed as one major reason for these differences . Such differing attributions of women and men can induce negative experiences in terms of negative feelings and can reinforce the feelings of uncertainty experienced by women . We therefore assume that the usage of technology especially with increasing complexity may induce more negative experiences in women than in men . We conducted a 2 x 3 between subjects lab experiment
