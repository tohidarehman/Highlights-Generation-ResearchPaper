 This study aimed to determine the impact of consecutive boarding days on boarding school students academic achievement and social emotional competence . Data were collected from 6638 students in rural western China . Results showed that in general a break every 23 weeks had positive impacts while a break every 4 weeks or more had negative effects on school boarders . More specifically scheduled breaks that occur once a week or more frequently had more positive impacts on primary school boarders and a scheduled break every 23 weeks had more benefits for junior middle school boarders . Additionally taking a break every 23 weeks had more positive effects on both left behind children and those commuting daily between home and school but it played more positive role in the former . Therefore for boarding school managers and policy makers more attention should be paid to boarding schedules .
