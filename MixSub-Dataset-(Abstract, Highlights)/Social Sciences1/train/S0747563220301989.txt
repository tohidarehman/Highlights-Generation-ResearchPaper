 Mindset is believed to influence students learning outcomes but there is a paucity of research examining its relationship to students learning choices as a pathway to improving learning and performance . This study examines the relationships between mindset critical feedback seeking and learning . Undergraduate students at a University in Western Canada completed a mindset pre test played an online assessment game in which they designed three posters and completed a post test measuring their learning of graphic design principles . For each poster the game tracked students choices to seek confirmatory or critical feedback and to revise their posters as well as their poster performance . Findings show that the more the students seek critical feedback the more they revise their posters and the better they perform across the game . Theoretical implications resulting from mediation analyses indicate that revision fully explains the link between critical feedback seeking and performance . Moreover moderation analyses of mindset revealed differential results on the relationship between critical feedback seeking and learning depending on the conceptualization of the mindset construct . Implications of these results with regards to the conceptualization of mindset are discussed .

@highlight This study examines the relationships between mindset critical feedback seeking and learning.
@highlight Undergraduates n 155 completed a mindset pre test played a game and completed a post test measuring their learning.
@highlight Critical feedback seeking was positively associated with learning only for students who endorsed a strong growth mindset.
@highlight Theoretical implications indicate that revision fully explains the link between critical feedback seeking and performance.
@highlight Practical implications include interventions that focus on revising and cultivating a growth mindset to improve learning.
