 Smartphone use has become an always on activity . Caring for children and being sensitive to their needs seems to conflict with this immersive and time consuming activity . Building on John Bowlby s Attachment Theory we focused on how mothers smartphone use is related to maternal sensitivity . Using the Mini Maternal Behavior Q Sort method and a post observation questionnaire we collected data from 89 mother child dyads on playgrounds . Our results showed that mothers who used their smartphones longer had lower sensitivity ratings 0.51
