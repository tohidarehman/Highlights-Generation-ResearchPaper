 While school related gender based violence is increasingly on the agenda of international development agencies and national governments there is little evidence on the policy processes that can more effectively address violence . Drawing on data from studies conducted during an innovative three year action research project with UNICEF and governments in Ethiopia Togo Cte dIvoire and Zambia this paper explores the struggles of actors and organisations engaged in developing and implementing policies linked to SRGBV at national mid and local levels . We examine interlinked political conceptual and resource challenges that frequently hinder the multi dimensional work needed to respond to and prevent the many forms of everyday violence in girls and boys lives . Finally we explore the potential for strengthening government structures and networks across sectors and state and non state organisations that are able to support the creative work of school communities to recontextualise policies in order to generate more effective multi dimensional policy enactments .
