 Using a process component lens this paper decomposes an e business process into technical relational and business components . We then draw on resource orchestration theory to identify two managerial actions resources structuring and capabilities leveraging in using e business process components to explain how these three components work together to improve competitive performance in supply chain operations . Two interesting insights emerge from our empirical research corresponds to value creation mechanisms . First we identify the critical three portfolio effects to promote platform architecture flexibility and partner engagement to develop e business operations capabilities in three major e business processes . Second we reveal the transformation effect of EBOCs in different e business processes in obtaining competitive performance . The notion of portfolio and transformation mechanisms of e business process components offers theoretical and practical implications for developing successful digital supply chain platform .
