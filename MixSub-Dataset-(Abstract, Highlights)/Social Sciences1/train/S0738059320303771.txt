 Despite the significant role that teachers play in students education there is little consensus on whether teacher qualification indicators actually correspond to improved academic success by students . To better understand the role that teacher qualification plays this study examines the relationship between teachers qualifications and students educational attainment .

The results show that students who have been taught by multiple highly qualified teachers were more likely to earn higher level educational degrees . Considering teacher qualification will continue to play an integral role the findings from this study have significant implications for education policy across nations .
