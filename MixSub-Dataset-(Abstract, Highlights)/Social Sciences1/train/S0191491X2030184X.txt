 As society becomes increasingly digital teachers must be trained to integrate technology effectively into their classrooms . Teachers technological pedagogical knowledge as defined in the TPACK framework is considered an important prerequisite for effectively integrating technology . The TPACK framework has received a great deal of attention yet few knowledge tests have been developed that directly assess TPK . However those tests are crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of teacher education courses on technology integration . We have developed a 17 item test that covers teacher knowledge about various digital technologies as employed in teaching . Experts rated the items to represent the construct adequately . Data obtained from 245 pre service teachers supports the tests internal structure . Concerning convergent and discriminant validity the pre service teachers test scores were not related to their self reported TPK but to their self reported technological knowledge . The test was sensitive to changes in pre service teachers TPK through teacher education courses .

@highlight Development of knowledge test to measure pre service teachers TPK.
@highlight First evidence for the knowledge tests content and construct validity.
@highlight TPK test performance was related to self reported TK but not self reported TPK.
@highlight The knowledge test was sensitive to changes in pre service teachers TPK.
@highlight TPK knowledge test as important future supplement to TPK self report scales.
