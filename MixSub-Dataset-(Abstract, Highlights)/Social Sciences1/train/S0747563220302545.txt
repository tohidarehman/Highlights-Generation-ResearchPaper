 Sexting has been defined as sharing sexually suggestive content via Internet or smartphone . To date only a few studies investigated the role of personality traits in relation to sending or receiving sexts and most of them used the Five Factor Model of Personality .

Thus this is the first study that using a cross cultural perspective investigated HEXACO personality predictors of sexting behaviors considered as a multidimensional construct . A total of 5542 participants from 13 to 30 years old
