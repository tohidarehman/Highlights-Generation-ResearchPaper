 Although associations between problematic smartphone use or impaired functioning in different aspects of life due to excessive smartphone use and psychopathology are well established the body of research including objectively measured smartphone use is relatively small . In addition the majority of these studies relies on cross sectional self report data . Finally there are no studies investigating the effect of excessive smartphone use related notifications on self reported PSU and OMSU . The aim of the current study was to fill that gap . The effective sample comprised 73 people who were randomly assigned into one of three groups control active experimental or passive experimental . All groups filled out a PSU measure at Time 1 . Then active and passive experimental group used a smartphone use tracking application for three weeks . After receiving their data active experimental group received instructions for setting up their app so that it would prompt notifications based on their personal smartphone use patterns for the next month of smartphone use while smartphone use tracking for passive experimental group continued without prompting notifications . Finally all groups of participants were asked about their PSU again . Contrary to our expectations notifications regarding excessive smartphone use did not lower self reported PSU nor participants screen time or the frequency of phone checking behavior .

@highlight The aim was to examine the effect of pop up notifications on smartphone use.
@highlight Self reported problematic PSU and objectively measured smartphone use OMSU were DVs.
@highlight Three participant groups were measured over two months Time 1 Time 2 Time 3 .
@highlight Notifications regarding excessive smartphone use had no effect on PSU or OMSU.
