 This study investigated technostress among university students in technology enhanced learning from a multidimensional person environment misfit perspective technostress on the dimensions of person organization misfit person TEL misfit and person people misfit respectively . A research model was created to examine how the three dimensions of technostress were related to one another and how they predicted students burnout persistence in TEL and perceived performance . It was validated by 740 university students from two public universities in China . The findings show that PO misfit of technostress strongly predicted technostress on both P TEL misfit and PP misfit dimensions . PP misfit of technostress predicted P TEL misfit of technostress . The three dimensions of technostress were positively associated with students burnout which negatively affected their perceived performance in TEL . Moreover PO misfit of technostress demonstrated the most salient effect on students burnout . Additionally group comparisons based on gender and grade levels indicate that females and lower grade students were more susceptible to burnout associated with PP misfit of technostress than others . And female students performance tended to be more negatively affected by burnout than males . This study has important implications for disentangling factors affecting students wellbeing and academic success in TEL and developing effective solutions to technostress .

@highlight This study investigated technostress among university students in TEL.
@highlight A multidimensional P E misfit framework was developed to examine technostress.
@highlight Technostress on the dimension of PO misfit predicted other dimensions of misfit.
@highlight The multiple dimensions of P E misfit of technostress predicted students burnout.
@highlight Students burnout negatively predicted their perceived performance in TEL.
