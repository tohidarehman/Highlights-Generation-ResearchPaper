 This study utilized discourse based instruction as an alternative method of instruction that emphasizes the teaching of mathematics by actively engaging students in mathematical discourse practices . A quasi experimental study was employed to determine the effectiveness of mathematical discourse based instruction in enhancing eleventh grade students conceptual and procedural understanding of probability and statistics . A researcher constructed test instrument was used for data collection from the experimental and control groups . The data analysis performed using the Kruskal Wallis test showed that the experimental group outperformed the control groups in terms of conceptual and procedural knowledge . Furthermore the results suggest that discourse based instruction when appropriately designed and implemented can increase students understanding of mathematical topics .
