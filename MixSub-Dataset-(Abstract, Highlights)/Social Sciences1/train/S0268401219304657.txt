 Blockchain technology provides us a new tool to solve the product traceability problem in supply chain management . This research focuses on the cross border e commerce context to propose a blockchain based framework and develop a set of corresponding techniques and methods for achieving traceable products and transactions in supply chain management . A general blockchain based product traceability framework is introduced . This framework is based on a cross border e commerce supply chain context incorporating a series of blockchain based models including multi chain structure model data management model and block structure model . Several core methods and algorithms are also developed such as information anchoring method key distribution method information encryption algorithm and anti counterfeiting method . The framework models and methods form a complete and comprehensive solution which are evaluated by applying to several typical problems and attack cases . The case analysis results show that the framework models and methods can successfully deal with key recover problem and protect against clone attack counterfeit tag attack and counterfeit product attack . The effectiveness extendibility security implementation and governance issues of applying these solutions are also discussed . This research contributes to the theoretical and practical literatures on blockchain technology cross border e commerce and supply chain management research fields .

@highlight Focusing on the context of cross border e commerce supply chain a blockchain based product information traceability framework is proposed.
@highlight A novel multi chain structure model for blockchain system design is provided.
@highlight A Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet technique is introduced into the key distribution method in the system.
@highlight The product traceability tag scheme proposed can effectively achieve the verification of tag source tag information and tag ownership.
