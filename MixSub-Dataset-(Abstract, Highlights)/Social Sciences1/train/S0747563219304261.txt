 Currently little is known about how creativity is expressed in digital entertainment games or what specific design elements may foster it . Using a qualitative methodology this article reports on the findings of 24 semi structured interviews and 14 narrative surveys with regular players of different types of digital games . Using a hybrid thematic approach to analysis involving both deductive and inductive phases three main categories relating to the expressivity of creativity were discovered and one category relating to the specific game design considerations which give rise to such creative opportunities . Creativity was found to be expressed in terms of creative problem solving involving the creation of novel strategies solutions and approaches to problems in terms of appropriation involving emergent play practices and how gameplay was adapted for alternative goals and finally in terms of affective change involving the personally meaningful insights and changes in attitudes perceptions which games elicited . Design considerations were also identified relating to freedom of play environment replayability tools avatar design and content creation . By shedding light on the grey area of creativity in digital games and illuminating how games may support and promote creativity in players this article provides a basis for future research and can help inform game design practices in both digital entertainment games and games specifically designed to facilitate creativity .
