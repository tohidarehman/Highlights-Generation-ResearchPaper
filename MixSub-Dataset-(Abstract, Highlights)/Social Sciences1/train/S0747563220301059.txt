 When searching for new information do people focus their search on places not yet discovered by others or on places that others also focus on Through a controlled experiment we investigated heuristic rules that people adopt in social information search a growing characteristic of how people find information in this hyperconnected world . Three people were connected online to simultaneously search for specific objects in multiple images under either a cooperative or a competitive setting . They were provided with information about the current number of objects collected and the cumulative time spent on each image . People used such information to decide when to stop the current search and which image to explore next . Further people paid more attention to others and distribute search efforts when cooperating compared to when competing against others . Our findings highlight the heuristic rules that people adopt when searching in groups for new information .
