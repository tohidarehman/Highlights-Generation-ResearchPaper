 This paper studies the influence of parental involvement in the educational process on the educational achievements of Russian students and their educational strategies such as studying in high school and successful admission to university . We argue that the patterns of parental involvement represent a link between the formal and informal educational institutions and can have a beneficial effect on academic performance and contribute to the choice of the educational pathway to higher education . Based on data from the longitudinal study Trajectories in Education and Careers it was shown that the results of school state examinations are positively associated with the active participation of parents in school meetings the employment of tutors and the provision of additional literature for the child . A negative relationship was found between homework control and student success . In general the factor of rational involvement is positively associated with educational achievement and educational choice which may indicate the non linear nature of the relationship . Parental involvement itself depends on the family characteristics such as mothers education family income and the number of books at home . In addition family has a positive impact on educational success and educational strategies and high school characteristics are especially important for the results of the Unified State Exam and the university choice .
