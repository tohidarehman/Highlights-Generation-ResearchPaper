 In this paper we address the problem of maximizing the influence in a social network by hiring a few users in the network to propagate the information . Considering limited budget and time hired users are activated dynamically at different time intervals over a time horizon . This motivates to avoid the same seed activation in consecutive time intervals that leads to deteriorating the seeds efficiency . The aim of this paper is to maximize the total gain obtained in the process of maximizing the influence in a social network . Total gain is obtained by earning of influencing the customers and then deducting the cost incurred for influencing the users . Therefore an improvised memetic algorithm is developed to find the seeds that are to be activated at different time intervals to maximize the gain . Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and it is found to perform better in identifying the potential seeds with minimum expenditure .

@highlight Maximizing the gain obtained that includes unrealized and the cost incurred to execute the proposed strategy.
@highlight Hiring the seeds to propagate the information in a considered network within limited time period and budget.
@highlight Considering information retention and effectiveness reduction over the time intervals while maximizing the influence.
