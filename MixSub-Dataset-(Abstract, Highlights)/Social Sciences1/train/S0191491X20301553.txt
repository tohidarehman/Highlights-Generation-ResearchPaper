The tool was evaluated through teacher interviews student focus groups and FEET booklet document analysis . The results showed that the FEET components achieved the theoretical aims of enhancing student engagement with feedback on their writing although not to the same extent for all students . Students in the trial who reported positive experiences with the FEET used it as intended indicating the FEETs potential to enhance student engagement with feedback . The results highlight various potential future modifications and procedural aspects to consider in future FEET use .
