 Flipping the classroom is a didactical approach aimed at letting students come to class prepared and apply the learning material actively during class . As FTC places a higher demand on students self regulated learning skills our goal in the current study was to research the effects of SRL support in a flipped classroom on students SRL and learning outcomes . Previous research showed that video embedded SRL prompts enhances students SRL and learning outcomes . We measured the effects of SRL prompts with a quasi experimental design in six flipped History classrooms in secondary education where 154 students were randomly assigned to the SRL prompts or no SRL prompt condition . We found positive effects of the SRL prompts for the completion rate of the instructional videos but not for other indicators of SRL or learning outcomes . Thus in contrast to previous research from higher education our results show that implementing SRL prompts in a flipped classroom is not directly effective in secondary education . We address potential explanations for the absence of effects of the SRL prompts for theory and practice into SRL support in flipped classrooms .

@highlight The effect of SRL prompts in videos was investigated in flipped classrooms in secondary education.
@highlight A positive effect of the SRL prompts was found on the completion rate of the instructional videos.
@highlight No effects were found on other indicators of SRL self reports and log data or learning outcomes.
@highlight Students were generally satisfied with the flipped classroom learning environment.
