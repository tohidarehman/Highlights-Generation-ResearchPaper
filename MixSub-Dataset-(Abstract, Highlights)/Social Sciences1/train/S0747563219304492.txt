 This study aimed at investigating whether Computational Thinking Perspectives can foster Computational Identity among primary school students in programming learning from the perspective of situated learning theory . This study conceptualized CT perspectives as a multidimensional construct that comprises ability to connect ability to question and ability to express and CI with four subcomponents including programming affiliation programming engagement programming actualization and programming goal setting . Students who received at least 6 month programming training for computational thinking development were invited to participate in this study . Results of Confirmatory Factor Analysis suggested that the CT perspectives instrument and CI instrument reached good fit and therefore were validated in the pilot study . In the main study survey answers including CT perspectives and CI were collected . Results of Structural Equation Modeling showed positive relationships between CT perspectives and CI formation among primary school students . Mediation results further revealed that ability to question can foster CI formation through ability to express while ability to connect can directly foster CI formation . Implications were discussed at the end of the study .

@highlight Learning visual programming contributes to positive learning outcomes.
@highlight CT perspectives facilitated by visual programming contribute to CI formation.
@highlight Young learners willingness to connect with peers is positively related to CI formation.
@highlight Young learners willingness to express with programming artifacts is positively related to CI formation.
@highlight Young learners willingness to question is positively related to CI formation only if they are willing to express.
