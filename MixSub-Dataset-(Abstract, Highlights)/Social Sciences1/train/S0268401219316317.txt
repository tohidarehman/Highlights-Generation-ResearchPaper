 Considerable research has focused on information system success over the years largely using the models proposed by DeLone and McLean in 1992 and 2003 . Several relationships found in the DM models have been sporadically supported in empirical research although the complete DM models have not been consistently applied . Studies have also interchanged relationships in the 1992 and 2003 models tested relationships between ISS dimensions unspecified in the DM models and examined relationships between ISS dimensions and other factors . This study presents a critical meta review of 53 studies using DM models published between 1992 and 2019 identifies the state of ISS research and raises several directions for research .

@highlight DeLone and McLean success models have not been applied consistently.
@highlight This meta review examined 53 prior studies published between 1992 and 2019.
@highlight Dimensionality and interdependence of success dimensions may need attention.
@highlight Scope of reciprocal relationships in success models could need reconsideration.
@highlight Nomological net for examining information systems success could be crucial.
