 The popularity of online learning is growing exponentially . Accordingly it is critical to understand how we can facilitate the learning experience for users in these unique online environments . Past research consistently finds that one important antecedent of online learning outcomes is social presence . However there is limited research related to how to foster social presence perceptions among users . Further research has yet to understand whether there are boundary conditions for the positive effects of social presence perceptions on user outcomes . The current work describes two studies to address these questions . The first study uses an experimental design to investigate how the perception of social presence can be increased in the online learning context . In the second study we investigate the degree to which social presence perceptions are more beneficial for some individuals versus others . Specifically we consider two personality traits as moderators of the relationships between social presence perceptions and two outcomes perceived learning and satisfaction . Overall the results of these two studies provide important insights into how to enhance user outcomes in online learning and training environments .
