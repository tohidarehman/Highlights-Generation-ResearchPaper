 History shows that pandemics can catalyse enormous change fundamentally transforming the way people make sense of the world . Technologies can also be catalysts of change . While digital technologies are playing a vital role in tackling the covid 19 pandemic the pandemic also presents a significant opportunity for digital technologies . Some experts believe the pandemic may permanently normalise the comprehensive societal use of digital technologies . This article casts a critical eye over the potential implications of this opportunity in the context of information systems research and development . We introduce and outline selected principles of Zygmunt Baumans theory of liquid modernity . We then apply the liquid modern principles to illustrative examples drawn from the covid 19 literature by focussing on three areas of established information systems interest control big data and information privacy . We show that traditional conceptualisations of scientific and societal order and control need to be reassessed that big data alone can not order clear and safe paths out of the current crisis and that information privacy regulations are irrelevant when undermined or circumvented by public and private actors . We conclude by making four recommendations for IS pandemic researchers and five practical recommendations in the context of the pandemic .
