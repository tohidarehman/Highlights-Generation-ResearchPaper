 This study examines the possible change in cognitive processes and geographical knowledge requirements during the digitalisation process of the Finnish Matriculation Examination in Geography . The theoretical background is derived from revised Blooms taxonomy which is applied as a framework for the content analysis of the questions of the geography tests between the autumn of 2013 and the spring of 2019 . The results show that the questions mainly require an understanding of conceptual and factual knowledge . Because of the digitalisation questions that require remembering have been reduced whereas questions that require analysing have been increased . In addition more comprehensive use and more extensive production of materials are required in the tests . Based on our research findings we emphasise the need for a careful re evaluation of the kind of cognitive processes and knowledge that should be assessed in geography tests both nationally and internationally .

@highlight Using revised bloom s taxonomy as a analysing framework for assessment of geography.
@highlight The cognitive processes of understanding analysing and remembering are emphasised.
@highlight Conceptual and factual geographical knowledge is valued.
@highlight Minor differences between the paper based and the digital forms of the tests.
@highlight Need for dialogue between institutions of the knowledge and skills assessed.
