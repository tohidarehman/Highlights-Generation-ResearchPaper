 Many studies have found a link between time spent using social media and mental health issues such as depression and anxiety . However the existing research is plagued by cross sectional research and lacks analytic techniques examining individual change over time . The current research involves an 8 year longitudinal study examining the association between time spent using social media and depression and anxiety at the intra individual level . Participants included 500 adolescents who completed once yearly questionnaires between the ages of 13 and 20 . Results revealed that increased time spent on social media was not associated with increased mental health issues across development when examined at the individual level . Hopefully these results can move the field of research beyond its past focus on screen time .

@highlight Time spent using social media was not related to individual changes in depression or anxiety over 8 years.
@highlight This lack of a relationship was found even in the transition between adolescence and emerging adulthood.
@highlight Results were not stronger for girls or boys.
