 Drawing upon the causal agency theory this study examined the direct and indirect links between positivity and quality of college life of business students in a transitioning market Vietnam . Two studies were conducted to test these relationships using structural equation modeling . Findings from study 1 based on a sample of 428 business students showed that positivity was positively related to QCL . Further deep learning approaches mediated the relationship between positivity and QCL . Findings from study 2 based on a sample of 416 business students reconfirmed the role of positivity in QCL . However the indirect relationship between positivity and QCL was not significant demonstrating that surface learning approaches did not mediate the relationship between positivity and QCL . The findings contribute to the literature on positivity in higher education by confirming the overarching role that positivity plays directly and indirectly in QCL .
