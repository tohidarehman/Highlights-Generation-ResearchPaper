 Do teaching awards affect the growth in income of teachers recognized for excellence Our study is one of the firsts to use income as the primary indicator of success when evaluating the impact of an award . Taking the case of Metrobank Foundation Award for Outstanding Teachers in the Philippines our analysis reveals that the award had a higher impact on the income of winners who were in the middle of their career when they received the award . This implies that timing as to when an award is received matters . Relatively younger winners in their mid career have more years in their professional career to capitalize on the award .
