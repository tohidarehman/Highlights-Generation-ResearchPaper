 The emotional design hypothesis states that features in digital learning materials can elicit emotional reactions . Voice related cues such as enthusiastic accentuations are getting more into the focus of research .

One hundred eighteen participants were assigned to one cell of a two two factorial between subjects design . Regarding the multiple choice learning test results revealed that learners with a neutral agent voice performed better in a high load condition while learners exposed to an enthusiastic voice reached higher learning scores in a low load condition . However this moderating effect of mental load could not be shown for open answer questions .

@highlight Induced mental load moderates the effect of emotions on learning.
