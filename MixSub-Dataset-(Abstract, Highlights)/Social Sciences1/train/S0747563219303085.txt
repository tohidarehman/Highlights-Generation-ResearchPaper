 To understand the impact of learner metacognition and goal orientation on problem solving this study investigated 159 undergraduate students metacognition goal orientations and their problem solving performances and processes in a laboratory setting using a Serious Game environment that adopts problem based learning pedagogy to teach space science . Utilizing cluster analysis multiple regression similarity measure and data visualization this study analyzed multiple data sources including computer log data problem solving performance scores and survey data . The results show that both learner metacognition and goal orientation affected problem solving . The findings of this study offer insights of how learner characteristics impact on problem solving in SG environments with PBL pedagogy . It also contributes to understanding the design of SG environments to benefit learners based on their metacognitive levels .

@highlight Computer log data was used to analyze leaner problem solving process.
@highlight Similarity measure was used to analyze sequence pattern.
@highlight Learner metacognition affected learner problem solving in a serious game.
@highlight Learner goal orientation affected learner problem solving in a serious game.
@highlight Dunning Kruger effect and problem complexity could be the possible explanation forlearner problem solving differences.
