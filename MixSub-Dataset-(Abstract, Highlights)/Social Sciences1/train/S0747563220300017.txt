 This research explored how a new platform of advergames functions to communicate prosocial initiatives . A 2 2 between subject factorial design was employed in an online experiment . A mobile advergame with four conditions was specifically developed as study stimuli . A total of 131 undergraduate student subjects were asked to play an advergame in one of the four conditions and subsequently redirected to an online survey that measured advergame effectiveness . Findings showed that those who played an advergame with a prosocial narrative responded more favorably toward both the game and the company embedded in the game than those who played an advergame without a prosocial narrative . Further findings revealed that this relationship was mediated by the level of game engagement . In addition this study found an interaction effect of advergame narratives and company placement on consumer response . In the advergame with a prosocial narrative participants exposed to a prominently placed company logo evaluated the company more favorably than those exposed to a subtly placed logo did . By comparison in the advergame without a prosocial narrative evaluation of the company was more positive in a subtly placed condition than in a prominently placed condition . Implications and suggestions for future research were discussed .

@highlight A prosocial advergame led to more favorable response toward the game and the company than a non prosocial advergame.
@highlight Game engagement mediated the relationship between advergame narratives and consumer response.
@highlight In the prosocial advergame prominent placement led to more favorable company evaluation than subtle placement.
@highlight In the non prosocial advergame subtle placement led to more favorable company evaluation than prominent placement.
