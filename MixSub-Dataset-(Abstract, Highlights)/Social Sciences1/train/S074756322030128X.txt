 Problematic Internet and smartphone usage among adolescents has become an alarming social problem . Previous research suggests a detrimental effect of Internet and smartphone problematic use on psychological adjustment . Therefore it is important to identify protective factors that may ameliorate these deleterious mental health consequences . We examined emotional intelligence as a potential moderator in the association between problematic Internet and smartphone use and suicide ideation in a sample of 2196 Spanish adolescents . Results showed that problematic Internet and smartphone use was significantly associated with suicide ideation . Emotional intelligence scores were negatively associated with both problematic Internet and smartphone use and suicide ideation . Finally results of moderation analyses indicated that emotional intelligence moderates the negative link between problematic Internet and smartphone use and suicide risk . Specifically a weaker association between problematic Internet and smartphone usage and suicidal ideation was found among adolescents with higher emotional intelligence . These findings reinforce the notion that emotional intelligence might be a protective factor in adolescents helping them to reduce the negative symptoms associated to problematic Internet and smartphone use . Implications of these findings for the prevention of psychological maladjustment associated to Internet and smartphone problematic usage in adolescents are discussed .
