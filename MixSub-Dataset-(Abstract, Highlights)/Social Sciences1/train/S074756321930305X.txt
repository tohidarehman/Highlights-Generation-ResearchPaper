 Research has shown that multitasking in classrooms negatively impacts students academic performance . This study investigated the indirect effects of multitasking on academic performance through self efficacy for self regulated learning in males and females . Measures of multitasking behaviors in both online and traditional format classrooms and SESRL were administered to university students . Two simple mediation and moderated mediation models were tested . The simple mediation analysis indicated that SESRL fully mediated the relationship between multitasking behaviors and GPA in F2F classes and partially mediated this relationship in online classes . Evidence of moderated mediation effect was only found in online classes suggesting that there was a significant indirect effect for female students only . Female students with higher levels of SESRL experience a limited impact of online multitasking on GPA resulting in better academic performance .
