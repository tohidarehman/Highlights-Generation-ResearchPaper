 With the main goal of identifying the process factors associated with school effectiveness in secondary education this work presents an innovative methodological proposal . Based on secondary data from the Spanish sample of PISA 2015 high and low effectiveness schools were selected by analysing the residuals of the school level in multilevel models . Subsequently decision trees were used to identify the process variables with a greater predictive power for the identification of high and low effectiveness schools . While the hierarchical linear models obtained show inter school variance scores greater than 10 decision trees achieve a precision greater than 90 . We conclude by analysing the suitability of using decision trees in data originating from large scale assessments and examining the obtained factors associated with school effectiveness .

@highlight Decision trees enable the detection of factors that predict school effectiveness.
@highlight The predictive model is more accurate for low effectiveness schools.
@highlight A single negative factor at school escalates the risk of low effectiveness.
