 This study examined the relationships between university mathematics classroom environments mathematics beliefs and achievement in the context of mainland China . As a type of affect in mathematics learning mathematics beliefs including mathematics conceptions and efficacy were examined as mediators . Based on analysis of a sample of 1443 undergraduate students from a university in northern China the study not only found that the mathematics classroom environment was associated with both affective and cognitive mathematics outcomes but also confirmed the mediating role of mathematics beliefs . Specifically a desirable classroom environment was related to students cohesive conceptions enhanced self efficacy and higher mathematics achievement . In contrast students perceived difficulty of learning mathematics was connected to their fragmented conceptions reduced self efficacy and lower mathematics achievement . Implications of the study are discussed .
