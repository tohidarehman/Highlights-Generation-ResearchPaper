 Having a literate society has been a policy objective of the Rwandan Government for 20 years . However in practice it has never been a high priority although investing in adult literacy education has the potential to contribute to socio economic transformation . This paper reports on findings from a survey key informant interviews and focus group discussions . We show that learners rarely benefit from attending literacy classes . Extreme poverty lack of a culture of reading and the poor delivery of literacy classes are the main barriers to student learning . Without more investment in training tutors infrastructure and learning resources the policy implementation gap will persist .
