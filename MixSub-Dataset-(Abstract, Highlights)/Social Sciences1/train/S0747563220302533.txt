 Little is known about the development of early screen use patterns . Using data from 1949 families in Calgary Alberta drawn from the All Our Families cohort this study examined patterns of screen use across 3 time points to identify trajectories of screen use socio demographic factors that predict trajectory membership and whether high use trajectories relate to suboptimal child behavior and learning outcomes . Mothers reported on children s screen use children s behavior problems and developmental milestones . Using latent class growth modeling two trajectories were identified low to moderate screen use and high persistent screen use . A number of socio demographic factors were associated with the high persistent screen use trajectory . Additionally the high persistent screen use trajectory was associated with higher levels of externalizing behavior poor adaptive skills and less likelihood of achievement of developmental milestones at 60 months of age . Findings support that screen use patterns are formed early in childhood emphasizing the need for prevention and early intervention .

@highlight Screen use patterns are formed early in childhood.
@highlight Many factors in the family environment relate to screen use patterns.
@highlight High screen users across early childhood have poorer developmental outcomes.
@highlight Families are encouraged to engage with technology in an age appropriate way.
