 The study aimed to explore the washback mechanism on learning by investigating the structural relationship between learners perceptions of a test learning practices and learning outcomes via structural equation modeling . The participants in this study included 3105 Chinese senior high school students . Exploratory factor analysis confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were used in the analyses of the data . This study found that learners perceptions of test validity impact and importance affected their learning practices in different ways and to different degrees . The research results also showed that four types of English learning practices had significant positive but differential effects on learning outcomes . The effect size was partly associated with the frequency of engagement with each learning practice . Based on the findings some implications and suggestions were drawn for learners teachers test designers and test authorities .
