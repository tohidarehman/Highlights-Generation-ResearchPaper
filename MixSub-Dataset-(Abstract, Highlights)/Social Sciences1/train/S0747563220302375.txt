 Cyberbullying victimization is an international phenomenon and is increasing globally at a high rate . However studies have shown inconsistent findings for the definition measurement and prevalence of cyberbullying victimization and perpetration . To provide an overview of the existing scales and to suggest ways to standardize the cyberbullying measurement this study analyzed sixty four international studies on cyberbullying measurements using the following categories general characteristics definition of cyberbullying study sample characteristics sample size type of device or social media time frame survey type item pooling method subscales reliability and validity . Regarding the definition of cyberbullying 46 of the 64 studies explained the concept of cyberbullying . Furthermore only 15 studies followed the recommended guidelines either fully or partially when developing their scale . Although most of the cyberbullying instruments revealed moderate to high reliability only half of the studies assessed the validity of the cyberbullying measurements with a high portion of them testing the construct validity . Our findings address the need for a consistent and standardized definition of cyberbullying to use worldwide which may be the most important factor in measuring cyberbullying behaviors .
