 This study aimed to develop an instrument for assessing kindergarteners mathematics problem solving by using cognitive diagnostic assessment . A total of 747 children were recruited to examine the psychometric properties of the cognitive diagnostic test . The results showed that the classification accuracy of 11 cognitive attributes ranged from .68 to .99 with the average being .84 . Both the cognitive diagnostic test score and the average mastery probabilities of the 11 cognitive attributes had moderate correlations with the Applied Problem subtest and the Calculation subtest of the WoodcockJohnson IV Tests of Achievement . Moreover the correlation between the cognitive diagnostic test and the Applied Problems subtest was higher than that between the cognitive diagnostic test and the Calculation subtest . The results indicated that the formal cognitive diagnostic test was a reliable instrument for assessing kindergarteners MPS in the domain of number and operations .
