 In medical training allowing learners to take pauses during tasks is known to enhance performance . Cognitive load theory assumes that insertion of pauses positively affects cognitive load thereby enhancing performance . However empirical studies on how allowing and taking pauses affects cognitive load and performance in dynamic task environments are scarce . We investigated the pause effect using a computerized simulation game in emergency medicine . Medical students

@highlight The nature of pausing in nonlinear tasks is different from that in linear tasks.
@highlight Allowing pauses increases overall cognitive load probably due to self regulation.
@highlight Without instructions taking actual pauses does not affect overall cognitive load.
@highlight In intense situations cognitive load during pauses decreases temporarily.
@highlight Cognitive load during pauses differs by activities e.g. reflection relaxation.
