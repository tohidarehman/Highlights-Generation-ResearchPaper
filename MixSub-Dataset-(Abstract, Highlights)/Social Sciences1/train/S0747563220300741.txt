 Despite Social Networking Sites having a minimum age of 13 younger adolescents are using them . In this study we examine self reported overall SNS use and SNS use if awake at night in relation to Health Related Quality of Life and behaviour in 5229 adolescents aged 1112 in the Study of Cognition Adolescents and Mobile Phones cohort . Two thirds of the study population used SNS . Weekday and weekend SNS use on mobile phones and other devices was significantly associated with lower HRQOL in females but not males . Using SNS if awake at night was also significantly associated with lower HRQOL in females . Higher SNS use on mobile phones and other devices was associated with increased behavioural difficulties in both genders . Similarly SNS use if awake at night was associated with greater behavioural difficulties . We recommend further longitudinal research in this area in order have a better understanding of the direction of relationships between SNS and wellbeing and behaviour in adolescents .
