 Action video game play as a form of cognitive training shows promise but has not been widely tested with participants exclusively over age 80 years . Age related decline in executive function produces widely varying levels of ability to function independently . This study aimed to examine the change in executive functioning after a 3 week action video game intervention in healthy adults aged 8097 years living in residential care . Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental or care as usual control group experimental participants played

@highlight Short video game play influences executive function in oldest old.
@highlight Participants aged 8097 years were cognitively healthy living in residential care.
