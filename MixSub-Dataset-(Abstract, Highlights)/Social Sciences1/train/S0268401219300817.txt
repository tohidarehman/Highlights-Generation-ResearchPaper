 To develop highly competitive products companies need to understand customer needs by effectively gathering and analysing customer data . With the advances in Information Technology customer data comes not only from surveys and focus groups but also from social media and networking sites . Few studies have focused on developing algorithms that are devised exclusively to help to understand customer needs from big opinion data . Topic mining aspect based sentiment analysis and word embedding are some of the techniques adopted to identify CNs from text data . However most of them do not consider the possibility that part of the customer data analysed is already known by companies . With the aim to continuously enhance company understanding of CNs this paper presents an autonomous methodology for automatically classifying a set of text data as referring to known or unknown CN statements by the company . For verification purposes an example regarding a set of customer answers from an open survey questionnaire regarding the climate system of a car is illustrated . Results indicate that the proposed methodology helps companies to validate and update the customer need database with an average of 90 precision and 60 recall .

@highlight Existing studies often treat the set of input text data equally independently of referring to already known or unknown customer information by company members.
@highlight The proposed semi autonomous methodology classifies a set of sentences as known or unknown information based on existing company knowledge about customer needs CNs .
@highlight A guideline for how to represent company knowledge about already known CNs is provided.
@highlight Results highlight the possibility for companies to identify new customer information as well as to validate and update their knowledge about already known CNs.
