Given the possibility that Internet users can confront a rebuttal when they are not even aware of the rumor this paper takes into account the role of exposure sequence as a moderator . Data were collected from 322 social media users in a between participants experiment which manipulated the exposure sequence . Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data . Perceived message properties were positively associated with perceived utilitarian and hedonic values both of which were positively related to rebuttal acceptance . Exposure sequence significantly moderated the underlying mechanism of rebuttal acceptance . This paper contributes to the online rebuttal literature by examining how individuals respond to rebuttals in terms of intention to believe and share such messages . It also has implications for practitioners and other Internet users .
