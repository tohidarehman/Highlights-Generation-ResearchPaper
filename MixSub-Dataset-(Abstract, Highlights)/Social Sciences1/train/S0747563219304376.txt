 The present study employed a real life speed dating methodology with three conditions a face to face condition a video mediated communication condition without eye contact and a VMC condition with eye contact . The first aim of this study was to investigate the effect of eye contact on the development of romantic attraction . Second this study analysed the role of four interactive uncertainty reduction strategies in the relationship between eye contact and romantic attraction namely self disclosure and question asking . The results revealed no direct effect of eye contact on romantic attraction . Moreover there were more self disclosures in conditions with eye contact but fewer questions asked . These findings suggest that communication conditions with eye contact result in less information seeking behaviour in terms of question asking . However people share more personal intimate information about themselves to their interaction partner . Conclusively eye contact in initial interactions induces less uncertainty and more intimacy compared to interactions without eye contact .

@highlight The availability for eye contact in communication conditions does not impact romantic attraction in initial interactions.
@highlight Communication with eye contact is more nonverbally expressive as it enhances intimate self disclosure.
@highlight In communication conditions without eye contact people ask more intimate questions to reduce uncertainty.
@highlight Communication without eye contact results in more information seeking behaviour and less intimate interaction conditions.
