 The World Banks Human Capital Index aims to provide new information regarding future productivity of each countrys workforce by synchronizing available International Large Scale Assessment and regional test program results . Linking the literature on ILSA participation this study questions the problematic nature of this approach and revisits the comparability issue of ILSA results . We find that education systems are imposed upon a score penalty depending on which ILSA or regional test program they choose to partake in . In particular our results show that test overlap systems used in the score synchronization procedure are systematically different from systems that only choose to participate in one ILSA or exclusively in regional tests inter test score exchange rate is volatile due to sampling design and cohort effects test participation type alone accounts for about 57.8 percent of the variation in synchronized scores and the score penalty is especially salient for systems that exclusively participate in regional test programs the majority of which are low income and lower middle income countries . Findings in this study show how various intra and extrapolations to compensate for missing data in effect introduce large score penalties for systems that either did not participate or only partially participated in ILSAs . Finally this study contributes to research on reasons for participation in ILSAs and the global rise of test based accountability reform under which the World Banks new HCI may be seen as a tool to incentivize participation in ILSAs by penalizing those governments that have chosen alternative non standardized paths for measuring learning outcomes of students .

@highlight This study examines the World Banks Human Capital Index and finds that through intra and extrapolation of ILSAs a penalty is imposed upon systems that are partial or non participants.
@highlight Findings show that the Banks HCI calculation is highly dependent on the list of systems that are overlapped across ILSA programs however because test objective sampling design and cohort effects are not accounted for in this approach results are volatile and not robust.
@highlight Systems that partially participate in ILSA are found to expect 2837 points or about 1 full year of learning lower on the Banks harmonized scale relative to full ILSA participation.
