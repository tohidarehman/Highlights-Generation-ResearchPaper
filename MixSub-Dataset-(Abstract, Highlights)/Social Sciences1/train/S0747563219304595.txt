 Although reward based crowdfunding projects have experienced high growth in recent years it is necessary to emphasize that not all the campaigns have success . Under these circumstances this paper studies the influence of two potential funders motivations on their behavioral intentions . It also explores how the effect of these motivations is moderated by two campaign characteristics the percentage of target capital pledged and the time remaining until the funding deadline . With this aim this paper simulates a crowdfunding project and collects 311 survey responses about it . Subsequently a PLS SEM approach is applied to test the model proposed . Findings demonstrate that potential funders intentions are mainly influenced by their attachment to the project . For its part the business viability as perceived by potential funders plays a secondary role mainly influencing their word of mouth intentions . Finally the campaign characteristics moderate the effect of attachment and viability on electronic word of mouth intentions .
