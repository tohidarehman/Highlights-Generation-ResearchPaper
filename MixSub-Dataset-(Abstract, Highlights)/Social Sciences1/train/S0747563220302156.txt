 With a growing prevalence of social media use worldwide where individuals share varying aspects of their lives this paper focuses on how individuals with a chronic illness use these communications platforms to discuss their health . This paper aims to provide a qualitative approach to understanding the connection between the technical features offered by Facebook Twitter and Instagram and the therapeutic affordances experienced . Semi structured interviews were carried out with 38 participants living with Inflammatory Bowel Disease who use Facebook Twitter and or Instagram for health related support . Interview transcripts were analysed systematically to draw connections between platform features and therapeutic affordances . The interview data was thematically coded through an adapted SCENA Model to infer therapeutic affordances while content analysis identified the technical features discussed . Our findings indicate that most participants use more than one social media platform for health related discourse and that features on the platforms offer different therapeutic affordances . Facebook Groups privacy settings affording self presentation as individuals feel comforted that other people can not see what they post while hashtags afford connectivity on Twitter and Instagram but not on Facebook . This approach enabled the authors to identify similarities and differences between social media platforms and their technical features .
