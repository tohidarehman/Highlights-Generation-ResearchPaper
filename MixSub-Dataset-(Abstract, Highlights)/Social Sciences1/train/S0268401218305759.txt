 Organizations considering green IT initiatives seek to reconcile two significant goals environmental sustainability and business profitability . These two purposes however are not necessarily aligned and can engender a dilemma in which investing to achieve environmental sustainability may threaten business profitability to some extent . Thus this research builds on the theoretical perspective of corporate ecological responsiveness and proposes three types of strategic drivers for green IT initiatives . How various types of organizations may be motivated by these green IT initiative drivers will affect whether organizations can reconcile the objectives of environmental sustainability and business profitability . We further deduce findings from multiple case studies of eight organizations in China and Singapore . The findings illustrate that the characteristics of any given organization influence why various driving factors affect their green IT initiative decisions . Additionally doing good and doing well are reconciled when organizations consider the short term investment and long term benefit design appropriate strategy and receive severe external pressure . We also discuss contributions to research and practice .
