 Personal interviews are widely used to collect open ended data in an array of settings many of which require solicitation of data that may be regarded as sensitive or threatening by interviewees . The high costs of employing human interviewers can be mitigated by utilizing computer generated human like interviewers at least in scripted interview conditions . However the effects of replacing humans with human like interviewers on interviewees level of actual disclosure has not been well researched . This experiment compared disclosure of sensitive information obtained from personal interviews utilizing various interviewer modes . One hundred and fifty eight students from a southwestern university were randomly assigned to answer a series of open ended questions in one of three different personal interview modes 1 audio only computer assisted self interview 2 human like embodied conversational agent or 3 a human interviewer . Disclosure was measured using both self report and objective scores derived from trained judges . Disclosure levels were significantly higher in the faceless ACASI condition than in the combined virtual and human interviewer conditions both of which were embodied with a face . There was no significant difference between the ECA and human interviewer conditions . This suggests that the mere presence of a human face can inhibit disclosure .

@highlight Presence of a human or human like face decreases sensitive information disclosure.
@highlight No significant difference in disclosure to human or embodied conversational agent.
@highlight Choice to not disclose is often manifest by providing an irrelevant answer to the question.
@highlight No evidence that computerized interviewers perform worse than human interviewers.
