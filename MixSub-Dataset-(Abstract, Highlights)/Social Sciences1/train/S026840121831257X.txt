 With information technology increasingly penetrating in workplaces employee satisfaction with workplace IT becomes an integral part of work and significantly influences work related outcomes . Scant attention however has been paid to whether and how employees IT satisfaction plays a role in generating job related attitudinal changes among employees . Drawing upon satisfaction spillover theory we developed and empirically tested a model to examine the relationship between individual satisfaction with workplace IT and job satisfaction . Specifically we introduced two elements of user task technology fitnamely job fit and professional fitto examine the transition in employees satisfaction from the technological domain to overall satisfaction with work . We found that job fit not only mediated but also strengthened the effect of workplace IT satisfaction on job satisfaction whereas professional fit did not play a moderating role in the relationship between workplace IT satisfaction and job satisfaction . The findings suggest that practitioners should emphasize workplace IT as a crucial ingredient of the work context and improve employee experiences with using IT . More importantly the fit of IT with employees job and professional requirements is critical for this transition in satisfaction .
