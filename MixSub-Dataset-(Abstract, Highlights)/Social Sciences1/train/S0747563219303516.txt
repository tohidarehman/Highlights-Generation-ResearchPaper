 This study was conducted to synthesize existing studies on user acceptance of consumer oriented health information technologies through a systematic review and meta analysis . We searched four electronic databases in August 2018 for studies that empirically examined user acceptance of CHITs based on theoretical frameworks of Technology Acceptance Model . Meta analysis was used to estimate effect sizes of pairwise relationships among TAM constructs while subgroup analysis was performed to investigate potential factors that may moderate TAM relationships . Sixty seven studies were identified and included for analysis . The results show that TAM was a robust model in examining user acceptance of CHITs . The results also identified a number of significant relationships between several antecedents and the core TAM constructs . In addition many of the relationships could be moderated by study characteristics such as country of origin type of user and type of technology . The findings demonstrated that TAM represents a good ground theory for examining factors that influence consumer acceptance of CHITs . Further efforts can be dedicated to contextualize the use of TAM theories in CHIT domain and to further examine factors that are able to moderate the model relationships .
