 The development of big data and Internet of things have brought big changes to e commerce . Different kinds of information sources have improved the consumers online shopping performance and make it possible to realize the business intelligence . Grip force and eye tracking sensors are applied to consumers online reviews search behavior by relating them to the research approaches in IoT . To begin with public cognition of human contact degrees of recycled water reuses with grip force test was measured . According to the human contact degrees 9 recycled water reuses presented by the experiment are classified into 4 categories . Based on the conclusion drawn from grip force test purified recycled water and fresh vegetable irrigated with recycled water are regarded as the drinking for high level human contact degree and the irrigation of food crops for low level human contact degree respectively . Several pictures are designed for eye tracking test by simulating an on line shopping web page on Taobao . By comparing the fixation time participants spent on the areas of interest we justify that consumers online reviews search behavior is substantially affected by human contact degrees of recycled products . It was found that consumers rely on safety perception reviews when buying high contact goods .

@highlight We combine of IoT technology and e business research.
@highlight We use grip force sensors to test human contact degrees of different products.
@highlight We use eye tracking sensors to capture the eye movement of consumers behavior.
@highlight We summarize the characteristics of consumers behaviors based on sensor data.
