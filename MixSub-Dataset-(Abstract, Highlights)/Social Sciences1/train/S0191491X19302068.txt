 This paper reports a Norwegian validation study of a widely used instrument to measure students approaches to learning namely Biggs revised two factor study process questionnaire . Its cultural sensitivity and psychometry evaluations have provoked rigorous discussion among educators in different languages . A survey design was adopted involving 253 undergraduate engineering students across two universities . Confirmatory factor analyses were used to test six models hypothesized to reflect the factor structures of R SPQ 2F and unidimensionality of its subscales . The results showed appropriate fits of a two factor first order model with 10 items measuring deep approach and 9 items measuring surface approach subscales . The reliability was found to be high with coefficients of .81 .72 and .63 on deep subscale surface subscale and the whole instrument respectively . Findings may be interpreted as evidence of cultural sensitivity of the instrument and more validation studies were recommended .

@highlight R SPQ 2F is a widely used instrument to evaluate students learning approaches.
@highlight Its cultural sensitivity has provoked hot debates among educationists.
@highlight The current article investigates this cultural sensitivity in Norwegian context.
@highlight Evidence of construct validity and reliability was found upon deletion of an item.
@highlight Recommendations were made including further studies on its cultural specificity.
