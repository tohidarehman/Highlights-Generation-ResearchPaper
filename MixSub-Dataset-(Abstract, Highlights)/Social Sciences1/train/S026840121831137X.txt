 Based on the Elaboration Likelihood Model this study identifies the differences between perceived privacy risks and privacy concern . Furthermore the study analyses how perceived privacy risks and privacy concerns affect the disclosure intention and the actual information disclosure behavior of Internet users . In addition the study discusses the moderating effects of platform types from the perspective of privacy elaboration likelihood . By applying meta analyses and SEM on 104 independent studies with 42 256 samples from existing empirical studies we attempt to systematically reveal the relationship between privacy cognition and information disclosure . The results show that perceived privacy risks can significantly reduce personal information disclosure intention as well as actual information disclosure behavior . However privacy concerns only affect disclosure intention but do not have a significant effect on actual information disclosure behavior . The study also verified that platform types have moderating effects on the privacy decision making of Internet users . The findings yield important and useful implications both for research and for practice .
