 Gaming Disorder is a new category in the ICD 11 despite mixed evidence supporting its validity . In order to determine if this is a distinct and separate category of addiction it is necessary to demonstrate a link between the inherent properties of video games and problematic symptoms . The current study aimed to evaluate this link by examining differences in problematic video game use across different video game genres . Participants aged 14 and above were recruited internationally through online English language video game forums and completed an online survey 1030min in length . When controlling for participants age and self rated impulsivity scores there were no overall differences in PVGU between genres or across different proportions of social play . Self rated impulsivity and frequency of playtime were uniquely and positively associated with PVGU . The current study does not support the assertion that the type of video game played is related to levels of problem use challenging the idea that video games themselves are addictive . Future research should explore whether when controlling for impulsivity and social play online only or Massively Multiplayer Online games are predictive of PVGU .

@highlight Younger people played longer more sociably and had higher problem use scores.
