 This paper proposes collaborative filtering as a means to predict semantic preferences by combining information on social ties with information on links between actors and semantics . First the authors present an overview of the most relevant collaborative filtering approaches showing how they work and how they differ . They then compare three different collaborative filtering algorithms using articles published by

@highlight Addressing links prediction challenge in Socio Semantic System.
@highlight Collaborative filtering algorithms constitute relevant models to predict semantic preferences.
@highlight Similarity model predicts semantic links preferences.
@highlight Small increase of accuracy with social network signals.
