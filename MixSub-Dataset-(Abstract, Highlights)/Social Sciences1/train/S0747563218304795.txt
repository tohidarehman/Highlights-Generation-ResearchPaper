 Approach and avoidance are typical behavioral tendencies of consumers when exposed to a new environment . Drawing on the stimulus organism response framework this study investigates the effects of atmospheric cues on consumers approach and avoidance intentions in social commerce environments . We elucidate the interaction mechanisms between atmospheric cues and consumers evaluations through the lens of perceived affordances . Then we investigate how three types of perceived affordances influence consumers approach and avoidance behavioral intentions . A three way factorial experiment provides strong evidence that task cues aesthetic cues and social cues elicit perceived utilitarian hedonic and connective affordances respectively . Approach behavioral intentions were affected by all three types of perceived affordances yet avoidance intentions were only affected by perceived utilitarian and hedonic affordances . This paper discusses both theoretical and practical implications for social commerce research .

@highlight Different types of atmospheric cues stimulate perceived affordances differently.
@highlight More task cues induces a higher level of perceived utilitarian affordances.
@highlight The presence of aesthetic cues induces perceive hedonic affordances.
@highlight The presence of social cues induces perceive connective affordances.
@highlight Approach and avoidance intentions are influenced by different perceived affordances.
