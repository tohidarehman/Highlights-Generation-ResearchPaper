 We study youth materialism as an antecedent of problematic smartphone dependency among adolescents . Based on Uses and Gratifications theory and the I PACE framework we consider process and social oriented smartphones as mediators in the relationship between youth materialism and problematic smartphone dependency . Using data from 463 French late adolescents known as digital natives we demonstrate that paths differ depending on gender . For girls youth materialism is positively related to problematic smartphone dependency via social oriented smartphone use whereas this relationship is nonsignificant for boys . Moreover youth materialism is positively related to problematic smartphone dependency via process oriented smartphone use for both boys and girls but the relationship is stronger for boys than for girls . We discuss the implications of these results for business and social policies .

@highlight Paper argues for the concept of Problematic Smartphone Dependency PSD .
@highlight Model explains PSD by materialism mediated by use gratifications at adolescence.
@highlight Model is consistent with I PACE model gratification theory and social role theory.
@highlight Both social oriented and process oriented smartphone use are influenced by gender.
@highlight Gender moderates the relationship between materialism and PSD for teenagers.
