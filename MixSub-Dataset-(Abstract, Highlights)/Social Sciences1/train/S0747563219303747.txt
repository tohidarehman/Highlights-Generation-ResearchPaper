 Social media sites allow users to instantaneously self disclose to their entire social network . This creates an opportunity to engage in self expression that is farther reaching than ever before but also a new challenge managing the risk inherent in self disclosing to a large and diverse set of people . What guides decisions about how openly to self disclose in such contexts Building on theoretical and empirical evidence linking perceived partner responsiveness to open self disclosure in face to face dyadic interactions we hypothesized that perceptions of a Facebook network s responsiveness would shape people s self disclosure on Facebook . We also examined whether observers can infer people s perceived network responsiveness from thin slices of self disclosure . Across two studies people who perceived their Facebook network as more responsive self disclosed more openly on Facebook . Furthermore observers could infer participants perceived network responsiveness with some accuracy on the basis of disclosure openness . Implications for the self disclosure and person perception literatures are discussed .

@highlight Perceived network responsiveness predicted open self disclosure on Facebook.
@highlight Observers could infer perceived network responsiveness based on people s updates.
@highlight Observers appeared to have used update openness to inform their inferences.
