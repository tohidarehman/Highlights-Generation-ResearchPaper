Specifically the study took into account the role of perception primary responses and social capital connections . Moreover we explored the link between fear of cybercrime and these antecedents . Data collected from 334 cybercrime victims were analyzed using structural equation modeling . The findings indicated that victims with high perceived control and who ignore the incident are less inclined to ask for help . Surprisingly victims with high levels of self blame are more likely to seek support . Moreover we found that fear of crime is significantly related with perception and self blame . Future awareness campaigns should stress that support seeking is part of the solution and should avoid placing the responsibility of victimization completely on the victim .
