 Traceability of ingredients in food supply chains has become paramount in a world in which markets become global heterogeneous and complex and in which consumers expect a high level of quality . The food supply chain consists of many organizations having different interests and are often reluctant to share traceability information with each other . Blockchain has been advocated for improving traceability by providing trust . Yet practice proved to be more stubborn . The goal of this paper is to identify boundary conditions for sharing assurance information to improve traceability . Four cases in the food supply chain have been investigated using a template analysis of 16 interviews . Eighteen boundary conditions categorized in business regulation quality and traceability categories have been identified . Some boundary conditions were found in all supply chains whereas others were found to be supply chain specific . Standardization of traceability processes and interfaces having a joint platform and independent governance were found to be key boundary conditions before blockchain can be used . Our findings imply that supply chain systems have first to be modified and organizational measures need to be taken to fulfill the boundary conditions before blockchain can be used successfully .

@highlight Use of blockchain remains limited despite it promises.
@highlight Boundary conditions should be met before blockchain can be used.
@highlight Blockchain technology requires standardization and data governance.
@highlight Blockchain use requires organizational transformations.
@highlight Blockchain can result in more information sharing.
