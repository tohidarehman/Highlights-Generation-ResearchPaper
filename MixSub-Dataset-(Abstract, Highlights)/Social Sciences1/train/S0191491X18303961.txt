 Recruiting and preparing STEM majors for teaching has become one of the major efforts at improving mathematics and science teacher quality at secondary level . One question is whether STEM majors who have not had the chance to experience active learning in mathematics and science classes as secondary students themselves know what inquiry pedagogy is . Secondly it is unclear whether those who experienced inquiry in their college introductory discipline courses will be able to utilize the pedagogy in teaching secondary content . We address these questions through studying an undergraduate research methods course designed to improve STEM majors capacity for delivering inquiry based mathematics and science lesson . Analysis of data from pre and post course surveys and students written research reports including students reflection on their inquiry projects suggests that offering future STEM teachers opportunities to conduct inquiry and reflect

@highlight We cannot take for granted STEM majors know the basic inquiry concepts.
@highlight Teaching the elements of inquiry to STEM majors is important and beneficial.
@highlight Offering opportunities to connect inquiry and secondary content is important.
