 Student exchange programs and trips abroad are consistently portrayed in scholarship as a strategy for promoting students global competence . Through a thematic document analysis of a mandatory course developed by the Israeli MOE for students embarking on trips abroad and additional sources I explore the discourse used to portray these trips in the Israeli context showing an alternative model that places the state rather than students at the center of these programs . Although from an education perspective this discourse is distinct political science scholarship suggests the goals it embodies could be embedded across many national contexts albeit more discretely .
