 Influencers are non celebrity individuals who gain popularity on social media by posting visually attractive content and by interacting with other users to create a sense of authenticity and friendship . Brands partner with Influencers to garner engagement from their target consumers in a new marketing strategy known as Influencer marketing . Nonetheless the theoretical underpinnings of such remains unknown . We suggest a new conceptual framework of Visual Congruence induced Social Influence which contextualizes the Similarity Attraction Model in the Social Influence literature . Using VCSI we delineate how Influencers use visual congruence as representations of shared interests in a specific area to build strong bonds with Followers . This intimate affiliation catalyzes the positive effects of visual congruence on Followers brand engagement . To test these hypotheses we conducted in vivo observations of Influencer marketing on Instagram . We collected 45 000 images and social media usage behaviors over 26 months . We then applied deep learning algorithms to automatically classify each image and used social media analytics to disclose hidden associations between visual elements and brand engagement . Our hypothesis testing results provide empirical support for VCSI advancing theories into the rapidly growing fields of multimodal content and Influencer marketing .
