 The improvement of volunteer performance is a continuing issue in citizen science projects . From the perspective of motivational design the provision of feedback is regarded as an effective design principle to promote user experience and performance in many contexts . We draw upon achievement goal theory and propose a research model to depict the influence of feedback types on perceived enjoyment perceived meaning and self expansion thereby further enhancing volunteer performance . We also investigate whether volunteers dispositional goal orientation moderates the effects of feedback types on perceived enjoyment perceived meaning and self expansion . A 3 2 between subject experiment was conducted to validate our research model . Results showed that task self and social feedback have varying impact on volunteers experiences with citizen science projects . Individuals dispositional goal orientation significantly interacted with feedback design in affecting volunteers experiences . Moreover the impact of feedback will be enhanced when feedback design is congruent with volunteers dispositional goal orientation . Perceived enjoyment perceived meaning and self expansion can positively influence volunteer performance which is measured with the quantity and accuracy of their contributions . These findings will provide a groundwork for guidelines and strategies to enhance volunteer performance in citizen science projects .

@highlight Task self and social feedback affect volunteers experiences differently in citizen science.
@highlight The effect of feedback is enhanced if feedback type is congruent with dispositional goal orientation.
@highlight Volunteers experiences positively influence the quantity and accuracy of contributions.
