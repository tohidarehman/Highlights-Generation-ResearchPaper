 The number of firms that intend to invest in big data analytics has declined and many firms that invested in the use of these tools could not successfully deploy their project to production . In this study we leverage the valence theory perspective to investigate the role of positive and negative valence factors on the impact of bigness of data on big data analytics usage within firms . The research model is validated empirically from 140 IT managers and data analysts using survey data . The results confirm the impact of bigness of data on both negative valence and positive valence factors . In addition findings show that data security concern is not a critical factor in using big data analytics . The results also show that interestingly at different levels of data security concern task complexity data accessibility and data diagnosticity the impact of bigness of data on big data analytics use will be varied . For practitioners the findings provide important guidelines to increase the extent of using big data analytics by considering both positive and negative valence factors .
