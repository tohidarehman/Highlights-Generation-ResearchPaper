Hence this paper collects 50 listed blockchain technology enterprises in China and quantitatively analyses them . The results show that the expansion of the enterprise asset scale is a significant driving factor for implementing blockchain technology . In addition this paper proves that implementation of blockchain technology has a positive impact on improving asset turnover rate and reducing sales expense rate . Based on the results of theoretical and empirical analysis this paper provides some constructive suggestions for constructing blockchain projects in the future .
