 The use of computer generated characters is increasingly being used to study emotion and social cognition in humans as it offers a highly controllable yet potentially interactive experimental set up . However avatars often fall short at conveying credible emotions . This study explored the interaction between body motion and facial expression on the perceived intensity and believability of an avatar s pain expression . Adults were shown videos of an agematched avatar displaying facial expressions of pain while the body was static or while the trunk was oscillating at varied amplitudes which represented human dynamic equilibrium or trunk rocking expressing a sustained pain . Pupil size was recorded during the task as an objective marker of emotional reaction . Results showed that the avatar s pain was perceived to be more intense and more believable in the presence of both idle motion and trunk rocking than in the static condition . Pupil dilated more when facial pain expression was combined with trunk rocking than in the static and idle conditions . This work demonstrated the critical role of idle motion when creating dynamical pain expressing avatars as well as the potentiating effect of body motion when combined with facial expression on the perception of avatar s pain .

@highlight The avatar s pain expression is rated as more intense in the presence of idle motion.
@highlight The avatar s pain expression is judged more realistic in the presence of idle motion.
@highlight Trunk rocking enhanced the perceived intensity of the avatar s facial pain expression.
@highlight Trunk rocking enhanced the perceived realism of the avatar s facial pain expression.
@highlight Pupil dilation was higher when trunk rocking was congruent with pain expression.
