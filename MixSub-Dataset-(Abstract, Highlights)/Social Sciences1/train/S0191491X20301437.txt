 Although Likert type rating scales are used in a great number of early childhood studies knowledge of how the number of response options affects the psychometric properties of scales used with children is limited . The purpose of this study is to contribute to this knowledge . Data were collected from second grade students and third grade students . Accordingly 1 092 second and third graders completed a 2 point 3 point and 4 point version of the School Attachment Scale for Children and Adolescents . Participants came from 11 schools different in terms of socioeconomic status . The children received the versions approximately three weeks apart . Results revealed that as the number of response options increased the means tended to decrease and the distribution to be normal . For the 2 point version most items were below the cut off point in terms of discrimination indexes . Compared to the 2 point version there was a significant increase in discrimination indexes for the 3 and 4 point versions and the items discrimination indexes were high . It was concluded that the reliability coefficient increased with an increasing number of response options for all subdimensions of the scale . When the validity estimations of the three subdimensions were examined for the three versions of the scale it was found that the 3 and 4 point versions were appropriate for the validity and that the validity of the 2 point version was weak . It was observed that using 2 point Likert type scales with children negatively affected the psychometric properties and that these properties improved with an increased number of response options .

@highlight Children can use 3 and 4 point Likert type scales.
@highlight Reliability coefficient increased with an increasing number of response options for the scale.
@highlight Validity of 3 and 4 point versions of the scale were appropriate and 2 point version was weak.
