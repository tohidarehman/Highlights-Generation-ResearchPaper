 This paper aims to investigate a test instrument measuring teachers general pedagogical knowledge . Pre service teachers in service teachers and teacher educators from Estonia participated in a pilot study . Item response theory analysis showed that the items fit to a unidimensional instrument assumption . Three levels of difficulty were identified questions based on a situation description questions connecting situations with theoretical concepts and questions requiring theoretical knowledge . When comparing the sample groups pre service teachers struggled with topics that had not been part of their curriculum yet . Interestingly in service teachers had more difficulty with questions requiring specific theoretical knowledge while teacher educators struggled more with practical situations in a school context . An overall suggestion for future research is to review the conceptual framework in terms of linking theory and practice to connect rather than to distinguish these characteristics of teachers general pedagogical knowledge . The results of the study also contribute to further improvement of the instrument .

@highlight It is possible to have a unidimensional instrument for measuring teachers GPK.
@highlight Item difficulty levels were found regarding practical and theoretical knowledge.
@highlight In service teachers struggled more with specific theoretical concepts.
@highlight To teacher educators questions about practical school situations were demanding.
@highlight Suggestions on linking theory and practice in GPK tests are made.
