 Online reviews have reshaped visitor economies . However there is a lack of research regarding the motivations of visitors to write online reviews as most existing research disregards the cultural differences between individuals . This research investigates the motivations of museum visitors from individualistic cultures to write online reviews with the critique of Hofstede through the lens of Social Exchange Theory . This study utilises the netnography methodology . One hundred and eleven detailed TripAdvisor reviews and ten email interviews were collected . Theoretically we contribute to SET by developing a two dimensional framework which indicates 1 that the complexity and heterogeneity of individualist culture were identified in the dimension of social exchange between the service provider and the visitors through online reviews and 2 American and British visitors share similar individualist culture in the second dimension of social exchange between peers in online reviews . Practically this research can benefit the online reputation management and expectation management for visitor attractions with the goal of improving their visitor offerings and to minimise negative reviews .
