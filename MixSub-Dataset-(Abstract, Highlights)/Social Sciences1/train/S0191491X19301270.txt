 Teacher professional standards globally now include a stronger emphasis on teacher research and evaluation skills . Yet little is known about how to build these capacities through teacher education . This paper reports on a systematic literature review conducted to synthesize the literature about approaches to improving research and evaluative skills and attitudes in teachers . A total of 19 studies were included . The field is largely dominated by small qualitative studies that focus on teacher action research as a facilitator of professional development . There is a substantial and highly problematic gap in the research specifically in relation to building evaluation skills in teachers . Recommendations include a stronger investment in teacher education focussed on evaluation and evaluative thinking which holds significant potential to positively impact the professional practice of teachers and student learning outcomes .

@highlight Increasingly strong research and evaluation skills are expected of teachers.
@highlight There is very little research on approaches to building evaluation skills in the teaching profession.
@highlight A stronger focus on evaluation and evaluative thinking in teacher education is required.
