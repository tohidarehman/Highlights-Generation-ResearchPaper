 The present study applies a social ecological framework of adolescent resilience to examine how online risk exposure and online social capital influence psychological stress on adolescents . We conducted a web based survey of adolescents in the United States and found that exposure to online risks helped explain the association between Internet usage and adolescent psychological stress . Contrary to our hypotheses online social capital moderated the relationship between online risk exposure and psychological stress in unanticipated ways . Instead of playing a protective role by reducing stress high levels of online social capital strengthened the relationship between risk exposure and psychological stress . This suggests that adolescents who rely heavily on the formation of social capital online may be more vulnerable to psychological stress resulting from online risk exposure than adolescents who do not garner social capital from online environments . Our study is the first to identify online social capital as a potential risk factor in relation to Internet use and online risk exposure for adolescents . We discuss the implications of our findings for researchers educators parents and adolescents .
