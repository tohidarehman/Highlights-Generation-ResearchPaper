The results indicate perceived ubiquity and m commerce app incentives as two strongest predictors of impulsiveness and perceived value respectively . It was further observed that impulsiveness negatively affects consumers repurchase intention but positively enhances the satisfying experience whereas perceived value favourably affects both the variable . The study contributes in various ways first a holistic model using the S O R framework is a new addition in literature ground second the extra focus on the construct satisfying experience will give a larger understanding to optimise the m commerce applications efficiently . Moreover the study also presents managerial implications for practitioners working in areas related to m commerce .
