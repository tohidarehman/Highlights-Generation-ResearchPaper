 As social networking sites become increasingly pervasive among students educational information system researchers begin to highlight the potential negative effect of SNSs for students . Despite such interest scholars have paid little attention to the underlying mechanism of EIS to date . By employing two well known theoretical models we investigated the determinants of excessive SNS usage and how excessive use induces cognitive distraction and consequently influences the academic performance of the students . Using a survey of 505 university undergraduate students who are SNS users and the objective data of their cumulative grade point average we confirmed four technology characteristics as determinants of excessive use . Excessive use of SNS causes cognitive distraction among students thereby affecting academic performance . Results also showed the interaction effect of the boundary condition that is cognitivebehavioral control which mitigates the deleterious effect of excessive use in relation to cognitive distractions . The outcomes offer significant implications for the strategizing of managers and researchers to reduce psychological problems among SNS users .
