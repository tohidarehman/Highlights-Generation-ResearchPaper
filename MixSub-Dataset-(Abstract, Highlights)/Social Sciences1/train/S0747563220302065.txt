 This experiment investigated whether eye contact would evoke similar attention and emotion related psychophysiological responses in virtual reality as in a face to face interaction . Participants viewed a confederate in a live interaction and a confederate s avatar in VR . In both conditions the confederate avatar was portraying direct and laterally averted gaze . Heart rate deceleration responses reflecting attention orienting were greater to direct gaze compared to averted gaze and the effect was not significantly different between Live and VR conditions . However skin conductance responses reflecting physiological arousal were larger in response to direct than averted gaze only in the Live condition . These results suggest that while eye contact with a live person evokes substantial attention and emotion related psychophysiological responses the physiological effects of eye contact are diminished in VR .

@highlight The study investigated psychophysiological responses to virtual and real eye contact.
@highlight Heart rate deceleration responses were greater to direct gaze than averted gaze.
@highlight Larger skin conductance responses to direct vs. averted gaze only in live interaction.
