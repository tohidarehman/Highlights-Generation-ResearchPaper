 Considering students as the key stakeholders in higher education institutions the present study identifies service quality indicators from their perspectives and proposes a more comprehensive instrument for measuring SQ exclusively in HEIs . HEISQUAL covers the operational as well as technical aspects of SQ by following a holistic approach which has largely been ignored in previous studies . The proposed instrument was subjected to different scale development tests where outcomes fully complied with the benchmark values and proposed seven SQ themes namely teachers profile curriculum infrastructure and facilities management and support staff employment quality safety and security and students skills development .

@highlight Safety and security and employment are the two emerging themes of service quality SQ in higher education institutions HEIs .
