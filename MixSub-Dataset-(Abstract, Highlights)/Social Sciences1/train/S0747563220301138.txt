 Previous research has confirmed that social loafing as a pronouncing obstacle undermines the development of online communities . However relevant studies centered on the critical factors that affect social loafing in online travel communities are still not well understood . Drawing on self determination theory and social identity theory this paper critically focuses on the effects of intrinsic motivation extrinsic motivation and community identification on social loafing in online travel communities using data collected from 300 respondents in China . After a structural equation modeling analysis the results of this study indicate that only enjoyment in helping exhibits a significantly negative relationship with social loafing whereas the other three types of motivation are reinforced by community identification to inhibit social loafing indirectly . Meanwhile community identification is more positively influenced by extrinsic motivation and social loafing can be effectively diminished by community identification . Theoretical and practical suggestions are discussed for future research .
