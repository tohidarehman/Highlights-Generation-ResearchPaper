 The use of web surveys is a common and popular data collection method in behavioral and social research . Compared to other established survey modes web surveys are frequently cheaper and less time consuming because they are commonly self administered . They also allow respondents to take part with few time and location restrictions . However research has shown that web surveys are frequently associated with multitasking which may negatively affect response behavior and response quality . In this study we use paradata detecting switching away from the web survey to explore on device media multitasking . We conducted a web survey in an opt in access panel in Germany and randomly assigned respondents to a PC or smartphone condition . The results reveal that on device media multitasking is more common on PCs than on smartphones . We also find evidence that engaging in on device media multitasking affects response quality . Respondents who switch away are more likely to select the middle response category . In addition the results show that the question presentation format the device type and respondents age and education are associated with the occurrence of on device media multitasking . These findings point to the importance of controlling for on device media multitasking in web surveys .
