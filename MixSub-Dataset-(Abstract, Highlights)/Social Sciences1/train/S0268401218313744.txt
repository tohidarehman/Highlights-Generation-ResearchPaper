 Connoisseur consumption is continuing to grow in popularity with more niche retailers and specialty firms servicing increasingly discerning consumers . Despite the wealth of consumer data from social media platforms there has been little empirical focus on how consumers make sense of their experiences after interacting with cultural interlocutors from niche industries with highly specialized knowledge . In order to scrutinize the process of distinction making in practice and reception this study employs a mixed methods approach to triangulate the production reception and practice of taste making at four coffee fairs held in Toronto Ontario and Hamilton Ontario . Through ethnographic fieldwork conventional content analysis and a discourse network analysis of social media usage from attendees this study finds that there are important contextual differences that affect which discourses are present in person and appear online .
