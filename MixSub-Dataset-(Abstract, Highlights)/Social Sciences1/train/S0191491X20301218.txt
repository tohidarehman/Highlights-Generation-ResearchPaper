 International recognition of the teachers role in student learning has increased attention to teacher quality and evaluation . In the U.S. policy has relaxed requirements for using student outcomes and granted more flexibility to evaluate teachers in ways that ostensibly improve instructional practice and student learning . This exploratory single case study examined the perceptions of practitioners at one high school in a large suburban district during the implementation of a new evaluation system posited as focused on teacher support and growth . Findings suggest teachers and administrators appreciated the emphasis on communication . However tensions inherent to the conflation of evaluation and support created challenges . These included distrust of policymaker motives complexity of the model technical challenges to implementation time constraints and teachers need for additional support . Practitioners lived experiences can inform policymakers reconsidering how and to what extent evaluation systems tied to accountability can meaningfully impact teacher professional growth and student learning .
