 This study examines not only the relationship between work related smartphone use after work and job burnout but also the 3 way interaction effect of social support and perceived organizational politics on this relationship . The findings of an analysis of 387 Korean workers provide various significant implications . The 3 way interaction effect of POPs was identified while the interaction effect of social support between work related smartphone use after work and job burnout was not confirmed . Specifically the negative impact of work related smartphone use after work which induces job burnout was found to be mitigated when supervisor support was high in a negative political work environment . However in a positive political work environment greater supervisor support was actually found to increase the negative impact of work related smartphone use after work while strong peer support reduced the negative impact of work related smartphone use after work . This study contributes to research by providing an extended research model of how work related smartphone use after work affects job burnout and how social support and political work environment moderate this relationship . Additional longitudinal studies including other factors of job demands and resources will facilitate more academic and practical discussions .
