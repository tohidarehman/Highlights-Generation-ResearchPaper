 This study explores the potential of blockchain technology in enhancing trust among the stakeholders responsible for the maintenance of rolling stock . Although the technology has been widely successful in the financial sector it is still novel in the maintenance field . Given the customized nature of maintenance processes it is unclear if a suitable consensus protocol can be identified that can enhance trust among stakeholders . This problem is investigated through the lens of the Design Science Research Methodology . First the theoretical background of blockchain technology and its role in enhancing trust are explained followed by the analysis of a current case at a Railway company to test the proof of concept . A business network archive is developed for the maintenance management of the sliding step of the train door system . The archive encompasses the business logic and transactional data required to enhance trust among stakeholders in the quality of performed maintenance . The developed archive is deployed on Hyperledger Fabric and the effectiveness of the solution is evaluated through a survey . The results show that the developed business network deployed on a customized Hyperledger Fabric consensus protocol enhanced trust among the stakeholders involved .

@highlight A use case of blockchain for maintenance information management is identified.
@highlight A blockchain led knowledge sharing platform is developed.
@highlight Trust among stakeholders is enhanced by the deployed consensus protocol.
