 Taking a configurational approach this paper investigates the causal configurations of IT ambidexterity dynamic capabilities and environmental uncertainty that are associated to service innovation performance in small and medium sized enterprises . Results from a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis of 63 industrial service SMEs show that these firms attain high service innovation performance with three different configurations under conditions of high uncertainty . Two configurations highlight the importance of IT exploration capabilities whereas another configuration accentuates the importance of IT exploitation capabilities . Our study contributes to the literature in multiple ways . For instance due to the equifinal properties of the configurational approach our results suggest that SMEs can attain high innovation performance through both sequential and simultaneous IT ambidexterity thus providing a starting point for reconciling competing views of IT ambidexterity . Other contributions to theory and practice and avenues for future research are also discussed .

@highlight This study investigates IT ambidexterity from a configurational approach.
@highlight Results yield 3 configurations equally capable of attaining innovation performance.
@highlight Two configurations highlight the importance of IT exploration capabilities.
@highlight One configuration highlights the importance of IT exploitation capabilities.
@highlight The results serve to reconcile competing views about ambidexterity.
