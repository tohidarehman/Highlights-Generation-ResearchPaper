 This article focuses on the role of accountability within information management particularly in cloud computing contexts . Key to this notion is that an accountable Cloud Provider must demonstrate both willingness and capacity for being a responsible steward of other people s data . More generally the notion of accountability is defined as it applies to the cloud and a conceptual model is presented related to the provision of accountability of cloud services . This allows a consideration of accountability at various different levels of abstraction including the operationalisation of accountability . It is underpinned by fundamental requirements for strong accountability which in particular are aimed at avoiding risks in the provision and verification of accounts . In addition the article sketches what kind of tools mechanisms and guidelines support this in practice and discusses these in the light of the upcoming European Data Protection Regulation .
