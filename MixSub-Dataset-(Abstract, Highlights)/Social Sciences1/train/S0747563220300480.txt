 Personal information management on digital platforms requires multiple practices of saving organizing and retrieving information . This exploratory study offers a new perspective on PIM practices and focuses on the gaps between their actual and ideal use . Data were collected from 465 participants 114 males and 351 females who filled in a questionnaire that we developed and validated for 25 PIM practices . Findings showed significant gaps between actual and ideal usage for 22 out of 25 practices . These gaps were mostly positive revealing that participants wished to use more practices than they actually did and were not satisfied with their PIM behavior . They were larger for women and we also found age differences . Larger gaps could be associated with negative feelings and a sense of low efficacy in managing personal information . We offer various explanations of the gaps and suggest implications for consumer training and platform design .
