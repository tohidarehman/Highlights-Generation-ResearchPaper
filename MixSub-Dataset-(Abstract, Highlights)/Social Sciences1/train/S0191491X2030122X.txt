 The purpose of the present study was to examine the role of perfectionism in the second foreign language learning context . To this end we investigated the possible links between perfectionism emotions achievement goals and L2 achievement . A total number of 2008 secondary school students completed the relevant questionnaires . First confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assure the construct validity of the questionnaires . Then separate structural equation models were conducted to examine the relations among variables . Results indicated that adaptive perfectionism was directly related to positive emotions while the opposite pattern was found for maladaptive perfectionism . Moreover only adaptive perfectionism was related to mastery goals and both adaptive and maladaptive perfectionisms were related to performance approach goals and performance avoidance goals . Maladaptive perfectionism dimensions were negatively related to L2 achievement while one dimension of adaptive perfectionism had positive relation and another one had negative relation with L2 achievement . Finally mediation analysis was performed and results showed that only negative emotions and only mastery goals could mediate the relation between perfectionism dimensions and L2 achievement .
