 Information technology engagement is defined as a need to spend more time using IT . Practice based examples show that IT engagement can have adverse effects in organizations . Although users can potentially get more work done through IT engagement observations show that the users might jeopardize their well being and hamper their work performance . We aimed to investigate this complexity in the research on IT engagement by examining its potential antecedents and outcomes in organizations . Considering the potentially mixed outcomes we developed a model to examine the effects of IT engagement on personal productivity and strain . We also aimed to explain the antecedents of IT engagement by drawing on the collective expectations for IT use . In particular we examined the extent to which normative pressure on IT use drives users information load and IT engagement . Finally we sought to understand whether users attempts to avert dependency on IT use reduced their IT engagement . Several hypotheses were developed and tested with survey data of 1091 organizational IT users . The findings help explain the role of normative pressure as a key driver of IT engagement and validate the positive and negative outcomes of IT engagement in organizations .
