 Online audiences shape users self presentation online but little is known about whether or not they impact users actions in reality so offline when they are not engaged directly with a site interface . To bridge this gap we provide the first investigation of the extended warming effect of social media a special form of a phenomenon in which saliency of online audiences in offline encounters triggers impression management behavior in the pursuit of a more desirable online public image . Across two controlled experiments in the context of charity fundraising we support the existence of the extended warming effect . We find that as online audiences become more salient people show greater intentions of engaging in prosocial behavior offline . This effect is mediated by higher public self awareness and extrinsic motivations . In addition we find that the extended warming effect is amplified for more intense social media users . Theoretical contributions and practical implications are discussed .

@highlight Provides model and evidence for the extended warming effect of social media.
@highlight Users engage in prosocial behavior offline due to perceived online surveillance.
@highlight Even subtle saliency of online audiences increases offline prosocial behavior.
@highlight Higher public self awareness and extrinsic motivation mediate the effect.
