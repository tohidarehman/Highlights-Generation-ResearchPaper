 Whom do we trust more the recommendation of an expert or public opinion from a crowd of other users of the site Does it matter if the expert belongs to our in group And what if anything would change if an Artificial Intelligence system was the recommender rather than a human expert In order to answer these research questions we conducted a between subjects online experiment informed by MAIN Model which posits that interface cues signaling different types of sources can influence perceived credibility of content by triggering distinct cognitive heuristics . Participants were assigned to a scenario wherein the expert review contrasted the peer rating about recommending photos for business profiles with systematic variations in expert review valence expert identity and agent type . Results show that positive ratings are more influential on user judgements . However for negative ratings human ingroup members generated greater effects than no identity experts . Moreover AI systems were as influential as human experts suggesting the potential for AI to substitute human experts for online recommendations .
