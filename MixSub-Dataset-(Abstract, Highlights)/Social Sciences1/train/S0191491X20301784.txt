 Implementing English as a medium of instruction in Latin American countries contributes to reducing language exchange isolation in the region and helps prepare higher education students for future labor opportunities . However one of the main concerns around EMI is whether English instruction could negatively affect content acquisition . This paper examines if the performance of native Spanish speakers is affected by EMI . Specifically it discusses experiences from finance and industrial organization courses given to industrial engineers at a Chilean university . The results of a multivariate analysis of tests and final grades show that performance differences can mainly be attributed to students performance in previous courses only on rare occasions do language gender and attendance explain performance differences .
