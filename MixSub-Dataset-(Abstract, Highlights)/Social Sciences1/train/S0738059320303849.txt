 The literature on the effects of primary school size on learning achievement in sub Saharan Africa is rather limited . To address this gap we examine the causal relationship between primary school size and learning achievement of two cohorts of students followed with collection of three rounds of data in Senegal . These two cohorts attended grades 2 and 4 at the beginning of the 20092010 school year . We implement an empirical strategy that hinges on value added models estimated with a doubly robust approach we find that fourth fifth graders attending mid sized schools perform significantly better than their counterparts attending smaller or larger schools . These results are robust to a number of sensitivity analyses . The potential mechanisms through which school size operates include students gender family socioeconomic status class size and the urban rural location of the schools . Importantly we suggest optimal sizes of primary schools for both policymakers and parents . These optimal sizes are contingent upon schools urban or rural location .

@highlight We study the effect of primary school size on learning achievement in Senegal.
@highlight Students in mid sized schools perform better than those attending smaller or larger schools.
@highlight The effects tend to appear in the long term suggesting that length of exposure to school size matters.
@highlight We estimate optimal school size contingently on the decision maker policymaker or parent and school location.
