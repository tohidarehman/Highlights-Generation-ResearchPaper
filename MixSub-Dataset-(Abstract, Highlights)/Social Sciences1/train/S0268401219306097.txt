 This paper proposes an approach to tackle the problem of querying large volume of statistical RDF data . Our approach relies on pre aggregation strategies to better manage the analysis of this kind of data . Specifically we define a conceptual model to represent original RDF data with aggregates in a multidimensional structure . A set of translations rules for converting a well known multidimensional RDF modelling vocabulary into the proposed conceptual model is then proposed . We implement the conceptual model in six different data stores two RDF triple stores one graph oriented NoSQL database one column oriented data store and two relational databases . We compare the querying performance with and without aggregates in these data stores . Experimental results on real world datasets containing 81.92 million triplets show that pre aggregation allows for reducing query runtime in all data stores . Neo4j NoSQL and relational databases with aggregates outperform triple stores speeding up to 99 query runtime .

@highlight Pre aggregates improve the performance of all tested data stores.
@highlight Relational databases outperform all other data stores.
@highlight Neo4j NoSQL is more recommended than Cassandra NoSQL for manipulating multidimensional data as it scales better for larger datasets.
@highlight Neo4j performs better than Jena TDB2 and Virtuoso triple stores.
