 Recently the popularity of smart wearable technologies such as Fitbit has significantly increased . There are numerous potential benefits in using these devices especially among seniors . Yet little is known about seniors adoption behavior . Through a mixed methods approach this study investigates the factors that impact seniors intention to use wearable devices . Results from an online survey and interviews showed that seniors perception of the complexity of working with these devices is a barrier to their adoption decisions . Looking more deeply into the role of complexity revealed that seniors concern about the complexity of reading and interpreting the output of wearable devices is the main deterring element . Furthermore we explored the role of two important elements seniors cognitive age and the influence of their subjective well being on their adoption behavior . Results demonstrated that cognitive age does not significantly impact use intention by itself nonetheless subjective well being moderates its effect . This result revealed an interesting finding which is that the influence of cognitive age on seniors use intention depends on seniors level of subjective well being . When seniors subjective well being is low surprisingly cognitive age increases seniors intention to use the device . These findings provide interesting implications for practice and future research .

@highlight Using a mixed methods approach we analyzed the adoption of wearable devices among older adults.
@highlight Perceived complexity of devices specifically interpreting the outputs is the most salient deterrent of adoption.
@highlight The effect of cognitive age on adoption is moderated by subjective well being SWB .
@highlight Cognitive age negatively vs. positively impacts the older adults adoption intention when their SWB is high vs. low .
