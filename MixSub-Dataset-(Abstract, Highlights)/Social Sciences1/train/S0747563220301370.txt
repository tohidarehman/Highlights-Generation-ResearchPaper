 Political partisanship fosters in party dating behaviors . However little research has explored why individuals employ homogenous approaches to partner selection and their role in initiating developing and sustaining romantic relationships . The present study posits that social identity theory and self categorization theory provide explanations for this phenomenon in an online dating context . Specifically niche online dating websites provide an environment ripe with group dynamics . These websites emphasize a characteristic that a group of individuals share and associate with their self concept . Theoretically the social identity formed around this characteristic becomes situationally accessible and serves as the dominant factor by which individuals evaluate and categorize others . In an online survey experiment participants viewed a dating website tailored to a political affiliation selected a user s profile to browse and evaluated them as a potential romantic partner . Results revealed expectations of relationship satisfaction and willingness to date were influenced by group membership directly and indirectly through perceptions of trustworthiness . The extent to which the partner s values aligned with the group moderated this indirect effect .
