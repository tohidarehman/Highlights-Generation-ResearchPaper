 Scholarships are increasingly used to expand higher education access for refugee youth in exile but less is known about their equity implications . Drawing from scholarship on street level bureaucrats and Nancy Frasers theory of social justice I identify street level bureaucrats decision making within refugee higher education . Drawing on 62 interviews with Syrian youth and organizations in NGOs in Lebanon and 24 organizational scholarship related documents I elaborate the fundamental alignments that emerge in scholarship granting organizations goals and the needs of refugee youth they seek to support . Organizations over emphasize transitions to university overlooking the most vulnerable youths transitions through university . Though youth link their futures to opportunity and not geography SLBs seek to fund youth willing to return to Syria and engage in post conflict reconstruction .
