In addition we monitored adolescents smartphones for 14 days gathering objective data to evaluate time and content online . Results supported out model indicating that the effects of low family expressiveness and high conflicts on PIU and time spent online are mediated by depression and FoMO . Results suggest that positive family environment could decrease depressive symptoms and FoMO among adolescents and hence diminish PIU and time spent online .
