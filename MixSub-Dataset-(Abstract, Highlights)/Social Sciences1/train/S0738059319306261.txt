 I theorize that the idea of knowledge and education has shifted in Islam from an inclusive and rational search for all knowledge to a narrowed focus on religious knowledge void of rationality . By synthesizing literature on education and knowledge in Islam this study identifies three shifts in the cultural history of Islamic education . I argue that those shifts in what was deemed valuable knowledge have played a significant role in the emergence of radicalization today . The study shows that once the social world of Islam destabilized the sense of belonging and sense making became inward and less reflexive as compared to that of early Muslims . Belief became privileged over the rationality mechanisms that had previously formed Islamic endeavors . I demonstrate that a decline in intellectual and scientific production followed allowing extremists to skew Islams narrative by putting forward an idealized version of the Islamic caliphate divorced from rationality .

@highlight I have isolated three key historic shifts in knowledge and education in Islam.
@highlight During the first stage in Islam scientific and religious forms of knowledge were not mutually exclusive.
@highlight In the second stage belief began to be privileged over rationality adversely impacting the definition of knowledge.
@highlight In the last stage I show a complete fracturing of belief away from rationality in the actions of radicalized Muslims.
@highlight I draw a parallel to growing white nationalism that idealizes the imagined past and reflexively rejects rationality.
