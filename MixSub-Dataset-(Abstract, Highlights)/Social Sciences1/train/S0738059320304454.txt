 This study utilises a unique school based survey of public private and Public Partnership Programme schools in Punjab Pakistan to identify the correlates of teacher behaviour in the classroom teacher content knowledge mastery and teacher pay . The study finds that private school teachers are associated with lower classroom observation scores than public school teachers and both private and PPP school teachers are less likely to exhibit content knowledge mastery in Urdu than public school teachers . Public school teachers recruited after the introduction of test based teacher recruitment are 30 percentage points more likely to demonstrate math content knowledge mastery than teachers recruited prior to test based recruitment . The study also finds evidence of a pay gap between male and female teachers in both public and PPP schools after controlling for other characteristics . Teachers math content knowledge scores were found to be statistically significant correlates of teacher pay for private school teachers but not for PPP or public school teachers . For female PPP school teachers having higher academic qualifications is associated with higher wages however this is not the case for male teachers in these schools .
