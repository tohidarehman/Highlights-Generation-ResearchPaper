 While the practice of sending out location based advertising messages via smart devices is increasingly popular relatively little is known about how consumers cope with such personalized advertising messages and the disclosure of their personal information . Applying the persuasion knowledge model we propose that consumers form attitudes and behavioral intentions based on their persuasion knowledge and their understanding of how LBA works which affect their assessment of its benefits and harms . Perhaps more importantly we examine different dimensions of persuasion knowledge by exploring to what extent objective and subjective persuasion knowledge have differential impacts on consumers benefit harm assessments as well as attitudinal responses to LBA . A total of 246 useable responses were obtained from an online survey and structural equation modeling was employed for data analyses . The results confirmed the proposed model consumers cope with LBA by making assessments of benefits and harms based on their persuasion knowledge and form attitudes toward LBA which ultimately affect their intention to disclose personal information as well as their decision to accept or reject LBA .
