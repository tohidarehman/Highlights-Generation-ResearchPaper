 Empowerment has been argued as a viable strategy to enable frontline employees to manage the complexities of service encounters . Organisations must cascade insights from analytics to frontlines for dynamic bundling of service elements while serving customers . However very little is known on how FLEs are empowered in analytics driven services . This study addresses these research gaps drawing on a systematic literature review and in depth interviews followed by conceptualisation and validation of an empowerment scale through a pilot and the main study . This research confirms empowerment as a second order construct consisting of six dimensions namely decision making discretionary skills information access knowledge tools and training . The predictive power of the scale is validated through PLSc and PLSpredict using a training sample and a holdout sample . Theoretically this work extends FLE empowerment to analytics driven services . Practically the study informs managers to complement their investments in technology with an internal orientation program to empower FLEs to effectively link with customers and seize opportunities .

@highlight This article conceptualises frontline employee empowerment FLE in the context of analytics driven services.
@highlight We empirically validate the empowerment scale through a survey of FLEs working in Australian Services Industry.
@highlight We make the case to employ confirmatory composite analysis PLS SEM for scale development research.
@highlight We extend the empowerment construct using dynamic capabilities and offer implications for enhancing service delivery.
@highlight We also examine the empowerment constructs impact on two dependent constructs market sensing and customer linking.
