 Given the history of caste politics in India it is not surprising that the socially marginalized students face discrimination especially after the introduction of the reservation policy in educational institutes . Our qualitative study informed by Meyers Minority Stress model analysed in depth interviews with 30 undergraduate students 3 faculty members and 4 administrative officials at a premier Indian university to examine the psychological wellbeing of the reserved category students . We analysed how the discrimination processes contributed to students poor academic performance low self esteem and weak motivation . Student group affiliations and university resources created a supportive environment for the socially marginalized despite a small risk of stigmatization due to enrolment in a few campus support programs . Moreover there existed a palpable frustration among the socially privileged students resulting in discriminatory attitudes against reserved categories but not lower caste . Our findings call for the attention of college administrators policymakers and the society at large to ensure that well intended social justice policies are efficiently implemented to deliver justice to the underprivileged students of India .
