 A goal of any educational measure is to improve students capability to retain teaching content . In this paper we investigate the potential of gamification to foster knowledge retention using an action research approach . We present the results from a longitudinal study including 617 secondary and tertiary education students conducted over a period of two years . Various workshop designs that incorporated numerous gamification elements were compared with non gamified workshop designs tested and refined over time . The improved workshop designs led to increased levels of knowledge retention that exceeded the benchmark values from educational literature . We found that gamification exerts a positive impact on knowledge retention . We tested for the moderating effects of gender and age and found no effect of the former and inconsistent results for the latter . The steady increase in students learning performance resulting from constant refinement of the workshops demonstrates the usefulness of incorporating gamification principles into educational activities .

@highlight Gamification has a positive effect on students knowledge retention.
@highlight The positive effect of gamification is independent of age and gender.
@highlight Game elements can be used to tailor workshops to students needs.
