 Mobile payments are the future as we move towards a cashless society . In some markets cash is already being replaced by digital transactions but consumers of many developing countries are slower in transition towards digital payments . This study aims to identify major determinants of consumer mobile payment adoption in India the country with second largest mobile subscribers in the world . Existing mobile payments adoption studies have predominantly utilised Technology Acceptance Model which was primarily developed in organisational context and criticised for having deterministic approach without much consideration for users individual characteristics . Therefore this study adapted meta UTAUT model with individual difference variable attitude as core construct and extended the model with consumer related constructs such as personal innovativeness anxiety trust and grievance redressal . Empirical examination of the model among 491 Indian consumers revealed performance expectancy intention to use and grievance redressal as significant positive predictor of consumer use behaviour towards mobile payment . Moreover intention to use was significantly influenced by attitude social influence and facilitating conditions . The major contribution of this study includes re affirming the central role of attitude in consumer adoption studies and examining usage behaviour in contrast to most existing studies which examine only behavioural intention .

@highlight Meta UTAUT model adapted as theoretical lens with personal innovativeness anxiety trust and grievance redressal as extensions.
@highlight The empirical examination of the model among 491 Indian consumers found all proposed hypotheses to be significant.
