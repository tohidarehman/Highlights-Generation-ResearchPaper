 This study examines Google effects on memory and cognitive self esteem in the interpersonal contexts of Snapchat and text messaging and looks at the relationship between the two concepts given that both are derived from earlier research on transactive memory systems . It was hypothesized that the permanence of text messages would impair memory relative to the ephemerality of Snaps and these effects would be mediated by cognitive self esteem such that information permanence would increase cognitive self esteem which in turn would impair memory . Using a laboratory experiment

@highlight No memory differences for information received via text message compared to Snapchat.
@highlight Similarly no cognitive self esteem CSE differences between two channels.
@highlight CSE positively related to memory.
@highlight Controlling for CSE and use text message impaired cued recall and recognition.
@highlight Controlling for CSE and use Snapchat also impaired cued recall.
