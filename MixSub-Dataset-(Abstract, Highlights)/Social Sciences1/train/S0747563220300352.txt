 This study examined the impact of cues on learning processes and outcomes in short instructional videos . One hundred and twenty college students were randomly assigned to watch short videos in one of four conditions 1 no added cues 2 textual cues 3 visual cues and 4 combined textual visual cues . A Tobii X120 eye tracker was used to record the students eye movements to determine how students looked at the added cues and for how long . The students learning outcomes were measured with retention and transfer tests . Results showed that the cues helped students do better with retention tests and spend more time focusing on the areas with cues . Additionally the visual cues and combined textual visual cues also helped students do better in transfer tests and do better in organizing and integrating information . The study adds insights to multimedia design as well as teaching and learning with instructional videos . The study shows how eye tracking technology can be used to provide evidence and efficacy of the additional pointing or highlighting cues .

@highlight All the added cues in the videos helped improve students retention knowledge.
@highlight The visual cues and combined textual visual cues helped students transfer knowledge.
@highlight Eye movement patterns showed all cues helped students information selection.
@highlight The visual and combined cues helped information selection organization and integration.
@highlight Students eye movement patterns provided evidence based data on the impacts of added cues.
