 This study proposes a conceptual framework for innovation post adoption behavior . The model emphasizes that innovation discontinuance is not the end of the innovation diffusion process but one of the stages . The post adoption process is portrayed in a manner analogous to Rogers s innovation adoption process but depending on the type of discontinuanceintermittent or permanentthe respective decision making process could be quite different . For intermittent discontinuers the movement through different stages is cyclical involving multiple stages pre evaluation evaluation preparation discontinuance post action and readoption . To provide support for the applicability of this framework this study compares the post adoption behavior between Twitter intermittent discontinuers and permanent discontinuers
