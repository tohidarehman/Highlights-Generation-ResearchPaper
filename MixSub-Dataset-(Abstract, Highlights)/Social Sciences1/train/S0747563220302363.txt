 Multisensory integration is critical for supporting human spatial perception as we move around our environment . In this study we used a modern head mounted display as a tool for studying the effects of visual vestibular conflict on human spatial perception feelings of presence and cybersickness in virtual reality . Thirty participants were recruited and exposed to different levels of sensory conflict as they moved their heads in pitch . This sensory conflict was generated by artificially delaying updates to the visual representations of their virtual environment . On each trial we measured our participants 1 perceived scene instability using an angular gauge figure task 2 spatial presence using a subjective rating scale and 3 cybersickness severity using the fast motion sickness scale . As display lag was increased perceived scene instability and cybersickness were both found to increase whereas reported presence decreased . Importantly the difference in the participant s virtual and physical head orientation for the trial was also found to predict reported scene instability and cybersickness . Faster head rotations amplified both of these adverse effects . These findings are consistent with the view that measurable low level visual vestibular conflicts can account for the cybersickness experienced during HMD VR .
