 Mobile phone use and misuse have become a pressing challenge in today s society . Dangerous mobile phone use such as the use of a mobile phone while driving is widely practiced though banned in several jurisdictions . Research aiming at unfolding the psychological predictors of dangerous mobile phone use have so far been scarce . Especially researchers have never taken the role of self esteem into account which is unfortunate given prior research linking self esteem to addictive mobile phone use . In the present study we evaluated the associations between both explicit and implicit self esteem and dangerous mobile phone use with a particular focus on phoning while driving . To do so we assessed implicit self esteem among 95 participants via the Implicit Association Test and explicit self esteem via a self reported measure . Problematic mobile phone use and demographic data were assessed with self reported measures . Implicit self esteem predicted dangerous mobile phone use even after we controlled for demographic data and mobile phone dependence . Explicit self esteem however was related to neither dependence nor dangerous use of the mobile phone thereby supporting the importance of distinguishing between explicit and implicit self esteem . Our results set the scene for new research avenues regarding mobile phone use while driving .
