 Grounded in Banduras social cognitive theory of mass communication and Giles model of parasocial relationship development the current research examines how a viewer s wishful identification with an online video game streaming personality and emotional engagement with other viewers lead to behavioral loyalty through PSR with their favorite live streamer . To test the proposed mediation model the researchers conducted a survey using a representative sample drawn from a national panel of a professional survey firm in South Korea . Results of a mediation analysis employing structural equation modeling reveal that both wishful identification and emotional engagement have indirect effects on behavioral loyalty through PSR . Put another way a viewer s likeliness to continue viewing a live streaming game increase as the viewer develops stronger PSR . The current research also demonstrates that wishful identification and engagement with others streamers develop into PSR as suggested by Giles PSR development model .
