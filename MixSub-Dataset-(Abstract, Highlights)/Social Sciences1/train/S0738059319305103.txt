 This paper seeks to evaluate the access to Public Private Partnership schools by examining their geographic distribution and the factors that predict whether a child enrolls in a public PPP or private school in Punjab Pakistan using multiple micro data sets . The analysis shows that PPP schools are located in districts where high shares of children are out of school unlike public and private schools . The results indicate that while private school students are the most likely to belong to more affluent households and receive private tuition there is no evidence that students enrolled in PPP schools come from more advantaged households than public school students . Girls are more likely to be enrolled in PPP schools than in public schools while students enrolled in the New School Program seem to be the most disadvantaged amongst all PPP students .
