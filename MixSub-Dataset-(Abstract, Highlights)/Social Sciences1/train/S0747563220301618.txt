 Older adults show pronounced interindividual differences in terms of their technology adoption experiences and resources . To better understand this heterogeneity we compared older technology experts and non experts . We focused on General Internet self efficacy and Communication related Internet self efficacy . Further we considered innovativeness and technology avoidance as variables able to predict GISE and CISE which we assumed to be related to two different areas of Internet use . Samples included 131 older technology experts engaged as volunteer coaches in government supported technology projects and 239 older adults with no technology expertise . All subjects completed a paper pencil or online questionnaire containing established measures of study constructs . Multigroup structural equation models revealed that innovativeness was an important predictor of GISE and

@highlight Two groups of older Internet users differing in the degree of technological expertise were examined.
@highlight Innovativeness predicted general and communication Internet self efficacy among technology experts and non experts.
@highlight Among experts those who reported lower technology avoidance showed higher scores in general Internet self efficacy.
@highlight General Internet self efficacy predicted informational Internet activities particularly among non experts.
@highlight Communication Internet self efficacy predicted communication and instrumental Internet activities in both groups.
