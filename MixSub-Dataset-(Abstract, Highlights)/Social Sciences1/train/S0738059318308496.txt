 A straightforward way of keeping children in school is increasing the duration of compulsory education . Evidence of the impact of this type of policy in Western countries is abundant . However its effectiveness has been rarely tested in low income countries . Using panel data of low income and lower middle income countries covering the period 19962017 this paper analyzes the impact of lengthening the duration of compulsory education on the progression of children from primary to secondary education . The empirical results show that in those countries where this policy is implemented there is a significant increase in the share of children progressing from primary to secondary education but only in those countries where after the reform the duration of compulsory education becomes longer than the duration of primary education .

@highlight Increasing the duration of compulsory education pushes the progression to secondary education in low and lower middle income countries.
@highlight This policy is effective only in countries where the duration of compulsory education becomes longer than the duration of primary education.
@highlight During the post reform period we estimate increments of above 10 points in the transition of students to secondary education.
@highlight Estimated effects in the long rung are about 3 percentage points higher for girls.
