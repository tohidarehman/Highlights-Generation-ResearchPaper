 Adults must improve and acquire new skills valid for the twenty first century specifically in aspects related to employability . In this context lifelong e learning is a suitable methodology since online training courses can be adapted to the specific characteristics and needs of students . According to a definition for employability skill based on thirteen latent constructs and using partial least squares path modeling on a data set coming from a fieldwork done in an fully online university the analyses prove that i the social technical system the learning and social innovation via STS and the information and communication technology space time continuum related to the learners ways of studying have significant positive effects on employability ii the four STS factors have significant influences on the whole STS and iii the dimensions of life balanced and traditional monocronic use have not significant influences on the ICT space time continuum . Finally these results are shown in science technology engineering and mathematics and non STEM studies . Specifically in STEM studies the life balanced use is significant and the learning tasks are not significant . Results are very interesting for new approaches to social learning innovation .
