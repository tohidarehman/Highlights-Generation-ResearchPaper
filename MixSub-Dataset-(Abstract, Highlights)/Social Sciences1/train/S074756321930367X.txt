 Although research has amply demonstrated that people exhibit confirmatory biases associated with exposure and information sharing on social media there is a lack of research attempting to parse out the respective effects of selective exposure and sharing on political outcomes especially in non U.S. contexts . In this experiment we tested the extent of confirmation bias in Dutch Facebook users selection and sharing of opinionated news about three political issues . The relative contributions of selecting versus sharing pro attitudinal messages were assessed for their influences on attitude polarization and political participation . Value and impression involvement were considered as moderating factors . Findings indicate that a confirmation bias is much more consistently observed in selective sharing than in selective exposure . Second pro attitudinal selective sharing is a more robust predictor of political outcomes than pro attitudinal selective exposure . Third the effects of selective sharing and exposure on political outcomes depend more on value involvement than impression relevant involvement . Finally between topic differences were evident for the extent of confirmation bias and its effects on political outcomes .

@highlight An experiment showed Dutch adults were more selective in sharing than exposure.
@highlight Selective sharing was more predictive of political polarization and participation.
@highlight Some selectivity effects were strengthened by value or impression involvement.
@highlight The findings also varied by issue which diverged in pre existing polarization.
