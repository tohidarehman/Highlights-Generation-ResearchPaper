 High frequency data provides a lot of materials and broad research prospects for in depth research and understanding on financial market behavior but the problems solved in the research of high frequency data are far less than the problems faced and encountered and the research value of high frequency data will be greatly reduced without solving these problems . Volatility is an important measurement index of market risk and the research and forecasting on the volatility of high frequency data is of great significance to investors government regulators and capital markets . To this end by modelling the jump volatility of high frequency data the short term volatility of high frequency data are predicted .

@highlight Volatility is an important measurement index of market risk and the research and forecasting on the volatility of high frequency data is of great significance to investors government regulators and capital markets.
@highlight The realized volatility and the realized bi power variation have the obvious phenomenon of fluctuation aggregation and have the auto correlation different from the auto correlation of logarithmic yield the auto correlation of the realized volatility and the realized bi power variation is relatively strong and the correlation is positive.
@highlight The verification results of verification data obtained by fitting HAR RV model HAR lnRV model and HAR JV CV model show that the HAR lnRV model has the best prediction effect followed by the HAR JV CV model and the worst is the HAR RV model.
