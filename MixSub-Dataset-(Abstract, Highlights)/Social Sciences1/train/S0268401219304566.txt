 Online games are highly popular applications . While online gamers actively participate in gaming teams no study has yet explored whether gamers have sufficient teamwork knowledge and have accumulated sufficient team participation experience . These likely strengthen team commitment but we do not know indicating a research gap . Research filling this gap could shed light on useful means for enhancing gamers team commitment . Grounded in social identity theory we theorize the mechanism that links gamers overall gaming team participation experience and overall gaming teamwork knowledge to their team commitment . We collect two wave data from 344 online gamers that have played massively multiplayer online role playing games and use structural equation modelling for data analysis . We find that overall team participation experience is positively related to gaming team identification while overall teamwork knowledge is positively related to compliance with gaming team norms . Both team identification and norm compliance are positively related to gaming team commitment . This study is the first to clarify the mechanism underlying the impacts of overall gaming team participation experience and overall gaming teamwork knowledge on gamers team commitment . Our findings provide the practical insight that game designers should incorporate game features that require or reward gamers participation in gaming teams or enhance gaming teamwork knowledge thus strengthening gamers team commitment .

@highlight We test how overall online gamers teamwork knowledge and overall team participation experience affect their commitment.
@highlight Overall teamwork knowledge enhances norm compliance overall team participation experience enhances team identification.
@highlight Both norm compliance and team identification contribute to gamers team commitment.
