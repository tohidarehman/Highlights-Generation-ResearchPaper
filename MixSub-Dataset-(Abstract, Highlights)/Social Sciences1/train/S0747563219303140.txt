 Human machine intellectual comparisons increasingly threaten the distinctiveness of humans . Drawing on social identity theory we assume that people will compensate for the loss of human distinctiveness in a given area by valuing alternative human attributes . A preliminary study found that the defeat of a human go champion by an artificial intelligence threatened the rationality and refinement of humanity . Studies 13 found that participants primed with human machine comparison compared to controls tended to evaluate alternative attributes such as emotional responsiveness as uniquely human and as superior to machines . Finally Study 4 found that the perceived loss of distinctiveness in threatened dimensions led people to evaluate the alternative dimensions as valuable for humanness . These findings suggest that people use social creativity to compensate for the loss of human distinctiveness by valuing the alternative dimensions under humanmachine comparison .

@highlight Human machine comparison threatens the distinctiveness of human identity.
@highlight The defeat of human go champion against an artificial intelligence threatened human attributes such as rationality.
@highlight As social identity theory predicts people value non threatened human attributes to compensate.
@highlight Four studies including experimental and survey methods replicated the result.
