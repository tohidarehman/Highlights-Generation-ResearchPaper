 This study investigated associations between screen use and cognition in children and tested the hypothesis that across all screen types time spent on screens is negatively associated with cognition . This study presents cross sectional data from 11 875 US children aged 910 years . Exposures were self reported daily recreational screen use . The primary outcome was global cognition measured by the Youth NIH Toolbox . Covariates included child education pubertal development parental education household income race ethnicity physical activity and sleep duration . The mean daily recreational screen time was 3.8 hours and 99.7 of children reported using some form of screen daily . More screen time was accumulated on weekends compared to weekdays vs. 3.5 hours d 0.34 p 0.001 and boys reported more screen time than girls vs. 3.4 hours d 0.22 p 0.001 . Children in the high and middle daily screen time tertiles had lower measures of cognition compared to children in the low tertile . Children in the high tertile for TV watching video watching and social media had lower measures of cognition compared to children in the low tertile for each variable . Higher video game time was positively associated with cognition compared to the low tertile p 0.53 . Higher daily screen time is associated with lower cognition in children . These findings suggest moderating screen use for promoting cognitive development in children .

@highlight We report the relationship between cognition and screen use in 11 875 US children.
@highlight Higher TV and video watching were negatively associated with cognition.
@highlight Higher social networking activities was negatively associated with cognition.
@highlight Higher video game time was positively associated with cognition.
@highlight These effects although small suggest children should moderate screen use.
