 Offenders in custody are often disadvantaged in terms of education . Research shows that providing and improving education in custody can help reduce the possibility of recidivism and high crime rates in young offenders . Among various factors that can impact on youths ability to engage effectively with education in custody prevalence rates of neurodisabilities such as learning disabilities and traumatic brain injuries remain high . Young offenders with neurodisabilities may present with various developmental cognitive intellectual social functioning language and communication deficits that may impact on learner teacher relationships and learning acquisition . For the purpose of this paper we focused on learning disabilities and TBI given high prevalence rates for these neurodisabilities reported in the literature . We also report on general intellectual functioning given the association with specific learning disabilities . Despite contextual vulnerabilities there is a dearth of literature on neurodisabilities and its associated impact on education for young offenders in South Africa .

@highlight There is a dearth of literature on neurodisabilities and its associated impact on education for young offenders in South Africa.
@highlight Results of this nature can potentially be used to inform rehabilitative efforts in our local youth centres for offenders.
@highlight Such rehabilitative efforts could involve screening for various developmental and acquired neuro disabilities.
@highlight Rehabilitation strategies may then be even more targeted for offenders with special education needs in an already vulnerable population.
