 This study investigates the impact of teaching factors on students cognitive and metacognitive achievement in mathematics . Written tests and the Metacognitive Skills and Knowledge Assessment tool were administered to grade 4 and 5 students at the beginning and end of the school year 2013 2014 . A student questionnaire was used for measuring teaching factors . Multilevel SEM analyses revealed a reciprocal relationship between students cognitive and metacognitive skills . All teaching factors of the dynamic model of educational effectiveness were found to be associated with mathematics achievement but only four factors were associated with two aspects of metacognition . Implications of findings are drawn .
