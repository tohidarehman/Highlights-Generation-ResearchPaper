 One of the important facets of effective social communication is Joint Attention . However children with Autism Spectrum Disorder are often characterized by JA related deficits adversely affecting their social communication . In conventional interventions therapists use different types of JA cues depending on one s capability to pick up the delivered cue . Though effective conventional approaches suffer from restricted healthcare resources cost etc . With an increase in computational power investigators are exploring alternative robot based and computer based techniques for JA skill training while delivering different types of JA cues . However robot assisted techniques are powerful but suffer from limitations such as high cost restricted flexibility etc . Thus researchers are exploring the use of computer based techniques for JA skill training since it can be controllable flexible cost effective more accessible etc . With the advent of rich graphics researchers are augmenting computer based interfaces with Virtual Reality while designing Human Computer Interaction based JA tasks . Given the importance of VR enabled HCI based JA training platform studying the comparative potential of different types of JA cues implemented using a VR enabled HCI based task platform is important . In this research work we presented a VR enabled HCI based JA task platform that can deliver avatar mediated and environment triggered JA cues of varying information content . Results of a preliminary study with twenty typically developing and twenty age matched children with ASD indicate differentiated implications of JA cues of varying information content on one s functional and physiological measures .

@highlight We designed a VR enabled HCI based JA task platform for children with ASD .
@highlight Gaze based JA cue can cause discomfort in children with ASD evident from physiology .
@highlight Children with ASD are comfortable with finger pointing based JA cue .
@highlight Appropriate JA cue can improve their JA skill related task performance .
@highlight Typically Developing children are equally good with varying types of JA cues .
