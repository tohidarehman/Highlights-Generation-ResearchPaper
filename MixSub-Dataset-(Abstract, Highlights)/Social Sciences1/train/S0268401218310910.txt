 Financial decisions are often based on classification models which are used to assign a set of observations into predefined groups . Different data classification models were developed to foresee the financial crisis of an organization using their historical data . One important step towards the development of accurate financial crisis prediction model involves the selection of appropriate variables which are relevant for the problems at hand . This is termed as feature selection problem which helps to improve the classification performance . This paper proposes an Ant Colony Optimization based financial crisis prediction model which incorporates two phases ACO based feature selection algorithm and ACO based data classification algorithm . The proposed ACO FCP model is validated using a set of five benchmark dataset includes both qualitative and quantitative . For feature selection design the developed ACO FS method is compared with three existing feature selection algorithms namely genetic algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm and Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm . In addition a comparison of classification results is also made between ACO DC and state of art methods . Experimental analysis shows that the ACO FCP ensemble model is superior and more robust than its counterparts . In consequence this study strongly recommends that the proposed ACO FCP model is highly competitive than traditional and other artificial intelligence techniques .
