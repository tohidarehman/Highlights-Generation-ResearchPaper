 The COVID 19 pandemic has had massive implications for the nature of work and the role technology plays in the workplace . Organisations have been forced into rapid big bang introduction of technology and tech driven practices in an unprecedented and time pressured manner . In many cases there has been little training or reflection on how the practices and associated technology should be introduced and integrated or adapted to suit the new workplace context . We argue that there is a need for a more reflective normalisation of work practices and the role technology plays . The paper draws on normalisation process theory and its underlying components of cohesion cognitive participation collective action and reflexive monitoring . As an exemplar we focus on the changing nature of work and adoption of remote working practices . The paper uses NPT to examine current thinking and approaches and offering some guidelines to inform research and practice .
