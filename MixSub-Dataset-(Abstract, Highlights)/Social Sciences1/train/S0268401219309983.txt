 In the current socio economic environment to face challenges such as the emergence of new technologies globalisation and increasing demands from their clients it is inevitable that enterprises will collaborate with others and progressively shift their boundaries . In this context interoperability has become a prerequisite in the jigsaw of such collaboration . By definition it is entities ability to work together as an organisation . This ability spans a wide range of aspects embracing both technical and business issues . Over the past decade both the concept and the context of interoperability have been extended from a largely IT focused domain to a business focused domain and the evaluation of interoperability has become a rising concern . An increasing number of studies have concentrated on not just digital but business aspects of human behaviour in the social environment . In general the wider application domain is the assessment of the interoperability of information systems and processes in any organisation that needs multiple processes to interact effectively .

@highlight Using metrics for interoperability assessment is applicable and useful.
@highlight Extra metrics are recommended to add into the framework e.g. human resources and change management are also important for interoperability evaluation.
@highlight Technology alone cannot resolve business processes interoperability problems.
@highlight Human resources is a critical component for interoperability.
