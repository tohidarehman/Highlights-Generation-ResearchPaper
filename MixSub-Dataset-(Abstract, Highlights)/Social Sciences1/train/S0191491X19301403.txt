 Schools are among the most studied organizations yet research has little influence on them . This is in part because schools often do not have an opportunity to learn from the research projects they are engaged in . In this paper we explain the process and impact of feeding back research results to participating schools . The feedback of results related to the topic of student participation was designed in a school specific way and expected to support school improvement processes . Accordingly we examined changes in beliefs and school practices by analysing longitudinal qualitative interviews . Results show changes in school practices and in the perceived importance of student participation as well as enduring beliefs that inhibited changes . The findings of this paper contribute to the discourse on data use in education and to building research practice partnerships .
