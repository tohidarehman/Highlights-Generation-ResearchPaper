 The present study examined the underlying mechanism of self presentation on emerging social networking sites where features facilitating simulation of real life communication are plenty . Although previous scholars have examined self presentation on social media very few have investigated the combined influences of extrinsic media features and intrinsic personality trait in orchestrating self presentation on Instagram a platform that is highly popular among young adults . Specifically based on the concepts from media richness theory and survey data collected from 671 young adults our study showed that perceived media richness of Instagram was positively associated with the young adults self presentation on the platform which in turn enhanced their friendship development . Mediation analyses demonstrated that perceived functionality mediated the association between perceived media richness and self presentation on Instagram . Additionally tests of moderated mediation indicated that the indirect effect was stronger for young adults who were low on openness . Results underscore the importance of identifying the underlying processes that moderate the mediation between perceived media richness and self presentation .
