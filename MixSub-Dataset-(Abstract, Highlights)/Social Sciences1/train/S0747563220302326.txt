 Males have been proposed to be more vulnerable to internet addiction than females . However males and females may differ with respect to specific patterns and types of internet usage and related IA . To investigate further a meta analysis was conducted to investigate gender related differences in internet gaming disorder and social media addiction . The current meta analysis aimed to quantify gender related effect sizes relating to IGD and SMA examine potential moderating influences of regions and other possible confounds and compare the findings with generalized IA at the country level . The meta analysis comprised 53 effect sizes with 82 440 individuals from 21 countries regions for IGD and 41 effect sizes with 58 336 individuals from 22 countries regions for SMA . A random effects model confirmed important gender specific distinctions as men were more likely to exhibit IGD than women

@highlight Gender differences exist globally in specific internet use behaviors disorders.
@highlight Higher levels of internet gaming disorder IGD exist in males.
@highlight Higher levels of social media addiction SMA exist in females.
@highlight The moderating influence of region existed in IGD and SMA.
@highlight Studies of IGD and SMA may unmask features lost in studies of internet addiction.
