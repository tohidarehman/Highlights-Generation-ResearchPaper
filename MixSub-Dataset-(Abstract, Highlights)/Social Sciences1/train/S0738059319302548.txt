 There have been many studies of the socio economic background of students in developed countries but apart from extensive commentary on the gender gap far fewer in developing countries . In Africa this is mostly because the University record systems do not record corresponding data and because the international standard household surveys such as DHS only ask about educational attainment of household members which of course mainly excludes current students . This paper uses the record systems of the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences and specifically the Pre Assessment form completed by all students on entry with information about their parental background .

@highlight No data about in equalities of access to Higher Education in Sub Saharan Africa.
@highlight Unique data on socio economic background of students to a graduate programme.
@highlight Course is entirely funded because there is no access for poor African students.
@highlight Analysis of questionnaire completed on entry shows that students are relatively rich.
@highlight Rather sad similarity with situation prevailing in Europe 50 years ago.
