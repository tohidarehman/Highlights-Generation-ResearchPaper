 In this opinion paper I argue that the Covid 19 pandemic as tragic and disastrous as it undoubtedly is has also given us a rare opportunity to deeply examine the research and practice of information management in particular and information systems in general . To cope with the pandemic we have retreated to the digital world and drastically changed the way we work . Yet these very practices can well shape the way we work in the post pandemic world . Moreover the pandemic is also a sharp lens through which we can study deep rooted theoretical issues that otherwise would not have surfaced or at least remained in the background . My call to the research community is to seize this rare opportunity .

@highlight The Covid 19 pandemic is a rare opportunity to examine some fundamental aspects of IM and IS research and practice.
@highlight There are at least three areas where the pandemic has impacted practice information management work practices and design of technologies.
@highlight The IS discipline has appropriate methods and theories to study the design of technologies and social interactions.
@highlight Concepts such as social distancing that has emerged in the pandemic need to be studied through philosophical premises.
@highlight The IM practices that emerge after the pandemic is over will be shaped by how well we seize the opportunity to learn from the pandemic.
