 Cognitive diagnostic assessment allows for diagnosing second language learners strengths and weaknesses of attributes in a specific domain . Exploring the little known territory of CDA the current study retrofitted the reading section of the International English Language Testing System with a cognitive diagnostic model . It aimed to identify the attributes involved in successfully implementing IELTS reading analyze the overall and individual test takers reading performance and finally explore the IELTS reading differences of Iranian students in engineering and veterinary domains . Based on think aloud protocols and expert judgement an initial Q matrix was developed . Using R package CDM the generalized deterministic inputs noisy and gate model was applied to IELTS reading data to refine and validate the initial Q matrix and estimate the mastery probabilities of 1025 test takers on each attribute . The final Q matrix consisted of 6 attributes assumed to be involved in IELTS reading . Moreover the overall test takers and the individuals demonstrated different mastery non mastery across the 6 IELTS reading attributes on both macro and micro levels . Further significant differences were found between IELTS reading performances of Iranian engineering and veterinary students . The findings supported the assumption that CDA can provide instructors and IELTS candidates with detailed diagnostic feedback to promote test takers IELTS reading performance .

@highlight The G DINA model was applied to IELTS reading data of Iranian EAP students.
@highlight The final CDA Q matrix consisted of 6 attributes in IELTS reading.
@highlight Test takers demonstrated different mastery probabilities.
@highlight Cross major reading performances were found.
@highlight CDA provided detailed diagnostic feedback.
