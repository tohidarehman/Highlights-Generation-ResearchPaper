This new environment has provided unprecedented opportunities for the information management research community to develop research that will have a significant impact on practice in these and other areas . We are essentially at the pinnacle of new developments in the digital space and must seek to develop exemplars that can help to signpost the future direction of digital global society for the benefit of all . Notwithstanding the problems of digitalization have also been exacerbated and must be further understood and ameliorated in the post COVID world . This paper examines opportunities and problems in information management brought about by the COVID 19 pandemic . It details implications for research and practice .
