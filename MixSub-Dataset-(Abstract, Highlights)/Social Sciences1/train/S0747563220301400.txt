 Recent development in human computer interfaces including electronic gaming machines and online gambling has exposed novices to the risks of gambling related harm . Interface characteristics not only reflect the structure of the game they also shape users sense of agency concerning their gambling . Although studies have indicated the importance of causal attribution in risky gambling the roles of the sense of agency and its largest factor predictability remains unclear . Therefore we assessed the impact of interface predictability on gambling tendencies . Participants played a computerized card guessing game on two interfaces with distinct visual feedback predictability related to users card choice operation . Between these interfaces we compared participants subjective estimation of win probability and their wager history in each trial . Their subjective win probability did not differ between conditions . Intriguingly participants only decreased their wagers following a loss when the interface was predictable but not when it was unpredictable . Moreover the effects of predictability of a winning run depended on individual difference in illusory control . This study provides evidence that feeling of agency mediates the impact of interface features on gambling . This may contribute to interface design for a healthy gambling experience .

@highlight The association between sense of agency and HCI based gambling behavior was unclear.
@highlight We examined the impact of interface predictability on users gambling behavior.
@highlight Users subjective win probability did not differ between predictability conditions.
@highlight Users decreased their wagers following a loss when the interface was predictable.
@highlight The feeling of agency might meditate the impacts of interface features on gambling.
