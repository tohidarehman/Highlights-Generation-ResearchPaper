 This paper explores the barriers and drivers of diffusion associated with permissionless and permissioned blockchains seeking to establish whether they are the same or different and whether barriers and drivers change over time . The study was undertaken in two stages interviews in 2016 that examine the barriers and drivers of diffusion followed by a case study in 2019 of the Italian wine industrys permissioned blockchain . The results show that diffusion is reaching a final stage for permissionless blockchains but is lagging behind for permissioned blockchains due to the different barriers and drivers of diffusion .

@highlight A study of permissionless and permissioned blockchain diffusion.
@highlight Permissioned blockchain diffusion is lagging well behind the diffusion of permissionless blockchains.
@highlight Barriers and drivers of diffusion are different for each type of blockchain.
@highlight Barriers and drivers of diffusion change over time initial barriers may be surmounted and become features or drivers.
@highlight Drivers of one type of technology may be drivers for another type.
