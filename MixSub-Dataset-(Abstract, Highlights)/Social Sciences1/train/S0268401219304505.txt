 Immunization is an indispensable mechanism for preventing infectious diseases in modern society and vaccine safety is closely related to public health and national security . However issues such as vaccine expiration and vaccine record fraud are still widespread in vaccine supply chains . Therefore an effective management system for the supervision of vaccine supply chains is urgently required . As the next generation of core technology after the Internet blockchain is designed to build trust mechanisms that can change current information management methods . Meanwhile the development of machine learning technologies provides additional ways to analyze the data in information management systems . The main objective of this study is to develop a vaccine blockchain system based on blockchain and machine learning technologies . This vaccine blockchain system is designed to support vaccine traceability and smart contract functions and can be used to address the problems of vaccine expiration and vaccine record fraud . Additionally the use of machine learning models can provide valuable recommendations to immunization practitioners and recipients allowing them to choose better immunization methods and vaccines .

@highlight A detailed vaccine blockchain system is designed for Vaccine Supply and Supervision.
@highlight Machine learning based intelligent recommendation modules for vaccine management are designed and tested.
@highlight Smart contracts and vaccine coin are designed to query and supervise vaccine information.
