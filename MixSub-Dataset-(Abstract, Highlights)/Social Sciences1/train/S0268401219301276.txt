 In this paper we study the role of temporal coordination in managing the early stages of innovation in the context of virtual teams . Following a comparative case study approach we detail the role of temporal coordination through the study of two contrasting virtual teamsone with a 24 h lifespan and one with a five month lifespanfrom two Industry Academia collaboration projects . Our approach was longitudinal capturing virtual team activities from start to end of each project and involved multiple data collection methods including observations and interviews . The findings reveal that the virtual team lifespan influences the type of temporal coordination that emerges . In virtual teams with short lifespans

@highlight The virtual team lifespan influences what coordination practices will emerge.
@highlight Two temporal coordination practices were identified

@highlight Tight coordination helps to reduce uncertainty in the fuzzy front end.
@highlight Loose coordination allows dispersed members to work complementarily together.
