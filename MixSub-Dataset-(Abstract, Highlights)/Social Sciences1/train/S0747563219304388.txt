Citation analysis identifies the journals and publications that have received the most attention in this field . Factor and social network analyses reveal that online gambling and gaming literature consists of six main research streams . The results advance our understanding of these streams including their most representative articles their key themes their network connectedness and their temporal development . Based on the findings this study proposes directions for future research .
