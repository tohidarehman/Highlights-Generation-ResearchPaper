 Extant research examines the factors that cause the initial adoption of digital technologies like mobile wallets with limited focus on post adoption behaviours . This work proposes a novel extended expectationconfirmation model which explores the impact of pre adoption expectancies and confirmation on post adoption satisfaction and continuance intentions . The model also explores the roles played by the post adoption factors like perceived user interface quality perceived security and self efficacy . The findings indicate that pre adoption performance effort expectancies impact consumption driven confirmation which in turn affects the post adoption perceived usefulness post adoption perceived security and user satisfaction . Further satisfaction post adoption self efficacy and post adoption perceived usefulness are found to be strong antecedents of the users continuance intention . The framework contributes to the extant research by integrating both pre and post adoption constructs that determine post adoption continuance intentions . The framework also guides the M wallet application developers to enhance user satisfaction and continuance intentions by meeting their pre adoption expectations through consumption driven confirmation in order to stay relevant in an extremely competitive m payments business .
