 Virtual worlds can provide a safe place for social movements of marginal and oppressed groups such as lesbian gay bisexual and transgender . When the virtual safe places are under threat the inhabitants of a virtual world register protests which have critical implications for the real world issues . The nature of emancipatory practices such as virtual protests in the digital realm research remains somewhat under explored . Specifically it remains to be seen how the oppressed communities such as LGBT take radical actions in virtual worlds in order to restore the imbalance of power . We conducted a 35 month netnographic study of an LGBT social movement in World of Warcraft . The lead researcher joined the LGBT social movement and data was captured through participant observations discussion forums and chat logs . Drawing on the critical theory of Michel Foucault we present empirical evidence that illuminates emancipatory social movement practices in an online virtual world . The findings suggest that there are complex power relations in a virtual world and when power balance is disrupted LGBT players form complex ways to register protests which invoke strategies to restore order in the virtual fields .
