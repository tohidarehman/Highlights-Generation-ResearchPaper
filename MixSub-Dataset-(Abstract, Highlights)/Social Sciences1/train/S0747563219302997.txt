 Data and theory have generated mixed results about the positive versus negative psychological effects of massively multiplayer role playing games . Such games provide opportunities to interact with others in ways that can foster cooperation and social support from others however they can facilitate social aggression and peer victimization as well . The current study involved multi group path analysis of survey data obtained from 337 frequent MMORPG users . The paper proposes and supports a Compensatory Social Interaction model in which MMORPG play was simultaneously associated with healthy outcomes as a function of higher online social support and adverse outcomes as a function of online peer victimization . These countervailing processes offset one another ostensibly suggesting that MMORPG use was unassociated with these outcomes however follow up analyses revealed that the kind of outcome depended on individuals levels of online social support versus victimization . Results are interpreted in light of the Compensatory Social Interaction model and possible clinical applications .
