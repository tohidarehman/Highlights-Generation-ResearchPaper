 Research indicates that instructional aspects of teacher performance are the most difficult to reach consensus on significantly limiting teacher observation as a way to systematically improve instructional practice . Understanding the rationales that raters provide as they evaluate teacher performance with an observation protocol offers one way to better understand the training efforts required to improve rater accuracy . The purpose of this study was to examine the accuracy of raters evaluating special education teachers implementation of evidence based math instruction . A mixed methods approach was used to investigate 1 the consistency of the raters application of the scoring criteria to evaluate teachers lessons 2 raters accuracy on two lessons with those given by expert raters and 3 the raters understanding and application of the scoring criteria through a think aloud process . The results show that raters had difficulty understanding some of the high inference items in the rubric and applying them accurately and consistently across the lessons . Implications for rater training are discussed .

@highlight Special education teachers do not receive training in math content pedagogy.
@highlight Observation tools aligned with EBPs offer one way to improve practice.
@highlight Rater feedback must be accurate and consistent to improve teacher practice.
