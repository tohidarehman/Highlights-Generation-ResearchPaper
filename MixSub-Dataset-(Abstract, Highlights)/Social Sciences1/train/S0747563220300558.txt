 Online sexual activities are any sexual behaviours done using the Internet and are divided into non arousal partnered arousal and solitary arousal activities . The means of accessing the Internet have extended past the traditional home computer and the rapid evolution of personal digital devices has led to a lag in the measurement of OSA . The current study s aim is to explore a new measurement scale that considers the widespread use of personal digital devices and examines gender differences in OSA . Results show that the suggested scale is a reliable measurement of OSA . Women engaged in more partnered arousal activities whereas men engaged in more solitary arousal activities . Computer use was the preferred method for OSA overall but smartphone apps were the preferred method for partnered arousal activities . Some implications for parents and educators clinicians and researchers as well as limitations inviting to further research are provided as OSA is an emerging but rapidly evolving field of investigation .
