 Smart home technologies such as smart thermostats are a growing commercial opportunity . SHTs can offer a broad spectrum of potential functional experiential and esthetic benefits yet much of the prior research on the adoption of SHTs has been limited by a narrow TAM based functional view . Relatively little is known about the salient user beliefs related to the experiential and esthetic benefits of SHTs that may affect SHT adoption . To address this gap in research we conduct a mixed methods study wherein we inductively develop a set of factors that reflect salient user considerations associated with smart thermostats and we examine the effects of the elicited factors on the smart thermostat adoption intention . We find that performance expectancy emphasized by TAM has a relatively minor effect on the smart thermostat adoption intention and effort expectancy has no effect at all . We identify a novel factor which we term

@highlight We elicit and analyze the effects of perceived benefits and concerns on the smart thermostats adoption intention.
@highlight We find that a novel factor that we term techno coolness is the most important predictor of the adoption intention.
@highlight We also find that compatibility concerns are an important consideration in the smart thermostat adoption intention.
