 Marketers increasingly use social media platforms as a promotion channel and doing this they prefer highly interactive social media because it allows consumers to socialize and network better . However in this media attention is often restricted towards primary purpose only as a result of the level of interactivity thereby affecting consumer response towards the advertisement . In this setting the study analyzes the role of media interactivity and the effects it has on the reaction of customers towards the social media ad . Further the study also introduces the conditional role of message relevant aspects such as message vividness and anthropomorphism and examines the intervening role of flow experience . Results from a between subjects study indicate that interactivity hurts the consumer ad reactions . It also suggests that the right use of message relevant aspects can mitigate these adverse effects . Thus the study makes a significant contribution to the literature and practice regarding the effects of social media interactivity which is relatively recent and has been overlooked by past researchers .
