 Despite the importance of both research and teaching doctoral and postdoctoral programs tend to focus on research . One approach to address the lack of teaching development for early career researchers is to train them on instruction . The purpose of this two year study was to examine the effects of a Teaching Development Institute on ECRs intended teaching strategies course planning beliefs about instructors and students knowledge and instructional self efficacy . We used the Approaches to Teaching and the College Teaching Self Efficacy instruments in a one group pretest posttest design . The sample was 109 and 140 ECRs who participated at the Teaching Institute at Johns Hopkins University in 2018 and 2019 respectively . The results of the Wilcoxon signed ranks test indicated that the TDI intervention was effective . The theoretical implications of the paper include reinterpreting the ATI according to the interactive constructive active and passive cognitive engagement framework and proposing the professional development to student achievement model .
