 Pharmacy students undertake experiential learning to prepare them for practice . With the move to more patient facing roles there is a need to assess if the experiential learning prepares students for practice . A mixed methods study was undertaken to obtain the feedback of graduates currently in pre registration training on their experiential learning experience . There were 63 responses to the online survey . One focus group consisting of four graduates and ten one on one interviews were conducted . Placement experience was dependent on tutors and placement sites . There was displeasure with community placements as they were relegated to dispensing duties but satisfaction with their hospital experience despite only being allowed to shadow tutors . The limited duration of placements was highlighted especially in hospital settings . Tutor training is key to ensuring students have an optimum experience . Sites should be made to see the value of having students so that they are allowed patient contact .
