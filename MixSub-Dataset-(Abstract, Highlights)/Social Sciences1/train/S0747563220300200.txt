 University students often engage in multimedia and nonmultimedia off task multitasking behaviors during courses . The aim of the present study was to describe these off task multitasking behaviors and analyze their effects on learning performance in a real teaching session . More specifically 187 students attended a cognitive psychology tutorial as usual taking notes either on paper or on a laptop . In an effort to preserve the ecological setting they were not informed of our research on multitasking . After 20min students had to report the number and duration of off task multitasking behaviors they had engaged in and complete a learning questionnaire . Results showed that multimedia and nonmultimedia multitasking behaviors were frequent but also additive especially among students who used a laptop . These behaviors had a negative impact on students memorization of course content although we found no significant effects on comprehension . Our study also showed that students who used a laptop had lower memory scores . A mediation analysis confirmed that this deleterious effect was partly attributable to multitasking . These results are discussed in terms of interference between off task behaviors and the cognitive processes essential for learning .

@highlight We studied off task multitasking effects on learning in a real life teaching session.
@highlight Students engaged in numerous multimedia and nonmultimedia multitasking behaviors.
@highlight Multitasking behaviors had a negative impact on the memorization of lecture content.
@highlight Students who used a laptop engaged in more multitasking and had lower memory scores.
