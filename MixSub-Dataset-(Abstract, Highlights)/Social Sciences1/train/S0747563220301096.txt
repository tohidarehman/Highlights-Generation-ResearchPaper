 Gamification has been a new trend in hiring and staffing influencing companies selection procedures . To explore applicant reactions to this new trend two studies were conducted . First following an experimental design we explored whether applicants perceived a gamified assessment method more favorably in terms of satisfaction predictive validity and fairness than its traditional version as well as their levels of organizational attractiveness . Second to get further insight into the factors that might influence applicant reactions towards a gamified assessment method we explored the potential impact of personality . Our findings indicated that applicants report higher levels of process satisfaction and in turn perceived fairness and organizational attractiveness when the gamified assessment method is used compared to its traditional version whereas the role of openness to experience was not supported . The role of gamification in employee selection as well as the practical implications of enhancing the assessment methods with game elements are discussed .
