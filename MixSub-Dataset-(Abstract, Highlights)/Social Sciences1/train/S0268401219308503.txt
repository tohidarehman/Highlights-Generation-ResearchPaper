 Drawing on the stressor strain outcome framework this study investigates how information irrelevance and overload induce social network fatigue and the relationship of these variables to users information avoidance behavior . It also examines the conditions under which social network fatigue is more likely to be translated into information avoidance behavior . The analysis of data collected from 341 users of WeChat Moments suggests that information irrelevance directly leads to information avoidance behavior and social media fatigue as a mediator partially mediates the impact of information overload on information avoidance behavior and fully mediates the impact of social overload on information avoidance behavior . Furthermore time pressure strengthens the effect of social network fatigue on information avoidance behavior . This study fulfills the identified need for an in depth investigation of actual discontinuous behavior in social network services by investigating information avoidance behavior and its antecedents . The findings provide SNSs providers with guidelines on how to manage users behavior so that they remain active users of the SNSs .
