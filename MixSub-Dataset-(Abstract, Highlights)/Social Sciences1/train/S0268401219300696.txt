 Information systems research provides increasing evidence that women and men differ in their use of information technology . However research has not sufficiently explained why these differences exist . Using the theory of reasoned action and social role theory this paper investigates gender differences in peoples decisions about information sharing in the context of social networking sites . We developed a comparative model of the information sharing decision process across genders and theoretically explained why these differences exist . Data was collected from an online survey taken by American SNS users . We found that privacy risks social ties and commitment were more important in the formation of attitudes toward information sharing for women than men . Gender significantly moderates the relationship between peoples perceptions of information sharing and their intention to share information . This paper provides an enhanced understanding of gender differences in peoples decisions about sharing information on SNSs . It advances gender differences research into the use of newly emerged information technology and provides researchers insightful views of the role that gender plays in the social media era . Being aware of the research findings practitioners may better engage their targeted stakeholders on SNSs and collect more useful information for business purposes .
