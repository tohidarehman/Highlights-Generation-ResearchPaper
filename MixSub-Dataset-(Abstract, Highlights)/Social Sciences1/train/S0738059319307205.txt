 This paper estimates the local efficiency of the public provision of education in Colombia between 2008 and 2013 . Since the decentralization process in 1991 local authorities have spent an increasing amount of resources in the provision of education services . The empirical analysis relies on a multiproduct function that assesses public performance considering two types of education products quality and enrolment . Results for Colombian municipalities show efficiencies that vary between 26 and 98 suggesting that better results in quality and enrolment in public education could be accomplished using the same resources . Possible sources of inefficiency are explored such as institutional environment and fiscal autonomy . Differing regional patterns are observed for the cases of education quality and enrolment .

@highlight Estimate the efficiency of local public provision of education in a context of multiple outputs of quality and enrollment.
@highlight Three output distant models are estimated.
@highlight Some municipalities could obtain better educational results in quality and enrolment without increasing their inputs.
@highlight Regional patterns of efficiency measures are observed differing for quality and enrolment models.
@highlight Results suggest that educational policies should have different priorities according to the region of the country.
