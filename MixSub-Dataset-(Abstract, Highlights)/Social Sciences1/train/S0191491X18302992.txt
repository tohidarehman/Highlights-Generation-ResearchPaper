 This empirical study aimed to investigate the impact of easy first vs. hard first ordering of the same items in a paper and pencil multiple choice exam on the performances of low moderate and high achiever examinees as well as on the item statistics . Data were collected from 554 Turkish university students using two test forms which included the same multiple choice items ordered reversely i.e . easy first vs. hard first . Tests included 26 multiple choice items about the introductory unit of Measurement and Assessment course . The results suggested that sequencing the multiple choice items in either direction from easy to hard or vice versa did not affect the test performances of the examinees no matter whether they are low moderate or high achiever examinees . Finally no statistically significant difference was observed between item statistics of both forms i.e . the difficulty discrimination point biserial and adjusted point biserial coefficients .

@highlight Multiple choice items are one of the most commonly used objective item formats.
@highlight Unfavorable item order in terms of item difficulty can be a source of random error.
@highlight Low moderate and high achievers reaction to item order is underresearched.
@highlight The effect of difficulty based item order on test performance was examined.
@highlight Difficulty based item order have no effect on test performance and item statistics.
