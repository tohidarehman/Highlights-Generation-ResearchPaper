 Behavioral determinants of cybersecurity have gained greater attention among information technology experts in recent years . However drivers of risky cybersecurity behavior have not been widely studied . This exploratory study examines the extent to which risky cybersecurity behavior is predicted by factors of cybersecurity related avoidance behavior . Self reported risky cybersecurity behavior was examined in light of technology threat avoidance factors in a sample of 184 working adults in the United States . Risky behaviors were measured using the instrument by Hadlington previously used by researchers to measure behavioral associations with non technology threat avoidance related items . Hierarchical regression noted significant predictive associations between several technology threat avoidance factors and self reported risky cybersecurity behavior perceived susceptibility perceived cost and self efficacy . Combined these variables explained 9.4 of the adjusted variance in levels of risky cybersecurity behavior . Effect size calculations revealed predictive impacts in the low medium range . Age was also confirmed as a confounding covariate . The impact findings uniquely distinguish this study from previous works . Findings also infer that training in protective behavior can mitigate a significant portion of risky cybersecurity behavior .

@highlight Workplace cybersecurity risks include systems specific and human behavioral concerns.
@highlight Impacts of protective inclinations on risky cybersecurity behavior have not been widely studied.
@highlight Technology threat avoidance factors were analyzed regarding risky cybersecurity behavior by 184 working adults in the US.
@highlight Perceived susceptibility perceived cost and self efficacy significantly predicted risky cybersecurity behavior.
@highlight The predictors explained approximately 9.4 of variance in risky cybersecurity behavior by participants.
