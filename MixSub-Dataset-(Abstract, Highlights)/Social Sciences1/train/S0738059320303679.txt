 Of the approximately 93 million children with moderate or severe disabilities around the world large numbers do not have access to quality education . Inclusive education systems have been advocated as a solution to this problem . In this paper we examine whether legislation to advance inclusive education can increase the likelihood of children with disabilities attending school in a low income country . Using a difference in difference methodology we find that children with visual hearing and physical disabilities who began school at a time when inclusive education was guaranteed in Uganda had a significantly higher likelihood of going to school than children with disabilities in comparator countries in Sub Saharan Africa as well as children with disabilities in Uganda who became of school age prior to the passage of legislation . However this was no longer true when considering only the sample of children reported to have no ability to see hear or engage in physical activities . While our findings are promising comparable data on more countries are needed to comprehensively examine the impact of similar legislation across multiple settings .

@highlight We examine whether inclusive education legislation can increase the likelihood of children with disabilities attending school.
@highlight We use difference in difference estimation with Uganda as the treatment country and Chad and Ghana as the control countries.
@highlight The sample comprises of children aged 5 9 with visual hearing and physical disabilities.
@highlight We find that Ugandan children with disabilities are associated with a greater likelihood of attending school relative to the control group.
@highlight This is a first step towards understanding the influence of inclusive education laws that operate at scale especially in lower income settings.
