 Scholars disagree on the extent to which low fee private schools can adequately supply education to poor children in developing countries . This article contributes to the debate with a qualitative study in the Chinese context where privatization of education intersects with rural urban migration . Using grounded theory approach I examine how these schools aid or hinder migrant childrens settlement and integration in the host city . Fieldwork in the countrys interior region reveals that migrant schools are oriented toward meeting the immediate needs of migrant families but at the cost of childrens future prospects . The conclusion discusses implications for equitable urbanization .

@highlight The merits of low fee private schools are not as well known in China as elsewhere.
@highlight Migrant schools as they are called in China can better meet the immediate needs of migrant families.
@highlight But they do not prepare students well for transition into public schools.
@highlight Cities should speed up educational integration and in the meantime provide more funding support for migrant schools.
