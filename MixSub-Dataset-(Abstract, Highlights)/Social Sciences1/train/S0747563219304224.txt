 Using online learning communities from the Internet as informal learning environments raises the question how likely these communities will integrate learners as new members i.e . how integrative these OLCs will be . Such prediction is the purpose of the current study . To achieve this an identification method of the central intermediate and peripheral OLC layers is proposed . Based on the CSCL approaches of voices interanimation and polyphony an advanced natural language processing framework was employed for dialog analysis in N 20 integrative vs. non integrative blog based OLCs involving 2342 users over one year . Hierarchical clusters built upon communicative centrality reflect socio cognitive structures including central intermediate and peripheral OLC members . The resulting clusters were assigned to the central intermediate and peripheral community layers with 55100 consistency whereas most consistent identification criterion of the socio cognitive OLC structures was the outdegree centrality followed by the blog owner inclusion the numbers of participants eccentricity and indegree centrality . Subsequently OLC integrativity was predicted with up to 90 accuracy based on topic complexity socio cognitive structure and automatically assessed dialog characteristics . Consequences for further research and educational practice are discussed .

@highlight Using online learning communities for learning is a matter of integrativity.
@highlight We predicted integrativity i.e. how likely online communites integrate newcomers.
@highlight The prediction was based on automated dialog analysis in blogger communities.
@highlight We analyzed N 20 blogger communities involving 2342 users.
@highlight We reached 90 prediction accuracy based on text complexity and other indicators.
