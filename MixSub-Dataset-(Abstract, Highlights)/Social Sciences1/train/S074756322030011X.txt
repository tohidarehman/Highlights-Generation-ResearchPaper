 We investigate how human beliefs are associated with the absorption of specialist knowledge that is required to produce cyber security . We ground our theorizing in the knowledge based view of the firm and transaction cost economics . We test our hypotheses with a sample of 262 members of an information sharing and analysis center who share sensitive information related to cyber security . Our findings suggest that resource belief usefulness belief and reciprocity belief are all positively associated with knowledge absorption whereas reward belief is not . The implications of these findings for practitioners and future research are discussed .
