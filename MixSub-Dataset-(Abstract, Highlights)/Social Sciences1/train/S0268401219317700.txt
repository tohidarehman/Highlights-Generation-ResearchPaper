 Using technology to facilitate learning in universities and other higher education institutions has become common practice due to its ability to reduce barriers related to time and space in traditional learning environments . However current literature mostly focuses on the use of the technology and not on the use of the information it conveys . Also very few studies focus on technology adoption in universities and HEIs in developing countries especially those in Africa . Thus we propose a model that explains the changing information behaviors of students in this digital age and the effect this has on their learning outcomes . We collected questionnaire data from 303 students and analyzed the data using structural equation modelling partial least squares . We found that our proposed model explains 60.2 of student satisfaction 24.2 of academic performance 24.1 of information sharing and 19.8 of their information exchange behavior . This study confirms that the use of digital information and its antecedent factors have significant effects on the college experience of students . This has several implications for information systems research and practice especially in the design and assessment of technology use in learning environments .

@highlight Understanding the information behavior of students is critical for HEIs today.
@highlight Information need and information source are key determinants of digital information use.
@highlight Digital information use strongly influences student performance and engagement.
@highlight The digital divide affects how HEIs deal with digital information literacy.
@highlight Ontology driven models can provide solid theoretical foundations for conceptual modeling.
