 This paper analyses out of school children in Guinea Bissau using a mixed methods approach . The OOSC framework includes primary and lower secondary school aged children who have not yet entered school children who will never enter school and those who have entered but already dropped out . The descriptive summary shows a significant reduction in OOSC in the last 20 years . However universal participation remains elusive due to a number of sociocultural and economic factors along with school supply and access constraints . Furthermore the system is highly inefficient due to high repetition rates and improvements in participation are somewhat misleading given the extensive amount of overage enrolment . The papers main contribution to OOSC research is a detailed analysis of barriers and key bottlenecks based on an OOSC focused qualitative data collection in six regions of the country .

@highlight Present findings from a mixed methods analysis of out of school children.
@highlight Significant decline in educational exclusion in the last 20 years but exclusion continues to be a problem.
@highlight Qualitative data analysis highlights the myriad factors that affect exclusion how they diverge by gender and how they can overlap.
@highlight Qualitative interview subjects include children parents community and religious leaders and school staff.
@highlight Multivariate analysis is used to identify child family and community factors that are associated with school attendance from household survey data.
@highlight Overage enrolment and high repetition rates are endemic throughout the basic education grades.
@highlight Almost all children in Guinea Bissau eventually attend school and they are quite persistent once enrolled they tend to stay in school for at least six years and many remain in basic education well into their late teens and beyond.
