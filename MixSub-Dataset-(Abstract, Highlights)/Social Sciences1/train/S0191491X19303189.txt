 Math attitude refers to emotional responses beliefs and behaviors towards mathematics . Several studies measured the relation with math learning and related variables but very few with statistics learning . To better investigate this relation has become increasingly relevant to have a measure that ensuring multidimensionality and shortness . The aim of the present paper was to confirm the factor structure of the Lin and Huang s ATMI Short Form when administered to Italian college students attending introductory statistics course and to test its measurement invariance applying a multigroup confirmatory analysis . We also assessed the reliability and the incremental validity of the ATMI SF by verifying whether it predicted statistics achievement over and above the effect of math knowledge . The overall findings provide that ATMI SF is a reliable and valid measure to assess math attitude among college students who attend introductory statistics courses in non mathematical courses .

@highlight The ATMI SF psychometric properties in Italian college students are analyzed.
@highlight The factor structure was verified through a cross validation.
@highlight Internal consistency was analyzed using Cronbachs alpha and McDonalds omega.
@highlight The ATMI SF predicts statistics achievement over and above math knowledge.
