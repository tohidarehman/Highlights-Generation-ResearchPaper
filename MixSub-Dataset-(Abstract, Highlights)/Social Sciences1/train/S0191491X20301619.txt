 School inspection is an external evaluation method that aims to promote the improvement of instruction in several European countries . One typical feature of a school inspection is classroom observation . In order to improve the effectiveness of school inspections in enhancing classroom practices in Lower Saxony a follow up classroom observation was implemented at several secondary schools . The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of this treatment on lesson development and its perceived usefulness using an online questionnaire . In total 436 teachers in the treatment group and 161 teachers in the control group participated in the study . The results show a very small effect of follow up classroom observations on lesson development in schools . Teachers rate the usefulness of this intervention as rather low . However follow up classroom observations seem to have a larger impact on lesson development in schools with a lower level of cooperation among teachers .
