 This study aimed to design and validate the Teacher Identity Measurement Scale for assessing primary student teachers professional identity . Based on identity theory and a systematic review into quantitative instruments of teacher identity teacher identity was decomposed in four first order constructs motivation self image self efficacy and task perception . This resulted in a measurement scale consisting of 46 items . The factorial design was examined by administering the TIMS to first and second year primary student teachers . In phase 1 involving 17 students qualitative scale development methods were used to assess the construct validity . In phase 2 its second order factor structure was tested and confirmed among a sample of 211 students . In phase 3 this structure was cross validated among a new sample of 419 students . The instrument may contribute to understanding primary student teachers professional development and can be used as a tool to support the process of developing a professional teacher identity .

@highlight We developed a purely quantitative instrument for measuring teacher identity.
@highlight Teacher identity is considered as a second order construct.
@highlight Teacher identity was decomposed in four first order constructs.
@highlight These constructs are motivation self image self efficacy and task perception.
@highlight qualitative and quantitative scale development approaches were used.
