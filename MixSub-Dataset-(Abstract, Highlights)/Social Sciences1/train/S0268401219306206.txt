 The purpose of this paper is to investigate factors influencing employees knowledge sharing behavior on social tagging supported systems . Using the strong theoretical background of the well known technology acceptance model this paper proposes and empirically validates a model that fits the social and technical nature of social tagging tools within the public sector .

Specifically the following factors showed a significant impact on employees creation and sharing behavior specifically their attitudes towards and intentions to create and share tags perceived ease of use perceived usefulness social presence and pro sharing norms . For researchers the paper offers an opportunity to further study knowledge sharing behavior regarding social media technologies .
