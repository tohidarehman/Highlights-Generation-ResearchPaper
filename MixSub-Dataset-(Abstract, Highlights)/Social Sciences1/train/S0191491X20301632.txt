 In globalization global competence is a crucial competence for graduate students to possess thus graduate education should prepare students with GC to compete globally . However no instrument has been designed to measure graduate students GC and the theoretical structure of GC has not been empirically examined . To fill these gaps first we developed the Global Competence Scale for graduate students based on a three dimensional theoretical framework . Second we administered the GCSG to Chinese graduate students sampled from five universities in Beijing . Third we examined the theoretical framework and examined the reliability and validity of the scale . Finally we described the Chinese graduate student samples GC by using the instrument . The results supported the theoretical model and provided evidence for the reliability and validity of the instrument . We also found that the sample showed higher ratings in knowledge and attitudes but lower ratings in communication skills .

@highlight We constructed an instrument to measure graduate students global competence.
@highlight The instrument was designed using a 3 dimensional and 9 factor theoretical model.
@highlight We collected data from 1421 graduate students at five universities in China.
@highlight We validated the instrument and the theoretical framework using EFA and CFA.
@highlight Chinese students showed high knowledge and attitude but low communication skills.
