 Social mindtools are cloud based and visual thinking oriented tools capable of facilitating synchronous collaboration . Such services have been widely applied to enhancing students collaborative learning . However students continuance intention to use these services has received little scholarly attention . To remedy this limitation we employed a social mindtool to support participants collaborative learning regarding game design and developed a research model as a means to examine their continuance intention to use it . In this model social support and social influence had direct effects on continuance intention while perceived synchronicity affected the latter indirectly . Our research findings suggest that social influence exerted the most significant and direct influence on continuance intention while perceived synchronicity having a critical role though had indirect impact on continuance intention via social support and social influence . These results imply that the synchronicity social mindtools offer will affect students interactions when the tools are applied to students collaborative learning which will further impact on students continuance intention to use the tools and peer opinions will be most valued .

@highlight We examined the factors behind students continued use of social mindtools.
@highlight Social influence exerted the most significant influence on continued use.
@highlight Perceived synchronicity wielded the indirect impact on continuance intention.
