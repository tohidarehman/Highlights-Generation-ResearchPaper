 Since much online shopping is attributed to online impulse buying it is important to define this particular shopping process . This process has three important issues perceived risk for virtual stores as well as e store design and psychological state for online shopping . This is because consumers are both system users and impulse buyers when shopping on e stores . E store design is based on the interaction of customers with e stores and the expectation confirmation model supports examination of this issue with a wide familiarity in IT use . Psychological state is emotional responses to the stimulus of products in e stores and flow theory with task skill and task challenge as precursors is suitable for exploring this issue . Grounding on the three issues this study proposes a new research model with these considerations to thoroughly examine the determinants of online impulse buying . Flow state and customer satisfaction also interact with each other . Empirical research shows an important link for the three defined issues of online impulse buying .
