 Although reports on the success of social commerce indicate an astronomical growth in the next decade understanding the complexities of the antecedents of its continuous use by consumers is limited . This study attempts to bridge this gap by using a mature IS continuance model in the social commerce context . The study also significantly extends this continuance model by theorizing and testing non linear effects . The IS continuance model argues that all the links among confirmation perceived usefulness satisfaction and continuance in the model are positive and linear . However there is a strong theoretical basis to suggest that some relationships in the model are complex and non linear especially the antecedents and consequences of satisfaction . Perceived usefulness is modeled as a second order construct of social hedonic and utility benefits to more richly account for contexts relevant to making continuous use decisions for social commerce . Data from 531 current social commerce users provide support to our assertions . The results revealed quadratic relationships between perceived usefulness and satisfaction and between satisfaction and continuance use intentions . Perceived usefulness has a positive relationship with satisfaction for females and experienced social commerce users but an inverse U relationship for males and inexperienced users . Satisfaction in turn has a positive relationship with continuance use intentions for females but an inverse U relationship for males .
