 The use of augmented reality in education is an emerging trend aimed at improving students learning outcomes and affective factors . This study further investigated the effects of AR learning activities combined with different approaches including teacher centered demonstration and student centered hands on on the conceptual understanding of chemistry and interest in science . Participants of this study included 104 ninth graders from four classes at a junior high school who were taught by the same chemistry teacher . A quasi experimental research design was conducted to compare students pretest immediate posttest and delayed posttest scores . Statistical findings were further supplemented by student interviews toward the activities . Results showed that the hands on learning group performed significantly better on the chemical reactions concept test and interest questionnaire of the immediate posttest than the demonstration learning group . Retention effects also revealed that the students conceptual understanding of chemical elements remained effective four months after completion of the learning activities . No significant decline of situational interest and a slightly upward trend of individual interest were found in both groups . According to the interview responses students were satisfied with the hands on activities and appreciated the opportunity to be active learners . From this study hands on AR could serve as a promising strategy to motivate students in learning chemistry not only for immediate effectiveness but longstanding influence .

@highlight This study compares the hands on and demonstration strategies in augmented reality.
@highlight Conception of chemistry and interest in science were measured in three tests.
@highlight Hands on instruction is effective in improving chemical conception and science interest.
@highlight Improvement of individual interest in science retained after four months.
