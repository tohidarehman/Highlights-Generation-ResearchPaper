 Credit card related over spending represents an important issue for consumers . Over spending arises in parts from reduced payment transparency compared to cash and other payment methods . Additionally week by week credit card spending exhibits high variance even on an intrapersonal level which makes it hard to intuitively learn from prior transactions and control one s spending . As mobile mediated information systems have been proven effective in delivering behavior change interventions this study investigates the efficacy of using a novel smartphone application that increases the salience of credit card transactions to help consumers control their cashless payments better and ultimately spend less . We implemented a goal setting feature and provided weekly goal attainment feedback highlighting ordinary exceptional or both types of purchases . This work was conducted as a field experiment studying a large sample of credit card consumers in the wild over several months which yielded a significant reduction in spending with unobtrusive interventions . It further highlights the importance of including exceptional purchases in households spending budgets and discusses how people adjusted their consumption to lower their expenditures .

@highlight Increasing the salience of credit card transactions helps people reduce spending.

@highlight Highlighting the frequency and volume of exceptional purchases was also ineffective.
@highlight Insights gained from large scale field experiment with credit card transaction data.
