 The goal of this experiment was to investigate the impact of metacognitive training and metacognitive and cognitive prompting in a game based simulation related to demographic change . The work here is based on supporting learning with serious games by scaffolding students self regulated learning by fostering metacognition in constructivist learning environments . The impact of metacognitive training and or cognitive and metacognitive prompting on learning outcomes and cognitive load was analyzed . A pre and post test assessing knowledge acquisition metacognitive behavior and cognitive load were applied . The learning environment was a game based simulation of a small village that was confronted with different problems related to demographic change . Learners were tasked with developing sustainable solutions to keep the village prospering . With regard to knowledge acquisition metacognitive and cognitive prompting proved effective while direct metacognitive training only had a minor effect . The expected interaction effect did not turn out to be statistically significant nor did the results show a reduction of cognitive load through direct or indirect metacognitive and cognitive support . Taken together outcomes suggest here that game based learning with simulations can be supported by direct and indirect metacognitive and cognitive support .

@highlight Metacognitions are fostered during learning with a serious game.
@highlight Results show benefits of metacognitive prompting during gameplay.
@highlight No effect of a short time training of metacognition was found.
@highlight Learning about demographic change can be effectively fostered with a serious game.
