 Young children help people achieve their goals in various situations even in the absence of verbal requests or rewards . Such help is typically described as indiscriminate because children s help is robust across many aspects of the recipient in need . However as previous studies have almost entirely focused on human recipients the question arises as to how indiscriminate children s helping behaviour really is . Here we aimed to investigate whether young children s helping behaviour would extend to a nonhuman entitya humanoid robot . In an experimental between subjects design 40 children witnessed a robot drop an object out of its reach either seemingly intentionally or unintentionally . Results showed that children typically returned the object but only when it was dropped apparently unintentionallyindicating that children attribute goals to a robot understand when it requires help and are motivated to help it . Results of a post test animacy interview were consistent with this interpretation as children attributed affective cognitive and physiological characteristics to the robot . We conclude that the indiscriminate nature of young children s altruistic behaviour extends to humanoid robots . This finding has important theoretical and practical implications for the future development of social robots as well as for the study of children s prosocial behaviour .

@highlight Prior work on children s helping has generally examined helping other humans.
@highlight We examined 3 to 4 year old children s helping behaviour towards a humanoid robot.
@highlight Children were most likely to help the robot when it appeared in need of help.
@highlight Children appear to attribute goals to robots and feel motivated to help them.
@highlight Children attributed animate characteristics to the robot.
