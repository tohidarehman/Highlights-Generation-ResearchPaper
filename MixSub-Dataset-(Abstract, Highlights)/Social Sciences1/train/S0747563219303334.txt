 Mobile financial services help to improve people s lives in developing countries . Recent studies suggest that the lack of skills to use mobile devices is a substantial barrier in the adoption and diffusion of mobile financial services . How inhabitants of developing countries learn skills is largely unknown . We present a field study of learning mobile money skills using a sample of the Ugandan population . The study sample consists of 208 inhabitants from an urban area and 526 inhabitants from a rural area . The data shows that in both studies learning is better explained by social network characteristics compared to attributes of the individual . In particular individuals profit from people in their network if those network connections are skillful regardless of how skilled the learner is . Our results suggest that on top of this direct learning effect learning happens at an accelerated rate in networks that consist of skilled people . Comparing the rural and urban sample we find that network effects are more substantial in the rural area relative to the urban area . The results further reveal that individuals with higher education and better mobile phone skills are less dependent on their networks in learning how to use mobile money .
