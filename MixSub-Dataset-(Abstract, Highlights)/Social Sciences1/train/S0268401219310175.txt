 With the prevalence of digital technologies various services have grown digitalized . Specific to the marketing section multichannel has been gradually replaced by omnichannel which aims to integrate all the physical and digital channels tightly . Although omnichannel has received considerable attention there is still a dearth of research that theorizes the multi faceted impacts of digitalization on omnichannel . This study thus extends social cognitive theory to the digitalized context and contextualizes the digitalized customer and digitalized environment as mobile identity and channel integration quality respectively . Moreover based on the self regulation process of human agency we incorporate omnichannel self efficacy satisfaction and habit as the agentic factors to interpret a customers conscious and unconscious decision making under the omnichannel setting . Through an online survey of 401 omnichannel customers we find support for all the proposed hypotheses . Implications and limitations of this study are further discussed .
