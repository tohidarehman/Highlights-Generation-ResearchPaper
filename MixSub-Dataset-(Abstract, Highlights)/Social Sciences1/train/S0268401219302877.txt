 Employees non compliance with organizational information security policy when using informational resources has become the main reason for continuous security incidents . Drawing upon technology threat avoidance theory and social exchange theory our study investigates the influence of supervisor subordinate guanxi and organizational commitment in the information security management . Our hypotheses were tested using survey data from 235 Chinese government employees . Results not only confirm the direct effect of SSG on government employees ISP compliance but also suggest that SSG indirectly influences compliance behavior via the mediation of organizational commitment . Organizational commitment weakens the negative influence of perceived costs on compliance behavior and also weakens the positive effect of self efficacy on employees ISP compliance . For low commitment employees the negative influence of perceived costs on compliance behavior is more significant than that of those with strong organizational commitment and self efficacy exerts a stronger effect on ISP compliance for low commitment employees than it does for high commitment employees . This study contributes to current literature on information systems by confirming the critical roles of SSG and organizational commitment in motivating employees compliance behavior .
