 Online self presentation behavior has been reported to be associated with purchasing intention in virtual environments but the underlying mechanisms that may mediate or moderate this relationship remain unclear . Based on the self presentation theory this study aims to examine the effect of the mediating role of trust in social networking service games and the moderating role of perceived value in the association between online self image expression and purchase intention . The moderated mediation model was empirically tested with 302 valid data points from WeChat game users . The mediation analysis suggested that online self image expression positively influences trust in SNS games while such trust is not associated with purchase intention regarding virtual goods . In further research tests of moderated mediation indicated that the indirect effects of trust in SNS games play a role for users who perceive virtual goods as having more value . In other words perceived value strengthens the transmission mechanism between online self image expression and purchase intention . Overall these findings shed light on the impact of online self image expression on consumer purchase intention in SNS games . Furthermore this research has theoretical and practical implications .
