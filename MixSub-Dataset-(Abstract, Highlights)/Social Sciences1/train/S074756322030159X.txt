 Experts show better mnemonic performance than novices due to higher number of stored schemas according to cognitive load theory . This advantage is hindered in non optimal situations where experts schemas are sometimes not applicable and may show same or higher cognitive load than novices . Further investigations were however needed to unravel the mechanisms at stake in real life situations . We investigated expert train travelers in normal versus disturb condition using immersion in a virtual environment of a Parisian train station Saint Michel Notre Dame . Our aim was to determine how cognitive load varies according to expertise level of travelers . We measured skin conductance responses for physiological analysis NASA Task Load Index for subjective analysis and factual and spatiotemporal contextual memory investigation for behavioral analysis . As expected expert travelers showed lower cognitive load than novices in normal but not in disturb condition . In fact an expertise reversal effect was observed in disturb context characterized by higher cognitive load in experts for subjective and physiological measures and a lower temporal memory performance . These alterations are believed to be associated with high cognitive load needed for inhibiting the automatized schemas . We provide a novel insight in expertise reversal effect during navigation in an everyday life activity .

@highlight Expertise reversal effect occurs during schema s creation in experts.
@highlight Episodic memory as well as semantic memory are involved in schemas modification.
@highlight Information processing is altered by a non optimal context for experts only.
@highlight Virtual reality allows the investigation of normal and non optimal processes.
@highlight Cognitive load of train travelers vary according to train station s context.
