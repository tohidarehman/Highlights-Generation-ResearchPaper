 The simultaneous engagement in more than one form of media known as media multitasking is an ever increasing phenomenon in our daily lives . Previous studies have associated media multitasking with lower self control greater sensation seeking and inattention which could have detrimental effects on task performance . The current study examined task performance and mind wandering of heavy intermediate and light media multitaskers as a function of task difficulty in an n back task . The results showed that intermediate media multitaskers performed better than heavy media multitaskers at the more difficult than easier levels of the task . The performance of heavy and light media multitaskers did not significantly differ across difficulty levels . Intermediate media multitaskers also mind wandered less than heavy media multitaskers however their mind wandering did not differ from that of light media multitaskers . Thus the results indicate an inverted U shape relationship between media multitasking task performance and mind wandering . The findings further suggest that the association between frequent media multitasking and greater mind wandering may be due to executive function failures as a result of insufficient cognitive control and distraction .

@highlight Media multitasking is an ever increasing phenomenon in our daily lives.
@highlight A moderate amount of media multitasking is associated with optimal task performance.
@highlight Moderate media multitasking is also associated with minimal mind wandering.
@highlight These relationships are more prominent during difficult than easy tasks.
