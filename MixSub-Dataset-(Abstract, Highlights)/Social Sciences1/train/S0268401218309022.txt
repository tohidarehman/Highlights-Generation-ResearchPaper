 The Internet of Things might yield many benefits for organizations but like other technology adoptions may also introduce unforeseen risks and requiring substantial organizational transformations . This paper analyzes IoT adoption by organizations and identifies IoT benefits and risks . A Big Open Linked Data categorization of the expected benefits and risks of IoT is made by conducting a comprehensive literature study . In depth case studies in the field of asset management were then executed to examine the actual experienced real world benefits and risks . The duality of technology is used as our theoretical lens to understand the interactions between organization and technology . The results confirm the duality that gaining the benefits of IoT in asset management produces unexpected social changes that lead to structural transformation of the organization . IoT can provide organizations with many benefits after having dealt with unexpected risks and making the necessary organizational changes . There is a need to introduce changes to the organization processes and systems to develop capabilities and ensure that IoT fits the organizations purposes .
