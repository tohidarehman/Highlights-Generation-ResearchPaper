 Current education reforms have increasingly advocated schools to create facilitative organizational conditions to promote teacher learning . However limited research has examined the effects of different aspects of school organizational conditions on teacher professional learning in China .

Teacher self efficacy significantly mediated the effects of both learning centered leadership and cultural barriers on teacher professional learning . Practical implications are also discussed .
