 In this era of social television we see not only the content of online videos but also how many other viewers are viewing them and how they are reacting to them . Do these metrics about audience size and opinion affect our own reactions And does it matter where these viewers are geographically located We investigated these questions by first proposing a typology of audience cues based on size opinion and identity and then testing the effects of each of these cues through a 2 x 3 x 2 between subjects experiment . We discovered that view counters and comments affect media enjoyment through perceptions of audience size and collective opinion respectively . Theoretical and practical implications are discussed .
