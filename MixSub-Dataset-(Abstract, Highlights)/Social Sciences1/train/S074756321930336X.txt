 Science and engineering education are mostly based on content assimilation and development of skills . However to adequately prepare students for today s world it is also necessary to stimulate critical thinking and make them reflect on how to improve current practices using new tools and technologies . In this line the main motivation of this research consists in exploring ways supported by technology to enhance the learning process of students and to better prepare them to face the challenges of today s world . To this end the purpose of this work is to design an innovative learning project based on collaborative work among students and research its impact in achieving better learning outcomes generating of collective intelligence and further motivation . The proposed collaborative working model is based on peer review assessment methodology implemented through a learning web platform . Thus students were encouraged to peer review their classmates works . They had to make comments suggest improvements and assess final assignments . Teaching staff managed and supervised the whole process . Students were selected from computer science engineering at the University of Alicante . Results suggested greater content assimilation and enhanced learning in several scientific skills . The students final grade exceeded what any student could produce individually but we can not conclude that real collective intelligence was generated . Learning methodologies based on the possibilities of Information and Communication Technologies provide new ways to transmit and manage knowledge in higher education . Collaborating in peer assessment enhances the students motivation and promotes the active learning . In addition this method can be very helpful and time saving for instructors in the management of large groups .

@highlight Improved performance of students is produced through collaborative learning.
