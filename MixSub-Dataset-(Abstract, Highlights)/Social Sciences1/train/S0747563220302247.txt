Such means of contact provide many benefits but could also influence how collaboration partners understand their roles Will a power holder feel responsible for taking care of his or her subordinatesthough s he anticipates meeting these subordinates only virtually but not in person Due to their independence power holders often seem to concentrate on and follow their own personal interests while neglecting their responsibility for otherswhich could be especially likely when expecting digital contact because the former makes others seem less socially close .
