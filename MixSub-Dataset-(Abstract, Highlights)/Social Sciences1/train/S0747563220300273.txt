 Action video game players have been shown to have an enhanced cognitive control ability to reduce stimulus driven attentional capture compared with non action video game players . Here we examined whether these benefits could extend to the memory driven attentional capture representations bias visual attention toward a matching distractor . AVGPs and NVGPs were instructed to complete a visual search task while actively maintaining 1 2 or 4 items in WM . There was a robust advantage to the memory driven attentional capture in reaction time and first eye movement fixation in the AVGPs compared to the NVGPs when they had to maintain one item in WM . Moreover the effect of memory driven attentional capture was maintained in the AVGPs when the WM load was increased but it was eliminated in the NVGPs . The results suggest that AVGPs may devote more attentional resources to sustaining the cognitive control rather than to suppressing the attentional capture driven by the active WM representations .

@highlight Greater memory driven attentional capture for AVGPs than for NVGPs.
@highlight Attentional capture was robust for AVGPs but eliminated for NVGPs when WM load is increased.
@highlight AVGPs utilized attentional resources to sustain rather than to suppress attentional capture.
