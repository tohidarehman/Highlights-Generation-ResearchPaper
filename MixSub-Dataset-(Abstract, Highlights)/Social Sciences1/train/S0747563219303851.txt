 Inspired by both classical theories on technology adoption and gerontological theories on social and emotional ageing we aim to better understand barriers and benefits in ICT use among older people with cognitive impairments . Through qualitative interviews among this population as well as important network members we obtained a detailed picture of the role of ICTs in their everyday lives . First we find that older individuals with cognitive impairments perceive ICTs as useful when these contribute to the satisfaction of social and emotional needs in terms of relationships hobbies or daily activities . Second ICT use among our group is jointly determined by perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use with PU motivating individuals to increase PEU . Third the social network plays an important role in encouraging and discouraging ICT use by providing assistance taking the first step restricting access or indirect use . The latter refers to shared use where devices are operated by others . Fourth we point out the importance of voluntariness in using ICT some participants were so restricted by others in their ICT use that this reduced their perception of control .

@highlight Despite decline most of our participants with cognitive impairments used ICTs.
@highlight When this no longer worked a close other sometimes used ICT for them indirect use .
@highlight Perceived usefulness was often a trigger to develop strategies to increase ease of use.
@highlight Some participants used ICTs to maintain a feeling of control over their lives.
@highlight Others used ICTs to compensate for their cognitive or physical decline.
