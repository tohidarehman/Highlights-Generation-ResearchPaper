 While avatars are frequently employed as a user interface element for improving user experience in human computer interaction the current design of avatars is primarily dominated by non Arabian cultures . To the best of our knowledge no previous research or guidelines can be found for avatar design in the context of Arabian culture . Aiming to address this gap we conducted an exploratory study to investigate how avatars can be designed for Arab users . Following a hybrid approach of deductive and inductive reasoning we reviewed the literature on UI design for Arabian culture avatar design in human computer interaction research and social response theory . Subsequently we conducted 32 semi structured interviews with Arabian culture experts psychologists and potential users . Based on thematic analysis of the interviews we developed a set of six general guidelines for the design of avatars for users from Arabian culture . These six guidelines are expected to provide system or UI designers the ability to design and employ appropriate avatars that can promote Arab users experience and engagement .

@highlight A comprehensive qualitative study on Arab avatar design was conducted.
@highlight Six general design guidelines for Arab avatars have been established.
@highlight The guidelines stipulate specific preferences for avatar appearance and background.
