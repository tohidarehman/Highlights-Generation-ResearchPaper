 Grades are the dominant currency that enables student migration patterns in particular the recent upsurge of Chinese students studying and settling in Canada . Given the use of grades for student promotion mobilization and admission into educational programs internationally there is an urgent need to understand the validity of grades across learning contexts . This study explored 35 Canadian and Chinese secondary school teachers grading decisions and practices through nine focus groups . Following inductive analyses findings indicated that teachers primarily valued fairness as an overarching driver of decision making when generating and considering grades . Teachers considerations of fairness centred around four emergent themes context and classroom management learning values grades as academic enablers policy and external pressures and consequences of grade use . The overarching thread common among both Canadian and Chinese teachers was their reported challenge in maintaining fair grading practices .
