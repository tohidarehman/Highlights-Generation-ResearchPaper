 Studies investigating recognition of facial expressions of emotions in Williams syndrome have reported difficulties in recognising negative expressions of emotion and a reliance on atypically developing underlying processes during task performance . The aim of the study was to extend these findings to the recognition of emotions in auditory domains . Children and adolescents with WS together with chronological and verbal mental age matched typically developing comparison groups were asked to judge expressions of happiness sadness anger and fear in vocal and musical conditions . Total emotion recognition scores did not differ between WS and VMA matched groups but profiles of discrimination across emotion categories were markedly different . For all groups the accessibility of emotion category cues differed across music and speech domains . The results suggested that emotion discrimination is more strongly linked with cognitive ability in WS than in TD . Although WS and TD groups showed a significantly different profile of discrimination across emotion categories similarities in the pattern of discrimination across domains and in the correlates of auditory emotion processing were observed . The results are discussed in the context of typical and atypical developmental trajectories and compensatory mechanisms in WS .

@highlight Recognition of negative emotions in music and vocalisations distinguishes WS and TD.
@highlight Intellectual strengths enable compensation during negative emotion recognition in WS.
@highlight Musical engagement is associated with improved emotion recognition in WS.
