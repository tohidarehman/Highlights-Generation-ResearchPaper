 Autism is characterised by phenotypic variability particularly in the domains of language and handedness . However the source of this heterogeneity is currently unclear . To synthesise findings regarding the relationship between language handedness and cerebral lateralisation in autistic people and consider how future research should be conducted in order to progress our understanding of phenotypic variability . Following a literature search and selection process 19 papers were included in this literature review . Studies using behavioural structural and functional measures of lateralisation are reviewed . The studies reviewed provided consistent evidence of differential cerebral lateralisation in autistic people and this appears to be related to between group differences in language . Evidence relating this to handedness was less consistent . Many of the studies did not include heterogeneous samples and or did not specify the language process they investigated . This review suggests that further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between cerebral lateralisation and phenotypic variability within autism . It is crucial that future studies in this area include heterogeneous samples specify the language process they are investigating and consider taking developmental trajectories into account .

@highlight Language lateralisation and language ability appear to be related in autism.
@highlight This relationship does not appear to be mediated by handedness.
@highlight Most studies included homogeneous autistic samples with respect to language ability.
@highlight Many studies did not specify the language process that was investigated.
@highlight We make a number of recommendations for future research in the field.
