 Culturally sensitive care is essential for improving healthcare for ethnic minorities with intellectual disabilities who require intensive sometimes lifelong care and support . The present study aimed to uncover factors that may complicate the delivery of culturally sensitive care for ethnic minorities with ID which have not previously been studied for this group . By means of in depth interviews with care professionals we identified these factors at the care receiver professional and institutional levels . Eight factors were found to complicate the delivery of culturally sensitive care abilities of the individuals with ID communication with the family of the care receiver cultural competency of the professional personal attitude and experience of the professional job position and responsibilities of the professional resources legislation and protocols and the team of colleagues . The factors at the care receiver level were specific for the delivery of culturally sensitive care to individuals with ID . In addition to the complicating factors previously identified for other forms of culturally sensitive healthcare we identified novel complicating factors for the care of individuals with ID . Future research should investigate how these complicating factors could be overcome .
