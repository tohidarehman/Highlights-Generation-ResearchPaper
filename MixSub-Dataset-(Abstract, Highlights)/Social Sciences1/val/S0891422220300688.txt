 In this article we focus on the causes of individual differences in Down syndrome exemplifying the multi level multi method lifespan developmental approach advocated by Karmiloff Smith . We evaluate the possibility of linking variations in infant and child development with variations in the risk for Alzheimers disease in adults with DS . We review the theoretical basis for this argument considering genetics epigenetics brain behaviour and environment . In studies 1 and 2 we focus on variation in language development . We utilise data from the MacArthur Bates Communicative Development Inventories CDI

@highlight Proof of principle that prenatal and neonatal magnetic resonance imaging methods may be used to test the predictive power of measures of early brain structure for variation in DS infant cognitive development. Early brain development represents the concerted effect of the DS genotype.
@highlight The article argues for the importance of a multi level lifespan developmental approach to explore the origins of individual differences in DS cognition. It hypothesises that in this framework dementia itself may be considered as a developmental disorder
