 Profiles of mathematical learning disability have been conceptualized in the literature but empirical evidence to support them based on academic and cognitive characteristics is lacking . We examined whether profiles of mathematics performance can empirically be identified and whether the identified profiles also differ in underlying cognitive skills . Latent profile analysis in 281 fourth graders . Basic arithmetic and advanced mathematics were used to identify profiles . Cognitive skills were then described for each profile of mathematics performance . Four profiles of mathematics performance were retrieved from the data including one general low achieving profile . Additional profiles of MLD were not found possibly because individual variation was substantial . It is highly important to understand childrens mathematics performance from an individual perspective rather than by averaging these children over subgroups . These new insights can be used to better tend to the specific needs of children with mathematical difficulties .

@highlight Different profiles of mathematics performance have been theorized in the literature.
@highlight The present study empirically identified one generally low achieving profile.
@highlight Specific profiles of mathematical learning disabilities were not identified.
@highlight Individual variation was too large for a meaningful distinction between profiles.
@highlight Heterogeneity in math performance should therefore be acknowledged.
