 When detected children with asymmetrical motor impairment are referred for therapeutic interventions to maximize the child s ability to reach their health and developmental potential . Referal is dependent on standardized evaluation which rarely examines upper extremity function within the context of real world activity . Accelerometry provides an efficient method to objectively measure movement in children . The purpose of this study was to compare accelerometry to clinical assessment specifically the Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function 2 . A total of 52 children between 117 years of age with asymmetrical motor deficits and age matched controls participated in this study . Participants wore bilateral accelerometers for 4 x 25 h. The use ratio and mono arm use index were calculated to quantify asymmetrical impairment . The Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function 2 was administered and compared to accelerometry variables . The UR and MAUI were significantly different in children with and without deficits . The MAUI was significantly correlated with all domains of the MA 2 accuracy fluency dexterity and range of motion . Our findings suggest a relationship between real world movement and clinical evaluation .

@highlight Accelerometry can be used to measure real world motor behavior in children.
@highlight Moderate concurrent reliability between accelerometry and the Melbourne Assessment 2.
@highlight A combination of clinical assessment and wearable technology can be used to describe movement.
