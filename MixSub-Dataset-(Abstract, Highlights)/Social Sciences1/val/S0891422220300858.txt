 People with Spina Bifida usually experience difficulties with mathematics . In a series of other developmental disorders a magnitude processing deficit was considered to be the main source of subsequent difficulties in mathematics . The processing of magnitude could be numerical or non numerical such as spatial or temporal for instance . However no study yet has examined directly magnitude processes in a population with Spina Bifida . On the other hand recent studies in people with genetic syndromes have suggested that visuospatial and working memory processes play an important role in magnitude processing including number magnitude . Therefore in this study we explored for the first time magnitude representation using several tasks with different visuospatial and working memory processing requirements cognitive skills frequently impaired in Spina Bifida . Results showed children with SB presented a global magnitude processing deficit for non numerical and numerical comparison tasks but not in symbolic number magnitude tasks compared to controls . Importantly visuospatial skills and working memory abilities could partially explain the differences between groups in comparison and estimation tasks . This study proposes that magnitude processing difficulties in children with SB could be due to higher cognitive factors such as visuospatial and working memory processes .

@highlight Children with SB demonstrated difficulties in comparing non symbolic magnitudes.
@highlight For visual and auditory information presented simultaneously or sequentially.
@highlight Deficit in estimating large numerosities.
@highlight Preserved abilities in symbolic magnitude comparison tasks.
@highlight These deficits can be explained partially by WM and visuospatial weaknesses.
