 Over recent decades the number of students diagnosed with learning disabilities and or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders has substantially increased . These students face various challenges and experience stress when receiving higher education . The purpose of this study was to compare two non pharmacological interventions mindfulness and device guided slow breathing with a control group . Seventy three students with attention problems and or learning disabilities were randomly assigned to three groups mindfulness meditation device guided breathing practice and waiting list control . Before and after the intervention physiological and psychological measures were collected . Our results show that only mindfulness practice improved awareness of the present moment and decreased hyperactivity and inattention . Furthermore both mindfulness and practice with device guided breathing were associated with stress reduction as shown by an increase in the galvanic skin response only in the control group . Implementation of the study results may lead to an advance in treating attention deficit disorders and learning disabilities especially among higher education students .
