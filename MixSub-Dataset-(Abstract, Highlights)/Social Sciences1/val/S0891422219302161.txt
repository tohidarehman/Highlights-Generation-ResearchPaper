 This cross syndrome study focuses on sleep and its relationship with language development . Children with neurodevelopmental disorders present with language delay . Typical language development is constrained by numerous factors including sleep . Sleep is often disrupted in adolescents adults with neurodevelopmental disorders . We therefore hypothesised that sleep may be disrupted and correlate with language development in infants toddlers with neurodevelopmental disorders . To test our hypothesis we obtained sleep and vocabulary size data from 75 infants toddlers with one of three neurodevelopmental disorders fragile X syndrome Williams syndrome . Sleep was indeed disrupted in these children . It was also positively associated with receptive vocabulary size in the infants toddlers with DS and WS . We argue that disrupted sleep may be a common occurrence in very young children with neurodevelopmental disorders and it may relate to their ability to acquire their first language .

@highlight Sleep is disrupted in infants and toddlers with neurodevelopmental disorders.
@highlight Sleep is related to language ability in infants toddlers with Down syndrome and Williams syndrome.
@highlight Sleep may therefore play a role in the emergence of the Down Williams syndrome phenotype.
