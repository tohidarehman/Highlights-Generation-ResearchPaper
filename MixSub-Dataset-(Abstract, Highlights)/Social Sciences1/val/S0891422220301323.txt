 Autism and intellectual disability may coincide and be preceded by global developmental delay or by motor delay . Motor delay in the context of global developmental delay is an initial red flag for ASD with added risk in girls . To assess early developmental milestones in girls with ASD as compared to diagnosed boys considering prematurity risk . Developmental milestones in a cohort of 467 children with ASD diagnosed at mean age of 3.4 years were analyzed according to gender and prematurity risk . 111 girls 356 boys presented with motor milestones acquisition grossly within the normal range . However there was a shift towards acquisition of walking being at the later end of the norm range with this shift being more prominent in girls . 60 of girls and 47 of boys with ASD had motor delay and 49 of girls and 36 of boys had global developmental delay . The extent of the delays was greater in the prematurity subgroup . Global delay of early milestones occurred in half of children with ASD and in 60 of girls with ASD . Delayed acquisition of independent walking is relatively more common in girls subsequently diagnosed with ASD .

@highlight Motor delay is a red flag for autism
@highlight Motor and global developmental delays are more common in girls with autism
@highlight Motor and global developmental delays were greater in the prematurity subgroup
@highlight Prematurely born girls with autism spectrum disorders have an elevated risk of showing motor or global developmental delays
