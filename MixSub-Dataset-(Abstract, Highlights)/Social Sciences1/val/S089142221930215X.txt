 Sleep problems are prevalent among young children with autism spectrum disorders . The Childrens Sleep Habits Questionnaire is commonly used for assessment but there are outstanding questions regarding its optimal measurement model . To examine the factor structure of the CSHQ in preschool children with ASD and relationships between CSHQ factors and childrens emotional cognitive and behavioral dysregulation . Participants included 4 to 5 year olds with ASD . Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine whether two previously reported CSHQ factor structures provided adequate fit to the sample data . Exploratory Factor Analysis was used examine alternative models . Regression analyses were used to examine how CSHQ factor scores explained variance in dysregulation symptoms measured by the Child Behavior Checklist . Previously reported factor models in children with ASD were not confirmed but a novel five factor model identified using EFA provided excellent fit to the sample data . Sleep factors were generally not correlated with autism symptoms but were associated with aggression anxiety depression and attention problems with evidence of specificity in these relationships . The proposed CSHQ five factor model may be useful in future studies of sleep problems in young children with ASD .

@highlight Sleep problems are prevalent among young children with autism spectrum disorders ASD .
@highlight A five factor model of the Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire CSHQ among preschool children with ASD best fitted the data from the current study.
@highlight There are distinctive relationships between specific types of sleep problems and childrens emotional and behavioral dysregulation.
@highlight A narrower age range in this sample may provide clarity regarding CSHQ measurement model and relationships with behavioral dysregulation.
