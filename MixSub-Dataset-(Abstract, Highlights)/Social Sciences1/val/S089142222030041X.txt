 More people with autism spectrum disorder are now being identified in the criminal justice system and in parallel with this increase the prevalence of ASD in the community has risen more than 150 in the same time period . In this article I will argue that this increase is due to a reclassification of those individuals whose social communicative and behavioural function is at the lower end of the normal range . Put simply extremes of these quantitative traits are now being conceptualised as disorder . This has particular relevance for the criminal justice system as such traits are over represented in this population as such it is likely that increasing numbers of people who are incarcerated will receive an ASD diagnosis . This will have major implications for where best and how best to manage such individuals using a framework of disorder versus difference .

@highlight This paper presents a conceptual discussion of autism specttrum disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders.
@highlight The paper includes a discussion of the current genetic underpinning of neurodevelopmental disorders and the implication of this for disorder conceptualisation.
@highlight Emphasis is placed on the implication of our conceptual understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders for the criminal justice system.
@highlight The paper also provides an opportunity to reflect on and re consider how we might best classify neurodevelopmental disorders.
