 Pathological Demand Avoidance is a developmental disorder involving challenging behaviour clinically linked to Autism Spectrum Disorder . Many of the problematic features of PDA are often seen in persons with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and impulsivity . ADHD and impulsivity are also common in the backgrounds of offenders . Method and procedure We examined if self reported ASD ADHD impulsivity and general personality traits such as low conscientiousness and low emotional stability predicted self reported PDA scores and which constructs contributed to the prediction of delinquency recruiting 132 participants of whom 126 cases had complete data . Many of these constructs but particularly ADHD This research indicates that for community adult populations self reported individual differences in ADHD emotional instability and antagonism appear to better predict PDA than ASD . The association PDA has with delinquency may reflect these constructs which are also correlates of offending .
