 An appropriate adult is required by law to support juveniles and vulnerable adults during custody procedures . This paper explored the opinions and knowledge of AAs and how the characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder could disadvantage an individual within a police interview . A questionnaire was administered to AAs who had received training to carry out their duties . AAs were asked a number of questions concerning suspects with ASD . Overall the questionnaire found that AAs had some awareness of the key features of ASD . However AAs were less aware of the possible impact these characteristics could have upon the interview process . Nevertheless when asked about actual practice fifteen incidents were reported where it was deemed that the characteristics of ASD disrupted interview procedures . For example it was reported that suspects with ASD displayed repetitive and rigid behaviour patterns that interfered with the flow of the interview . Encouragingly the self reported data suggested that AAs were able to respond effectively to these actual incidents . That withstanding it is suggested that AA training should include information about how those with ASD might be at a disadvantage within the forensic interview environment and outline strategies that AAs could use to help a person with ASD fully engage within the criminal justice process .

@highlight The self reported data suggests that on occassions AAs are required to support peolple with ASD during custody procedures.
@highlight Self reported data reported occasions where the characteristics of ASD disrupted the interview procedure and AAs were required to intervene.
@highlight Overall AAs have an awareness of the characteristics of ASD. However training to help AAs develop strategies to assit people with ASD is required
