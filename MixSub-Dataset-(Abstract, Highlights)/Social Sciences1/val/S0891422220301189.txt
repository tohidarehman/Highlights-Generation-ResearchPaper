 Research on play for children with autism and severe learning difficulties has been limited instead much of the research focuses on higher levels of play such as symbolic play . Those studies that present details regarding functional play are focused on examining the extent of the play deficit and limited in depth with respect to the precision of the categories presented . Therefore the current understanding the tools available to support plan and measure play are not sufficiently detailed or focused on children with autism and SLD . The aim of the research was to analyse the functional play actions and establish precise functional play categories though direct observations of children aged 311 diagnosed with a combination of autism and SLD . Free play observations of children diagnosed with autism and SLD were conducted in a natural play situation across three special schools in England . The results reveal four key areas of functional play interacting with one object interacting with two objects interacting with self and interacting with the environment . In addition seven subcategories were established as additional components related to functional play . The results suggest that functional play for children with autism and SLD is far more complex than currently recognised . Through the depth and detail established the categories provide greater understanding of the play characteristics and the most detailed account of the functional play characteristics for this group of children . The analysis provides sensitive measurement scales to support accuracy and precision when planning supporting and measuring small increments of progress in play .
