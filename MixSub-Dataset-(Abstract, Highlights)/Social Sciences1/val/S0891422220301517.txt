 Clinicians working with individuals with autism spectrum disorders who display sexual offending behaviours may face challenges during treatment as a result of the cognitive and behavioural profile associated with ASD . This research explored the views and experiences of those running adapted sex offender treatment groups with men with ASD . Semi structured interviews with group facilitators focused on service user engagement and response to the core components of the treatment programme and gathered the experiences of those working with men with ASD who display sexual offending behaviours . Grounded Theory was used to develop a model conceptualising the potential impact of ASD on treatment outcomes and this emerged predominantly through clinicians views of risk of re offending . Benefits of attending a group included the presence of other group members a forum to develop pro social roles and relationships and increased opportunity for monitoring . Challenges regarding empathy specifically emotional empathy and shifts in cognitive distortions were felt particularly pertinent to those with ASD as well as questions over internalisation of therapy . Despite identification of a number of challenges adapted sex offender treatment programmes were considered beneficial for men with ASD especially in light of a dearth of evidenced based alternatives .
