 Life skills instruction is important for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities and an emerging research base exists in which schema instruction is used to support students with IDD . In this single case multiple probe across participants study researchers explored the use of a schematic diagram in conjunction with the system of least prompts to support the acquisition fluency maintenance and generalization of life skills mathematics for secondary students with IDD . Researchers collected data relative to student accuracy and independence in solving problems involving finding the cost of an item after a discount . Researchers collected data across baseline intervention maintenance and generalization phases . Researchers found a functional relation between the intervention package and accuracy for all three students . Students were successful with the schematic diagram however the data for generalization to when no schema was provided were more idiosyncratic . This research holds implications for the use of a schematic diagram to support students with IDD learning life skills mathematical problem solving .

@highlight Middle school students with IDD acquired became fluent maintained and generalized finding the cost of an item after a discount.
@highlight A schematic diagram supported students in accuracy and independence in solving life skills mathematics problems.
@highlight This study adds to the emerging literature that supports life skills mathematics instruction for students with developmental disabilities.
