 At present it is unclear whether there is a consistent behavioural phenotype for children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder that can support screening efforts . There has been a dearth of qualitative studies exploring the behavioural phenotype from the perspective of caregivers raising children with FASD . The current study explores the cognitive and behavioural difficulties and impairments experienced by children with FASD aged between four and 12 years from the perspective of caregivers . Fourteen caregivers of children with FASD participated in telephone interviews . Caregivers were recruited until data saturation occurred . Thematic analysis was undertaken on the transcribed interviews using NVivo 12 . Three over arching themes were identified that consisted of subthemes 1 Self regulation behavioural emotional and attention 2 Cognitive abilities academic abilities and learning and memory and 3 Adaptive functioning social skills communication and language skills motor skills and sleep concerns . Multiple subthemes were consistently identified across participants . A further two cross cutting themes were identified children behaving young for their age and inconsistency in behaviour and strategies . Despite the lack of a consistent behavioural phenotype for FASD the findings suggest consistency between caregivers in their reports of the difficulties experienced by children with FASD . The implications for early identification and screening tool development are discussed .
