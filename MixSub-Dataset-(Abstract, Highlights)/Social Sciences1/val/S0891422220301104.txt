 Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and developmental coordination disorders may show similar clinical sensory motor symptoms . This study aimed to compare motor skills and sensory processing behaviors between these two groups . Methods and Procedures . In this retrospective analysis we examined secondary data and used multivariate analysis of variance to compare the Movement Assessment Battery for Children 2 and Sensory Processing Measure Home for 21 children with FASD and 21 with DCD without prenatal alcohol exposure ages 513 years . No significant group differences in mean total motor or subtest scores on the MABC 2 were detected but a higher proportion of children with DCD had more severe motor delays . Both groups had sensory processing difficulties but the children with FASD had significantly more sensory processing difficulties on the SPM total score and visual touch body awareness and planning subscales . The sensory processing symptoms in children with FASD distinguished the two groups . These group differences between children with FASD and DCD need corroboration in larger samples but haveimplications for differential diagnosis clinical assessment and targeted intervention .

@highlight More children with DCD than FASD had more severe motor delays in motor performance.
@highlight Atypical sensory symptoms were prevalent in both DCD and FASD groups.
@highlight Children with FASD had more sensory processing difficulties SPM scales .
