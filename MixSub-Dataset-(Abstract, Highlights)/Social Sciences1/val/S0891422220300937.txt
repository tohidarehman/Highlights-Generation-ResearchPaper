 Given the relationship between physical fitness and motor performance a test battery was developed that measures both components combined . Following the development of the Performance and Fitness battery this study investigated the construct validity with the ultimate aim of identifying attributes that discriminate between different levels of motor abilities and anaerobic or musculoskeletal fitness . In this cross sectional study 34 children with developmental coordination disorder and 34 matched typically developing children participated . The PERF FIT was used to examine known group validity . The PERF FIT items were also compared to test items of well known standardized tests to examine concurrent validity . Concurrent validity was found to be of the expected low to moderate magnitude . Children with DCD were consistently found to have lower levels of motor skill related fitness compared to typically developing children . The PERF FIT seems to be a valid test to measure movement skills musculoskeletal fitness and agility in children between the ages of 7 and 10 years in low resourced communities . The test seems to discriminate between gross motor skills and agility and power in children with and without DCD .

@highlight Integrating physical fitness and motor coordination in one test is deemed more ecologically valid.
@highlight Correlations between motor coordination and functional strength and power items are moderate to low.
@highlight Children with DCD performed significantly poorer on all items of the PERF FIT compared to typically developing peers.
@highlight Musculoskeletal fitness is recommended as an integral part of the DCD assessment protocol.
@highlight The PERF FIT is a valid tool to measure physical fitness and motor coordination in children in low resource communities.
