 The planning behaviors of children with autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder during writing remain overlooked . Targeted examination of planning behaviors may help to better understand their heterogeneous writing skills . This study examined overt planning behaviors of three groups of school age children during the planning stage of a standardized narrative writing assessment . Aims explored group differences in time spent planning between and within group differences in overt planning behaviors and relationships between planning behaviors and writing performance as well as age cognitive skills and diagnostic symptom severity . This study included 121 917 year old children . Video recordings captured overt planning behaviors during a two minute prewriting planning stage . Not all participants planned but group membership overwhelmingly did not influence planning likelihood . Groups differed in time spent engaging with the outline with the TD group spending the most time . Groups spent similar amounts of time looking away from the task and looking at the task picture . The TD and ASD groups demonstrated more similar within group level differences in planning behavior s while the ADHD group appeared more variable . The ADHD and TD groups but not the ASD group showed stronger associations between planning behaviors and writing performance . Children with ASD and ADHD differed relative to each other and to TD peers in specific planning behaviors . Implications are discussed regarding instructional practices and needed future research to examine planning during writing in children with developmental disabilities .

@highlight Groups predominantly did not differ in their choice to engage in planning.
@highlight The TD group spent more time than ASD or ADHD groups engaging with their outline.
@highlight All groups spent minimal time disengaged from the task during planning.
@highlight ASD and TD groups showed more similar behavioral planning profiles.
@highlight ADHD and TD groups showed more similar planning and writing associations.
