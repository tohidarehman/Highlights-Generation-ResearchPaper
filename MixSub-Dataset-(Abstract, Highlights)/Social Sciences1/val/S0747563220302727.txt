 Service robots are on the rise . Technological advances in engineering artificial intelligence and machine learning enable robots to take over tasks traditionally carried out by humans . Despite the rapid increase in the employment of robots there are still frequent failures in the performance of service robots . This research examines how and to what extent people attribute responsibility toward service robots in such cases of service failures compared to when humans provide the same service failures . Participants were randomly assigned to read vignettes describing a service failure either by a service robot or a human and were then asked who they thought was responsible for the service failure . The results of three experiments show that people attributed less responsibility toward a robot than a human for the service failure because people perceive robots to have less controllability over the task . However people attributed more responsibility toward a

@highlight When service fails people attribute less responsibility toward a service provider if it is a robot rather than a human.
@highlight People perceive a robot service provider to have less control over a service outcome than a human service provider.
@highlight People attribute more blame toward a service firm when a robot delivers a failed service than when a human does.
