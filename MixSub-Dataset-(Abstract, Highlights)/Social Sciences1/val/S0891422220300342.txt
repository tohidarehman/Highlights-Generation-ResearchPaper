 Following Annette Karmiloff Smiths approach to cognitive research this study applied a cross syndrome approach to the social phenotype focusing on social vulnerability and the factors that contribute to it . To identify syndrome specific differences in SV across four neurodevelopmental disorder groups determine the contribution of intellectual disability age or gender to SV and explore its relationship with social interaction style . 262 parents of children Autism Williams syndrome Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Fragile X syndrome and Neurotypical reported on their childs SV quality of SIS and other factors . Heightened SV was not syndrome specific . Instead it was found equally across NDD groups and independently of ID age and gender . Different atypical SISs were also distributed across NDD groups and each were significantly related to SV independent of the factors above and beyond neurodevelopmental diagnosis . The findings emphasise that social phenotypes are best understood as distributed across diagnostic boundaries and offer opportunities to further test the role of varied atypical SISs in the development of heightened SV .

@highlight Heightened social vulnerability is evident across multiple neurodevelopmental disorders.
@highlight The limitation of IQ to explain social vulnerability is shown by a cross syndrome approach.
@highlight Atypical social interaction styles vary within and across neurodevelopmental groups.
@highlight Social interaction styles make a unique contribution to heightened social vulnerability.
@highlight Social phenotypes are best understood as distributed across diagnostic boundaries.
