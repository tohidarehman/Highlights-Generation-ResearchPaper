 Sensory processing difficulties are present in children with Developmental Coordination Disorder and Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder . However little is known about sensory processing variability in these disorders . The purpose of this study was to explore SPD among children with DCD ADHD and co occurring symptoms in comparison to children with typical development and to determine how potential social confounders may influence these associations . The study involved 452 children aged 612 years . The Short Sensory Profile 2 was used to assess sensory processing patterns . Multiple linear regressions were utilized to investigate the relationship between DCD ADHD and co occurring symptoms and sensory processing patterns adjusting for social covariates . Children with DCD and ADHD symptoms showed greater variability of atypical sensory processing patterns compared with TD children . Low registration and sensory sensibility issues were more prevalent in the DCD group . ADHD children showed higher rates of low registration sensory sensibility and sensory seeking and all children in the co occurring symptoms group presented sensory sensibility . This study reports significant variability in sensory processing among children with DCD ADHD and co occurring symptoms using a population based sample . These differences can contribute to understand how neurological and social factors correlates across diagnoses .

@highlight Children with DCD ADHD and co occurring symptoms show more sensory processing issues than typically developing children.
@highlight There is variability in sensory processing patterns between DCD ADHD and typically developing children and within disorder.
@highlight Sensory processing and social factors interrelate with motor coordination performance inattention and hyperactivity.
