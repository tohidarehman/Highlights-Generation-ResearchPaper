 Although research has provided evidence for a clear association of core executive function to math performance fewer studies have been carried out on arithmetic fact retrieval in relation to the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . The present study assessed mathematical achievement on a basic number skill test and on an arithmetic fact retrieval task . Besides math achievement self ratings of ADHD symptoms core executive functions and state anxiety in 646 fourth and fifth grade students were measured . CEF was evaluated by means of a tablet based test . Regression analysis showed different predictors for both math abilities . While all CEF measures inattention and impulsivity self ratings predicted basic number skills only inhibition WMC and inattention self rating were predictors of arithmetic fact retrieval . On the basis of a cluster analysis of ADHD self ratings and CEF performance three different groups were identified 1 low ADHD average CEF 2 high ADHD low CEF 3 moderate ADHD high CEF . Cluster 2 showed scores below the mean in both math scores whereas cluster 3 exhibited performances above the mean in both math scores . No math differences were found between cluster 1 and 3 . The data yield evidence that the association between CEF and math achievement depends on the specific math skill and test type . The results underline the importance of differentiating between CEF components and specific math abilities . Implications for future research on the associations between mathematics ADHD and CEF are discussed .

@highlight Only inhibition control and WMC explained math retrieval difficulties while all CEF components seem to be involved in basic number skills.
@highlight The data showed stable and similar negative associations between inattention self ratings and both math skills.
@highlight Children with ADHD traits presented clear difficulties in basic number skills.
@highlight Future research should consider dissimilar executive functioning profiles which would help to fully explain the math difficulties of children with CEF and attention deficits.
