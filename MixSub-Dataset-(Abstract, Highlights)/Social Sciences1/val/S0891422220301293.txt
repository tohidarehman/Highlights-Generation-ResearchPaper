 Knowledge of obstetric and environmental influences on Developmental Coordination Disorder helps provide increased understanding of the mechanisms underlying the disorder . However the literature to date has not adequately examined the obstetric and environmental risk factors for DCD in a population based sample . The current study was therefore conducted to explore the prenatal perinatal neonatal and family environmental risk factors for DCD . A total of 2185 children aged 310 years from a national representative sample in China were included the Movement Assessment Battery for Children 2 was used to assess motor function and a questionnaire was completed by parents . DCD was identified in 156 children according to the DSM 5 criteria . Multilevel logistic regression was used and comparisons were made between the DCD and non DCD group . The results confirmed that male sex BMI score preterm birth and some prenatal conditions are significant risk factors for DCD . Parents education level and one child status as two significant environmental risk factors for DCD appear largely independent of other risk factors in the Chinese population . This study provides an opportunity to explore the etiology of DCD and suggest potential assessment monitoring and intervention programs for DCD that could be examined in the future .

@highlight Obstetric and environmental factors both predict DCD independently.
@highlight Male sex and higher BMI are risk factors for DCD.
@highlight Placenta previa and placental abruption are independent risk factors for DCD.
@highlight Preterm birth is an independent risk factor for DCD.
@highlight Parents education and one child status are independent risk factors for DCD.
