 Young people with disabilities are more at risk of experiencing loneliness in later life than their typically developing peers . To identify those who become lonely in later life trajectories of perceived parent and peer support from adolescence to adulthood of young people with a visual impairment were studied . A total of 316 adolescents Perceived parent support followed a linear decreasing course . No association was found between perceived parent support and loneliness in later life . For perceived peer support a quadratic growth pattern was found with an increase in peer support up to age 27 and thereafter a decrease . Both the initial level and the rate of change in perceived peer support significantly predicted loneliness in adulthood . The course of peer support is a better indicator for the risk of loneliness in later life than support from parents . Normative life transitions may affect the already vulnerable social support for young people with a visual impairment . This study highlights the importance of establishing and maintaining peer relationships throughout life .

@highlight Trajectories of social support of young adults with VI in relation to loneliness are studied using a longitudinal design.
@highlight Perceived parent support decreased and perceived peer support first increased and later decreased over time.
@highlight Adolescents with little peer support at T1 and those with the most rapid decline reported most loneliness later in life.
@highlight No association was found between perceived parent support and loneliness later in life.
@highlight Support is needed to foster and expand social networks of young people with VI in adulthood and adolescence.
