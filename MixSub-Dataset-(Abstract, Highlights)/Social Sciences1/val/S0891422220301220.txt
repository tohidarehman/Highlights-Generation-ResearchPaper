 Even genetic disorders associated with monogenic aetiologies are characterized by complex and variable risk for poor outcomes highlighting the need to follow trajectories longitudinally . Here we investigated the longitudinal relationships between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder symptoms in a population at high risk for both boys with fragile X syndrome . 59 boys with fragile X syndrome aged 310 years old at entry participated in this study and were followed up one and two years after their first visit . As expected we found strong relationships over three timepoints for ADHD symptoms and ASD symptoms . In addition using structural equation modeling we found that ADHD symptoms at time 2 predicted ASD symptoms at time 3 suggestive of a causal relationship . Importantly these relationships hold when including chronological age at entry to the study as well as when including severity of impairment as measured by IQ and their effects on both ASD and ADHD symptoms do not reach significance . This result highlights the need to study outcomes longitudinally and it informs the comorbidity of the two symptom domains in FXS as well as their potential directionality both of which have been little researched . In addition our findings may suggest a future need to study how ADHD symptoms and their treatment impact individuals with ASD .
