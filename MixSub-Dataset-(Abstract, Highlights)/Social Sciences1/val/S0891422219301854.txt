 Autistic children often recall fewer details about witnessed events than typically developing children although the information they recall is generally no less accurate . Previous research has not examined the narrative coherence of such accounts despite higher quality narratives potentially being perceived more favourably by criminal justice professionals and juries . This study compared the narrative coherence of witness transcripts produced by autistic and typically developing children . Secondary analysis was carried out on interview transcripts from a subset of 104 participants who had taken part in a larger study of eyewitness skills in autistic and TD children . Groups were matched on chronological age IQ and receptive language ability . Coding frameworks were adopted from existing narrative research featuring elements of story grammar . Whilst fewer event details were reported by autistic children there were no group differences in narrative coherence narrative length or semantic diversity . These findings suggest that the narrative coherence of autistic childrens witness accounts is equivalent to TD peers of comparable age and ability .

@highlight Autistic child witnesses recall fewer correct details than non autistic children.
@highlight However the narrative coherence of their accounts does not differ.
@highlight There are no group differences in account length or semantic diversity either.
@highlight Autistic child witnesses produce well formed narratives.
