 Whilst there is a growing body of research on the psychological outcomes for siblings of autistic children few studies have considered the school context . To explore group differences on two school related self reported outcomes for autism siblings and siblings of non autistic children sense of school belonging and academic self concept . Data on self and parent carer reported behavioural and emotional problems were also collected . 65 autism siblings and a comparison group of 57 siblings of non autistic children aged 1116 years completed questionnaires measuring sense of school belonging academic self concept and behaviour problems . 73 parents in the autism sibling and 67 parents in the comparison sibling group completed the behaviour problems measure . Autism siblings reported significantly lower school belonging and academic self concept and had significantly poorer self and parent reported behaviour problems . When controlling for demographic variables and internalising and externalizing behaviour robust sibling group differences on academic variables remained . Autism siblings reported poorer school related outcomes and increased behavioural difficulties relative to siblings of non autistic children . There was wide variation in autism siblings outcomes highlighting the importance of taking an individualised and contextualised approach to understanding the varying needs of autism siblings .

@highlight Academic self concept and school belonging are key factors in understanding school experience.
@highlight Siblings of autistic children reported poorer academic self concept and sense of school belonging.
@highlight Group differences remained when controlling for potential confounding variables.
@highlight We report large variability in sibling outcomes highlighting the importance of differentiation.
