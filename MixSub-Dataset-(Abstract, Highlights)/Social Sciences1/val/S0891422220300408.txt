 High levels of anxiety and sleep problems are common features of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders . The strong association between sleep and anxiety has been documented in typically developing populations and is thought to be bidirectional . The association between sleep and anxiety in children with FASD has not yet been examined . Caregivers of children with FASD Sleep disturbances and anxiety were at clinical levels for the majority of the FASD group and significantly higher in the FASD group than the TD group . After controlling for age and sex 27 of the variance in anxiety scores in TD children was attributable to sleep problems and 33 in children with FASD . This study highlights associations between parent reported sleep and anxiety in FASD . Sleep disturbances were significant predictors of anxiety in both children with FASD and in TD children . Given the importance of sleep to healthy neurodevelopment there is a pressing need for sleep intervention studies in children with FASD . Early identification and intervention for sleep problems in this condition should be a therapeutic priority .

@highlight This is the largest study to examine sleep in FASD.
@highlight We report that a significant proportion of anxiety can be predicted by sleep problems. This is true for both TD and FASD populations.
@highlight Children with FASD experienced significantly higher levels of sleep problems and anxiety than TD children the majority at clinical levels.
@highlight Sleep interventions should be a clinical priority for children with FASD.
