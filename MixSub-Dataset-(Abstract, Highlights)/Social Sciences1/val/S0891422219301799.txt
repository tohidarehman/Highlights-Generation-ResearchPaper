 Research conducted with typically developing infants and children generally indicates that better habitual sleep and sleep after learning are related to enhanced memory . Less is known however about associations between sleep and recall memory in children with Down syndrome . The present study was conducted to determine whether parent reported sleep problems were differentially associated with encoding 1 month delayed recall memory and forgetting over time in children with DS and those who were TD . Ten children with DS and 10 TD children participated in a two session study . At each session recall memory was assessed using an elicited imitation paradigm . Immediate imitation was permitted at the first session as an index of encoding and delayed recall was assessed 1 month later . In addition parents provided demographic information and reported on child sleep problems . Although parents did not report more frequent sleep problems for children with DS relative to TD children regression based moderation analyses revealed that more frequent sleep problems were associated with increased forgetting of individual target actions and their order by children with DS . Evidence of moderation was not found when examining encoding or delayed recall . Although group differences were not found when considering parent reported sleep problems more frequent sleep problems were positively associated with increased forgetting by children with DS relative to those who were TD . Although future experimental work is needed to determine causality these results suggest that improved sleep in children with DS might reduce forgetting ultimately improving long term recall memory .

@highlight Parent reported sleep problems did not differ for children with Down syndrome and their typically developing peers.
@highlight Sleep problems moderated the effect of group on the forgetting of individual target actions and their order.
@highlight For children with Down syndrome increased forgetting was associated with greater parent reported sleep problems.
