 Atypical behavioral responses to sensation are reported in a large proportion of children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure . Systematic examination of symptoms across the fetal alcohol spectrum in a large clinical sample is needed to inform diagnosis and intervention . To describe the prevalence and patterns of atypical sensory processing symptoms in a clinical sample of children with PAE . Retrospective analysis of diagnostic clinical data from the University of Washington Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnostic and Prevention Network . Participants were ages 3 through 11 years had a diagnosis on the fetal alcohol spectrum and Short Sensory Profile assessment . The proportions of children categorized with definite differences on the SSP across selected clinical and demographic features were examined with chi square analyses . The sample consisted of 325 children 73.2 had SSP total scores in the definite difference range . Atypical sensory processing symptoms were significantly more prevalent among children with higher reported levels of PAE . The prevalence of atypical symptoms was comparably high across age levels of diagnostic severity and other prenatal postnatal risks . Results lend support for altered sensory processing as another domain of brain function affected by the teratogenic impact of PAE guiding clinical work and research .

@highlight Atypical sensory processing symptoms were prevalent in a high proportion of children with PAE.
@highlight Prevalence was similar across severity of diagnoses on the fetal alcohol spectrum.
@highlight Atypical symptoms were more prevalent with higher levels of confirmed PAE.
