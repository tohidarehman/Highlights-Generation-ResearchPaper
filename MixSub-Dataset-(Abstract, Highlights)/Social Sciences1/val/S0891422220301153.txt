 Attitudes toward people with disabilities are a frequent subject of studies . However there are few complex studies with personal explanatory variables . Thus in our study we have conducted an analysis at both the individual and classroom level as well as we have examined between levels interactions . 1525 students without disabilities participated in the cross sectional study in which we analyzed attitudes toward people with disabilities and moral identity in traditional and in inclusive classroom settings . The results show that individual and classroom moral identity as well as learning in an inclusive classroom predict a reduction of negative attitudes toward people with disabilities . Moreover we have reported some interesting interactions between these two levels . The results obtained are important for educational practice .
