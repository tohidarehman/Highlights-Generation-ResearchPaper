 With the surge of intervention research examining ways of supporting students with autism spectrum disorder in inclusive settings there remains a need to examine how technology supports could enhance students learning by offering one size fits one instruction . Furthermore intervention studies focused on teaching students with ASD how to solve fractions are scarce . The purpose of this research study was to examine the effects of providing instruction via video modeling concrete manipulatives a self monitoring checklist and practice for comprehension check on the accuracy of fraction problem solving of three middle school students with ASD . Through the use of single case multiple probe across students experimental design we examined whether a functional relation existed between the intervention and students improved accuracy of solving simple proper fraction problems . All three students improved the accuracy of solving simple proper fraction problems from baseline to intervention sessions and two students generalized the skill to solving whole proper fraction problems . The intervention consisting of VM and concrete manipulatives along with additional behavioral strategies offers an option for teachers to accommodate diverse learning needs of students with ASD in a variety of settings .

@highlight Video modeling is an effective method of teaching mathematics topics to students with ASD.
@highlight All students improved the accuracy of fraction problem solving reaching 100 accuracy by the end of the intervention.
@highlight Using concrete manipulatives and self monitoring checklist helped students grasp the concept of fraction problem solving.
@highlight The video modeling instructional package offers an option for teachers to accommodate students diverse learning needs.
