 Little is known about the quality of life of adults with cerebral palsy . This systematic review aimed to examine the extent to which methodological best practices have been applied to achieve valid and informative QoL assessments for this population . Systematic search identified 1097 non duplicated quantitative articles assessing self and or proxy reported QoL in samples of adults with CP . Eighteen studies were included and data extraction was conducted for sampling characteristics selection of informants adequacy of administered measures and examination of age related specificities . The results revealed discrepancies between conceptual definitions of QoL and their measurement approaches in CP . Most papers relied on self reports . Most studies were cross sectional and often based on relatively small samples the variable of age was considered inconsistently in statistical analyses . Future strategies to improve the validity and applicability of QoL assessments of adults with CP would include using a clear definition of QoL aligned with the measurement employed considering proxy reports whenever appropriate to encompass larger samples and a wider range of ability and using age stratified analyses in order to deepen understanding of potentially modifiable variables and paths linked to QoL outcomes .

@highlight QoL outcomes tend to decline when people with CP enter adulthood.
@highlight Age related specificities ensure the developmental validity of QoL assessments.
@highlight Proxy reports are preferred for QoL assessment in the most severely impaired cases.
@highlight Modifiable mechanisms and pathways linked to QoL remain understudied for CP.
@highlight A family perspective is likely to improve QoL assessments across the lifespan.
