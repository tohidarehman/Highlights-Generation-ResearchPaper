 Research on visuospatial functioning has revealed cognitive challenges for children with autism spectrum disorder nonverbal learning disability and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . These disorders are characterized by some overlapping symptoms making their diagnosis a challenge . The study aims to clarify the role of visuospatial abilities in their neuropsychological profiles by investigating different visuospatial domains and their interplay with the local global processing . Participants with ASD NLD or ADHD were compared with typically developing children on visuospatial processing speed visuo perceptual abilities visuo constructive abilities and visuospatial working memory . Generalized mixed effects models were performed and receiver operating characteristic curves were estimated to express the usefulness of a local global processing index in discriminating groups . The NLD group was impaired in all domains children with ADHD revealed a heterogeneous profile with greater impairments in visuospatial processing speed ASD and TD groups were comparable . The local global processing index had predictive power in discriminating among groups in visuo constructive task . The study of visuospatial abilities of children with ASD NLD and ADHD might help to understand strengths and weaknesses in their neuropsychological profile and to differentiate between them . Clinical implications of these findings are discussed .

@highlight Examines local global visuospatial processing in children with ASD NLD and ADHD.
@highlight Different profiles of visuospatial abilities emerge for each clinical group.
@highlight The local global processing index discriminates among groups in visuo constructive task.
@highlight Results might help to further understand cross disorder similarities and differences.
