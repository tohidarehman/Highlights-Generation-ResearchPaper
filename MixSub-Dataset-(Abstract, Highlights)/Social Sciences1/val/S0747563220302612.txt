 The use of online social media is part of daily life but may impact subjective well being negatively and contribute to the development of addictive tendencies . The present empirical study investigated the mechanisms that might explain this development . An online survey and an implicit association test investigated the relationship between implicit associations with SM SM flow and addictive social media use in a sample of 145 users of SM . The results reveal a significant positive association between all three investigated constructs . Moreover SM flow mediated the relationship between the implicit associations and addictive SMU significantly . Implicit associations with SM might therefore foster immersion into the online world which contributes to SM flow s positive experience . However SM flow might also serve as an antecedent of addictive tendencies . The study findings should be considered when assessing individuals at risk of addictive SMU and when developing intervention programs to deal with problematic social platform use .
