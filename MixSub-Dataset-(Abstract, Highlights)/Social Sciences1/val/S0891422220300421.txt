The limited number of adult scales measure social emotional features and modalities together . To develop scales for adults that evaluate visual auditory and somatosensory sensitivities as separate domains and independent of social emotional features . Two consecutive studies were conducted using the same methods . Both studies included a pilot auditory and somatosensory scales . The categories were internally consistent can be used to screen sensory sensitivity variability or identify and follow up the outcome of sensory interventions in adults .

@highlight Visual auditory and somatosensory sensitivity can be measured separately by SeSS.
@highlight Somatosensation dissociated into subdomains as touch itch and pain.
