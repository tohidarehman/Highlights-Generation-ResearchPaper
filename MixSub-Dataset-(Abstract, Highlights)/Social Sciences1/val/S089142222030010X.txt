 Cerebral Visual Impairment is very common yet often unrecognised visual dysfunction in children with Cerebral Palsy . Magnetic Resonance Imaging is the diagnostic tool in the investigation of brain lesions in children with CP and CVI . The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the relationship between brain structure and CVI as determined by MRI in children with CP . A comprehensive search of 5 database was undertaken up until June 2019 . The PRISMA checklist was then utilised to report on the process of selecting eligible papers . A total of 30 observational studies met the full inclusion criteria . Further STROBE checklist was employed to report on the observational studies . Periventricular leucomalacia on MRI was found to have a strong association with CVI in all 30 studies . Only 13 studies described dorsal and ventral stream dysfunction . There was ambiguity in the definition of CVI . The overall level of evidence correlating different patterns of CVI and CP and MRI was low . Further studies utilising advances in MRI are needed to understand brain reorganisation and patterns of CVI and suggest rehabilitation therapy inclusive of vision .

@highlight Periventricular leucomalacia was the most commonly reported brain lesion associated CVI in children with CP.
@highlight The role of brain structures such as grey matter and subcortical structures in CVI and CP is largely unknown.
@highlight Current evidence associating different patterns of CVI with motor types of CP and structural and functional MRI is weak.
@highlight There is a need for uniform reporting of both brain structure function and CVI classification to help further understanding of CVI.
