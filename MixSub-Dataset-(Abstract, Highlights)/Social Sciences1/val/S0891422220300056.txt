 Down syndrome is associated with poor sleep but little is known about its neural correlates . The current research compared brain morphometry in youth with Down syndrome with parent reported sleep problems to peers with Down syndrome and typical development without parent reported sleep problems matched on age and sex ratio . Magnetic resonance imaging was completed on a 3 T scanner . Participants were stratified into groups based on parent report DS S DS TD . Brain morphometry processed with the FreeSurfer Image Analysis Suite was compared across groups . In addition the co occurrence of medical conditions in the DS groups was examined . Youth with DS S had reduced total frontal parietal and temporal brain volumes relative to DS and TD peers . They also had higher rates of congenital heart defects than the DS only group however this comorbidity did not appear to account for morphometry differences . Parent reported sleep problems in DS appear to relate to global and localized volume reductions . These preliminary results have implications for understanding the neural correlates of poor sleep in DS they also highlight the importance of examining relations between sleep and other medical comorbidities .

@highlight Little is known about the brain in youth with Down syndrome and poor sleep DS S .
@highlight The current study examined brain morphometry in youth with DS S.
@highlight The DS S group had smaller total brain volume than youth with DS only.
@highlight Specific reductions were noted in several frontal parietal and temporal gyri.
@highlight More research is needed to further characterize the brain in youth with DS S.
