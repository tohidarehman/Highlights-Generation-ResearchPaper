 Fragile X syndrome is characterised by atypical social behaviours such as gaze aversion . However it remains unclear whether or if so how these behaviours affect cognitive processing and influence memory . We asked children with FXS and typically developing children to explore naturalistic scenes containing social and non social salient items unrelated to their task at hand . We also assessed childrens memory for target locations . We complemented behavioural responses with eye tracking data for the subset of participants who managed to comply with calibration and the demands of the experimental testing session . Children with FXS performed well at the experimental task and showed similar accuracy and speed in locating targets in natural scenes to children of equivalent verbal abilities . They also learned target locations over blocks but their memory of target locations was not as precise as that of comparison children . In addition children with FXS initially directed few first looks to salient social items within the scenes but these looks increased over blocks . Like TD children children with FXS also dwelled gaze upon social items while recalling target locations from memory . Individual differences in everyday social characteristics also related to gaze and behavioural measures . In conclusion experimental approaches can highlight cognitive underpinnings of atypical social behaviour in FXS pinpointing both similarities and differences to TD individuals .

@highlight We investigated longitudinal relationships between ADHD and autism symptoms in boys with fragile X syndrome.
@highlight We found strong relationships over three timepoints for ADHD symptoms and ASD symptoms.
@highlight Using structural equation modeling SEM we found that ADHD symptoms at time 2 predicted ASD symptoms at time 3.
@highlight This result highlights the need to study outcomes longitudinally and it informs the comorbidity of the two symptom domains in FXS.
