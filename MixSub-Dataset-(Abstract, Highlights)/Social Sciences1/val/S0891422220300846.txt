 Previous studies have supported the advantages of an external focus of attention relative to an internal focus of attention in healthly adults . However effects of attentional focus instructions on skill performance and acquisition in children are equivocal . The aim of this study was to examine the effects of attentional focus instructions on performance of a whole body coordination task in children with and without developmental coordination disorder . Children with DCD and typically developing children were asked to perform 3 countermovement vertical jumps in the IFA EFA and control conditions . The results showed that regardless of childrens motor development proficiency the jump height and vertical take off velocity V The results of the current study showed that EFA relative to IFA instructions could enhance the neuromuscular activation of dynamic contractions of the leg muscles in both children with and without DCD . The findings suggest that the beneficial effects of EFA relative to IFA instructions on childrens motor performance is identical across children with different levels of motor proficiency .

@highlight An external focus of attention EFA relative to an internal focus of attention IFA increased jump height in children with and without DCD.
@highlight EFA instruction relative to an IFA instructions increased vertical velocity at take off in children with and without DCD.
@highlight An EFA instruction was more beneficial than an IFA instruction independently from childrens motor proficiency.
