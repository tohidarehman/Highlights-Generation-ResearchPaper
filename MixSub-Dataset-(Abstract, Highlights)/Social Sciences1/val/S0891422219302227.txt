Effectiveness of interventions depends on appropriate assessment complicated by compromised self report and health and behaviour difficulties . Studying settling and waking in these syndromes could inform assessment . To describe settling and waking behaviours in children at high risk of sleep and health problems using direct observation . Video and actigraphy data were collected for 12 participants with AS and challenging behaviours were rare at settling and waking in both groups . In the AS group pain related behaviours were more likely to occur before waking than by chance . Findings highlight the importance of considering pain as a cause of sleep problems in AS . The principle and methodology could be extended to individuals with ID experiencing sleep problems .
