 There is evidence that siblings of children with a developmental disability experience poorer mental health outcomes and increased stress compared to siblings of non disabled children . The variables which contribute to this are unclear . This study was designed to examine population level and individual variables associated with differences in mental health outcomes among siblings of children who have a variety of developmental disabilities . Population level administrative health data covering 19852014 for the province of British Columbia Canada were used to develop a cohort of over 45 000 children who have a sibling with a DD . Individual level demographic and health care services variables were used in logistic regression to assess their relationship to diagnoses of depression or other mental health problems . Odds of a diagnosis of depression or a mental health problem other than depression were associated with sex of the non disabled sibling sex of the child with the developmental disability type of disability birth order and income . Type of developmental disability and characteristics of the non disabled sibling and their family are associated with mental health outcomes of siblings of children with a DD .
