 Developmental coordination disorder interferes with academic achievement and daily life and is associated with persistent academic difficulties in particular within mathematical learning . In the present study we aimed to study numerical cognition using an approach that taps very basic numerical processes such as subitizing and counting abilities in DCD . We used a counting task and a subitizing task in forty 710 years old children with or without DCD . In both tasks children were presented with arrays of one to eight dots and asked to name aloud the number of dots as accurately and quickly as possible . In the subitizing task dots were presented during 250ms whereas in the counting task they stayed on the screen until the participants gave a verbal response . The results showed that children with DCD were less accurate and slower in the two enumeration tasks providing evidence that DCD impairs both counting and subitizing . These impairments might have a deleterious impact on the ability to improve the acuity of the Approximate Number System through counting and thus could play a role in the underachievement of children with DCD in mathematics .

@highlight DCD impairs counting and subitizing in children.
@highlight Deleterious impact may be expected on the ANS and mathematical abilities at school.
@highlight Educational practice should avoid traditional counting exercises with DCD children.
