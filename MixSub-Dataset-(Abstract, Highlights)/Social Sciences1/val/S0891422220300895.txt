 Hypothermia for perinatal asphyxia is a common treatment to decrease morbidity . This study aims to describe a individual longitudinal neurodevelopmental trajectories over 5 years in children with perinatal asphyxia treated with hypothermia and b the correlation between movement quality at 3 months and motor developmental outcomes at 5 years of age . In this longitudinal cohort study 18 children were assessed at 3 t Six children showed abnormal movement quality assessed with General Movements t Children without anomalies on the MRI before hospital discharge and normal movement quality at 3 months of age showed normal neurodevelopment at the age of 5 however individual motor trajectories showed variability over time . Presents of abnormal GMs tend to detect CP and developmental problems advocating a developmental surveillance to determine need for early intervention .

@highlight Anomalies on MRI correctly detected children with disabilities due to CP.
@highlight Abnormal scores on GMs correctly indicated CP or other developmental problems.
@highlight Movement quality at 3 months was correlated with motor outcomes at 5 years of age.
@highlight Children without severe disabilities showed variation in developmental trajectories.
@highlight Longitudinal monitoring of development is necessary for decisions on intervention.
