 The aim of the review was to synthesise the literature on the types and effectiveness of interventions to improve sleep for individuals with Angelman Syndrome . Four databases were searched using predetermined search terms . Data extraction was performed on studies to examine participant characteristics study design intervention procedures intervention duration dependent variables . Intervention outcomes were categorised as positive negative or and certainty of evidence as a measure of quality was reported for each study . Ten studies including 54 participants with AS met the inclusion criteria . Included studies comprised of both single subject designs and group based designs . Pharmacological interventions were the most commonly used followed by combined pharmacological and behavioral treatment or behavioral interventions as a single intervention . Pharmacological interventions demonstrated both positive and mixed outcomes and were categorised at a suggestive level of evidence . Behavioral interventions as a sole intervention and as a combined intervention were found to have positive outcomes and was also categorised at a suggestive level of evidence . This review found provisional evidence but weak evidence for the effectiveness of behavioral interventions and mixed outcomes for the effectiveness of Melatonin for the treatment of sleep problems in AS . All 10 studies only achieved a suggestive level of certainty therefore further high quality research is needed to evaluate interventions for the treatment of sleep problems in this population .
