 Parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder exhibit higher levels of parental stress than parents of typically developing children . The most frequently used tools to assess parental stress is the Parenting Stress Index or its Short Form . This study was designed to test the validity of the PSI SF in French parents of children with ASD . First a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to test the initial 3 factor structure which indicate a poor model fit . Then an exploratory factor analysis was performed and convergent validity was assessed . A 3 factor structure explaining 44 of the variance was observed . Dimensions were moderately correlated and exhibited good internal consistency . Convergent validity was checked through the PSI SF association with anxiety and depression quality of life and appraisal of being a parent of a child with ASD . Future research should use the full version of the PSI SF and examine its factor structure . More studies on the factor structure of the PSI SF are needed to find out if it is a suitable tool for measuring stress in parents of children with ASD in France .
