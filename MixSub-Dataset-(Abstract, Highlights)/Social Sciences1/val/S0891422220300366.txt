 Conventional Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a mainstay in Cerebral Palsy diagnosis . A systematic literature review was performed with the aim to investigate the relationship between structural brain lesions identified by sMRI and motor outcomes in children with CP . Fifty eight studies were included . The results were analysed in terms of population characteristics sMRI gross and fine motor function and their interrelation . White matter lesions were the most common brain lesion types and were present in 57.8 of all children with uCP in 67.0 of all children with bCP and in 33 of the group of mixed subtypes . Grey matter lesions were most frequently registered in children with dyskinesia . No structural anomalies visualized by sMRI were reported in 5.7 of all cases . In all lesion types an equal distribution over the different gross motor function classification system categories was present . The included studies did not report sufficient information about fine motor function to relate these results to structural imaging . The relationship between brain structure and motor outcome needs to be further elucidated in a representative cohort of children with CP using a more standardized MRI classification system .

@highlight Periventricular white matter injuries remain the most common cause of bilateral and unilateral spastic CP.
@highlight Grey matter lesions were most frequently registered in children with dyskinesia n 42.2 .
@highlight 5.7 of children with CP show no anomalies on sMRI which is still commonly associated with bilateral spastic CP with low ambulatory function.
@highlight To enhance early diagnosis the relationship between brain structure on MRI and motor outcome needs to be further elucidated in a cohort of children with CP using more advanced imaging and quantified MRI procedures.
