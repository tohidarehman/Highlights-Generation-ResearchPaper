 The internal modelling deficit hypothesis suggests that motor control issues associated with Developmental Coordination Disorder are the result of impaired predictive motor control . In this study we examined the benefits of a combined action observation and motor imagery intervention designed to alleviate deficits in internal modelling and improve eye hand coordination during a visuomotor rotation task . Twenty children with DCD were randomly assigned to either an AO MI group or a control group . Each group then attempted to learn a 90 visuomotor rotation while measurements of completion time eye movement behaviour and movement kinematics were recorded . As predicted after training the AO MI group exhibited quicker completion times more target focused eye movement behaviour and smoother movement kinematics compared to the control group . No significant after effects were present . These results offer further support for the IMD hypothesis and suggest that AO MI interventions may help to alleviate such deficits and improve motor performance in children with DCD .
