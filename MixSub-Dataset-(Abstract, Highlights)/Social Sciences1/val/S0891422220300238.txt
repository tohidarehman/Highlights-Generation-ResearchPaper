 Some theorists have suggested that the ability of visual perspective taking constitutes a rudimentary process of social cognition and as such the ability of VPT in people with autism spectrum disorder has been the focus of intensive research . The present study investigated whether adult males with ASD show signs of implicit VPT in first level VPT tasks in which participants were required to judge whether a target object can be seen from anothers perspective even when they are not explicitly required to take anothers perspective . We examined whether the information from anothers visual perspective interferes with visual processing from the participants own perspective using the reaction time as the main performance indicator in adult males with or without ASD . Eye movement patterns during VPT were analyzed for some participants . The results revealed signs of altercentric interference in neurotypical adults but not in adult males with ASD . The results indicate the possibility that people with ASD may rely on a different strategy than neurotypical adults in completing a first level VPT task .

@highlight Neurotypical adult males unintentionally take anothers visual perspective.
@highlight Autistic adults show no reliable signs of unintentionally taking anothers perspective.
@highlight Autistic adults rely on atypical strategy in visual perspective taking.
