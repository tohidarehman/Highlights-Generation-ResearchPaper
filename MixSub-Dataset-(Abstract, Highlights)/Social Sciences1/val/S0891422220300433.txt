 Down syndrome is often characterised by intellectual disability with particular difficulties in expressive language . However large individual differences exist in expressive language across development in DS . In the general population one of the factors associated with variability in this domain is parental depression . We investigated whether this is also the case in young children with DS . Thirty eight children with DS between 8 and 48 months of age participated in this study . Their parents reported on the childrens receptive and expressive vocabularies and on parental depression . Furthermore an experimenter led standardized developmental assessment was administered to the children to test five domains gross motor fine motor visual reception receptive language and expressive language . A cross sectional developmental trajectories analysis demonstrated that expressive language developed at a slower rate in children with DS whose parent reported depression than in those whose parent did not . No differences between groups were found in any other domain . Parental depression is associated with slower rate of expressive language development in young children with DS . These findings suggest that DS and parental depression may constitute a double hit leading to increased difficulties in the development of expressive language .

@highlight Parental depression relates to slower rate of expressive language development in young children with Down syndrome.
@highlight No association with parental depression was found for any other domain.
@highlight Parental depression and Down syndrome may constitute a double hit on expressive language development.
