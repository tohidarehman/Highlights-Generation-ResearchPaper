 Temperament is an important construct that shapes child development . Temperament is suggested to present differently in different groups such as children with neurodevelopmental disorders . However it is not known whether there are specific temperament features associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder . This systematic review aimed to synthesise extant literature to determine whether there are temperament features associated with ASD in infancy toddlerhood and childhood . Following the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews we searched PsycINFO CINAHL Academic Search Ultimate and ProQuest for all available articles from database conception until January 2020 . The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal checklists were used to assess the methodological quality of included articles . Twenty six articles met the selection criteria reported on the temperament of children diagnosed with ASD peer reviewed and published in English . Articles varied in overall methodological quality . Infants later diagnosed with ASD were found to more frequently be described as having easy temperament features in early infancy compared to typically developing infants and infants with developmental concerns but not ASD . Once diagnosed children with ASD were reported to as a group display more negative affect less extraversion and less effortful control than typically developing children . The literature suggests that more challenging temperament features are associated with ASD in childhood but less is known about within group variability . Overall this review highlights the need for further investigation into the variability of temperament in children with ASD .

@highlight In early infancy infants later diagnosed with ASD had easy temperament features.
@highlight In mid to late infancy temperament of infants later diagnosed with ASD was reported to be more challenging.
@highlight Children with ASD displayed more challenging temperament features than typically developing peers.
@highlight Further research is needed into the variability of temperament in children with ASD.
