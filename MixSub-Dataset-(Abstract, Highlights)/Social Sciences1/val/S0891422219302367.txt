 Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging is able to detect localize and quantify subtle brain white matter abnormalities that may not be visible on conventional structural MRI . Over the past years a growing number of studies have applied dMRI to investigate structure function relationships in children with cerebral palsy . To provide an overview of the recent literature on dMRI and motor function in children with CP . A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed Embase Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials Cinahl and Web of Science from 2012 onwards . In total 577 children with CP in 19 studies were included . Sixteen studies only included unilateral CP while none included dyskinetic CP . Most studies focused on specific regions tracts of interest versus two studies that investigated the whole brain . In unilateral and bilateral CP white matter abnormalities were widespread including non motor areas . In unilateral CP consistent relationships were found between white matter integrity of the corticospinal tract and somatosensory pathways with upper limb sensorimotor function . The role of commissural and associative tracts remains poorly investigated . Also results describing structure function relationships in bilateral CP are scarce . This review underlines the importance of both the motor and somatosensory tracts for upper limb sensorimotor function in unilateral CP . However the exact contribution of each tract requires further exploration . In addition research on the relevance of non motor pathways is warranted as well as studies including other types of CP .

@highlight In unilateral and bilateral CP white matter microstructural abnormalities are widespread including non motor areas.
@highlight In unilateral CP dMRI reveals a relationship between the microstructural properties of motor and somatosensory tracts and upper limb sensorimotor function.
@highlight The contribution of motor versus somatosensory tracts needs further clarification.
@highlight There are limited studies in bilateral spastic CP and in children with dyskinetic CP.
