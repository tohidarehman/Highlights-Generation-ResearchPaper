 To evaluate the efficacy of Neurologic Music Therapy using a traditional and a technological intervention in improving the coordination of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder as a primary outcome and the timing and strength control of their movements as secondary outcomes . Twenty two children with ASD completed 8 NMT sessions as a part of a 2 month intervention . Participants were randomly assigned to either use an elastic touch display or tambourines . We conducted pre and post assessment evaluations including the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire and motor assessments related to the control of strength and timing of movements . All participants improved their coordination according to the DCDQ scores and exhibited better control of their movements according to the strength and timing assessments after the intervention . Participants who used the elastic touch display scored higher on the DCDQ . NMT is an efficacious treatment to improve the coordination skills of children with ASD . Elastic touch displays provide more benefits than the use of tambourines .
