 Children with Social Communication Disorder or High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder have persistent deficits in language structure and language use . This feasibility study evaluated a novel parent preference based outcome measure and secondary outcomes associated with the Social Communication Intervention Programme . 15 UK speech and language practitioners identified 20 children aged 511 years with pragmatics language needs . Practitioners received SCIP training and supervision . Children received 20 SCIP therapy sessions . Primary endpoint was a goal attainment scale . Before intervention parents provided three prioritised communication goals refined into a series of steps . After intervention parents and practitioners rated each goal compared to T1 and parents provided a narrative on outcomes . Secondary outcomes Childrens Communication Checklist 2 Social Language Development Test and observational ratings of conversational interaction . All children except one progressed on T2 SCIP GAS parent outcomes . All children progressed on practitioner SCIP GAS ratings . 82.5 of parent comments supported their own SCIP GAS ratings . Secondary outcomes measures Only SLDT Making Inferences scores and TOPICC 2 ratings showed improvement at T2 . A preference based social communication measure showed feasibility as an outcome measure following social communication intervention for children who have HFASD or SPCD .

@highlight A goal attainment scale GAS method can be used as a primary outcome in evaluating social communication therapy.
@highlight SCIP GAS was acceptable to therapists and service users who received The Social Communication Intervention Programme SCIP Children with social communication disorders made progress on a modified goal attainment scale SCIP GAS after SCIP therapy.
@highlight Improvement in pragmatic ability on a conversation observational rating scale correlated with practitioner SCIP GAS outcomes.
@highlight Reliability was established for the conversation task but more work is needed on the validity and reliability of SCIP GAS.
