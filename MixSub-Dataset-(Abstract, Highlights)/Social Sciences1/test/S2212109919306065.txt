 To determine the cost effectiveness of intensive blood pressure treatment in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease over their lifetime in Saudi Arabia . A Markov model was developed for the BP strategies to estimate the added lifetime costs and quality adjusted life years gained . These 2 items were then used to develop an incremental cost effectiveness ratio . Event rates were estimated from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial and the other model inputs were retrieved from previous studies . Estimated costs were collected from 5 private hospitals in Riyadh Saudi Arabia . The model used a lifetime framework adopting healthcare payer in Saudi Arabia . Sensitivity analysis was conducted using 1 way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness and uncertainty of the estimates . Over a 30 year period intensive BP therapy would be cost effective compared with the standard treatment with incremental costs per QALY in US dollars of 24 056 . Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested intensive BP treatment would be cost effective compared with standard treatment 86.7 of the time at a willingness to pay threshold of 60 000 per QALY . The result of this study showed that intensive BP treatment appears to be a cost effective choice for patients with a high risk of CVD in Saudi Arabia when compared with standard treatment .

@highlight Intensive blood pressure BP treatment may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in high risk patients but is associated with increased medication use and higher costs and may result in a considerable increase in adverse events.
@highlight In the present analysis we determined the cost effectiveness of intensive BP treatment in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease CVD over their lifetime in Saudi Arabia.
@highlight Our analysis shows that intensive BP treatment for the average 68 year old patient costs in US dollars 24 056 per quality adjusted life year QALY gained which is considered to be cost effective in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
