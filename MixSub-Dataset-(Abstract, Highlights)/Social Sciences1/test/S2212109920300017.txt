 The ICEpop CAPability measure for adults is a measure of capability well being for adults and by focusing on more than health can extend the evaluative space of economic evaluations . The aim of this study was to translate and culturally adapt the ICECAP A questionnaire into Persian to assess the construct validity and reliability of the ICECAP A in the Iranian general population . In this study we followed Beatons guidelines for cross cultural adaptation of self report measures . The questionnaire was administered to a sample of 1200 members of the general population using a stratified probability sampling method . The construct validity and reliability of the ICECAP A were evaluated in relation to the EuroQol 5 dimension questionnaire . After translating and adapting the questionnaire the term being settled was changed to stability for the Iranian cultural context . A moderate correlation was found between the ICECAP A and EQ 5D 5L index scores and the ICECAP A scores showed differences across different health and socio economic groups . The results of the exploratory factor analysis indicated that the 2 instruments measured 2 different constructs . In terms of reliability the internal consistency of the measure using Cronbachs alpha was found to be 0.82 and for testretest reliability the intraclass correlation coefficient was found to be 0.90 for total scores . The results of this study suggest that the Persian version of the ICECAP A is a valid and reliable questionnaire and can complement EQ 5D measures already used in Iran .

@highlight The ICEpop CAPability measure for adults ICECAP A is a measure of capability well being and by focusing on more than health can extend the evaluative space of economic evaluations and offer a wider scope for decision makers in the field of healthcare.
@highlight The Persian version of the ICECAP A is not available.
@highlight This is the first study on the translation of the ICECAP A to Persian and explores the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the ICECAP A in the Iranian general population.
@highlight The Persian version of the ICECAP A is a valid and reliable capability measure and can identify expected differences in capability well being across a general population sample.
@highlight The results of the construct study suggest that the ICECAP A and the EuroQol 5 dimension questionnaire EQ 5D 5L can be seen as complementary measures rather than substitutes for one another because they measure 2 different constructs and provide different information.
@highlight This study offers a tool for measuring outcomes for economic evaluations in Iran and suggests that the ICECAP A measure can identify policy relevant differences in well being.
