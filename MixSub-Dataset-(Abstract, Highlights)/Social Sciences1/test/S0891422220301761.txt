 Mathematical difficulties in individuals with Williams Syndrome and in individuals with Down Syndrome are well established . Perceptual subitizing and conceptual subitizing are domain specific precursors of mathematical achievement in typically developing population . This study employed for the first time eye tracking methodology to investigate subitizing abilities in WS and DS . Twenty five participants with WS and 24 participants with DS were compared to a younger group of TD children matched for mental age . Participants were asked to enumerate one to six dots arranged either in a dice or a random pattern . Accuracy rates and analyses of reaction time showed no significant differences between the clinical groups and the control group suggesting that all participants used the same processes to perform the enumeration task in the different experimental conditions . Analyses of the eye movements showed that both individuals with WS and individuals with DS were using inefficient scanning strategies when counting . Moreover analyses of the eye movements showed significantly shorter fixation duration in participants with DS compared to the control group in all the experimental conditions . The current study provides evidence that individuals with WS and individuals with DS perform both perceptual subitizing and conceptual subitizing . Moreover our results suggest a fixation instability in DS group that does not affect their performance when subitizing but might explain their low accuracy rates when counting . Findings are discussed in relation to previous studies and the impact for intervention programmes to improve counting and symbolic mathematical abilities in these populations .

@highlight This study examined perceptual and conceptual subitizing in individuals with Down syndrome and Williams syndrome by means of eye tracking.
@highlight No significant differences in accuracy RT and fixation count suggested that all participants performed perceptual and conceptual subitizing.
@highlight Participants with DS showed significantly shorter fixations in all experimental conditions when compared to the control group.
@highlight When counting both participants with DS and participants with WS used inefficient scanning strategies.
