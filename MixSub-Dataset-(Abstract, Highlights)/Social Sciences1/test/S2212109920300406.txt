 The analysis aims to assess the cost effectiveness of cefuroxime in the prophylaxis of postoperative endophthalmitis after cataract surgery compared with the absence of antibiotic prophylaxis from the National Health Fund perspective in Poland . We performed a cost effectiveness and cost utility analysis using the decision tree and Markov model respectively for patients after cataract surgery . The efficacy of Aprokam was 0.21 0.08 0.55 and is based on the results of the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery study . According to the epidemiological data from Poland the risk of POE is 0.377 . The costs associated with the Aprokam administration and POE treatment costs were included . We determined the utilities of the health states in the model depending on visual loss due to POE . To determine the uncertainty of estimates parameters a one way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed . Using Aprokam allows avoiding 0.003 POEs per patient . The benefit from the intervention is 0.0007 quality adjusted life years per patient in the lifetime horizon . The total costs of prophylaxis are higher at about 1.70 . The cost of avoiding one POE is about 569.85 . The estimated incremental cost effectiveness utility ratio is equal to 2427.72 quality adjusted life years and it is significantly lower than the cost effectiveness threshold in Poland in 2019 . In all scenarios of performed one way sensitivity analyses Aprokam is cost effective . In Poland the use of Aprokam is cost effective with the estimated incremental cost utility ratio significantly lower than the cost effectiveness threshold .

@highlight Endophthalmitis is one of the most serious complications after cataract surgery. The incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis POE in Europe ranges from 0.03 to 1.2 and depends on the use of antibiotic prophylaxis. Owing to the serious health consequences of POE and despite its relatively low incidence clinical guidelines recommend the use of antibiotic prophylaxis.
@highlight In this study we assessed the cost effectiveness of cefuroxime Aprokam Laboratoires Thea France in the prophylaxis of POE after cataract surgery compared with the absence of antibiotic prophylaxis in the context of the Polish healthcare system.
@highlight Intracameral administration of cefuroxime Aprokam after cataract surgery allows avoiding 0.003 POE events per patient with prophylaxis. In Poland the use of Aprokam is cost effective with the estimated incremental cost utility ratio significantly lower than the cost effectiveness threshold.
