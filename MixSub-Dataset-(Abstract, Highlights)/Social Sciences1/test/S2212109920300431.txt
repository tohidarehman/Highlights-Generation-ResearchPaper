 Severe consequences of mother to child transmission of syphilis and high increasing incidence of congenital syphilis remains an important public health problem in Brazil . Our objective was to assess the cost effectiveness of a rapid point of care test and treatment of positive mothers immediately compared with a laboratory based standard test with treatment at next follow up visit . A decision analytic model was developed to estimate the incremental cost effectiveness ratio between antenatal syphilis screening strategies . The model was built with lifetime horizon from Brazilian health system perspective using 3 and 5 discount rates . A hypothetical cohort of pregnant women at reproductive age were used in the model . Health outcomes low birth weight stillbirths neonatal deaths and congenital syphilis were estimated in disability adjusted life years lost . Microcosting study and secondary data provided parameters of direct medical costs . Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken . For base case the mean cost per pregnant woman screened was 2.63 and 2.48 respectively . Maternal syphilis was associated with a loss of 0.0043 DALYs and 0.0048 DALYs per mother screened . Expected value of incremental cost per DALY averted was 298.08 . After 10000 probabilistic sensitivity analysis model runs incremental cost and health benefits were 0.15 and 0.00042 DALYs respectively with a mean ICER of 357.44 per DALY . Screening with RT has a 58 chance of being the optimal strategy at a threshold of 3 200 per DALY . In Brazil antenatal screening with syphilis RT and immediate treatment is likely to be cost effective compared with standard screening and must be prioritized in local settings .

@highlight Latin American countries have been enacting efforts to control sexually transmitted diseases particularly focusing on elimination of mother to child syphilis transmission. Economic studies on the cost effectiveness of screening for gestational syphilis with rapid diagnostic tests during prenatal care has absolute relevance for Brazil considering the severe consequences of mother to child transmission of the disease and the high incidence of congenital syphilis in the country.
@highlight We found that syphilis screening in pregnancy with a rapid test and providing treatment of women who test positive the same day of the antenatal visit is likely to be a highly cost effective strategy in Brazil. This is significant because despite the free access to treatment by pregnant women in the Unified Health System and the increased diagnosis and improved access to prenatal care the number of new cases of syphilis in pregnancy and childbirth have been increasing in recent years.
@highlight Economic evaluation could help the Ministry of Health decisionmakers in setting future directions for mother to child syphilis transmission strategies and provide a better understanding of new testing technologies. Our findings indicate that strategies including rapid tests for syphilis should be reinforced and prioritized in local settings and could be extended to other low and middle income countries.
