 Studying sit to stand in children with Cerebral Palsy addressing the domains of ICF allows determining the factors influencing STS in this population . To systematically review the literature on STS in children with CP identifying which ICF domains have been assessed and how they relate to sit to stand . A literature search was conducted in electronic databases by combining the keywords AND AND . We included cross sectional articles published in English that assessed STS movements in children with CP up to 18 years old . 25 articles met the inclusion criteria . All of them assessed Body Functions and Structure . According to them body alignment muscle strength and postural sway affect STS movement . Six studies related Activity and Participation with STS demonstrating that worse scores in scales that evaluate activities and participation are related to the poorer STS execution . Contextual factors were addressed in 15 studies childrens age bench height manipulation of sensory information and mechanical restriction impact the way children execute STS . Contextual factors and Body Functions and Structure impact the STS in children with CP . However few studies have evaluated the participation of these children . Based on the theoretical framework of the ICF it is important that future studies evaluate functional tasks in children with CP and the components that can affect them . The adoption of the biopsychosocial model strengthens the understanding of functioning which can contribute to rehabilitation planning .
