 Insomnia is highly prevalent in children with neurodevelopmental disorders yet little research exists on sleep treatment access utilization and provision in this population . This study explores barriers and facilitators to access use and provision of treatment for sleep problems as experienced by parents of children with NDDs including Autism Spectrum Disorder Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Cerebral Palsy and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and health care professionals who work with children with these conditions . Transcripts from online focus groups and interviews conducted separately with parents of children with NDDs parent factors and the challenging intensive nature of sleep treatment . Facilitators included positive beliefs and attitudes education support and ability to modify treatments for NDD symptoms . Barriers and facilitators were similar across all four NDDs . Results highlight a need for more education about sleep in NDDs and to develop accessible interventions as well as the potential of a transdiagnostic approach to sleep treatment in this population .
