 To evaluate excess healthcare resource utilization and costs among patients with both type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease relative to those with T2D only in Israel . A retrospective observational cohort study of adult patients with T2D from the Maccabi Healthcare Services in Israel who enrolled in a cardiovascular registry between 2013 and 2016 . Patients with established CVD between 2013 and 2016 were propensity matched 1 2 to control patients without established CVD . HRU and medical costs were extracted for a 2 year observation period and analyzed using generalized linear models . Overall 4 582 patients with established CVD were matched 1 2 to 9151 controls . HRU and costs were significantly higher in patients with established CVD versus controls across a wide range of resources . In total annual costs per patient were 10011.8 and 7206.8 in patients with established CVD and controls respectively . Hospitalizations primary care visits and medications for any condition were the main cost drivers with greater utilization and higher costs in the established CVD group versus controls In a real world setting HRU and costs were significantly higher in patients with T2D and established CVD compared with controls across the vast majority of resource types . These up to date cost estimates of CVD improve our understanding of the financial implications of established CVD beyond the direct expenses .

@highlight Cardiovascular disease CVD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality for individuals with diabetes and the largest contributor to associated healthcare costs. Previous studies assessing CVD related health expenditure underlined the cost increase which largely was due to direct expenditure in the immediate care of an acute event. A thorough analysis of the deferred impact of CV events on healthcare resource utilization HRU in the postevent period is lacking.
@highlight This retrospective database analysis provides comprehensive and up to date estimates of HRU and medical costs in patients with T2D and established CVD in Israel. HRU and costs were significantly higher in patients with established CVD versus propensity matched controls across a wide range of resource types including hospitalizations primary care visits emergency room visits and medication for any condition. Furthermore hospitalizations primary care visits and medications were the key cost drivers.
@highlight New international diabetes guidelines provide guidance on the prevention and management of CVD and treatment options. By characterizing and dissecting HRU and medical costs in patients with T2D either alone or in combination with CVD our findings provide valuable data for healthcare payers and insurers in evaluating the cost benefit of implementing the new guidelines. These data provide further evidence that CV complications of T2D place substantial economic burden on healthcare systems beyond immediate event related expenses.
