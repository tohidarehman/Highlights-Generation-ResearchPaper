 Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is an innovative and effective treatment in high surgical risk and inoperable patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis . This cost effectiveness analysis of transfemoral TAVI compared with surgical aortic valve replacement conforms with the methodological guidelines for cost effectiveness evaluation by the Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare in Japan . The cost effectiveness of TF TAVI using SAPIEN XT was evaluated using a lifetime Markov simulation from the national payer perspective . Comparators were SAVR for HR patients and standard of care for inoperable patients . A systematic literature review for clinical evidence of TF TAVI and comparators was conducted . The evidence for TF TAVI was derived from the SOURCE XT registry and Japanese post marketing surveillance . Because there was no literature directly or indirectly comparing TF TAVI using SAPIEN XT with comparators the comparator data were selected from relevant published studies considering the similarity of study eligibility criteria and patient backgrounds . Sensitivity analyses were used to validate the robustness of results . The incremental cost effectiveness ratio of TF TAVI versus SAVR for HR patients was 1.3 million quality adjusted life years . The incremental cost effectiveness ratio of TF TAVI versus SOC for inoperable patients was 3.5 million QALY . TF TAVI was cost effective when compared with SAVR for HR patients and when compared with SOC for inoperable patients using a threshold of 5 million QALY .

@highlight This study analyzed the cost effectiveness of transcatheter aortic valve implantation TAVI using a balloon expandable valve consistent with the Japanese Pilot Health Technology Assessment HTA . This study demonstrated the methods and results used in the Pilot HTA.
@highlight This study had several strengths compared with the previous cost effectiveness analysis of TAVI in Japan. First clinical inputs were derived from a systematic literature review of 5088 articles accounting for bias according to the Cochrane handbook. Second cost data were extracted from the Japanese claims data from 270 hospitals. Last the analytical framework eg parameters evidence selection criteria was discussed by an expert multidisciplinary advisory board including a health economist cardiologists and a cardiovascular surgeon.
