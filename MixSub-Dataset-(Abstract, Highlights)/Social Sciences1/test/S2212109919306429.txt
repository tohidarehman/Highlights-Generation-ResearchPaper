 Countries have constrained healthcare budgets and must prioritize new interventions depending on health goals and time frame . This situation is relevant in the sphere of national immunization programs for which many different vaccines are proposed budgets are limited and efficient choices must be made in the order of vaccine introduction . A constrained optimization model for infectious diseases was developed in which different intervention types were combined for consideration in Malaysia . Local experts defined their priority public health issues pneumococcal disease dengue hepatitis B and C rotavirus neonatal pertussis and cholera . Epidemiological cost and effectiveness data were informed from local or regionally published literature . The model aimed to maximize quality adjusted life year gain through the reduction of events in each of the different diseases under budget and intervention coverage constraints . The QALY impact of the interventions was assessed over 2 periods lifetime and 20 years . The period of investment was limited to 15 years . The assessment time horizon influenced the prioritization of interventions maximizing QALY gain . The incremental health gains compared with a uninformed prioritization were large for the first 8 years and declined thereafter . Rotaviral and pneumococcal vaccines were identified as key priorities irrespective of time horizon hepatitis B immune prophylaxis and hepatitis C treatment were priorities with the lifetime horizon and dengue vaccination replaced these with the 20 year horizon . CO modeling is a useful tool for making economically efficient decisions within public health programs for the control of infectious diseases by helping prioritize the selection of interventions to maximize health gain under annual budget constraints .

@highlight There is an increasing unmet demand for health interventions at a country level while the associated budgets are restricted. Under such circumstances new interventions are to be prioritized to maximize societal health gain. Traditional health economic analyses have limitations when assessing multiple interventions across disease areas while considering budget limitations. Constrained optimization is a method that helps address these limitations.
@highlight When applied to a Malaysian setting with a focus on interventions targeting infectious diseases and maximizing quality adjusted life year gain over lifetime or 20 years the optimized order of introduction of the interventions under annual budget constraints was dependent on the period of assessment.
@highlight The constrained optimization method itself was found to be transparent and easy to apply and should be considered as a full value assessment of economic efficiency in the field of healthcare as it has been effectively used for many years in other sectors of industry such as fishery agriculture forestry and tourism among others.
