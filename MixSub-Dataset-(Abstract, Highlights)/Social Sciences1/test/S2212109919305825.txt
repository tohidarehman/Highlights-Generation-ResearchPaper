Face to face computer assisted interviews using the EuroQol Portable Valuation Technology protocol of composite time trade off In the pilot study the acceptability of the tasks was good and there were no special concerns with undertaking the This is the first EQ 5D 5L valuation study in Africa using international valuation methods

@highlight There is a growing interest in health technology assessment and economic evaluation in low resource settings such as Ethiopia.
@highlight This study developed a value set for the EQ 5D 5L using an Ethiopian general population sample with the EuroQol GroupPortable Valuation Technology EQ PVT protocol administered in Amharic.
@highlight The new value set provides local users with societal preferences that are relevant.
@highlight The study also established the feasibility of using the less resource intensive EQ PVT which is relevant for future studies.
