There was a significant effect of participant level of education on the AKT scores . The availability of the AKT in Arabic is a valuable addition to the limited available tools related to asthma . As a simple and short tool it could be used in clinical practice and research to identify specific areas of patient asthma knowledge needing improvements hence targeted interventions are sought .
