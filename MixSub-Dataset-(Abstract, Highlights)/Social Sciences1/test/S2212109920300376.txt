 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a severe progressive disease with poor prognosis . Patients show an increased healthcare utilization pattern consisting of regular physician consultations and monitoring tests . The aim of the present study was to estimate healthcare resource utilization and out of pocket expenditures for IPF patients in Greece . An IPF specific questionnaire was constructed which focused on retrospective healthcare resource utilization and out of pocket expenditures within a 6 month period . Upon informed consent the questionnaires were completed anonymously . The study sample included 123 IPF patients . Within a 6 month period 85.4 of the patients visited their treating physician 1.400 29.4 visited other physicians for IPF related reasons 42.9 visited a healthcare setting and 10.6 required hospitalization . Spirometry and blood tests were the most common tests for IPF monitoring . Almost half of the respondents stated they had private expenditures for IPF medication physician visits hospital services medical tests or other IPF related reasons . IPF management requires regular contact with healthcare services and uptake of specific medical tests . Considering the high proportion of patients bearing out of pocket costs along with the decline of incomes in Greece improvement of the disease management is important and action should be taken to lower the financial burden imposed on patients .

@highlight Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF imposes a high economic burden on both patients and healthcare systems. Although the overall cost and healthcare utilization of IPF has been identified as quite high for health systems worldwide the cost that the disease imposes on individual patients has not been investigated.
@highlight The participation of almost half of the IPF patients in this study to their health expenditure is alarming in light of the high cost that the disease incurs. Considering the decreased income and constantly decreasing pensions in Greece a reasonable question arises as for how long IPF patients along with other chronic patients will be able to bear the economic burden imposed by the disease and the inadequate support of the state.
