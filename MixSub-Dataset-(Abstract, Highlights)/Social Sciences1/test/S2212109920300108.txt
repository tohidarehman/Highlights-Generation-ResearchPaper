 This study aims to translate culturally adapt and validate the Short Form 6D instruments for measuring quality of life as outcome parameters in pharmacoeconomic studies . The forward backward methods were applied to translate the SF 6D questionnaire . A preliminary Indonesian version of SF 6D questionnaire was field tested in samples of 470 adult general population . Testretest reliability was assessed by using Spearman rank correlation coefficient and internal consistency with Cronbach . Face validity was assessed descriptively based on the response of the respondents to all items in SF 6D . The construct validity test included internal construct validity and convergent validity which was assessed by examining the correlation between the questionnaire and Euro Quality of life 5D based on the scale of each domain . The known group method was used to test discriminant validity . Mann Whitney The SF 6D was a valid and reliable questionnaire indicated by the reliability coefficient of 0.725 and the value of each item ranging from 0.698 to 0.750 . Construct validity indicated a strong correlation between physical functioning role limitation social functioning pain and mental health with the SF 6D utility score . Convergent validity showed a weak and moderate correlation between dimensions on SF 6D and Euro Quality of life 5D . The SF 6D questionnaire has been translated into Indonesian version . The SF 6D questionnaire is valid and reliable . Known group validity shows that the SF 6D could differentiate utility scores by age group and history present illness .

@highlight Short Form 6D SF 6D questionnaire is a generic questionnaire to measure health related quality of life and has been widely used for surveys in populations clinical practices and clinical trials. SF 6D can also be used in economic evaluations for a preference based single index estimate of health status. The algorithm for SF 6D scoring has been developed by the University of Sheffield United Kingdom.
@highlight The Indonesian version of SF 6D is not available yet. Therefore there is a need for translation cultural adaptation and validation of the SF 6D instrument to the Indonesian version as one of the instruments to measure utility. The results showed that SF 6D is a valid and reliable measurement tool for health related quality of life in the general Indonesian population. SF 6D also could differentiate utility scores by age group and history present illness.
@highlight SF 6D can be used as a reference for preference based assessments research. This study provides an alternative instrument to express the value of healthcare including health utility assessments for decision making in determining cost effective intervention strategies.
