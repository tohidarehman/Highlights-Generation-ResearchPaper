 Individuals with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability more frequently experience potentially traumatic events and may be more vulnerable to trauma related symptoms . However it is unclear how such symptoms are captured on tools used for behavioural and psychiatric assessment in this population . To explore whether and how PTEs are associated with symptom reports in adults with ASD and ID . Associations and group differences for death of a close relative and serious disease injury in a close relative caregiver friend were explored in a clinical sample of 171 adults with ASD and ID referred for psychiatric assessment . Symptoms were measured using Aberrant Behavior Checklist and Psychopathology in Autism Checklist . Disease injury was associated with higher scores on ABC irritability ABC hyperactivity and self injurious behaviour . Death was associated with lower scores on ABC lethargy and ABC stereotypic behaviour . Some associations reached significance only when controlling for ASD ID or verbal language skills but the identified associations were not robust . No associations were found for PAC . There is a risk of under appreciating the impact of PTEs in this population unless ASD ID and verbal language skills are taken into account .

@highlight Potentially traumatic events seemed to be associated with behavioural symptoms.
@highlight ASD ID verbal language skills all affected associations between events and symptoms.
@highlight There is a risk of under appreciating the impact of events on behaviour in ASD ID.
@highlight Self injurious behaviours may constitute a trauma related symptom in ASD ID.
