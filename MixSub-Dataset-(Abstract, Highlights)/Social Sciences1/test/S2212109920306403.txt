 We aim to explore how the current increase in Healthcare Insurance Coverage in Colombia potentially affected educational inequalities in cardiovascular disease mortality from 1998 to2015 . The official death database for the period 1998 to 2015 codified by cause of death for CVD . People with a lower educational level have an increased risk of dying prematurely owing to CVD the higher inequalities being those for young women . Inequalities by educational level grew at a rate of 2.5 per year in men and 1.7 in women despite the steady increase of HIC throughout the period . From 1998 to 2011 there was a significant decrease in mortality rates owing to CVD . As of 2011 there was an increase only for men . In Colombia educational inequalities could be a cause of the worrying increase in mortality caused by CVD which affects women more than men whereas the HIC seem to be ineffective at reducing educational inequalities and therefore mortality by CVD .

@highlight It is assumed that increasing health insurance coverage potentially contributes to improving healthcare access among the poor and therefore reducing health inequalities.
@highlight We found a reduction except during last years in mortality rates due to cardiovascular diseases in Colombia during 1998 to 2015. Meanwhile healthcare insurance coverage increased but educational inequalities grew.
@highlight Health insurance coverage seems to be insufficient to achieve better health outcomes and multiple and complex strategies that go much further should be addressed.
