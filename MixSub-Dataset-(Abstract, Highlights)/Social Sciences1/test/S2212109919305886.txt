 To assess the cost effectiveness of population based abdominal aortic aneurysm screening in Estonia . A Markov cohort model was used to evaluate the cost effectiveness of population based AAA screening compared with no screening . A hypothetical cohort of 6000 men aged 65 was followed for 35 years . Data for disease transition probabilities and quality of life outcomes were obtained from published literature costs were calculated based on Estonian data . Analysis followed the healthcare payers perspective using an annual discount rate of 5 for costs and effects . The model evaluated the number of avoidable AAA ruptures and AAA related deaths and the differences in costs and quality adjusted life years . The AAA screening would have prevented 10 AAA ruptures and 6 AAA related deaths among the cohort of 6000 men resulting in 23 QALYs gained . The additional cost of the screening and treatment was 39 429 with the incremental cost effectiveness ratio for screening compared with no screening being 17303 per QALY gained . Although results were sensitive to assumptions regarding health related quality of life and the models time horizon screening was found to be cost effective with a 99 probability at a willingness to pay threshold of 30 000 per QALY . Population based AAA screening of elderly men is likely to be a cost effective measure in reducing the AAA related disease burden . Given the increase in the overall costs the actual policy decisions regarding implementing an AAA screening program in Estonia are likely to be influenced by availability of resources as well .

@highlight Ultrasonographic screening is effective in reducing abdominal aortic aneurysm AAA ruptures and AAA related mortality and several national screening programs have been implemented in Western Europe.
@highlight In a first attempt to cover the cost effectiveness of AAA screening in an Eastern European setting this article assesses the costs and outcomes of AAA screening in a cohort of 65 year old men in Estonia.
@highlight AAA screening could be cost effective even in a low prevalence scenario but the actual policy decisions are dependent on the availability of resources.
