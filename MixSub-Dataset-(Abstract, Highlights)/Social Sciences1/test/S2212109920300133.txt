This study evaluates the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Health Belief Model Scale for BSE and identifies the factors that influence its practice . A cross sectional design was used 738 Mexican women aged 20 years and older who attended a tertiary public hospital were evaluated . The HBMS of Champion was translated into Spanish . Focus groups of women were consulted and experts judgments were gathered to determine content validity . In the exploratory factor analysis a structure of 6 factors was obtained and Cronbachs alpha scales ranged between 0.65 and 0.84 . BSE practice was associated with age 1.05 confidence interval 1.03 1.07 self efficacy barriers and health motivation . The Spanish version of the HBMS is an adequate valid and reliable instrument for the Mexican population that allows us to evaluate their beliefs about breast cancer and BSE and it should also be applicable to other Spanish speaking people .
