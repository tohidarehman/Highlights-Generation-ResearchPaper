 Vascular and biliary complications associated with liver transplants involve high morbidity and mortality as well as cost overrun for health systems . Efforts to prioritize their prevention require not only clinical information but also information on costs that reflect the economic burden on health systems . The objective of this study was to describe cost overrun incurred from early vascular and biliary complications after liver transplant . This cases series included liver transplant patients treated at the San Vicente Foundation University Hospital Rionegro Antioquia from January 1 2013 to December 31 2018 . All liver transplant patients treated during the above period were included the absence of clinical records on the variables of interest was considered the exclusion criterion . A probabilistic analysis of patient cost was performed . Monte Carlo simulations as well as a 1 way sensitivity analysis per transplant cost component were performed . Records from 154 patients were assessed . The average patient age was 56.9 years 42.9 of patients were women . Of all 36.4 patients were classified as Child C and the average Model for End Stage Liver Disease score was 19.6 . The average cost for patients without complications was 27834.82 whereas that for patients with early vascular complications was 36747.83 and for those with early biliary complications was 38523.74 . Early vascular and biliary complications after liver transplant increase healthcare costs with the increase being significant in patients with biliary complications .

@highlight Early vascular and biliary complications are frequent in liver transplant patients with little information available on the economic burden incurred from these complications.
@highlight This is the first study to describe the nature of cost overrun incurred from these complications after liver transplant in Latin America.
@highlight In liver transplant patients with early vascular and biliary complications the costs incurred from medical procedures drugs and clinical laboratory examinations had the highest impact on the total transplant cost.
@highlight Liver transplant is the second most common type of transplant there are studies providing cost estimations for liver transplant in different countries but there are no such studies in Colombian transplant units.
@highlight This study provides an estimation of the cost of a liver transplant in Colombia.
@highlight The average cost of a liver transplant in Colombia in the absence of biliary or vascular complications is 27834.82 in patients with early vascular complications the average cost is 36747.83 and in those with early biliary complications the average cost is 38523.74.
