 Some research suggests that university lecture attendance positively correlates with academic performance . Although there are several motivational pathways which may explain attendance few studies have examined the psychosocial factors leading to student attendance intentions and behavior . Consequently we evaluated via structural equation modeling two prominent motivational theories to help explain lecture attendance Self Determination Theory and The Theory of Planned Behavior . Undergraduates

@highlight Self Determination Theory showed little utility for predicting lecture attendance.
@highlight The Theory of Planned Behavior showed promising utility for predicting lecture attendance.
@highlight Lecture attendance did not correlate with grades.
