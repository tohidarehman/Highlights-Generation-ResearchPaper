 Specific learning disorders are common as is their comorbidity . It has been suggested that the core cognitive deficit in dyscalculia is an impairment in numerical magnitude processing similarly in dyslexia phonological processing deficits are considered to be the main cognitive deficit . Cognitive theories on comorbid dyslexia dyscalculia have suggested a number of hypotheses about which cognitive deficits underlie the comorbidity . However few studies have thus far directly compared the abovementioned cognitive correlates of dyscalculia and dyslexia .

@highlight The origin of the comorbidity between dyslexia and dyscalculia remains unclear.
@highlight Children with dyslexia had deficits in phonological skills.
@highlight Children with dyscalculia were not impaired in magnitude processing.
@highlight Children with dyscalculia had lower spatial skills.
@highlight Comorbid dyslexia dyscalculia was also predicted by childrens spatial skills.
