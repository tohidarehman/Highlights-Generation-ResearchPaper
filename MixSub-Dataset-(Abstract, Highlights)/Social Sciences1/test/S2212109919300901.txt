 Neurologic disorders impose a heavy burden on healthcare in Singapore . To date no data on the willingness to pay for neurologic treatments has been reported in the local population . We aimed to quantify the value of various health domains to neuroscience patients and their caregivers by comparing their WTP for different types of treatments . A questionnaire using a mixed open ended and closed ended contingent valuation method was developed to elicit WTP and self administered by 112 visitors to a neuroscience outpatient clinic . The WTP for treatments in 3 health domains was evaluated and compared . Subgroup regression analysis was performed to investigate the impact of demographic and socioeconomic factors . Treatment that improved cosmesis had the highest median WTP of Singapore dollar 35000 followed by treatment that provided 1 year of life extension and 1 year of advanced restored function SGD 10000 This is the first study to provide data on how different health domains are valued by neuroscience patients and caregivers in our population . Respondents valued treatment that restored or improved their physical appearances the most . These findings could contribute to future policies on the improvement of neuroscience care .

@highlight This is the first study to investigate the willingness to pay for neurologic treatments targeted to improve 3 health domains advanced restoration of function life extension and cosmesis .
@highlight Neuroscience patients and caregivers had the highest valuation for treatment that improved cosmesis and lowest for treatment that provided 1 year of advanced restoration of function.
@highlight Those with a university education were willing to pay as much as 2 to 3 times of those without across all 3 health domains.
@highlight Neuroscience patients and caregivers may value treatments that are able to restore or improve their physical appearances the most.
