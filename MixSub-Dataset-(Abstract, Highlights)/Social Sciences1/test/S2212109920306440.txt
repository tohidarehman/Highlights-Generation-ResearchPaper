 To evaluate the incremental cost effectiveness ratio of the addition of bevacizumab to first line chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer from the perspective of the Colombian health system . A Markov model was employed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of bevacizumab carboplatin paclitaxel compared with carboplatin paclitaxel in the treatment of NSCLS during a 4 year period . The health outcome was the number of life years gained and quality adjusted life years obtained from the survival curves reported in a clinical study . Costs were estimated using national tariff and reported in US dollars at a date in 2019 . Costs and effectiveness outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3.5 per year . A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed on important parameters with a Monte Carlo simulation . The costs of BCP and CP were 30 341 and 11 735 respectively . The LYG for BCP and CP were 0.34 and 0.29 respectively . The QALY for BCP and CP were 0.27 and 0.23 . The ICER of BCP versus CP was 465 150 QALY . The results of the Monte Carlo simulation showed that CP was cost effective in 100 of the iterations compared with BCP . The addition of bevacizumab to the scheme carboplatin paclitaxel compared to carboplatin paclitaxel for NSCLC is not cost effective from the point of view of the Colombian health system .

@highlight Lung cancer is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. The addition of bevacizumaba monoclonal antibodyto conventional treatment increases overall survival in about 3 months at a considerable cost.
@highlight With this study we found that the addition of bevacizumab to carboplatin plus paclitaxel chemotherapy scheme is not cost effective from the willingness to pay in Colombia as defined previously considering the perspective of the publicly financed health system.
@highlight Because health resources are limited it is necessary for decision makers to have tools such as economic evaluations. In this sense this article provides information on the cost effectiveness of bevacizumab in lung cancer.
