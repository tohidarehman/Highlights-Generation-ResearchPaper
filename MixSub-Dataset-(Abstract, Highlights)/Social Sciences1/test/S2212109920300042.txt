 To calculate the total revenue under a hypothetical 1 Malaysian Ringgit prescription cost sharing model in government healthcare facilities in Pahang Malaysia . A cross sectional study was conducted at outpatient pharmacy in all government healthcare facilities in Pahang from year 2013 to 2017 . Each dispensed medication was calculated as 1 MYR and contributed to the total revenue . A total of 11 hospitals and 81 health clinics were recruited into the study . A hospital could generate 0.311 million MYR per year and a district health department could generate 0.623 million MYR per year giving a total of 10.268 million MYR revenue every year in Pahang Malaysia . Under the prescription medicines cost sharing scheme it was shown that an average of 9.4 of the total pharmaceutical spending could be recovered . The recovery percentage was approximately fourfold higher in health clinics when compared with that in hospitals . An estimated 10 million MYR or 10 from the total Ministry of Health pharmaceutical spending could be collected under the proposed 1 MYR prescription cost sharing model .

@highlight In Malaysia Ministry of Health facilities medications are fully subsidized by the government and they are dispensed at zero cost to all patients. Evidence showed that a prescription copayment could reduce unnecessary demand and minimize medication wastage.
@highlight This study conceptualized and tested a hypothetical low cost prescription copayment in terms of feasibility focusing on the percentage recovery in total pharmaceutical spending government budgetallocation .
@highlight A patient contribution of 1 Malaysian Ringgit could recover 9.4 of the total pharmaceutical spending. The recovery percentage was approximately fourfold higher in health clinics 16.5 21.7 compared to in hospitals 4.3 5.2 .
