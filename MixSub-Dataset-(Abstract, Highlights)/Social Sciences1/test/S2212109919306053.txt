 To identify and describe the various economic evaluation studies in Malaysia and to determine the range of incremental cost effectiveness ratios as reported in these studies . A comprehensive search of the scientific electronic databases was conducted to identify all published economic evaluation studies related to Malaysian healthcare . Two researchers assessed the quality of selected studies using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist and Quality of Health Economic Studies instrument . The assessment was also reviewed by expert members of the Technical Advisory Committee of Health Technology Economic Evaluations . A total of 64 full text articles were assessed for eligibility and included in this systematic review . Thirty studies were partial economic evaluations the full economic evaluations included 17 cost effectiveness analyses and 17 cost utility analyses . From all the reported ICERs the majority were categorized as highly cost effective per capita per quality adjusted life years or disability adjusted life years gained . This review identifies information gaps and loopholes in health economics research in Malaysia . Additionally this study provides the information that the majority of published interventions in Malaysia fell within the cost effectiveness threshold of 1 GDP per capita per quality adjusted life years or disability adjusted life years gained .

@highlight Economic evaluation studies provide valuable inputs in healthcare decision making. Nevertheless publications related to this area are still sparse in Malaysia there is a need for more health economics research to cater to the demand.
@highlight This review provides essential information in determining the acceptable cost effectiveness threshold in Malaysia based on a human capital approach or gross domestic product GDP per capita which may influence the value of decision making for health interventions and programs in the country.
