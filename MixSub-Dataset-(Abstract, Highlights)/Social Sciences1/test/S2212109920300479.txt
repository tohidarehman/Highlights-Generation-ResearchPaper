 There are challenges in conducting a budget impact analysis for rare disorders . Through this case study we present some challenges and limitations of a BIA of managing patients affected with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency . We explored a conceptual basis and barriers for health services researchers interested in quantifying budget impacts of rare disease management program . We developed a static budget impact cost calculator model in Microsoft Excel obtaining the clinical impact of a DMP from the literature and translating it into costs using OLDW . Cost inputs and resource use was obtained from 2010 to 2015 claims data using the OLDW . Insurers payments were calculated and categorized into the following cost buckets physician visits emergency room visits inpatients stays augmentation therapy other prescription drugs costs and other costs . Data were based on 6832 patients with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency identified among over 21 million OLDW enrollees observed between January 1 2010 and December 31 2015 . The introduction of a DMP was estimated to decrease costs of the management of patients with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency by 13.5 million over 5 years . The savings attributed to the program over the 5 year time horizon are due to 2555 exacerbations 5180 emergency room visits 9342 specialist visits and 105358 general practitioner visits avoided . A comprehensive DMP for a rare condition might provide cost savings to a health plan . BIAs for rare disease may be more informative if they focus on DMPs rather than on individual drugs .

@highlight Budget impact analysis BIA considers all potentially eligible patients to receive the new intervention covered with the budget being modeled. The accuracy of such estimations depends on the availability and quality of the data in addition to BIA design with corresponding assumptions. While there are accurate prevalence estimates available for common diseases eg hypertension diabetes quantifying the prevalence of a disease has been posing substantial difficulties when it affects only a small fraction of patients rare disease .
@highlight Previously the most prominent way to conduct cost studies in rare disease studies was through patient surveys. Large data sets belonging to insurers in the US open a new chapter in studying rare conditions from an economic standpoint.
@highlight We present a practical case study of conducting BIA of a disease management program DMP for a small fraction of patients using the clinical impact of a DMP from the literature and then translating it into costs using OptumLabs Data Warehouse OLDW claims database.
@highlight In this analysis the authors have shown a targeted DMP could be cost saving. Therefore focusing on the budget impact of a DMP rather than the cost effectiveness analysis of included drugs may be more informative for health policy decision making.
