An additional literature review was carried out to support some of the concepts included . This article includes a brief description of the implementation of HTA over the last 30 years and then a conceptual analysis using examples of the broader use of HTA to support procurement decisions and risk sharing agreements which might play a future role in healthcare priority setting in LA . Formerly HTA processes and methods played important although mostly isolated roles . Nowadays with more and more innovative technologies and the establishment of value frameworks to support the priority setting in healthcare HTA features a promising panorama for the health systems sustainability .
