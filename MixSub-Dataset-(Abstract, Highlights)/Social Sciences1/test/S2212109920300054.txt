 The purpose of this study was to assess the relationships between pharmaceutical therapyrelated quality of life and health utility scores since such data was not available . The dataset of 1156 outpatients with chronic diseases from 3 public university hospitals in Bangkok Thailand were applied . The Patient Reported Outcomes Measure of Pharmaceutical Therapy for Quality of Life was utilized to assess PTRQoL . HU measures included EQ 5D 5L and EuroQoL Visual Analog Scale . Multiple linear regressions using a stepwise approach were applied to evaluate the relationships between the PROMPT QoL and the HU scores . The results found that the EQ 5D 5L was mostly correlated with the impacts of medicines and side effects followed by the medicine effectiveness psychologic impacts of medication use and availability and accessibility domains of the PROMPT QoL respectively actual R The PROMPT QoL had medium correlations with the EQ 5D 5L and EQ VAS scores . Their relationships depended on HU approaches used . More research is needed to examine the relationships between the PROMPT QoL or other PTRQoL instruments and other HU scores in other settings and populations .

@highlight No data about which pharmaceutical therapyrelated quality of life domains are associated with a health utility score and the strength of their relationships.
@highlight This article shows that the relationships between pharmaceutical therapyrelated quality of life domains and health utility scores are moderate.
@highlight This article provides that such relationships in terms of significant domains and strengths depend on which health utility approaches are used.
