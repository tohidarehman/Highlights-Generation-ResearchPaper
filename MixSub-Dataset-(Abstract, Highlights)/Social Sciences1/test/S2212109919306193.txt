 Healthcare costs are a concern for the sustainability of health systems in both rich and poor countries . Achieving a balance between the aspirations of payers and the manufacturers of new technologies is a challenge for democratic societies . Evidence about the efficacy and effectiveness of a new intervention is a fundamental aspect for its inclusion but additional information about organization implementation and feasibility is required . Economic evaluations especially cost effectiveness analyses help inform the choice of a particular health intervention but they are not the only input for decision making . Use of CEA is relatively recent but has quickly become widespread . CEA techniques have evolved into increasingly complex and sophisticated methods intended to reflect reality closely but at the same time their results have become more difficult to verify and validate . In developed countries CEA results have generated intense debates but in developing countries these reflections are still weak due to lack of technical capacity . Competing perspectives on CEAs exist and can heavily influence the DM process . The use of CEAs and the interpretation of their results requires critical analysis especially when public funds are to be invested . Here we present a perspective on the use of CEAs for DM that arises from our experience of its use in developing countries and requires the consideration of other rationalities in addition to the economic one for DM .

@highlight Decision making DM in public health should be based on objective criteria to make the best investments with scarce resources. The cost effectiveness analysis CEA has earned a reputation as one of the strongest ways to obtain evidence for informing DM.
@highlight We discuss how DM is often based on CEA results especially when it comes to immunization planning but also how other rationalities outside of the economic sphere are necessary to overcome the CEAs limitations.
@highlight A critical perspective when using CEA results is proposed to reach the maximum populations well being from a democratic perspective this involves considering other inputs in the discussion as well.
