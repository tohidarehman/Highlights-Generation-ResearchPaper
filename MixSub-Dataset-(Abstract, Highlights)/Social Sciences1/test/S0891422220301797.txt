 Academic outcomes for autistic individuals are heterogeneous but the reasons for this are unknown . Attention is known to predict learning in typical development but there is less evidence about this relationship in Autism Spectrum Disorders even though attention is reported as atypical in this group . To investigate reading and maths achievement profiles for children with and without an ASD focusing on the role of attention in these profiles and to enable a better understanding of individual differences . Reading maths and attention abilities of 22 autistic children and 59 TD children were measured using standardised assessments . A hierarchical cluster analysis that included all children revealed three distinct transdiagnostic subgroups characterised by children with good average and poorer divided attention and academic achievement respectively . Children with poorer attention and achievement displayed relative weaknesses in maths while children with average or above average attention and achievement showed no such weakness . The findings provide a novel insight into the relationship between attention and achievement and understanding individual differences in ASD and typical development .

@highlight Divided attention ability defines profiles of reading and maths in autistic pupils.
@highlight Within domain discrepancies most prominent for those with poorer divided attention.
@highlight Transdiagnostic subgroups characterised by attention and achievement exist.
@highlight Autistic pupils are present across all three subgroups of attention and achievement.
@highlight Children with poorer attention and achievement display relative weaknesses in maths.
