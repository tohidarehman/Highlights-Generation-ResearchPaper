 Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder show a heightened drive toward systemizing which is the capability to analyze or the drive to construct a rule based system . In addition executive function deficits as well as diminished language capacity and vocabulary have been consistently demonstrated in individuals with ASD . The primary purpose of this study was to create a model to understand how these constructs interact in children with ASD . Forty six children diagnosed with ASD along with their parents and teachers participated . All children completed standardized vocabulary testing . For each child one parent and one teacher completed executive function and systemizing scales . For parents and teachers systemizing was significantly associated with vocabulary . For parents systematizing was significantly associated with all executive function subscales however for teachers systemizing was only significantly associated with half of the executive function subscales . The mediation model indicated that the relationship between vocabulary and systemizing was fully mediated by executive function for parents but the model was not significant for teachers . This model demonstrates that systemizing vocabulary and executive function should not be studied in isolation when attempting to understand the behaviors of children with ASD and can help us to better plan educational and therapeutic interventions .

@highlight Parents rated their children as significantly higher in systemizing than teachers.
@highlight Vocabulary was associated with systemizing.
@highlight Executive function was significantly associated with systemizing.
@highlight Executive function mediated the relationship between vocabulary and systemizing.
