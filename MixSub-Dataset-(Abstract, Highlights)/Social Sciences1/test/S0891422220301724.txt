 The Test component of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children 2nd Edition is used worldwide to identify children with Developmental Coordination Disorder . In China practitioners have been using this test with the assumption that the published UK norms are valid for Chinese children . However no systematic investigation has previously been undertaken to check this assumption . 2185 children aged 310 years old from a national representative sample in China were therefore recruited to the current study . Performance on the Movement ABC 2 was assessed and compared with the UK standardization norms . Gender differences were also examined . The comparisons revealed that Chinese children were generally better in Manual Dexterity and Balance tasks compared to their UK peers while UK children were better in Aiming Catching tasks . Further analysis showed an interaction of country and age with mixed results . For both countries girls were generally better in Manual Dexterity and Balance tasks and boys were generally better in Aiming Catching . Possible explanations for the country differences are discussed . The results suggest that local norms for the Movement ABC 2 Test are needed in China .
