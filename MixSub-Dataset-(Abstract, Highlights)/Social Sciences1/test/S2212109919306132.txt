 The combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin is currently the gold standard in treating chronic hepatitis C virus patients in Malaysia and is reimbursed by the Malaysian authorities . This analysis evaluated the cost effectiveness of the ombitasvir paritaprevir ritonavir and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin regimen as compared with the PegIFN RBV or no treatment in chronic HCV Genotype 1 treatment nave and treatment experienced cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients in Malaysia . A Markov model based on previously published CE models of HCV was adapted for the Malaysian public healthcare payer perspective based on good modeling practices . Treatment attributes included efficacy regimen duration and EQ 5D treatment related health utility . Transitional probabilities and health state health utilities were derived from previous studies . Costs were derived from Malaysian data sources . Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.0 per year . Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of uncertainties around key variables . Based on the analysis patients treated with the OBT PTV r DSBRBV showed less frequent progression to compensated cirrhosis decompensated cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma and liver related deaths when compared with standard care . At a price of MYR 1846 day the OBT PTV r DSBRBV regimen is cost effective over PegIFN RBV and yields better outcomes in terms of life years gained and quality adjusted life years at a higher cost which is still well below the implied willingness to pay threshold of MYR 384 503 QALY . The OBT PTV r DSBRBV regimen is cost effective for treatment nave treatment experienced cirrhotic and noncirrhotic GT1 chronic HCV patients in Malaysia .

@highlight In Malaysia only the combination of Pegylated interferon and ribavirin PegIFN RBV is reimbursed by the Malaysian authorities as the gold standard in treating chronic hepatitis C virus HCV patients. Although the favorable cost effectiveness CE profile of the ombitasvir paritaprevir ritonavir and dasabuvir with or without ribavarin OBT PTV r DSBRBV regimen compared with multiple standards of care has been documented worldwide evidence from Malaysia is limited.
@highlight This analysis evaluated the CE of the OBT PTV r DSBRBV regimen compared with PegIFN RBV or no treatment for chronic HCV genotype 1 for treatment nave and treatment experienced cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients in Malaysia.
@highlight This CE analysis reveals that the OBT PTV r DSBRBV regimen provides superior clinical outcomes versus the current standard of care in Malaysia ie PegIFN RBV and no treatment with fewer patients treated with the OBT PTV r DSBRBV regimen experiencing HCV related complications of CC DCC HCC and liver related deaths. In turn patients treated with the OBT PTV r DSB RBV regimen have a favorable CE profile with higher numbers of life years Lys gained and quality adjusted life years QALYs than patients treated with standard of care.
