 To perform cost consequence and cost effectiveness analyses of 2 methods of donor human milk preservationHolder pasteurization and high pressure processing in human milk banks in Poland . We used the results of the LACTOTECHnology as an answer to special nutritional requirements of preterm infants preclinical study on the impact of different preservation methods on the content of bioactive milk components . The cost analysis was performed from the hospital perspective . To estimate the Diagnosis Related Group tariff for enteral feeding with DHM preserved by HPP the pricing process used by the Polish health technology assessment agency was followed . One way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses on costs and human milk component parameters were undertaken . HPP maintains an average of 55 more potentially beneficial DHM components than HoP but is more expensive . The DRG tariff relating to milk from human milk banks preserved by the HPP method should be about 54 higher than with HoP . The cost effectiveness ratio ranged from 0.84 to 10.27 per 1 gain in the active compound content in a daily portion of DHM . Sensitivity analysis showed that the cost of an HPP device had the most significant impact on pascalization expenses . HPP is a potentially more beneficial method of DHM preservation than HoP but it is also about 7 times more expensive . Because of high pascalization costs the cost effectiveness analysis based on clinically significant endpoints will play an important role in decision making regarding the implementation of HPP into clinical practice of human milk banking .

@highlight Donor milk from a human milk bank is a safe and useful alternative for preterm infants in cases of an insufficient milk supply from the mother. Currently the most commonly used method of milk preservation in milk banks is Holder pasteurization. The most promising new techniquehigh pressure processingenables the preservation of active human milk components to a
@highlight extent.
@highlight In this study we estimated the costs of high pressure processing of donor human milk in the context of a human milk bank in Poland and the
@highlight diagnosis related group tariff. The costs of pascalization are nearly 7 times higher than pasteurization. The cost effectiveness analysis based on clinically significant endpoints should be performed when the clinical data become available.
