 To describe the process and results of the implementation of a performance based risk sharing arrangement for the use of certolizumab pegol in patients with rheumatoid arthritis based on rational pharmacotherapy . In 2014 the area of Management of Drugs and Supplies of the health maintenance organization of the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires signed a performance based risk sharing arrangement with Montpellier Laboratory for the use of certolizumab pegol in patients with RA . The laboratory would reimburse the hospital the cost of the first 10 doses of the drug if an optimal clinical response was not achieved measured at the beginning and at the end or if the patient presented with an adverse drug reaction during the first 12 weeks of treatment .

Eleven of them did not reach the optimal clinical response and 1 presented with an adverse drug reaction . The performance based risk sharing arrangement proved to be a useful tool to optimize the resources of the healthcare payer and contributed to the collection of scientific evidence in real life patients .
