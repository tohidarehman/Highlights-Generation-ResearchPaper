 Markov model simulation based on the natural history of disease is commonly employed for the comparative research of health interventions . The present study aims to simulate the natural progression of breast cancer and parameterize the initial and transition probabilities of multiple states of breast cancer development among Chinese women . The age specific incidence mortality and clinical stage distribution of breast cancer and relapse rate of each clinical stage were collected from China s cancer registry yearbooks and clinical epidemiological studies to simulate the process from full health to breast cancer to death among Chinese women aged 30 to 80 through a Markov cohort study . The validity analysis was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the model estimation . A Markov transition model with 7 states was constructed for Chinese women . The age specific incidence mortality and clinical stage distribution of breast cancer estimated by the initial and transition probabilities among different Markov states were highly consistent with the registered data and observed studies . A breast cancer transition model for Chinese women has been established with validity . It could be a point of reference for further economic evaluations and breast cancer screening policy formulation .

@highlight Key findings
@highlight A Markov transition model with 7 states no breast cancer tumor size number of nodes and metastasis stage 0 IV breast cancer and death was constructed for Chinese women.
@highlight The initial and transition probabilities among different Markov states produced reliable predictions of age specific incidence mortality and clinical stage distribution of breast cancer which were highly consistent with the registered data and observed studies.
@highlight What this adds to what is known 
@highlight The MISCAN model which is most commonly adopted for economic evaluations of breast cancer screening incorporates the natural history of breast cancer based on white women.
@highlight Owing to the important differences in epidemiological and clinicopathologic characteristics of breast cancer between white and Chinese women a state transition Markov model based on the natural history of breast cancer that is appropriate for Chinese women and consistent with clinical practice in China is necessary.
@highlight What is the implication what should change now 
@highlight A breast cancer transition model with Chinese population based natural history of breast cancer has been established with validity. This could be used as a reference for further economic evaluations and policy formulations of breast cancer mass screening.
@highlight The economic evaluations of breast cancer screening programs in China can be further carried out with the present breast cancer transition model for the Chinese government to make decisions on the potential future expansion of the screening project and on financing mechanisms such as reimbursements into the national social insurance which is funded by government employers and citizens.
