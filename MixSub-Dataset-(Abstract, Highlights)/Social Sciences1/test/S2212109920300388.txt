 To introduce and discuss the cost and effectiveness of using sofosbuvir daclatasvir and simeprevir antivirals in combination or not with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis C as based on real world data . We analyzed the treatment and outcomes of 253 patients from a retrospective cohort held in a specialized assistance service in the municipality of Porto Alegre Brazil . Regarding costs we considered only the direct costs of the antiviral medications per unit according to the financial receipts of the public procurements . We calculated the total cost of treatment per individual and the cost per cure expressed in sustained virologic response . Most patients were carriers of the genotype 1 of hepatitis and 92.9 reached the SVR . The average cost of the treatment for genotype 1 patients was 5 862.31 USD per patient and 6 310.34 for the cure for genotype 3 patients on the other hand the cost was 5 144.27 per patient and 5 974.76 for the cure . The drugs purchasing cost was around 40 less than was estimated for the process of incorporating them into the public health system . The results indicated that good rates of effectiveness were achieved with different combinations of the medicines . The costs of the medicines were still deemed too high for the Brazilian reality however . Therefore the results contribute to support the formulation and review of public policies based on strong evidence and on real world data for the treatment of hepatitis C .

@highlight Hepatitis C is considered a global public health issue. The emergence in recent years of treatment options with high levels of efficacy and safety but which also bear a high cost has emphasized the need to study the disease from an economic point of view.
@highlight This work analyzes the incorporation to the public health system of sofosbuvir daclatasvir and simeprevir and is based on real world data. The results indicated that good rates of effectiveness were achieved with different combinations of the medicines for Hepatitis C treatment. The cost of purchasing the drugs was around 40 less than was estimated however the cost of the medicines is still too high for Brazil.
@highlight Centralizing procurement and making negotiations within the industry are proving to be good strategies for reducing the paid amounts. The results show the primary data of effectiveness and cost in a real world scenario that may help future economic evaluations and we address the importance of negotiating the prices of medicines to guarantee access.
