 The dual task paradigm is an ecologically valid approach to assess cognitive function in relation with motor demands particularly for children with Down syndrome . This study aimed to determine DT performance for a complex Change of Direction walking task in children with DS . The sample included 12 children with DS 12 typically developing children matched for chronological and 12 TD children matched for mental age . We examined DT performance with the Trail Walking Test participants walked along a fixed pathway following a prescribed path delineated by target markers of increasing sequential numbers and increasing sequential numbers and letters . Motor and cognitive dual task costs were calculated . For the TWT an ANOVA with repeated measures revealed significant differences between DS and the CA but not the MA group . Overall there were significant decreases in speed with increasing cognitive demands . In addition all children produced higher cognitive compared to motor DTC which were more pronounced in the cognitively more challenging condition . The assessment of motor and cognitive performance in a DT paradigm provided insight in how motor and or cognitive impairment constrains the ability of children to successfully perform activities in a complex and dynamical environment .

@highlight The single task condition of walking is a challenge for children with DS.
@highlight DS children show reduced attention and cognitive ressources when performing DT.
@highlight TD children show a positive developmental trend in attention resources.
@highlight Walking with Change of Direction represents a reliable DT paradigm.
@highlight Visual search while walking seems to be a major challenge for children with DS.
