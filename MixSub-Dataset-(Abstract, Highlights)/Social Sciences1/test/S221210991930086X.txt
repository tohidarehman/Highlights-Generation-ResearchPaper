 Medical examination of the adult population is aimed at diagnosing chronic noncommunicable diseases and their risk factors . The unreasonable choice of screening methods and information processing can lead to the unjustified waste of resources with little benefit or even damage to the health of population and to the distortion of the statistic information . To evaluate the quality of medical examinations for chronic noncommunicable diseases among the adult population of the Irkutsk region from 2013 to2017 . We analyzed the Adult Clinical Examination report N 131 using comparative and statistical methods . It was selected for this study because it provides a summary of the findings from the Chronic Non Communicable Diseases surveys from 2013 to 2017 and thus precluded unnecessary investment of time and labor . The report comprises sections 1000 to 7000 which provided medical examination data such as demographic information and statistics on various diseases including neoplasms . The years 2016 and 2017 were notable for the emergence of 567 new cancers which accounted for 12.9 of total diagnoses . In 2017 there were 115 192 patients with cardiovascular diseases a fivefold increase from 2013 . Among the neurological dysfunctions 0.9 were ischemia attacks and related syndromes . The remaining 99.1 were not highlighted in the report . The respiratory system diseases were pneumonia bronchitis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma asthmatic status and bronchiectasis . These diseases made up 68.3 of all pathologies of the respiratory system . The remaining 11 327 cases were not classified nosologically . Every section of the N 131 report showed significant inconsistencies among the summary survey results for both the Irkutsk Region and Russia . This could result in a misunderstanding of disease prevalence and consequently in improper decision making . At this point approaches to statistical analysis of health surveys must be reconsidered on a national scale .

@highlight This article analyzes findings from the Chronic Non Communicable Diseases surveys generalized in the Adult Clinical Examination reports from 2013 to2017.
@highlight Findings can be used as a framework for organizing a prevention mechanism against chronic noncommunicable diseases in Russia.
