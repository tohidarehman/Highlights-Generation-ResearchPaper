 This article aims to support the development of practical guidelines for early detection of breast cancer in Asia by systematically reviewing economic evaluation studies of such early detection strategies in Asian countries . A systematic literature review was conducted following the Cochrane Handbook and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analysis Protocols checklist . The quality of reviewed studies was examined using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards statement . A total of 15 articles on the economic evaluation of breast cancer early detection based in Asia were reviewed . Cost effectiveness was used in all the studies as the analytic method to compare the cost and consequences of different screening policies . Ten studies were categorized as incorporating the modeled approach . Fourteen studies analysed the cost effectiveness of the organized population based approach in which mammography screening was the prevailing screening modality . Only one study evaluated the cost effectiveness of early diagnosis for breast cancer patients in order to provide early treatment . The results from the identified economic evaluations and consequent recommendations concerning optimal early detection strategies varied among studies and depended on key parameters and assumption used as well as differences in inter country health resources breast cancer incidence prevalence and early detection pathways . The economic evaluation of breast cancer early detection programs is still limited in Asia . Policy decisions on organized mammography screening in women 50 are economically attractive in the region despite the lack of evidence to provide recommendations on opportunistic screening strategy and early diagnosis strategy . Future studies need to provide better transparency of the data used and cover more comprehensive strategies to make them relevant and adaptable to other Asian countries resulting in clear policy recommendations on breast cancer early detection strategies .

@highlight Asia which faces both health and financial burdens as a result of breast cancer has been less explored than Europe and North America in the literature. This absence of region specific evidence poses a significant threat in that findings on safety effectiveness and cost effectiveness may differ substantially.
@highlight Given the considerable uncertainty when generalizing results from developed Western nations to Asia it is essential to have region specific comparative evidence on the variability of the economic analysis of strategies to recognize breast cancer at an early stage.
@highlight This review attempts to support the development of practical guidelines on breast cancer early detection strategy in Asia by evaluating such strategies in Asian countries and synthesizing the availability and variability of the health related economic evaluations made.
