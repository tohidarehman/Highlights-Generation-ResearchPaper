 This paper reviews and discusses research on arithmetical strengths and weaknesses in children with specific developmental cognitive disabilities . It focusses on children with dyslexia developmental language disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism . In general studies show that arithmetical weaknesses are commoner in children with any of these disorders than in controls . Autism is sometimes associated with specific strengths in arithmetic but even in autism it is commoner for arithmetic to be a relative weakness than a relative strength . There may be some genetic reasons why there is an overlap between mathematical difficulties and other developmental learning difficulties but much of the reason seems to be that specific aspects of arithmetic are often influenced by other factors including language comprehension phonological awareness verbal and spatial working memory and long term memory and executive functions . The findings discussed here will be discussed in relation to Penningtons Multiple Deficit Model .

@highlight Dyslexia and developmental language disorder are frequently associated with deficits in those aspects of arithmetic associated with verbal memory long term memory e.g. multiplication tables or working memory.
@highlight Autism may be associated with specific strengths in arithmetic but is more often associated with specific weaknesses in arithmetic.
@highlight Attention deficits but not hyperactivity are associated with arithmetical difficulties.
@highlight Arithmetic is associated with so called domain general executive functions but it may be that some numerical abilities are a form of executive function.
@highlight The findings reviewed here give considerable support for Pennington 2006 Multiple Deficit Model of comorbidity.
