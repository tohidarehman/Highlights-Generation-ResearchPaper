The added therapeutic value is the manner of measuring the therapeutic advantages of new medicines compared with existing ones in terms of comparative effectiveness and safety . There are variations in the mechanisms of reimbursement and drug pricing regulation between the countries of study . In a VBP system it is essential to establish the TV and ATV of a new medicine . Although there are no methodological guidelines for the implementation of VBP policies the process implies from the beginning the definition of TV categories that will be included in the drug pricing and reimbursement systems . Agreements between the pharmaceutical industry and governments have become a useful tool as a negotiating mechanism in most countries .
