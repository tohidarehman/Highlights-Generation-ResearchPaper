 The SAARC is a geopolitical organization composed of 8 neighboring countries Afghanistan Bangladesh Bhutan India the Maldives Nepal Pakistan and Sri Lanka . The objective of this study was to compare the prices of some selected drugs in SAARC countries . A list of 24 drugs was prepared based on certain inclusion and exclusion criteria . The retail prices of the drugs were determined from different sources and verified manually in the open market . The prices obtained in local currencies were converted into US dollars for comparison purposes . In another analysis the gross domestic product of each country was factored for comparative analysis . Out of the 23 drugs 17 comparisons across countries were statistically different at Prices of selected drugs varied markedly in SAARC countries . After adjusting for GDP drug prices became more polarized across countries with Nepal featuring the highest prices . In determining drug prices the countrys GDP and the populations purchasing power need to be taken into account .

@highlight The SAARC South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation is a geopolitical organization composed of 8 countries Afghanistan Bangladesh Bhutan India the Maldives Nepal Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Almost a quarter of the world population lives in these 8 countries.
@highlight To date no study has looked at a comparative analysis of drug prices in the SAARC region. Therefore this study was conducted with the aim of comparing the prices of selected drugs in SAARC countries.
@highlight The prices of selected drugs vary markedly in SAARC countries. At face value Sri Lanka was found to have the highest prices of selected drugs but the same drugs were sold at higher prices in Nepal after adjusting the median prices with the gross domestic product. When fixing the prices of drugs the gross domestic product and purchasing power of the population needs to be taken into account.
