 Physiotherapy in an adult intensive care unit affects health outcome . To justify the investment in ICU physical therapy the cost savings associated with its benefits need to be established . The main objective of this study is to evaluate the potential cost savings of implementing 24 hour 7 days per week physiotherapist in a Chilean public high complex specialized ICU . Using clinical data from a literature review and a micro costing technique we conducted a cost benefit analysis in the National Institute of Thorax in Chile . Our example scenario involves 697 theoretical admissions of adult patients with cardiovascular or respiratory diseases and the costs and benefits by reduction of length of stay in ICU days of mechanical ventilation and days with respiratory infections during the first year and 5 years of admissions . A sensitivity analysis was considered according to the variability in total costs production income and clinical benefits . Net cost savings generated in our example scenario demonstrate that the implementation of 24 7 PT produces a minimum saving for the institution of 16 242 during the first year and 69 351 over a 5 year interval considering individual income production . Out of the 30 scenarios included in the sensitivity analyses 26 demonstrated net savings . A financial model based on literature review and actual cost data projects that 24 7 PT intervention is a cost benefit alternative in adult ICU patients with cardiovascular or respiratory diseases in Chile . It is necessary a scenario of at least 3 sessions per day with insurance payment for individual treatments to support the long term implementation of a 24 7 PT program .

@highlight There are no other studies that contribute with adequate information regarding health resources to support the investment of hiring 24 7 physiotherapists in a Chilean intensive care unit ICU .
@highlight A theoretical financial model of the implementation of 24 7 physiotherapists outputs a minimum saving of 16 242 in the first year in terms of reduction of ICU length of stay. Savings of 69 351 at 5 years can be obtained in terms of reduction in days of mechanical ventilation with insurance payment for individual treatments variable production income .
@highlight A 24 7 physiotherapists intervention provides a cost benefit alternative to an adult ICU in a developing country where adult patients with cardiovascular or respiratory diseases receive at least 3 sessions of physical therapy per day.
