 The aim of this study was to evaluate the federal government expenditures with oncological care for the most incident cancer types among the Brazilian population using registries of all patients treated by the Brazilian National Health Service between 2001 and 2015 . We adopted the formal healthcare sector perspective in this study with the costs per patient estimated by the reimbursement price paid by the Ministry of Health to service providers . The costs were adjusted by the follow up time for each patient . We performed multivariate regression analysis using ordinary least squares . We analyzed 952960 patients aged 19 years who underwent cancer treatment between 2001 and 2015 for breast prostate colorectal cervix lung and stomach cancers . The annual mean costs per patient was 9572.30 varying from 5782.10 for breast cancer to 16656 for cervical cancer . Several variables predicted higher costs of cancer treatment namely to be male with younger age ranges at treatment initiation resident in the Northeast region treated for colorectal cancer with treatment initiation from 2010 to 2014 tumor stages III and IV hospitalization for other reasons besides the cancer treatment and suffering from some a comorbidity . Given the forthcoming Brazilian demographic changes which strongly suggest that the economic burden of cancer is about to increase in the near future our estimates provide relevant information to produce useful projections about future cancer related costs .

@highlight In middle income countries with universal health coverage as in Brazil the rise of cancer incidence allied to the increasing costs of treatments configure an important economic challenge.
@highlight This work presents large scale estimates of cancer related expenditures and its drivers for the most incident cancer types in Brazil.
@highlight The annual mean costs per patient in US purchasing power parity was 9572.3 varying from 5782.1 for breast cancer to 16656.0 for cervical cancer.
