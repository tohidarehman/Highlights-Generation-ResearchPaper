A total of 1000 physicians completed the survey . Although only 25 knewthe value equation 67 defined value in health according to Portersthe outcomes that matter to patients in relation to the costs of offering such outcomes .

In the multivariate analysis awareness of VBHC was associated with holding a management position scoring high in the hospitals physician segmentation program being familiar with the value equation and attributing high importance to developing new VBHC financing models for health system transformation . Physician awareness of key VBHC concepts is still heterogeneous in our clinical setting . Promoting opportunities for involving physicians in the discussion of VBHC is key for a successful value driven transformation of healthcare .
