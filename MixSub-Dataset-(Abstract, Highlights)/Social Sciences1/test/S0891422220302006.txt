 It has been hypothesised that deficits in the functions of predictive motor control and internal modeling may contribute to motor control issues of children with Developmental Coordination Disorder . Virtual reality technologies have great potential to provide opportunity for Motor observation and motor imagery which could enhance learning and development of motor skills in children with DCD . Thus the present study aimed to investigate the benefits of a VR training intervention to improve predictive motor control functions of children with DCD . Forty female children with DCD were randomly assigned to VR and control groups . In this study an experimental pre post and follow up design was used and Predictive motor control functions were measured before and after the VR intervention and two months later . Predictive motor control was evaluated using MI action planning and rapid and online control tests . VR intervention consisted of a selection of Xbox 360 Kinect games that were performed for sixteen 30 min sessions over 8 weeks . Compared to the control group the VR group improved significantly on measures of MI motor planning and rapid and online control scores from pre to post test and retained their performance to follow up . Overall it seems that virtual reality training program may be used as an appropriate intervention approach for developing the ability of MI and predictive motor control functions in DCD children .

@highlight First study of the application of virtual reality VR training for predictive motor control in DCD children.
@highlight Results are consistent with the hypothesis of the developmental delay of internal modeling in DCD children.
@highlight Predictive motor control functions of DCD children improved after VR training intervention.
@highlight VR interventions may be useful to optimize motor skills in those with DCD.
