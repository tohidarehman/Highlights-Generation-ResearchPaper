 It s estimated that 40 to 60 of patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery of the hip or knee who do not receive thromboprophylaxis will develop deep venous thrombosis Instituto Nacional de Traumatologia e Ortopedia has established a guideline to prevent DVT with the administration of the Enoxaparin . Recently institute stakeholders have been questioning this guideline as new oral anticoagulants that offer more comfort and efficacy but present higher risk of bleeding have been appearing in the market for treating deep venous thrombosis . This study aims to validate the application of a multicriteria decision analysis in a real world problem the use of rivaroxaban and enoxaparin to prevent deep venous thrombosis . The multicriteria method MACBETH was used in a decision conferencing process to develop an evaluation model for measuring the relative value of the drugs on each evaluation criterion separately and globally . The model building process was informed by a literature review and meta analysis of randomized clinical trials with a critical appraisal of the evidence . We report a model structure with eight criteria each one associated with a weighting coefficient and value function . Following a simple additive aggregation process the model outputs showed that Rivaroxaban was considered a robust option for DVT . Sensitivity analysis and robustness analysis were performed and testify the consistency of the results . This article contributes to literature by showing how MACBETH method can be combined with scientific evidence and participatory group processes for health technology assessment in hospitals .

@highlight MCDA can support decision making in the hospital context. MACBETH Measuring Attractiveness by a Category Based Evaluation Technique has proved to be effective in building multicriteria value models in healthcare contexts and several other group processes in different application fields.
@highlight The model results suggest that rivaroxaban is better than enoxaparin for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis in the postoperative period of major orthopedic surgery.
@highlight MACBETH and any other MCDA approaches do not replace the role of decision makers but help to achieve the best decision.
