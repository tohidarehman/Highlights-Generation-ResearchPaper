 Hypoglycemia is a common acute complication in patients with diabetes and markedly impacts on medical resource use . To make an initial assessment of the incidence of hypoglycemia and the associated utilization of medical resources and medical costs in insulin treated patients with diabetes using medical records from 4 tertiary hospitals in China . A retrospective cohort study was conducted using electronic medical records from 4 tertiary hospitals in Beijing Henan and Guangzhou from 2012 to 2015 . The targeted patients were those diagnosed with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes and treated with insulin . Diabetes was identified with A total of 14 044 patients were treated with insulin . There were 1930 patients who had outpatient visits and 310 patients who had inpatient visits owing to hypoglycemia . Incidences of hypoglycemia were 111.3 events per 100 patient years for outpatient visits and 5.9 events per 100 patient years for inpatient visits . Patients with hypoglycemia had more outpatient visits 8.09 vs 6.22 times year The burden of hypoglycemia especially severe hypoglycemia is substantial and associated with increased use of medical resources and expenditures among the target population which serves as a vital first glance at patients with insulin treated diabetes in China overall .

@highlight Hypoglycemia is a major limiting factor in the glycemic control of patients with diabetes. Hypoglycemic events constitute a major economic burden on healthcare systems. There is a lack of awareness of hypoglycemia and related economic burden in China. Only a few studies have tried to capture the cost of hypoglycemia which were based on survey data only. This paper is the first research using large scale electronic medical record data to analyze the impact of hypoglycemia on patients with insulin treated diabetes and represents a subpopulation of China to serve as an initial insight toward the more widespread issues with diabetes that China currently faces.
