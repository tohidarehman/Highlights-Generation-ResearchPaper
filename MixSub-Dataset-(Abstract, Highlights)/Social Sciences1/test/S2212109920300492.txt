 One of the core principles of rational prescribing is consideration of the cost of the medicines prescribed especially in countries with high patient copayments and low incomes such as Nigeria . Little is known about Nigerian physicians knowledge about the cost of commonly prescribed medicines . Descriptive cross sectional survey conducted among physicians in 3 tertiary institutions in Nigeria . Apart from socio demographic and other information questions about the estimated costs of branded and generic versions of 11 commonly prescribed medications were included in the questionnaire . One hundred and seventy nine respondents agreed that costs of medicines were important when writing prescriptions although only 7 of them had any formal training in the economics of healthcare . The median percentages of respondents with accurate estimated costs for generic and originator brands were 6.2 and 12 respectively . Respondents were more knowledgeable about the cost of medicines used for the treatment of infectious diseases than noncommunicable diseases . The knowledge of Nigerian physicians in the 3 participating hospitals about the costs of commonly prescribed medicines was poor . This is despite their awareness about the importance of costs of medicines when prescribing .

@highlight Healthcare expenditure is escalating worldwide with the cost of medicines responsible for a major proportion of overall healthcare expenditure especially in lower and middle income countries where the costs of medicines can account for up to 70 of total healthcare expenditure. This is a major challenge in lower and middle income countries where the majority of the population pays out of pocket for their healthcare and where the costs of care for patients with chronic noncommunicable diseases NCDs can be potentially catastrophic. Little is currently known about physicians knowledge of the cost of medicines in Nigeria which needs to be addressed to help ensure that patients can afford the medicines they are prescribed. Otherwise there will be concerns with long term adherence to the medicines prescribed especially for chronic diseases and the subsequent impact on their health.
@highlight The results of this study revealed poor knowledge of the cost of prescribed medicines for common medical conditions among physicians in tertiary healthcare facilities in Nigeria. This is not surprising because only 7 of respondents had any formal training in health economics or cost consciousness. This is a concern since tertiary hospitals are the training hospitals for future physicians in Nigeria and lack of cost consciousness here may well continue when physicians qualify and work in other settings in Nigeria. Respondents were though more knowledgeable about the cost of medicines for infectious diseases compared to NCDs such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus.
@highlight The study reinforces the need for inclusion of cost consciousness health economics and health policy in undergraduate and postgraduate medical training curricula in Nigeria combined with regular updates. This will go a long way in ensuring the sustainable use of medicines especially for patients with NCDs in Nigeria.
