 To profile children s reading comprehension we developed a dynamic approach with componential abilities being assessed within the same texts and provided with feedback in addition to the global comprehension of these texts . In 275 Dutch third to fifth graders we investigated to what extent the response accuracy for questions on componential abilities on first attempts and after feedback predicted global text comprehension within the same texts as well as the prospective development in a standardized reading comprehension test . We found that global text comprehension was increased by each correctly answered question on a componential ability on first attempts and by each correctly answered sentence integration question after feedback . The accuracy on first attempts also explained unique variance of the growth in the standardized reading comprehension test . A dynamic approach may thus help to arrive at a better understanding of the profiles of children s reading comprehension .

@highlight Word and sentence level abilities within a text predict its global comprehension.
@highlight They also explain the growth in a standardized reading comprehension test.
@highlight Responsiveness to feedback at sentence level helps to articulate reading profiles.
@highlight Such a dynamic approach aids profiling of individual instructional needs.
