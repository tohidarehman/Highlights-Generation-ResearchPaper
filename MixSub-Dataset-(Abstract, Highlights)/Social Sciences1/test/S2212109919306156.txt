 Escalating healthcare costs calls for the efficiency of health services especially in the intensive care unit where the bulk of resources are used . This study aims to identify the length of stay and cost of care at ICUs which are proxy indicators of efficiency and the factors determining them . A cross sectional study of patients requiring ICU admissions in a teaching hospital in Malaysia from 2013 to 2015 was conducted . The cost at the ICU was estimated using the step down approach . Factors that determined the cost and LOS at the ICU were also explored by using multivariate regression analysis . Each day of stay cost 427 at the pediatric intensive care unit and 1324 at the general intensive care unit . The mean LOS at the ICU was 5.7 days 8.4 with a median of 4 days 1 16.7 days . Average cost of care at the ICU per episode of care was 5473 and the median was 3463 . ICU patients spent 29.3 of the total stay and 47.2 of the cost at ICU units . Upon multivariate regression analysis severity case base group and type of ICU that the patient was admitted to were associated with the cost and LOS at ICU . Compared with critical care practices in hospitals from more developed nations a Malaysian teaching hospital required a longer length of ICU stay . Hence implementations of strategies that can reduce the length of stay and hospital costs without compromising healthcare quality are required .

@highlight No detailed information is yet available on the cost of care at intensive care units ICUs in Malaysia and its determinants.
@highlight This article describes length of stay and cost of care at the ICU and the factors influencing them.
@highlight Our study findings aim to support health managers and policy makers to explore strategies that can reduce the length of stay and hospital costs without affecting healthcare quality.
@highlight Relatively younger ICU patients at the Malaysian institution and the cost differential by units implies the ICU policy needs to be reviewed as do disease intervention strategies for the younger age group.
