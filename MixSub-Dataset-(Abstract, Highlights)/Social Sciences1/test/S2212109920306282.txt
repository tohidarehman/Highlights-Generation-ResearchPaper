 To estimate the budget impact of the expansion of liposomal amphotericin B use for all confirmed cases of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil . Currently the first line medicine for VL treatment is meglumine antimoniate . Liposomal amphotericin B is indicated only for patients with a greater risk of severity by the disease . The analysis was performed from the perspective of the Brazilian public healthcare system over 3 years considering the following 2 scenarios the reference scenario with the current recommendations for VL treatment and the alternative scenario based on the use of liposomal amphotericin B for all patients . A diffusion rate of 60 was used in the first year 80 in the second year and 100 in the third year . The epidemiological parameters used in the analysis came from the Notifiable Diseases Information System and from a clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of medicines for the treatment of VL in the country . The costs were related to the treatment of VL and to hospital and outpatient care . In the reference scenario the total cost for treatment of the 3453 VL confirmed cases in 2014 was 1447611.75 . The incremental budget impact with the use of liposomal amphotericin B for all the VL confirmed cases was 299646.43 in the third year . The analysis presented will support the decision process for the use and expansion of liposomal amphotericin B for all VL confirmed cases in Brazil .

@highlight There are currently data available on the safety efficacy and efficiency of liposomal amphotericin B for treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil.
@highlight Despite its relevance and given that few studies have been developed to assess the economic impact of visceral leishmaniasis this study provides data on the budget impact resulting from the use of liposomal amphotericin B for all visceral leishmaniasis patients in Brazil.
@highlight A budget impact analysis is relevant when taking into consideration the possibility of incorporating a new therapeutic regimen for first line treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil to subsidize decision making within the Brazilian public health system.
