 To evaluate the validity and reliability of the 5 level EuroQol 5 dimensional questionnaire through classical test theory and the Rasch measurement model . Three hundred patients treated for uncomplicated malaria in selected primary healthcare facilities of Plateau state Nigeria completed the EQ 5D 5L scale . Classical test theory was used to establish validity and Cronbachs alpha reliability of the scale . Rasch analysis was used to confirm the unidimensionality item fitness item and person separations and reliabilities and targeting of item difficulty to patient ability levels and presentation on Wright map . The outcome of classical test theory revealed unidimensional scale with average variance extracted values 0.5 and the square root of the average variance extracted for construct was greater than the correlation coefficients indicating convergent and discriminant validities of the scale whose Cronbachs alpha coefficient was 0.87 . Rasch analysis indicated variance explained values of 88.3 and the eigenvalues of the first contrast was 1.3 further confirming the unidimensionality of the scale whose fit index values were within accepted ranges . The high item and person separation and reliability values indicated the instruments strength in detecting and evenly spreading items and persons on the Wright map based on item difficulty and the respondents ability levels respectively . The EQ 5D 5L scale performed well in uncomplicated malaria hence it is recommended for use in the assessment of health related quality of life in this patient population .

@highlight Malaria is an endemic disease throughout Nigeria which is a developing country with high poverty levels of citizens.
@highlight Inappropriate management of the disease has been reported with material resources health workers and patient related factors implicated as reasons for such practices with reported health and financial consequences on both the patients and the systems.
@highlight This study confirmed the reliability and validity of an English version of the 5 level EuroQol 5 dimensional questionnaire scale for assessing health related quality of life impacts of malaria among patients who received treatment in primary healthcare settings in Plateau state Nigeria which was the first of its kind in Nigeria based on literature review.
@highlight In addition the study showed the usefulness of the scale for conducting children of 12 years old and adult patients health related quality of life studies which would be useful for advising patients healthcare professionals and health policymakers in necessary attentions and interventions aimed at improving patients quality of malaria management toward achieving the desired therapeutic outcomes for better quality of life.
