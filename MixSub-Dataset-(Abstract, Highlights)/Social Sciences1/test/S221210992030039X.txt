 To elicit a willingness to pay per quality adjusted life year estimate for the general Greek population and assess the impact of individuals socio demographic characteristics and motives on this estimate . A telephone based survey was carried out employing a representative sample of the general Greek population . A computer assisted telephone interview method was adopted to ensure random sampling . A total of 528 participants reported a WTP value for a utility improvement from their current health to perfect health . Those individuals motives were assessed through predefined statements . Testretest reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient . Multiple linear regression and one way analysis of variance tests were conducted to assess the effect of socioeconomic demographic determinants and motive statements respectively on WTP QALY . MLR was re estimated considering as dependent variable the WTP QALY estimate calculated for participants stating a WTP value their household income and presenting higher certainty regarding stated WTP value . Analysis revealed good reliability for WTP QALY estimates and motive statements . Mean WTP QALY was 26280 . The respective 5 trimmed value was 14862 . Being a student and household income affected WTP QALY . Sensitivity analysis did not produce markedly different WTP QALY predictors implying the robustness of results irrespective of the participant group considered . Individuals who indicated the inability to cover basic family needs or pay tax claims as motives reported lower WTP QALY values compared with those not viewing these aspects as motives . Findings confirm that the World Health Organizations criterion used currently in Greek cost effectiveness studies is not unreasonable . Additional research is essential to further explore WTP QALY estimates in the Greek setting and facilitate informed decision making .

@highlight In Greece willingness to pay WTP per quality adjusted life year QALY estimates have been determined only for discrete interventions related to specific diseases and patient populations. Therefore applied Greek economic evaluations adopt the World Health Organizations recommendation of 1 to 3 times the countrys gross domestic product per capita to assess interventions cost effectiveness.
@highlight The monetary estimate for an additional QALY calculated for the general Greek population falls within the cost effectiveness threshold recommended by the World Health Organization.
@highlight The currently elicited WTP per QALY value constitutes the first such estimate in the Greek setting that considers the general country population. Despite the need for additional research this estimate could be used henceforth to assist informed decision making in the Greek healthcare setting.
