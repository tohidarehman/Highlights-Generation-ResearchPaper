 Existing buildings consume an inordinate amount of energy globally . The consumption negatively affects the environment and economy therefore it is necessary to improve energy performance in buildings by retrofitting the existing ones . Several energy retrofitting strategies are proposed in the energy efficiency programs and hence the selection of optimal and efficient solutions is a complex task . Several factors affect the implementation of energy retrofitting measures such as budget comfort requirement and reliable economic value . To this end the study was conducted to develop a decision support model for residential building owners based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming . The model was designed to select optimum energy retrofitting strategies . The objective function involves minimizing the total Life Cycle Cost of the energy retrofitting plan to achieve economic benefit while considering the budget thermal comfort and recommended illumination level as primary constraints . To test the validity of the model a case study of a residential building was conducted . The findings of the study suggest an energy retrofitting plan that decreases approximately 70 of energy consumption . A sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the effect of the change in the cost component on the Life Cycle Cost and energy saving .

@highlight The paper presents a Decision Support Model aimed to the public for optimum energy retrofitting strategies in residential buildings.
@highlight The Decision Support Model minimizes the life cycle cost of Buildings under the constraints of thermal comfort illumination and budget.
@highlight The Case study conducted to validate the utility of the Model shows a 34 and 70 Energy Savings for retrofitting budgets of US 8K and US 53K respectively.
@highlight In the conducted Case Study The Life Cycle Cost was decreased from US 1 81M to US 1 7M when the investment budget increased from US 8K to US 21K.
@highlight The calculated Payback Period and Savings to Investment ratio show that the Decision Support Model prioritize the most efficient retrofitting measures in the selection process
