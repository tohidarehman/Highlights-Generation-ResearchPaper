 Biofuels for use in on road transportation have been promoted in Thailand over the past decade to reduce dependence on imported fossil resources as well as possibly reducing greenhouse gas emissions . This has led to an increase in production of biodiesel which is produced from palm oil . However as palm oil is also used for food it is important to take this into consideration as well . Also oil palm cultivation is rather water intensive . Hence it is necessary to analyze the interlinkage between water food and energy to have a holistic understanding and prevent trade offs when addressing one issue in isolation . The water energy food nexus for oil palm cultivation in Thailand has been conducted following two widely used methods the Water Food Energy Nexus and Water Energy Food nexus assessment method . The results are demonstrated as a single score which is easier for suggesting a suitable area for oil palm plantation . The assessment indicates the southern region of Thailand is the most suitable for oil palm plantation . The recommendation is consistent with the suggestion of the government based on land and climate suitability . However this study considers more comprehensive aspects including various other environmental aspects . Oil palm cultivation mainly relates to the amount of freshwater consumption leading to the increment of fuel consumption for pumping water . On the other hand the effectiveness of fresh fruit bunch yield should be developed in the future . Besides the results recommend the central region for the expansion of oil palm cultivation in the future because of the availability of a good irrigation infrastructure .
