 Considering that one of the alternatives for transitioning to a circular economy is the adoption of new business models based on use performance instead of product ownership we focused this study on the adoption of product service systems . Specifically we identify the main drivers and barriers affecting the adoption of use oriented PSS by young consumers residing in medium and small cities . We opted to perform a descriptive research with a quantitative approach . We verified that environmental concern and healthy lifestyle are the main drivers for the adoption of use oriented PSS while unavailability of use oriented PSS in the region or city presented the greatest barrier to the adoption . Furthermore we conclude that drivers associated with hedonistic experiential needs as well as personal factors tend to positively incentivize the adoption of use oriented PSS . Notwithstanding situational factors as PSS availability and information about costs and usage methods can serve as inhibitors . Finally to assist managers and academics we propose a framework that summarizes the identified PSS adoption drivers and barriers along with recommendations to optimize adoption drivers .

@highlight environmental concern and healthy lifestyle are the main drivers to the adoption.
@highlight difficulty in finding is the greatest barrier to the adoption.
@highlight drivers associated with hedonistic needs tend to positively motivate the adoption.
@highlight personal factors such as age tend to positively motivate the adoption.
@highlight situational factors as availability and little information can serve as inhibitors.
