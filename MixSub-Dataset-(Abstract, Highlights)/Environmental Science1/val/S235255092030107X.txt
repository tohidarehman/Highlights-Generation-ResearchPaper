 In this study forecasting of Turkey s total renewable and hydro energy installed capacity and electricity generation from 2019 to 2030 was investigated . For this purpose fractional nonlinear grey Bernoulli model briefly as FANGBM and its reduced forms were used and compared . The prediction procedure was applied for the data sets from 2009 to 2018 and prediction performance of these models were measured with calculation of mean absolute percentage error value . The FANGBM gives the highest accurate results for all cases . According to the results of the FANGBM Turkey s total renewable installed capacity and electricity generation were estimated as 80.3 GW and 241.3 TWh in 2030 respectively . Additionally this model estimates that Turkey s hydropower installed capacity and electricity generation will be 30.7 GW and 57.3 TWh in 2030 respectively . All grey prediction models present that the share of hydropower in total renewable installed capacity and electricity generation will decrease from 2019 to 2030 . In 2030 the share of hydropower in total renewable installed capacity and electricity generation is obtained by FANGBM as 38.2 and 23.8 respectively . Finally it is suggested to the Turkish government to reduce the share of hydropower in total renewable electricity generation by increasing the share of other types of renewable sources due to the consideration of Turkey as an extremely water stress country in coming years .

@highlight Turkey s total renewable and hydro power are forecasted by 2030.
@highlight Fractional nonlinear grey Bernoulli model gives the best prediction results.
@highlight The share of hydro energy in total renewable power will decrease by 2030.
@highlight In 2030 total renewable electricity generation are estimated in the range of 141.0150.8 TWh.
@highlight In 2030 hydropower can satisfy 18.534.2 of total renewable electricity generation.
