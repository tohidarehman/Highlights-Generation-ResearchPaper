 Urban trees are appreciated for their intrinsic value and their contributions to human well being . Here we analysed a database of 115686 non forest trees to quantify the present contributions of native and non native trees to biodiversity in the metropolitan area of Geneva Switzerland . Non native trees made up 90 of species and 40 of individuals . A subset of these individuals with more detailed phenotypic information was used to quantify five regulating ecosystem services three cultural ecosystem services and two disservices . Non native and native trees generated roughly identical regulating services on a per tree basis as these are linked primarily to tree morphology rather than to tree origin . Non native trees generated cultural ecosystem services that were greater than native trees on a per tree basis with the exception of the notion of natural heritage . For example 79 of trees independently identified as remarkable by the canton of Geneva were non native . Our results illustrate that non native trees represent a significant source of biodiversity and ecosystem services both in absolute terms and on a per tree basis . Given the empirical importance of non native trees in many cities and the likelihood that their importance will increase with future climate change we suggest that non native trees be considered in conservation assessments and strategic planning both for intrinsic reasons and for their contributions to human well being .

@highlight 90 of tree species and 40 of non forest trees in Geneva are non native.
@highlight Native and non native trees provide similar regulating services on a per tree basis.
@highlight Key cultural ecosystem services are dominated by non native trees.
@highlight Non native trees contribute significantly to regional biodiversity and ecosystem services.
@highlight Biodiversity indicators should also capture contributions of non native species.
