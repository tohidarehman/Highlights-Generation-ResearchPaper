 The purpose of this study is to clarify the patterns of influence of a firms environmental performance on its economic performance with consideration of sustainable consumption and production . It is well known that environmental performance generally influences economic performance through an improvement in the production process and an increase in demand . Thus it is expected that firms can enhance economic performance much more than previously thought by contributing to SCP . However because consumers customers can not directly observe a firms environmental performance its environmental performance should influence economic performance by improving the production process directly and increasing demand indirectly via disclosed environmental information . Furthermore the influence of environmental performance on economic performance should depend on the assumption of the nature of the relationship between them . This study develops a simple theoretical economic model to identify how a firms environmental performance influences economic performance and empirically tests the model using data on Japanese manufacturing firms from 2008 to 2015 . Our regression results prove that environmental performance enhances economic performance by improving the production process directly and increasing demand indirectly via disclosed environmental information . Specifically the former is a positive linear relationship and the latter is a U shaped relationship . Because these results support the view that firms can enhance economic performance by contributing to the SCP this study provides new insight into the ongoing debate about whether a firms environmental performance enhances its economic performance especially in the era of sustainable development goals .

@highlight Theoretical model of environmental and economic performance is empirically tested.
@highlight Environmental disclosures mediate environmental and economic performance via demand.
@highlight Environmental performance enhances economic performance via productivity and demand.
@highlight Economic performance is enhanced linearly and non linearly via these paths.
@highlight Sustainable consumption and production contribute to economic performance.
