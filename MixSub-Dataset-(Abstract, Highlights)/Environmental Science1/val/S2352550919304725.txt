 Life cycle assessment was performed for comparing a single use bio based beverage cup with single use plastics and multiple use stainless steel alternative . The results reveal that the bio based cups produced from sugarcane in Thailand exhibit lower global warming and fossil depletion impacts than the petroleum based plastics but higher than multiple use stainless steel cups . Over prolonged use multiple use cups show better environmental performance than the others . Increasing the use of recycled materials by 25 percent for example helps to reduce environmental impacts in the range of 3556 percent indicating better performance in terms of global warming and fossil depletion impacts . However consumer behavior is an important factor because they may choose not to use the same cup for long using the multiple use stainless steel cup more than 140 times can outweigh the impact of all single use cups . Reuse and eventual recycling of materials supports the move towards the circular economy . In order to enable circular economy government policies and infrastructure must be in place to support the recycling of materials as well as the use of recycled materials to keep resources in the system as much as possible to close the loop of the takeaway beverage cups lifecycle .

@highlight Comparative life cycle assessment of plastic bioplastic and steel cups conducted.
@highlight Reusable steel cups show the best environmental performance of prolonged use.
@highlight Bioplastic cups show a better environmental performance than plastic cups.
@highlight Use of recycled materials and recycling at end of life improve environmental profile.
