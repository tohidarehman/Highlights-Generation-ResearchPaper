 Sustainable management of vehicles at their end of life stage offers a significant potential for resource recovery by closing the material loop and thus contributes to dealing with scarcity of resources . Although ELVs till date in countries like India are considered as waste and not as secondary resource material but if used judiciously may obviate the extraction of primary or virgin materials . Although policymakers have focused on ways to ensure higher resource efficiency in the automobile sector research on the role of the informal sector in recovering useful materials and parts from ELVs is limited . The present study examines the current situation of ELV processing at Mayapuri scrap market one of the largest informal markets for ELVs in Asia wherein mass balance approach is used to examine how hatchback cars are disposed . A conceptual framework depicting process flow and the interactions between the multiple stakeholders involved in this sector has been developed . Further approximately 7 of aluminium and 76 of iron by weight were recovered from the sampled hatchback cars . These results were used for estimating the potential to recycle and to recover useful materials from ELVs that are processed by the informal sector in India . Under the business as usual scenario the estimates show that the sector can recover about 0.34 million tonnes of aluminium and 4.03 million tonnes of iron by 2030 . These figures indicate the huge potential of this sector in a circular economy and highlight the need to make operations in this sector more formal and to include informal players in the value chain to address the scarcity of these resource .

@highlight Composition of cars at the end of their life was analysed for mass characterization.
@highlight From primary data potential to recycle and recover materials from ELVs was estimated.
@highlight Annual recovery of iron and aluminum was projected for 20162030.
@highlight SWOT analysis was undertaken of an informal sector devoted to disposal of ELVs.
@highlight Higher efficiency of manual dismantling of ELVs in the informal sector is highlighted.
