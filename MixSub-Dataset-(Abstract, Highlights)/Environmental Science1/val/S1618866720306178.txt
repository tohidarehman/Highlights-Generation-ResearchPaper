 Nocturnal sap flow is an important part of plant sap flow while it is usually regarded as negligible . Consequently the aim of this study was to measure nocturnal stem sap flow of

@highlight In urban environment the nocturnal sap flow of Acer truncatum is regulated by nocturnal transpiration and stem refilling and stem refilling should be the fundamental cause of nocturnal sap flow while nocturnal transpiration could promote nocturnal sap flow.
@highlight The phenomenon of high speed sap flow in low VPD conditions is analyzed and discussed and we suggest nocturnal transpiration only occurs when VPD exceeds 0.10 kPa while stem refilling occurs almost all the time and the main driving force is water demand to support trunk tissue hydration and VPD respectively.
@highlight Because of the differences between urban environment and natural environment in soil physical properties soil water supply model active root distribution depth humidity and wind speed etc. it is necessary to conduct the research of plant sap flow in an urban green space rather than in the nursery or woodland as in previous studies especially for the important tree species in the nursery industry and urban greening.
