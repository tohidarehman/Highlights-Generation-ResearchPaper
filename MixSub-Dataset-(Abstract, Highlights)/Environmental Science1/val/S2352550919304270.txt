 Environmental pollution resource scarcity and freshwater shortage are critical world challenges facing humanity . Process industry produces large amounts of brine a waste water with a high salinity level and often critical raw materials . This study applies the social life cycle assessment to quantify societal benefits and risks in developing brine treatment systems . S LCA is implemented for hotspot and site specific levels on four case studies of the Zero Brine project . Hotspot analysis focused on the major commodities . Social Hotspot Database was used as source for data and endpoint indicators . In addition site specific analysis regarded the social performance of the case studies companies interviews and questionnaires were performed with representatives of the four case studies . The collected data were converted to scores with subcategory assessment method and performance reference points . The results show that for all case studies Labor rights and decent work and Health and safety indicators result in the largest impacts due to imports of commodities from developing countries . Site specific results show that the overall social sustainability performance of the case study companies is at a good level . The only potential areas for improvement are the Occupational accidents and Contribution to the local community . The former are minimally higher for silica plant and higher for coal mine in relation to these sectors average accidents rates . Furthermore the coal mine company can contribute more to the local community and reduce conflicts concerning environmental impacts at the city level . Common identified hotspots among the case studies are China India and Congo . Reducing imports from these countries will significantly improve the societal performance of the brine systems .

@highlight Common social hotspots of supply chains of case studies are China India and Congo.
@highlight Areas of concern were Occupational accidents rate and Organizational support for community initiatives.
@highlight SLCA is a useful tool for companies to improve corporate social sustainability.
@highlight The structure of Social Hotspot Database limits the hotspot analysis level results.
