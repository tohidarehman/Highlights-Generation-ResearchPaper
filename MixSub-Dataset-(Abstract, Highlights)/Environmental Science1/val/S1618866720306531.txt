 Urban forests are important hotspots of biodiversity in the environment of cities and their surroundings but may also stand out from neighbouring forests by greater tree species diversity higher tree age and greater share of deciduous species . However they are usually not connected with nesting of rare birds of prey especially dietary specialists . Unexpectedly I have found Honey Buzzard

@highlight Successful nesting of rare dietary specialist raptor was noted in an urban forest in Poland.
@highlight Nesting and foraging of Honey Buzzard male were affected by tree cover density.
@highlight In this terms urban forest provided best conditions in a 10 km radius.
