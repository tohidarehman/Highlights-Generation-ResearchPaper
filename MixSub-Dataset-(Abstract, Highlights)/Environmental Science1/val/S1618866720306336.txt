 Cities around the world are pursuing tree planting as a way to increase tree cover . Despite the growing interest in planting trees as a way to offset climate change counter the negative impacts of urbanization and provide benefits to city dwellers there has not been a recent effort to quantify the number of trees being planted nor the species composition of these plantings . Because ecosystem services and ecosystem threats can transcend municipal boundaries understanding trends in tree planting at multiple spatial scales is critical . To overcome this knowledge gap we used a survey to collate recent tree planting data from 52 cities with populations greater than 50 000 people in the Northeastern USA . The four largest cities in our study planted over 87 of all the trees that were planted in the region . Smaller cities which are numerous in region planted proportionally fewer trees and in over 40 of the small cities surveyed planting palettes included invasive tree species highlighting both a resource and a knowledge gap in smaller cities as compared with larger ones . Regardless of city size records also illuminated an overreliance on certain genera for specific ecosystem services nearly 20 of all shade trees were

@highlight We collected recent tree planting data from 52 Northeastern USA cities.
@highlight Collectively these cities planted over half a million trees from 2012 to 2017.
@highlight Over half of the trees planted were in the cherry legume maple or oak families.
@highlight Trees planted include three confirmed and six potentially invasive species.
