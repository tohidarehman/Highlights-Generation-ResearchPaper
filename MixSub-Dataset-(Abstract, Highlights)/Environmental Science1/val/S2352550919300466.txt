To do so the authors conducted a total of 13 non standardized semi structured expert interviews with representatives of companies as well as experts from consultancies accounting and professional services and organizations that work in the field of IMV . The findings of this research contribute to the existing literature by providing seminal insights into the current movement of industry alliances developing new standards of IMV .
