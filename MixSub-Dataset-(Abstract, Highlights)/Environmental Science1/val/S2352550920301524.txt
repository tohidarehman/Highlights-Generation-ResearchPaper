 Sustainable supply chain innovation simultaneously creates value for social environmental and economic dimensions . It is a fact that innovation is very significant in achieving long term sustainability in the supply chain . Literature analysis reveals that an in depth investigation of SSCI implementation framework in developing nations is still limited . Hence this research work investigates the sustainable supply chain innovation enablers to achieve sustainability in the supply chain using the Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process framework . The proposed framework is applied to an Indian manufacturing industry for the adoption of SSCIEs in its supply chain . This research identifies a total of thirty three SSCIEs through extensive literature review and consultation with the decision making panel . The identified enablers are then ranked based on their relative importance weight . The results reveal that collaboration and engagement of a diverse group of stakeholders is the most critical SSCIE to achieve sustainability in the supply chain followed by develop R D labs in relationships with marketing production universities and government institutes . Sensitivity analysis is also performed in this study to check the robustness in the ranking of SSCIEs . This research helps the managers policy makers of the Indian manufacturing industry to identify and understand the most significant SSCIEs to achieve sustainability in the supply chain . The ranking of SSCIEs assists the managers to systematically focus on the most significant SSCIE and work towards its successful adoption . This study implies that the successful adoption of SSCIEs enables simultaneous improvement in social environmental and economic dimensions for Indian manufacturing industries .

@highlight This study identifies and evaluates the sustainable supply chain innovation enablers
@highlight We propose Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method to rank the enablers
@highlight Collaboration and engagement of various stakeholders is the most important enabler
@highlight Develop R D labs is the second most important enabler to achieve sustainability
@highlight Presents a structured approach to implement the enablers to achieve sustainability
