 Urban ecosystems can host a considerable amount of biodiversity because of the varying habitats created during urban development processes . Spontaneous vegetation is a neglected element of urban biodiversity and the roles of a citys natural floristic resources geomorphic features and topographic characteristics in shaping spontaneous plant diversity patterns have not been fully clarified . We explored the impact of urban growth and elevation and slope on the diversity patterns of urban spontaneous plant communities in a mountainous city in southwest China . We recorded 279 species belonging to 210 genera and 70 families with native species accounting for about 85 of the urban spontaneous plants . The magnitude of urban growth and elevation were the most important drivers and they were positively correlated with the diversity patterns in Chongqing . Thus both urban forms and the citys natural conditions are important in affecting the urban biodiversity patterns . Furthermore urban spontaneous plant communities in Chongqing metropolis were mainly dominated by a few widespread cosmopolitan species with nearly 50 of the 279 species we recorded being narrowly distributed and rarely occurring species . The distribution of the rare spontaneous species may be highly dependent on chance dispersal the legacies of earlier land use and the availability of specific habitats . We propose that urban construction and landscape design should maintain appropriate configurations for the habitat type to preserve rarely occurring plant species to increase biodiversity in urban landscapes .

@highlight Spontaneous plant communities in Chongqing Metropolis included 279 species.
@highlight Native species accounted for about 85 of the urban spontaneous plants.
@highlight Regional species pool decreased with increasing levels of urbanization intensification.
@highlight Habitat types and qualities affected the composition of spontaneous plant communities.
