 Pollinators provide crucial urban ecosystem services . Introducing nectar producing species on green roofs is one method to support pollinator populations . However novel cultivation methods may be required to improve plant health with minimal irrigation on extensive green roofs which are severely restricted in soil thickness . Although companion planting with CAM plants such as

@highlight Plant species combinations can improve green roof performance.
