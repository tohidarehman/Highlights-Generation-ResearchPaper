 Life Cycle Inventories must meet the data quality requirements set out by the goal and scope of a Life Cycle Assessment . The literature on the timing of updating inventory data to meet the data quality requirements is almost non existent . In this study data were taken from publicly available reports congresses proceedings technical papers international databases and LCAs . Monte Carlo simulations were used to test for variance regression analysis was used to determine correlation between time and energy intensity . Different conventional automobile power train configurations were examined along with lightweight versions . Monte Carlo simulations were programmed for each automobile power train configuration . Least absolute residuals methods were used to confirm whether the variance seen in simulations was due to time or to other factors such as uncertainty or scattered data . The Monte Carlo simulations identified the variation by material and quantified their significance . Least absolute regression analysis identified and confirmed which materials have a clearly delineated temporal relationship rubber polyethylene terephthalate polypropylene lead copper steel recycled steel aluminum and recycled aluminum . Consequently recommendations are given for the time intervals for necessary data updates which depending on the material in question are between two and five years .

@highlight Monte carlo simulations tested for variance in energy intensity across time.
@highlight 37 materials of manufacture found significant variance.
@highlight Regression analysis identified linear relations of energy intensity versus time.
@highlight Measured uncertainty highlights need for better data collection and updates in LCA.
