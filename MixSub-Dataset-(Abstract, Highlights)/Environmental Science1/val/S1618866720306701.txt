 This study aims to determine the physiological and psychosocial effects of forest therapy on the stress levels of middle aged working women . Nineteen middle aged working women participated in a half day forest therapy program conducted at Bukit Ekspo A tree dominated urban park located at the centre of Universiti Putra Malaysia . For the physiological indices the systolic blood pressure diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate of the participants were evaluated three times a day Before breakfast lunch and dinner . The readings were obtained two days before during and three days after the forest therapy program . The physiological readings obtained two days before the study served as the baseline reading as it represented the normal everyday physiological condition of the participants . The baseline SBP and the baseline DBP of the participants were beyond healthy levels falling into Stage 1 hypertension . The mean SBP of the participants significantly reduced during the forest therapy day and three days after the forest therapy day . This reduction was also observed for the DBP readings whereby the mean DBP readings for the forest therapy day and three days after were lower than the baseline values . There were no significant changes in the pulse rate . For the psychosocial perspective the participants self evaluated themselves to determine the effects of forest therapy on their mental wellbeing . Only 16 of the participants believed that they successfully performed self regulation when faced with stressful situations although 74 of the participants admitted to experiencing stress on a daily basis . After participating in forest therapy the majority of the participants felt rejuvenated and more at ease at work . In conclusion forest therapy is an effective stress management tool for middle aged female employees .
