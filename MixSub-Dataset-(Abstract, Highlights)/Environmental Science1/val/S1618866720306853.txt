 Invasive species are drivers of urban ecosystem transformation . However their management requires cost demanding distributional data . Here we proposed an approach using floristic surveys land use maps and field observations to reveal the patterns responsible for the spread of invasive trees using open source software . We used the tree of heaven

@highlight Invasive tree species are relevant elements of urban landscape transformation.
@highlight We studied patterns of
@highlight natural regeneration in Pozna city.
@highlight Its spread was limited by distance from propagule source and microhabitats.
@highlight Revealing patterns of spread allows prediction of which areas require monitoring.
@highlight Knowledge of
@highlight natural regeneration will increase management efficiency.
