 Integrating tree species diversity into urban forest management can help create resilient tree populations . In this study the abundance of trees within families genera and species levels was determined through a system developed to evaluate the diversity of urban street trees at different scales . Municipal foresters were asked to report the six street tree species most commonly used in urban forests as an assessment of tree diversity . Through the use of this question in a series of urban forest management surveys we were able to describe the diversity of urban street tree species in the 48 continental United States across time and space . Throughout the United States the top six street tree species were distributed in 115 species 71 genera and 32 families . At the national scale no one tree species or family dominated but the

@highlight Tree diversity changes as the scale changes.
@highlight Little change in street tree species has occurred over 40 years.
@highlight The majority of street trees in a community can be explained for by 4 to 6 species.
