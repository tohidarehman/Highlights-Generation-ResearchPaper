 All economies rely today on metal use either in the construction or energy sectors or in more advanced technology sectors . Nevertheless not all countries have mining industries which implies that these countries need to import primary metal concentrates and semi finished goods containing metals to fulfill their final consumption . By importing these goods they also import their associated environmental externalities . Considering the French metropolitan territory where mining industries are on hold since the 1990s this study assesses the impacts on climate change of metals related activities induced by the French final demand as well as their share in the total French carbon footprint . The EXIOBASE v3.3 hybrid database is used to perform the assessment showing that the metal sector represents 13 of the total French carbon footprint . This contribution is mainly due to the iron and steel production activities that are linked to the construction and motor vehicles trailers and semi trailers goods consumed in France . The assessment also shows that France outsources 79 of the metal sector GHG emissions induced by its consumption . 55 of these emissions occur in the European Union and more than 17 specifically in China . Therefore despite metallic ores are pratically not anymore mined in France the embodied metal on the French final demand indirectly generates large greenhouse gases emissions abroad in particular CO

@highlight The metals sector is responsible for 13 of the total French carbon footprint.
@highlight Iron and steel production is the main contributor to this share.
@highlight France outsources 79 of the corresponding GHG emissions.
@highlight These emissions are mainly outsourced in the European Union and in China.
