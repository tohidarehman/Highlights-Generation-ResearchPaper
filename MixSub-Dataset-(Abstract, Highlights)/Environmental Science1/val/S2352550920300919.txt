 In previous research interrelationships between green innovation and supply chain collaboration are under explored . This study explores the effects of SCC on green innovation performance and considers supply chain collaborative drivers as a crucial part of green innovation strategy . We construct a conceptual model containing a set of 17 drivers on the implementation of green innovation and analyze the contextual relationships between these drivers using an interpretive structural modeling method to identify the driving and dependence powers in green innovation within the context of SCC . The model is validated on a case study involving an automobile firm in southwestern China . The study reveals that the relationships between supply chain partners have a very high influence on green innovation performance . SCC should be deemed as a core component in green innovation strategies . In addition environmental regulations top management commitment and social recognition are among high driving and dependence powers . We have confirmed the significance of SCC enablers for green innovation and identified several specific attributes through research . To further improve the value of this study theoretical and managerial implications are discussed .
