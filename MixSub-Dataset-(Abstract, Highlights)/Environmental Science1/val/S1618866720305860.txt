 Square dancing is a popular public activity performed in squares and parks in Chinese cities . Although dancers benefit from such activity physically and mentally nearby residents may suffer from noise pollution and other negative externalities . However only a few existing studies have explored the effects of square dancing on the value of residential properties and open spaces . To fill this knowledge gap this study utilizes the hedonic price model and spatial econometric model to investigate the external effects of square dancing in the housing market of Hangzhou China . Results show that nearby housing price drops by 5.8 and 13.0 when people dance in the nearest park and square . In addition square dancing decreases the value of parks and squares and this mediating effect shows spatial heterogeneity . The results of this study indicate that square dancing has a significant negative external effect on housing price and the value of open space . This study offers implications for policy makers to achieve a harmonious society and humanized urban planning . The findings and implications of this study ensure the benefits of residents and improve the value of residential properties and open spaces . In addition the findings can be generalized across cities or countries where square dancing and other human activities are popular .
