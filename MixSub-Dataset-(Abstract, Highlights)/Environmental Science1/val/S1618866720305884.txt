 In urban environments long term tree survival and performance requires physiological tolerance or phenotypic plasticity in plant functional traits . Knowledge of these traits can inform the likely persistence of urban forests under future more severe climates . We assessed the plasticity of morphological and physiological traits of tree species planted along an urban climatic gradient in the Greater Sydney region during a severe multi year drought in eastern Australia . We selected four sites along a 55 km east west transect ranging from the cool wet coast to the warm dry inland . We assessed five tree species with different predicted climatic vulnerability based on climate origins estimating functional traits indicative of drought tolerance carbon isotope composition

@highlight Urban trees presented functional adaptations in response to local climate.
@highlight Urban trees had different levels of trait plasticity along a climatic gradient.
@highlight Turgor loss point was the best surrogate for changes in precipitation and maximum temperature.
@highlight Leaf level traits showed a greater plasticity across species and sites.
