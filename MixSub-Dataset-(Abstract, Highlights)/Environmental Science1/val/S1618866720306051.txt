 With the increasing demand for forest tourism and forest leisure space in recent years providing a high quality forest landscape space to participants has become an increasingly important topic for designers and managers of forest parks . To clarify differences in the visual behavior characteristics and psychological cognitive evaluation of participants when viewing different types of forest landscape spaces and to explore the relationship between them in order to identify the psychological evaluation factors that affect visual behavior . This analysis will provide a theoretical basis and a basis for the construction and reconstruction of forest park landscape spaces even for new forests in the future . This study used eye tracking technology and cognitive questionnaires for participants . ANOVA and Spearman s rho correlation analysis in SPSS 23.0 were used to statistically analyze the data . 1 . There are differences in participants visual behavior especially in visual spans when participants appreciate different types of forest landscape spaces . The visual span of forest waterscape space is small while the visual span of in forest landscape space is large . 2 . There are differences in participants psychological cognitive evaluations of different types of forest landscape spaces . The forest waterscape space is evaluated highly on multiple indicators especially for dynamic water space whereas for in forest landscape space participants also pay attention to unique or interesting landscape elements with the exception of color and plants . 3 . There are correlations between the mean visual span mean pupil diameter and psychological cognitive evaluation of participants in different types of forest landscape spaces . When people admire scenes with diverse plant species rich landscape content good landscape depth and permeability rich and bright color open and tidy spaces and good landscape permeability and layering their mean pupil diameter and lateral and portrait visual span are small . Based on the above analysis we recommend that when planning and designing forest landscape space we should consider not only the characteristics of different types of landscape spaces and their visual and cognitive effects for participants but also the combination of some iconic elements or interesting landscape elements .
