 In 2015 China proposed to gradually reduce the cross subsidy of electricity price . In order to reduce cross subsidies and make electricity price reflect its actual cost it is necessary to estimate the scale of cross subsidies . Existing research has not yet seen the estimation of the scale of cross subsidy of electricity price for electricity grid provinces and residential and industrial users . Based on Ramsey s pricing theory and panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2006 to 2017 this paper constructs an empirical model of power demand and price for industrial and residential users . The price elasticity of power demand for residential and industrial users is determined and the Ramsey price index of residential and industrial users are calculated . The scale of cross subsidies for electricity prices of residential and industrial users at the national level and in different power grids and provinces are estimated . The conclusions are as follows The elasticity of electricity demand of residential users is greater than that of industrial users . The sales price of residential and industrial users deviates from Ramsey s theoretical price . The cross subsidy provided by industrial users is far greater than that accepted by residential users . The residential users of Central China power grid receive the most cross subsidies and the industrial users of North China power grid provide the most subsidies . The unit power consumption of residential users in Northwest power grid receives the most subsidies while the industrial users in Central China power grid provide the most subsidies . The scale of cross subsidy of electric power in developed areas is larger than that in underdeveloped areas . Since 2015 the power system reform has little impact on the total power consumption of residential and industrial users .

@highlight Demand elasticity of residents is greater than that of industries.
@highlight Electricity sales price deviates from ramsey s price.
@highlight Industrial users provide more cross subsidies.
@highlight Cross subsidy of electricity price in developed areas is larger.
@highlight Power system reform has little impact on the total power consumption.
