 It is increasingly evident that the general publics recognition of local flora and fauna is typically inaccurate because the majority of species are not recognized by ordinary people . These incorrect perceptions are a concern because they could lead to decreased public motivation for conservation and reduced health and well being benefits that people gain when interacting with nature . However there remains limited knowledge of how well ordinary people recognize wild plants and animals in their local areas and how the levels of recognition vary among the general public . We conducted a questionnaire survey among urban park users in Zenpukuji Park in Tokyo to assess their levels of recognition of birds and flowering plants and determined the factors that affect their recognition of these taxa . We asked participants to report their own personal characteristics and whether or not they had observed each of 24 common bird and 24 flowering plants species found in the park . Numbers of bird and plant species recognized by participants varied greatly with those who visited the park frequently and who had greater taxonomic knowledge reporting higher numbers . Moreover the traits of each of the study bird and plant species were associated with the numbers of participants who recognized them . Our results suggest that both the individuals personal characteristics and species ecological traits determine park users recognition of local biodiversity . Increasing individuals use of urban greenspace and strengthening their orientation toward and familiarity with wildlife especially species that may be less noticeable would contribute to enhancing their perceptions of the local wildlife .
