 Extensive green roof architecture is an effective and low maintenance solution to reduce energy cost of heating or cooling the buildings and can be used to mitigate several urbanization problems such as heat island effect lack of green space and excessive stormwater runoff . However designs and vegetation selections of the extensive green roofs have primarily been based on the studies conducted in the temperate areas . This study aimed to assess the suitability of ten groundcover plants in a tropical area using quantitative physiological parameters of plants including relative water content stomatal opening rate maximum quantum yield of photosystem II F

@highlight This study aimed to assess the suitability of selected tropical groundcover plants for extensive green roof architecture especially by investigating physiological parameters of plants under drought stress.
@highlight Relative water content RWC stomatal opening rate maximum quantum yield of photosystem II F
@highlight  F
@highlight  soil humidity and leaf surface temperature were measured for ten plant species.
@highlight Upon severe drought stress RWC could distinguish non tolerant from tolerant species as early as 3 days after drought treatment DAD .
@highlight  F
@highlight could be measured conveniently and is also highly informative for indicating drought tolerance.
@highlight We identified two groundcover plant species 
@highlight and
@highlight with high drought tolerant ability and should be considered for extensive green roof architecture in the tropical areas.
