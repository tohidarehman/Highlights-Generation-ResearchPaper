 Urban parks and tree lined streets are major components of urban greenspaces as well as the most frequently used public spaces for senior citizens . Studies have shown significant associations between urban greenspaces and various health outcomes of older adults . However most of them focused on urban parks or overall vegetation coverage and few have considered the impact of street greenery . The lack of research attention on the latter is partly because of no method objectively measuring greenery exposure on streets especially from a pedestrian centered perspective . In the current study we recruited 1161 adults aged 60 or above who lived in 12 housing estates in Wuhan China and collected their socio demographic data and 7 day physical activity data . Streetscape photos were taken by trained researchers on sidewalks of all streets in the 800 m buffers from these housing estates . The pedestrian centered street greenery exposure was extracted from these photos with the machine learning technique of convolutional neural networks along with the pyramid pooling module . Multilevel logistic regression models were conducted to examine the association of the frequency and total duration of physical activity with street greenery . Park area population density street connectivity and land use mix within the buffer zone as well as individual factors were included as covariates in the models . Results showed that street greenery was positively associated with the odds of achieving 300 mins or more of physical activity per week but the park area was not . Furthermore street connectivity and land use mix were positively associated with both the frequency and total time of physical activity . Unexpectedly population density was negatively associated with the frequency and total time of physical activity . Therefore adding street greenery or improving existing street greenery can be a vital environment intervention strategy to create an aging friendly urban environment .

@highlight Streetscape photos taken by trained researchers was used to measured street greenery.
@highlight Street greenery has a positive association with the time of physical activity in older adults.
@highlight Park area is not significantly associated with the physical level of older adults.
@highlight The effect of street connectivity and land use mix on physical activity of older adults are positive.
