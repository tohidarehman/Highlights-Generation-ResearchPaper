 Urban agriculture which includes community gardens provides ecosystem services but is continuously threatened by the densification of cities . Picardo Farm is the oldest community garden in Seattle . Its success and popularity inspired the municipality of Seattle to develop a city wide public program called the P Patch Community Gardening program . We evaluated the perceptions of Picardo Farm gardeners about the benefits provided by the farm and the reasons why this community garden is so resilient . Gardeners were asked three open ended questions and their responses were evaluated for recurring keywords regarding ecosystem services . We found that gardeners perceptions of ecosystem services vary and they often underestimate ecosystem services related to regulation . We identified seven key topics from gardeners responses
