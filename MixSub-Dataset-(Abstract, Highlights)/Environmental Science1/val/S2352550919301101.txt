 Sustainability evaluation has been an important topic for politicians and professionals for the last few decades . A data envelopment analysis is a popular technique for evaluating the sustainability of decision making units . The traditional DEA models consider a DMU as black box thus ignoring the interactions among the different processes . This study proposes a new network data envelopment analysis model for evaluating the sustainability of high middle and low income countries . The proposed NDEA model allows us to evaluate sustainable production and distribution stages in a unified framework in the presence of both zero data and undesirable outputs . The results of our proposed model show that countries with high and low incomes perform well in the sustainable production stage but have a weak performance in the sustainable distribution stage . In contrast middle income countries have weak performance in the sustainable production stage but good performance in the sustainable distribution stage . Finally to identify countries strengths and weaknesses we also did a sensitivity analysis . Based on the results the paper proposes solutions for reducing inefficiencies in the sustainable production and distribution stages .

@highlight A network DEA model is proposed to evaluate sustainability of countries.
@highlight The model allows to evaluate production and distribution stages.
@highlight High and low incomes perform strong in production but weak in distribution.
@highlight Middle income countries perform weak in production but strong in distribution.
@highlight Solutions are proposed to reduce inefficiencies in each of the economic stages.
