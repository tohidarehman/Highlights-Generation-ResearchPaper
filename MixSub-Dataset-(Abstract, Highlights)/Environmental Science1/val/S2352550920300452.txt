 Green products are increasingly considered by companies owing to the significant attention of government regulations customers requests and competitors . Here we deal with Green Product Families by selecting green components modules and products which are produced based on the assembling to order approach to cover diverse customer needs . Designing a GPFs is important but not sufficient for sustainable optimization . In fact we need to simultaneously consider the supply chain of a GPF to control the pollution generated in the downstream supply chain . For a sustainable optimization approach this joint configuration is usually structured based on economic environmental and social criteria which are often conflicting . Maximizing the total profit maximizing the product greenness and minimizing the total supply chain cost with environmental considerations constitute our main objectives . We apply the Leader Follower Stackelberg game in order to present a joint configuration of the GPF and its green supply chain . Maximizing the total profit and maximizing product greenness are the two objectivesof the leader problem to attain the GPF . This is done by determining the optimal selection of components modules and product variants . The follower of the joint problem seeks to configure the supply chain by minimizing the GSC costs considering carbon emissions . This includes the optimal selection of suppliers manufacturers the assembly plant distribution centers and retailers . A bi level multi objective linear programming problem is used to model the Stackelberg game of the GPF GSC . A new particle swarm optimization algorithm named as bi level multi objective PSO is developed to solve the proposed bi level multi objective model . To show the validity of the proposed model and the efficiency of our algorithm a case study at a mobile phone company is worked through . Finally certain results with some managerial implications are obtained through a sensitivity analysis .
