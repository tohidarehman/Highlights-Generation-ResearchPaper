 Nurturing the global population without exceeding the carrying capacity of the earth is a challenge . Linking nutritional quality and environmental objectives is of high importance in a sustainable food context . Meals are not usually evaluated and classified based on their contribution to health and especially to environmental sustainability . Therefore we propose a methodology for the classification of meals based on environmental policy targets and nutritional recommendations . As a case study we analyzed 100 hot meals served in a university canteen in Belgium . Every meal contained three meal components . A life cycle assessment and a nutritional assessment based on the Weighted Nutrient Density Score were performed to evaluate the environmental impact and the nutritional value respectively . To classify the meals we introduced three reference values for both the environmental impact and the nutritional value . This corresponded to four environmental and four nutritional classes which results in 16 classes in total . The environmental reference values were based on the 2020 and 2030 European Commission targets on greenhouse gas emission reduction . The nutritional reference values were based on food recommendations from national public health authorities . Meals with fish had the best overall score and meals with ruminant meat had the worst score . Vegetarian meals had the best environmental score and similarly to ruminant meat meals the worst nutritional score . Further studies are needed to test the classification methodology for other meals and food items . Future research may focus on further optimization of the combined environmental and nutritional assessment especially for the classification of reference values . To conclude we developed a novel nutritional and environmental classification for meals based on environmental policy targets and nutritional recommendations .

@highlight Meals are classified based on environmental policy and nutritional recommendations.
@highlight The classification includes 4 environmental and 4 nutritional classes 16 in total.
@highlight Meals with fish had the best score and meals with ruminant meat the worst score.
