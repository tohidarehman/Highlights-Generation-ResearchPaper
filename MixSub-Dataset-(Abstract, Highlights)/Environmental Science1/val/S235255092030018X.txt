 The present study assesses the electricity generation potential of methane from municipal solid waste through landfill gas to energy technology in 16 districts of Beijing municipality . Municipal solid waste generation potential and methane generation potential from landfills of each of the districts were estimated from 2019 to 2038 . Economic viability analysis of landfill gas to energy project based on Net Present Value Levelized Cost of Energy and Payback Period was conducted . Besides environmental impact analysis based on greenhouse gas emissions potential was evaluated . Key results indicate that the generation potential of municipal solid waste during the project period is 55 000 to 2 120 000 tons year . Chaoyang district has the highest municipal solid waste generation potential while lower municipal solid waste generation potential was observed in Mentougou district . It is also found that Chaoyang district had the highest electricity generation potential of 8 400 000 to 218 300 000 kWh year . Findings of the economic feasibility analysis show that landfill gas to energy project is viable in all the districts . However the project is highly viable in Chaoyang district with more positive net present value shorter payback period and lower levelized cost of energy . Greenhouse gas emission potential of landfill gas without energy recovery was the highest in all the districts . It was realized that landfill gas with energy recovery could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 72.3 in all the districts . This paper will provide scientific guidance for investment in landfill gas to energy projects in Beijing municipality and other municipalities of China .
