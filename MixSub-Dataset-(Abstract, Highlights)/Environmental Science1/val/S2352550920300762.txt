 The build orientation of parts which are produced by Additive Manufacturing processes has a considerable effect on material and energy consumptions . The choice of a specific build orientation from the range available is crucial because it has a direct impact on the economic and environmental aspects of part production .

@highlight A new method to orient parts in additive manufacturing is presented.
@highlight The method is applied to different combinations of technologies and products.
@highlight A reduction of environmental impact indicators is achieved.
@highlight Solutions proposed by the method reduce the cost of the production.
