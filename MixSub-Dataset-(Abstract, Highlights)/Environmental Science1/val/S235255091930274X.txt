 India is projected to be among the top three energy consuming countries by 2030 . Even with a low per capita consumption it is ranked fourth in terms of carbon emissions . Though India has made progress in terms of deploying renewables as part of its climate commitments there has been a temporal and regional variation in terms of installed capacity . The paper aims to identify the drivers and challengers impacting the solar and wind power sectors in India through an expert survey . Thirty four sector experts representing ministries federal agencies renewable companies investor groups financial institutions and civil society responded to a questionnaire using a Likert Scale encompassing all possible factors which would have influenced these two sectors . Response depicted an even distribution of score with experts endorsing policies like feed in tariff auctions and tax depreciation and the requirement of a strong grid network to assimilate variable power . Commercial and infrastructure variables like cost of capital credit worthiness of utility land and road network were marked high . Experts envisaged heightened role of green power in future which may have to compete in open power markets sans any policy support . This analysis may be used for improving the effectiveness of Indian climate policies .

@highlight Feed in tariff tax credits and auctions came out as key policy measures.
@highlight Utilities credit worthiness and cost of funds were key commercial factors.
@highlight High share of variable power was identified as a technical challenge.
@highlight Experts anticipate growing awareness on climate issues in India.
