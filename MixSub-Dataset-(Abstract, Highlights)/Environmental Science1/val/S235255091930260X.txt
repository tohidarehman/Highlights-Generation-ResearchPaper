 Resource optimization platforms appear as a valid option to more sustainable modes of consumption . The success of these platforms mostly depends on the capability to comprehend the potential users motives for engagement . We developed and tested a conceptual model based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour to investigate the relative significance of consumer motives for and against using a peer to peer sharing platform . Qualitative interviews of an elicitation study followed a quantitative survey with potential users . The size of the demand for accessing specific products and services and the type of transaction mode preferred were also investigated . Attitude towards using a P2P sharing platform is the strongest predictor of behavioural intention among the TPB constructs . Ecological sustainability sense of belonging trust in other users and familiarity are the most critical factors determining the attitude towards using the potential platform process risk concerns were identified as the main hinder . There were more providers than takers to all likely items enquired and accommodation and car sharing had the most significant asymmetric ratios remarkably . Services in general and study materials were the items with the highest potential demand and supply . The preferred mode of exchange for the platform is a free system which includes donation and second hand sales and transfer of points or money . This study contributes to a better understanding of consumer motivations and desires to engage in sharing resources for sustainability transformations .
