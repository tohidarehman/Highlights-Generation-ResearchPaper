 Making an effective sustainability decision at every stage of a product life cycle is key to achieving a holistic sustainable product development . The extant literature highlights the challenges and lack of effective tools for determining the impact of manufacturing processes on the environmental economic and social dimensions as well as the interdependence of the outcome of one dimension on the other . This research paper identifies methodologies tools and approaches that can be integrated into a single descriptive framework to enable both assessment and analysis of the aspects of the three sustainability dimensions . The paper also details the development of the framework using inductive methods and conceptual synthesis of key sustainability approaches and a Delphi study involving panels of international researchers and practitioners in the field of sustainable manufacturing . The framework can provide a platform for both practitioners and sustainability analysts to build impact analysis models that will support effective sustainability decision making . It will also enable a clear perspective of the required elements processes and indicators that need to be considered in sustainable manufacturing design and assessments .
