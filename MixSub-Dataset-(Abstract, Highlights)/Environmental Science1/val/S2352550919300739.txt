 We examine resident perceptions of tap water organoleptic properties to identify overall satisfaction and consumption patterns in relation to social and economic inequality across urban neighborhoods in Palm Beach County FL . We surveyed randomly selected households and inquired in person at the residence about the organoleptic properties of their household tap water . A socioeconomic status index was created using Principal Components Analysis and KruskalWallis and MannWhitney tests were used to examine the differences in survey responses between SES groups . The results provide evidence that residents living in the lowest SES ranked neighborhoods are less satisfied with the organoleptic properties of their tap water and consume more bottled water than those living in the higher SES ranked neighborhoods . This paper explores socioeconomic disparities across Palm Beach County and assesses how organoleptic properties of tap water influence consumption patterns especially in poorer neighborhoods . Suggestions for future research include testing for tap water contaminants at the household by using resident descriptions of tap water aesthetics as a guide for sampling design . Additionally reducing secondary contaminants at the water treatment plant is recommended in order to promote tap water consumption and reduce reliance on bottled water .

@highlight Odor clarity and taste of tap water were rated lower in poorer households.
@highlight Lower ranked SES households consume bottled water the most frequently.
@highlight Improving tap water organoleptics may promote consumption and reduce plastic waste.
@highlight Resident perceptions can help guide solutions for tap water improvements.
