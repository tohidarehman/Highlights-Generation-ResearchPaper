 Decarbonizing the energy intensive and natural resource based industries is possible but may substantially increase the cost of production . Whether such cost increases will reduce economic welfare depends on how the downstream industries respond to the higher cost for intermediate goods . In this paper we explore how downstream industries in the EU15 responded to upstream carbon technology shocks and prices shocks during the period 19982014 . Our results show that downstream industries do not respond to technology shocks directly but that they do respond to price shocks . A 5 percent upstream price increase is followed by a 4 percent increase in capital investments 3 percent increase in productivity and a 4 percent reduction in the carbon intensity among manufacturing industries . The utilities and construction industries respond primarily by increasing prices and reducing wages . Prices increase by approximately by 1 percent and real wages fall by approximately 2 percent following a five percent upstream price increase .

@highlight We test how a decarbonization of upstream industries affects downstream industries.
@highlight Downstream industries are only affected if upstream industries increase prices.
@highlight Manufacturing industries respond by investing in new capital and by innovating.
@highlight Utility and construction industries respond by increasing prices and reducing wages.
