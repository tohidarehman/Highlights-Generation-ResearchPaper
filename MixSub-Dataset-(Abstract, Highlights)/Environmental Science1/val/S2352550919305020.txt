 The adoption of palm oil sustainability standards remains limited especially among plantation companies . This is a concern since plantation companies are pivotal for the palm oil industry not only because of their own production but because they form an important nucleus for smallholders . Using a panel technique this study investigates the drivers underlying the certification of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil standard by plantation companies in Malaysia . We examine the period between 2007 and 2016 . Panel logistics analysis allows for changes in variables including company capacity and the time dependent price of crude palm oil . Despite the fact that these variables influence adoption our findings reveal that adoption is found to be elastic to changes only in proportion to the planted area . Plantation companies that have undertaken conservation efforts may present low hanging fruits . Given the currently limited response to adoption a partially targeted approach encompassing education and technical assistance financial assistance and regulation is recommended to create a more inclusive and enabling environment .

@highlight Advocacy of sustainability standards should also target plantation companies.
@highlight Company capacity and price of crude palm oil influence RSPO adoption.
@highlight Firms that have undertaken conservation efforts may present low hanging fruits.
@highlight Partially targeted approach could create an inclusive enabling environment.
@highlight Technical assistance financial aids and financial regulation are viable options.
