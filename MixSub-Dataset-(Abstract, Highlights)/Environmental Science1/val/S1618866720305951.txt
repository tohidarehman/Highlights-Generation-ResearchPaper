 Green infrastructure practices consisting of using vegetation and soil to manage stormwater runoff has been adopted by cities across the world to help address aging water infrastructure water quality excess water quantity and urban planning needs . Although GIs contribution to stormwater control and management has been extensively studied the economic value of its benefits is less known . In Omaha NE GI projects have been completed in several public parks . Using a repeat sales model based on 20002018 housing data we examined the effect of GI on the value of single family homes within various buffer distances of parks where GI was installed . After controlling for changes associated with home deterioration and renovation non stationary location effects and time invariant characteristics we did not find any statistically significant relationships between housing values and GI . This finding is consistent with the notion that homeowners place little value on modifications to existing greenspace but may also stem from homeowners lack of familiarity with GI practices or data limitations .

@highlight A repeat sales model assessed how installing GI in parks affects nearby home values.
@highlight The data consisted of 25 472 sales pairs 20002018 from Omaha NE USA.
@highlight We found no significant effects of GI on home values.
@highlight Homeowners likely place little to no value on the assessed greenspace modifications.
