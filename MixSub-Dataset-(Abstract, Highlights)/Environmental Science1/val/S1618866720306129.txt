 Urban green areas are an important part of the cities that provide novel ecosystem for the preservation of many plants and animals . Pollinators are the one animal group that are well adapted to live in the urban environment . However not all green areas in the city affect pollinators equally which is associated with management practices vegetation composition and distance to the city center . Our study was aimed to assess how environmental features and vegetation composition shape the pollinator communities in different habitats in the city . Forty seven squares in the three different urban green areas were established in the Pozna city where the bees butterflies and hoverflies were surveyed . On each square the vegetation and environmental features were estimated . Plant communities composition was different between three habitats which affected pollinators compositions in the city . The NMDS analyses showed that in the case of bees and butterflies plant height and share of built up area explain a high percentage of the variance . Additionally the Plantaginaceae Boraginaceae Asteraceae Lamiaceae Ranunculaceae and Caryophyllaceae families had a significant impact on pollinators . Plants form these families are characterized by the flowers from opened to closed corollas which provide access to nectar and pollen for different pollinator groups . This study demonstrated that both environmental and vegetation features had a significant effect on pollinators species communities composition which is indirectly relate to management practices of these greenery areas . The management policy of greenery landscapes in the city especially in more transformed areas like urban parks and housing estates must consider restricted implement actions leading to a reduction of the number of mowing or and leaving un mowed foraging patches for pollinators .
