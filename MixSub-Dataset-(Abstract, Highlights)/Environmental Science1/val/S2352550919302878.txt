 Selective Laser Melting offers significant potential for a sustainable way of production . Raw material in form of metallic powder can directly be reused and the selective nature of the process offers new potential for resource economization . We introduce a mathematical model which allows conclusions about the influence of parameters like part volume and exposure parameters onto the resource consumption in an SLM process . For this purpose time and energy consumption are classified in process shares as a function of volume and process parameters . The introduced approach is validated by experimental methods under the consideration of part volume exposure parameters and batch size . While the approach shall be independent of the manufactured material the experiments are executed for the aluminum alloy AlSi10Mg . The measurements quantify the impact of the part volume and process parameters on the resource consumption and provide recommendations for improvements regarding an increased material efficiency . Additionally the established model can be used to analyze manufacturing costs for single parts or series productions . The results illustrate the importance of lightweight design methods for an efficient and sustainable production by powder bed fusion methods like SLM .
