 Extensive gaps in invasive plant species research in terms of ecosystem distribution and impact are major barriers faced by global decision making bodies for scientific management of plant species invasions of native flora . Effective strategies need to be worked out which would enable simultaneous management and the use of invasive plant species for ecosystem restoration . For evaluating the photosynthetic potential of invasive plant species in restoration of degraded areas exhaustive in situ leaf gas exchange and leaf chlorophyll fluorescence were undertaken on four plants found naturally colonizing on the fly ash deposits . The four invasive species screened for their physiological tolerances towards microclimatic and edaphic stresses in harsh fly ash deposits were

@highlight Study reveals the success of fly ash dumpsite restoration by invasive plant species.

@highlight emissions in fly ash dump.
@highlight C4 species should be given more weightage in fly ash dumpsite revegetation programs.
@highlight suitable for fly ash ponds due to moisture loving nature.
