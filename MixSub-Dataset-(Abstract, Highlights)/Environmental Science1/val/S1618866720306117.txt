 It is important to quantify the value of green space amenities in order to justify the cost of their creation and maintenance furthermore advances in available data and methods have produced exciting ways to measure the economic values of green infrastructure . In this study we use publicly available data from Zillow Inc. to implement the hedonic pricing method at a novel scope and scale . We analyze over 5000 Zillow neighborhoods located in metropolitan areas across 44 states to identify the marginal value of urban green spaces with respect to median neighborhood home prices . By incorporating a vast heterogeneous study area we are able to gain a national scale perspective on the effects of green spaces on home values . Furthermore Zillow neighborhoods permit reproducible extensible and policy relevant insight into the effects of green spaces on neighborhoods holistically . Our results suggest that for Zillow neighborhoods on average the normalized difference vegetation index and open space are dis amenities however parks and tree cover add premiums to Zillow neighborhood value . By interacting tree cover with land surface temperature we find the amenity value of trees is realized in part through shading furthermore we find that tree shading has a greater amenity value in higher income areas .

@highlight Zillow Inc. open access data offers potential for large scale hedonic pricing analyses that inform urban greening initiatives.
@highlight Trees and parks add premiums to home values in metropolitan areas on average whereas un curated vegetation is a dis amenity.
@highlight We find indications of a positive feedback loop between wealth and tree shade in urban and suburban areas.
