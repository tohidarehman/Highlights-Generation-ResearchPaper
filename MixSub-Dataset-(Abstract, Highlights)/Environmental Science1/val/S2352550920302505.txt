 The current study attempted to understand factors influencing pro environmental behaviors with Theory of Planned Behavior and Value Identity Personal norm model by proposing a new model . 16 hypotheses were tested using a total of 340 science teachers in several cities in central anatolia region in Turkey . Scales obtained from previous studies included eight psychological variables to measure antecedents of pro environmental behaviors . Structural equation modeling revealed that the proposed model has acceptable fit data and was determined for hypothesis testing . The results of the data analysis showed that the biospheric values have significant influence on TPB constructs . In addition attitude and perceived behavioral control had a direct influence on pro environmentalbehavioralintentions which encourage active engagement in pro environmental behaviors while subjective norm had no direct effect on pro environmentalbehavioralintentions . Lastly considering VIP constructs biospheric values and environmental self identity had a direct influence on personal norm which in turn affected pro environmental behaviors . Results of indirect relationship between constructs showed that attitude perceived behavioral control biospheric values and environmental self identity had indirect influence on pro environmentalbehaviors while the indirect relationship between subjective norm and behaviors was insignificant . Consequently 14 out of 16 hypotheses within the model that merged the TPB and the VIP were statistically supported in determining antecedents of pro environmental behaviors .

@highlight A robust proposed model was developed by merging TPB and VIP.
@highlight The proposed model had strong predictive power to explain behaviors.
@highlight Personal norm and intention had a significant direct effect on behaviors.
@highlight Intention personal norm and environmental self identity had moderating roles on behaviors.
