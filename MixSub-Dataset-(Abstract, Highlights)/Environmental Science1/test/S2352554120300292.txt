 Biowaste is an important sustainable source of adsorption activities for many harmful materials such as hazardous metals elements and organics . It has many advantages over the conventional materials due to its low cost abundance affective adsorption capacity and recyclability . Dyes are mainly organics with different structures and molecular weights they are harmful to the environment and organisms if they were not efficiently treated before releasing . However there is a massive number of dyes that classified into different categories and there are different adsorbents that were reported for dyes adsorption . Among these dyes methyl dyes with their different colors are very common in researches because of their availability and easiness in the study . Also there are various biosorbents that were used prepared or grafted from different parts of plants and animals . In this review we are focusing on the use of plant parts such as the leaf peel etc . in dyes removal . Researches numbers in this field are increasing yearly which indicates the importance of this type of material though we selected a group of articles to focus on to clarify the idea in summary . Different adsorption capacities operation conditions and applying forms were studied and the reported results showed that biomass adsorbents are so influential and recyclable . The adsorption kinetics and isotherms were illustrated and tabled for selected studies to show the adsorbents behaviors and adsorption mechanisms .
