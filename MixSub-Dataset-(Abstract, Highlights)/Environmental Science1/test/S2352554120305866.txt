 Acute and chronic exposure to ultraviolet radiation leads to variety of changes in skin . For skin protection from deleterious effects of sunlight sunscreen products are used in various forms having chemical and physical filters . These chemical formulations have adverse effects in chronic condition . Thus involvement of herbal extracts could be of great choice owing to their specific radiation absorbing capacity . The rationale of this study was to determine the sun protection factor of commonly consumed vegetables and fruits and compare it with that of a synthetic compound and assess their efficacy as protecting ultraviolet radiations . Five vegetable samples namely Potato Beetroot Eggplant Cucumber and Tomato and five fruit sample Banana Papaya Green Grapes Black Grapes and Orange Fruits were examined for their SPF values at different temperature and pH conditions . The photoprotective activity was recorded using spectrophotometric method and calculations were done using Mansur equation . Among all vegetable used the SPF of eggplant was found to be highest 14.37at 25C and pH 7 while among fruits orange was found to be best at same conditions . It shows the possibility to use these extracts as a sunscreen in pharmaceutical preparations .

@highlight Eggplant and orange aqueous extract has SPF value more than 10 and can be used as sunscreen in pharmaceutical preparation.
@highlight SPF of vegetables and fruit extracts largely affected by pH and temperature.
@highlight Total phenolic content and DPPH radical activity is high for Eggplant and orange extracts.
@highlight Plant extracts can be used as potential candidate for prevention of harmful effects of UV radiation on the skin.
