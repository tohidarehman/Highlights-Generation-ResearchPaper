 The ability of olive pips in the removal of lead ions from polluted water was investigated using three layer artificial neural network and 114 batch experiments . The experiments revealed that the highest removal was achieved at pH 5 agitation time 60min biosorbent dose 0.3g 100mL of liquid phase speed 200rpmat room temperature and 50mg L initial concentration . The transfer functions in the artificial network model were linear and tangent sigmoid for output and hidden layers respectively where eight neurons presented a good description for results of batch experiments with coefficient of correlation 0.997 . The analysis of sensitivity proved that the initial pH of solution had more influence in the present sorption process with relative importance of 34 . The outputs of artificial network were integrated with the solute transport equation for description the propagation of lead ions through fixed bed column packed with olive pips . For breakthrough curves a satisfactory concurrence was observed between outputs of model and measured concentrations because Willmott s index was 0.97 .
