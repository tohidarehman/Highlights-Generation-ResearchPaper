 This study deals with the combustion characteristics of base oil based blends called number 10 lubes a blend of virgin nonstandard base oils with low taxation petroleum products and or wastes used as diesel additive or substitute using thermogravimetric analysis with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy . Basic compositional analyses were also conducted with relevant methods in an accredited fuel analysis laboratory . In general samples yielded exceptional characteristics in terms of sulfated ash content . Oxidation reactions were found to compose of one decomposition stage whilst up to three stages were also observed outstandingly . Thermographs vary slightly in shape and position similarly shaped to that for mineral oil base oil or waste engine oil and exhibited lower mass loss rates at low temperatures when compared to diesel . Quantitatively combustion reactions occur between 23642.2C and 36239.0C yielding a maximum combustion rate and mass loss of 17.43.87 min and 98.41.29 respectively on average with major gases released carbon dioxide water vapour and the others complicating the interpretation of spectral bands . The combustion characteristic indices also showed the combustion performance in favor of diesel NTLs mineral oil waste engine oil base oil waste vegetable oil . Thus this problem needs to be handled carefully via waste to fuel projects adopting the circular economy approach if sufficient knowledge on all of the technical and market aspects of such fuels would be obtained .

@highlight Thermal behavior of a diesel like generic fuel is investigated.
@highlight Combustion characteristics is similar to base oil lubricant or waste oil.
@highlight Thermal stability does not conform to diesel fuel.
@highlight Biodiesel like property as in sulfated ash is yielded among samples.
@highlight FTIR based gas analysis showed complex nature of components.
