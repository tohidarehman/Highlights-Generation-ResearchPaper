 The full life cycle of today s crystalline photovoltaic panel is dominated by a linear open material flow paradigm . The Cradle to Cradle philosophy applied in a Closed Loop Material Cycle scenario seems promising to move towards a Circular Economy . Environmental impacts associated with the End of life phase of PV panels particularly a CLMC scenario have not yet been evaluated . To this end this article uses the Life Cycle Assessment methodology to compare a linear Open Loop Material System scenario with a novel CLMC system . Based on our results the environmental impacts of a PV CLMC scenario are then compared with a Cadmium telluride panel CLMC scenario .

@highlight An environmental assessment for a closed PV material flow system is introduced
@highlight Re design phase of PV panels is key to reuse its materials at the End of Life
@highlight Closing the material flow per se does not guarantee environmental sustainability
@highlight Crystalline Silicon and Cadmium Telluride panels End of Life impacts are assessed
