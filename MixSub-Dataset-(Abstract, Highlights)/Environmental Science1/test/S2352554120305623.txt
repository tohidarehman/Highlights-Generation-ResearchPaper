 A comprehensive study has been hold as a function of ionic strength pH equilibrium kinetic and thermodynamic for the removal of carbamazepine from its aqueous solutions onto bentonite . A statistical experimental design method has been applied for the optimal adsorption conditions in order to achieve the maximum yield . Partition coefficient was also employed for the evaluation of the bentonite clay s performance . The equilibrium time was determined as 15min depending on the kinetic study where the maximum adsorption capacity 2.3550mgg

@highlight Adsorption of carbamazepine using bentonite was optimized by Box Behnken design.
@highlight Ionic strength gave rise to decrease the adsorption capacity.
@highlight Adsorption yield rised by the increase in the acidity of the medium.
@highlight Carbamazepine bentonite adsorption system has been found to be chemisorption.
