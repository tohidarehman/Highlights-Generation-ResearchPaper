 In this research our main concern is to address that fluorosis as a global health issue and to provide an affordable diagnostic probe to detect the unhealthy concentration of fluoride in water that causes it . In this context we have used chitosan with 85 deacetylation as a matrix to stabilize the nanoparticles for fluoride detection . The sensing probe based on a nano architecture imparts evident green color to the solution by encountering with fluoride ion in aqueous with bathochromic shift of 320nm . The corresponding color change of the solution after the interaction with fluoride is ascribed to the intra molecular charge transfer transition among the solution and fluoride ion complex and clearly distinguishable through naked eye and UVvis spectra . This cost effective easily detectable fast non hazardous self assembly driven colorimetric method has the concentration of detection of fluoride ion 2mgL
