 Palm oil processing is one of the most dynamic economic activities in Colombia due to its high productivity for oil extraction . The crude palm oil extraction from fresh fruit bunches requires processing stages that may generate by products or wastes impacting negatively the environment . In this work the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other Environmental Impacts was used for a better understanding of environment human health related issues during oil extraction . Besides potential hazards were determined through Hazard Identification and Ranking methodology to identify the most critical units and propose relevant safety corrections . The environmental assessment revealed that pressed cake and empty fruit bunches most contributed to total freshwater ecotoxicity calculated in 2.66

@highlight TRACI and HIRA approaches were performed to address process improvements in the sustainable extraction of crude palm oil.
@highlight Environmental and safety issues in the CPO production showed to be key approaches to move towards sustainability.
@highlight Most processing units in CPO production face potential hazards of fire and explosion.
@highlight The case study showed to be environmentally friendly however improvements must be addressed for emissions management.
