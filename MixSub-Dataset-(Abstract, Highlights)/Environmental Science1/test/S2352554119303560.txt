 In this study olive stone one of the largely gathered agricultural wastes was investigated as an adsorbent in modified and less efficient raw form in order to remove trace elements that have negative effects on human health and environment . Citric acid assisted mechanochemical modification method proposed as an alternative to traditional chemical modification was presented as an innovative approach with advantages of being an easy to use low cost and eco friendly technology . As an effective adsorbent modified olive stone was used for removing Cu

@highlight A new and eco friendly mechanochemical method was used for lignocellulosic waste modification.
@highlight Proposed alternative modification method includes low cost and fewer steps.
@highlight Modification and adsorption studies was optimized by CCD.
@highlight Adsorption efficiencies for Cu
@highlight  Pb
@highlight and Zn
@highlight ions were found to be above 94 .
@highlight The financial advantage of the method with cost analysis was revealed.
