 Catalytic processes are important components of sustainable chemistry . We present a novel process to synthesize crotonic acid by sequential catalytic oxidation condensation oxidation reactions in a Soxhlet extractor . Oxidation of ethanol and crotonaldehyde is catalyzed by a new composite Cu H

@highlight A continuous process for the catalytic synthesis of crotonic acid.
@highlight The novel composite Cu H3PO4 catalyst for the oxidation reactions of ethanol and crotonaldehyde.
@highlight Highly selective preparation of crotonic acid based on ethanol with green process.
