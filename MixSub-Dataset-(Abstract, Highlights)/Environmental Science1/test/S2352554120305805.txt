 The production of bioplastics from renewable and biodegradable sources could be a great potential option for the substitution of conventional plastics . In this way raw materials and processing method have been investigated to improve their competitiveness in the actual market . However the extra treatment that bioplastics must undergo to improve their properties are expensive making them unfeasible . In this sense a heat treatment in a conventional oven seems to be a potential low cost option . This work aimed to evaluate the incorporation of a heat treatment at 50C in the process of protein based bioplastic . For this two proteins with different applications absorption in hygiene and food packaging were selected to evaluate the versatility of this tentative post treatment . In addition two different mold temperatures and different exposure times of heat treatment were studied to evaluate the effect of them in the bioplastics properties and to select the most optimal processing method for each protein . In this context mechanical properties and water uptake capacity were evaluated to study the influence of this post treatment on them . The results showed that the processing conditions and the heat post treatment could modulate the final properties of protein based bioplastics being potential materials to replace conventional plastics .

@highlight SPI bioplastics present better mechanical and absorption properties than PPI ones.
@highlight A heat treatment improves mechanical properties of SPI and PPI bioplastics.
@highlight However a heat treatment decreases slowly the water uptake capacity of bioplastics.
@highlight Heat treatment preferably modifies both SPI and PPI bioplastics processed at 70C.
