 In the present research pH sensitive interpenetrating polymeric network are prepared by interpenetration of two natural polysaccharides Moringa bark gum and Carrageenan by use of microwave irradiation as interpenetrating polymeric network and characterized using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy x ray diffraction thermogravimetric studies and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance and the surface topography indepth pore size as well as the interior architecture of the material were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy .The contact angle measurement by optical contact angle indicated that the increase in MOG content increased the water retention capacity thereby maintaining the structural integrity of the polymeric network . The pH sensitivity at pH 2 7.4 9.2 and swelling studies helped in optimizing the best grade

@highlight Isotropic interpenetrating polymeric network of Moringa Bark Gum MOG carageenan CRG using microwave irradiation.
@highlight The swelling of F7 has maximum swelling at all pH of 2 7.4 and 9.2 exhibiting second order swelling kinetics.
@highlight Analytical characterizations of F7 with FTIR 13C NMR TGA XRD indicated successful interpenetration between MOG and CRG.
@highlight The scanning electron microscopy SEM and atomic force microscopy AFM of F7 revealed porous surfaces.
@highlight The drug release properties of F7 conducted for 8 hours showed 88 release and exhibited hemocompatibility.
