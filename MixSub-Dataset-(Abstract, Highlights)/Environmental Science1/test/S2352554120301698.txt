 The present work has focused on the utilization of vegetable residue of Fenugreek sustainable and novel adsorbent for sequestration of Basic Violet 14 dye . Effect of various batch operating parameters on BV 14 adsorption has been studied in detail and optimum values were reported as pH of 7.2 adsorbent loading of 0.125g shaking time of 105min and temperature of 323K . VRF was characterized based on various techniques as FTIR DLS zeta potential SEM EDS and BET analysis . Kinetic and equilibrium data have been well exemplified by pseudo 1
