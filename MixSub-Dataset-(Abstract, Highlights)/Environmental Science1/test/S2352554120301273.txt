 This study modeled and optimized the operational conditions for the extraction of keratin from waste chicken feathers via alkaline hydrolysis method . Response Surface methodology using Box Behnken design was used to investigate the effect of time temperature and the concentration of both sodium hydroxide and sodium bisulphite as an extraction solvent on the keratin hydrolysate and protein yield . The coefficients of determination R
