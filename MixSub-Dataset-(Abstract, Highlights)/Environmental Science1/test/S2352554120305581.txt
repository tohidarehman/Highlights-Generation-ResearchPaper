 As a very durable material soft polyvinyl chloride is used for many applications in the field of consumer products . To enable the desired properties for example for medical devices the addition of plasticizers is required . For this purpose mostly dialkyl phthalates are used being produced on a multi million tons scale annually . Since some of these are associated with human health effects there is an increasing demand for the search of alternatives . Besides reduced toxicity while maintaining excellent performance features an economic access as well as biorenewable starting materials are further criteria which should be ideally fulfilled by such a new plasticizer generation . Targeting these demands and in contrast to most available substitutes being based on petrochemical feedstock we developed a synthetic route starting from bio renewable platform chemicals . In detail a Diels Alder reaction of 2 methylfuran and maleic anhydride and subsequent dehydration leads to three phthalate derivatives with different alcohol components bearing a methyl group at the aromatic ring . As a representative substance di 3 methylphthalate was chosen for performance tests and this new bio based alternative offers properties similar to known plasticizers in such initial studies .

@highlight Potential new plasticizers based on biorenewables were prepared starting from 2 methylfuran and maleic anhydride.
@highlight By means of different alcohol components three dialkyl 3 methylphthalates were synthesized.
@highlight Initial performance tests with di 2 ethylhexyl 3 methylphthalate showed several promising plasticizer properties.
