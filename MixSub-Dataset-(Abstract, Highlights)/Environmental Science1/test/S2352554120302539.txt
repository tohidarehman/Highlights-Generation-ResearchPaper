 Polyethylene terephthalate from bottle waste was compounded with an organically modified nanoclay at increasing concentrations by extrusion to improve its physical mechanical properties . Nanocomposites evidenced combined intercalated tactoid structures by XRD and TEM . The higher tactoid proportion increased the color variation and the opacity of the films but did not affect the transparency . Although clay addition did not affect the thermal properties of PET samples crystallinity and the barrier effect against volatile release increased with clay concentration . The elastic modulus of nanocomposites was higher than control RPET film . Mechanical parameters of RPET film with 5wt of organoclay were similar to those obtained from virgin polymer . Global migration and metal traces migration from nanocomposite films to food simulants were below current European Union legislation .

@highlight Post consumer PET was reinforced with nanoclays towards a circular economy.
@highlight Global migration of nanoreinforced RPET into food simulants was determined.
@highlight The mechanical properties of RPET were improved by nanoclay addition.
@highlight Metal traces migration into aqueous and fatty simulants was analyzed.
