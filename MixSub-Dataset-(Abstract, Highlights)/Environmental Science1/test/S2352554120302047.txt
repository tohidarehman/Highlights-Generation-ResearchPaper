 Four types of green alkali modified clinoptilolite were prepared using green tea extracts as novel types of eco friendly heterogeneous basic catalysts in the transesterification of commercial waste cooking oil into biodiesel . The modified products displayed significant enhancement in the total basicity surface area ion exchange capacity and the morphological properties . The modified samples of K clinoptilolite Na clinoptilolite Ca clinoptilolite and Mg clinoptilolite showed promising catalytic activities achieving biodiesel yields of 93.6 95.2 96.4 and 98.7 respectively . The best yields were recognized using 4wt as catalysts loading 16 1 as methanol to waste oil molar ratio and at 70C as temperature . The best transesterification intervals were identified at 120min 120min 180min and 150min for K Clino Na Clino Ca Clino and Mg Clino respectively . The modified products also demonstrated high reusability properties and the resulted biodiesel in their transesterification systems are of technical properties within the accepted limits of EN 14214 and ASTM D 6751 standards .
