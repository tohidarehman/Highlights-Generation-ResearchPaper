 Major efforts have been made relating to the development of novel biosorbents applied to remove wastewater pollutants such as heavy metal ions and dyes . This work is focused on preparing a biosorbent from oil palm bagasse and alumina nanoparticles and using it for cadmium and nickel uptake . FT IR SEM and EDX analyses were carried out to test the diversification of functional groups morphology and elemental composition . Batch adsorption experiments were performed varying pH and particle size in order to determine suitable parameter values for further experiments using chemically modified biomass . The presence of absorption bands attributed to bonds with aluminum indicated a successful synthesis of this biosorbent . The carbon and oxygen elements most contribute to biosorbent composition due to the nature of this lignocellulosic biomass . The highest removal yields were achieved at pH 6 and particle size 0.355mm . In addition the modification with alumina nanoparticles using dimethyl sulfoxide as organic solvent reflected no significant enhancement of adsorption process .
