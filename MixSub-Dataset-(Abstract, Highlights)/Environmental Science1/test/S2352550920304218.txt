 Fleet operators periodically update and improve their vehicles in order to take opportunity of new technologies . Alternative fuel vehicles give opportunities to lower fuel costs as well as to reduce environmental footprint . To select an appropriate alternative fuel vehicle it is a significant concern for fleet operations . Now the assessment of fuel technology selection can be considered as multi criteria decision making problem due to involvement of several conflicting criteria . The objective of this study is to propose novel decision making framework based on the operators of q rung orthopair fuzzy sets traditional weighted aggregated sum product assessment approach score function and similarity measure to solve the alternative fuel technology selection problem within q ROFSs context wherein the decision experts and criteria weights are completely unknown . In this approach a new procedure is developed based on similarity measure and improved score function for evaluating the criteria weights . For this a new similarity measure and generalized improved score function for q ROFSs are introduced and shown the comparison with existing ones . Next to elucidate the efficiency and feasibility of the discussed framework an empirical study of alternative fuel technology selection problem is presented . In addition this study performs sensitivity analysis with respect to various set of criteria weights to reveal the strength of the introduced framework . Finally a comparison is discussed to analyze the validity of the obtained results . The final results confirm that the developed framework is more efficient and well consistent with previously developed methods under q ROFSs .
