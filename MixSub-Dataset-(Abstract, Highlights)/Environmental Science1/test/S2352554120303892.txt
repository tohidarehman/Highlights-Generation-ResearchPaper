 is a critically endangered plant species with medicinal and ornamental properties . The rare availability of the species in nature limits its potential to be used for various purposes . However plant tissue culture is an effective method for the cultivation of such vulnerable species without damaging their natural populations which are very limited in nature for scientific purposes . By taking advantage of plant tissue culture this study aimed to measure the phenolic substance and flavonoid contents in leaf extracts of

@highlight Plant tissue culture technique offers a sustainable approach for the utilization of rare plants in pharmaceutical studies.
@highlight Minimal amounts of leaf samples might be enough for preliminary screening of the antioxidant potential of plant species.
@highlight The ultrasound assisted extraction method is applicable to a minimal amount of plant sample.
@highlight The ethanolic extract of
@highlight leaves had the highest phenolic substance content and DPPH scavenging activity.
@highlight The water extract of
@highlight leaves exhibited promising antioxidant activity even when used at low concentration.
