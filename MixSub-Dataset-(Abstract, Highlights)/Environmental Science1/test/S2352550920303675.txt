 Human urine is a potential source of nitrogen potassium phosphorus and other trace elements essential for plant growth . Though different study reports indicated its considerable nutrient content large scale application of urine as a fertilizer is very limited . The aim of this work was to evaluate the different nutrient recovery processes from urine for large scale application in agriculture . Single and integrated nutrient recovery systems such as struvite precipitation forward osmosis nitrification distillation ammonia stripping and absorption adsorption with evaporation fertigation among others were reviewed . Though efficient at optimum conditions in laboratory scales most of the technologies are not promising for commercialization due to investment and operational costs uncertainty of economic returns and sustainability issues . Among them fertigation is the first priority for large scale applications .

@highlight Fertigation is opted for large scale application of urine nutrients.
@highlight Yield under urine fertigation and synthetic fertilizer is comparable.
@highlight Pathogen pharmaceuticals perception pH and salinity are risks in urine fertigation.
@highlight pH and Mg P ratio of urine are vital for choice of recovery technologies.
@highlight 99 91 and 80 N P K can be recovered in integrated processes respectively.
