 In recent decades pharmaceutical uses of chitosan microbeads have been identified owing to their low toxicity biocompatibility and biodegradability . However many contributions have limited such microbeads preparation to lab scale and there are no works reported in the literature about the scaling up of chitosan microbeads production . To fill the knowledge gap this research attempts to simulate and evaluate the environmental performance of large scale production of chitosan microbeads under sustainability concept using computer aided process engineering . The extended energy and mass balances were provided by process simulation using the commercial software Aspen Plus . The environmental assessment was performed through two computer aided tools waste reduction algorithm and Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other Environmental Impacts . Results reported negatives values for total generation rate of Potential Environmental Impacts 1.1610
