 Zinc oxide is of significant importance for many industries due to its versatile properties which have been enhanced with the production of this material in the nanoscale . Nonetheless the increase in concerns related to environmental impact has led to the development of eco friendly processes for its production . Recent interest in obtaining metal and metal oxide nanoparticles using biological approaches has been reported in the literature . This method was termed green synthesis as it is a less hazardous process than chemical and physical synthesis methods currently used in the industry to obtain these nanomaterials . Zinc oxide nanoparticles have been successfully obtained by green synthesis using different biological substrates . However large scale production using green synthesis approaches remains a challenge due to the complexity of the biological extracts that poses a barrier onto the elucidation of the reactions and mechanism of formation that occur during the synthesis . Hence the current review includes a summary of the different sources of biological substrates and methodologies applied to the green synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles and the impact on their properties . This work also describes the advances on the understanding of the mechanism routes reported in the literature .
