 In recent years the search for environmentally friendly monomers has gradually increased as an important field attracting the attention of researchers worldwide . Our approach to obtaining lactic acid based polymers entails the use of an environmentally friendly monomer derived from lactic acid presenting double bond functionality allowing it to undergo free radical polymerization while further having an eco friendly water based miniemulsion polymerization process . It has been demonstrated that the ELA methyl methacrylate copolymer can successfully be synthesized . Highly stable latexes were obtained at high conversion . The incorporation of ELA and its effect on the copolymer properties were evaluated results indicated that polymer properties such as average molar masses and glass transition temperatures are strongly dependent on the ELA composition .
