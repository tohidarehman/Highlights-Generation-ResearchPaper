 The development of green nanotechnology is generating research interest in the ecological biosynthesis of nanoparticles . In this study the biosynthesis of stable iron nanoparticles was carried out using

@highlight The
@highlight is an excellent source for green synthesis of the iron oxide nanoparticles.
@highlight The phenolic compounds present in
@highlight act as reducing and capping agents.
@highlight All NPs exhibit considerable antioxidant activity which reduces with increasing NPs size and the proportion of magnetite.
@highlight The synthesized iron nanoparticles exhibited good catalytic activity for the degradation of DPPH and PPM.
