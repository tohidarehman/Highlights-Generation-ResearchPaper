 Mostly collagen is obtained from mammalian sources but its use is limited because of high cost and various allergic reactions . In this review different alternative sources of collagen were explored and methods for isolation and peptide generations are summarized . Bioactive peptides are short sequences of 220 amino acid residues with positive effect on human health . This review summarizes various biological activities of sea food derived peptides hydrolysates includes antioxidant inflammatory antifreeze angiotension I converting enzyme inhibition antimicrobial antiaging wound healing and anticoagulant activities . Moreover this review also highlights the therapeutic potential and importance of sea food derived peptides in various pharmaceutical biomedical food and cosmetic industries . This review also proposes biological solution for utilization of seafood derived waste in the development of collagen based food ingredients that is otherwise cause environmental pollution .
