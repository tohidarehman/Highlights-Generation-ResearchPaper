 Introductory college chemistry courses are required by a wide range of science curricula . This fact has tended to frame the courses as places where core fundamental ideas are taught so that a foundation of knowledge might be called upon by students when they are in subsequent courses . Unfortunately the preponderance of compartmentalized fundamental topics bolsters learning that has challenges in terms of transfer of knowledge to other science settings . One method that has been proposed to help alleviate this concern is to incorporate systems thinking and rich contexts that directly connect foundational chemistry ideas to larger systems . One area that shows strong potential for such efforts is the science of pharmaceuticals . Adding examples related to the chemistry of drugs both within the large lecture setting of general chemistry and within smaller discussion groups . The role of example problems student writing projects and group construction of systems thinking related visualizations of the context of pharmaceutical chemistry are reported .
