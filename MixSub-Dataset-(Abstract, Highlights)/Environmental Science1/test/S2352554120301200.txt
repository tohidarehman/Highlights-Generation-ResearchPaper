 Substrate protection coatings are widely applied in the industry . ZnNi alloys have less potential for corrosion thus preserving the steel substrate by corroding first . In this sense this study used nickel rich electroplating industry wastewater to produce ZnNi alloys under different conditions analyzing the zinc sulfate concentration electric current density and rotating cathode in the deposition . The nickel removal kinetics showed a reversible and first order behavior . The alloys with a composition of 2wt . nickel according to energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy analysis were more anti corrosive with polarization resistance of 1276.7cm

@highlight Ni removals from wastewater close to 34 were obtained by electrodeposition.
@highlight Electrodeposition was an effective method to recover metals from wastewater.
@highlight An increase of ZnSO
@highlight concentration improve the faradaic efficiency.
@highlight Anticorrosive properties can be improved with a 2wt. Ni composition in the ZnNi alloy.
