 The present research work aimed to analyse the performance and emission characteristics of a single cylinder air cooled compressed injection diesel fuelled with Jatropha methyl ester blends with Diethyl Ether and Isobutanol additives . Each additive was added in the proportion of 5 and 10 by volume . Experiments were conducted with diesel B20 and B30 JME blends added with selected additives . With these additives the fuel properties improved . The engine test results showed an improvement in all the performance and emission characteristics with the fuel added and with additives . B20 10 DEE showed a better specific fuel consumption brake thermal efficiency and lower NOx emissions . B30 10 IB had shown better CO CO

@highlight Comparative assessment of diethyl ether and iso butanol as biodiesel additive.
@highlight Higher thermal efficiency and better fuel economy was observed with the addition of 10 diethyl ether.
@highlight Nitrogen oxides and unburnt hydrocarbons decreased for 5 iso butanol addition.
@highlight Carbon emissions CO CO
@highlight  were less for 10 iso butanol addition.
