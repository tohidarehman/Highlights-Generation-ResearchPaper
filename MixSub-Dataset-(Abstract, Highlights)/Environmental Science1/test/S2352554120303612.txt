 Oyster mushrooms are a globally important entity both commercially and therapeutically with immense food value . The work describes a successful application of a unique method of microwave hydrodiffusion and gravity combining optimal mix of high and low power microwave firing for the extraction of phenolics and flavonoids principles from oyster mushroom for the first time . Initial firing of microwaves at higher power level was applied followed by sustained microwave firing at 170W till the completion of the extraction as indicated by physical oozing out of the aqueous extract . Such a combination of microwave firing in microwave hydrodiffusion and gravity method successfully produced two times more yield of extract with 57.7 2.8 and 82.3 3.7 more content of phenolics and flavonoids respectively when compared to 5h Soxhlet extraction and that too with a better reproducibility . Mapping of individual phenolics flavonoids were carried out and SEM images were studied for better understanding of the operational aspects . The research aims towards canvassing green technologies as in the near future only those technologies shall survive which are in tandem with environment .

@highlight MHG model with a optimal mix of high low power microwave firing.
@highlight Applied for extraction of phenolics flavonoids from oyster mushrooms.
@highlight The proposed method doesn t make use of any solvent and can be completed in less than 20min.
@highlight Improved yield of phenolics and flavonoids when compared to Soxhlet.
