 Cadmium is a nonessential heavy metal that presents a great environmental problem due to its high toxicity to all living organisms . Cadmium can obstruct plant germination growth and production mainly associated with the physiological biochemical and genetic elements of the plant system . The aim of our study was to monitor the ammonia ethylene ethanol and carbon dioxide biomolecules emissions in

@highlight Gases molecules detection using LPAS at
@highlight contaminated with Cd.
@highlight Ethylene decreases and NH
@highlight is not so much affected.
@highlight Cadmium doesn t change the concentration of C2H5OH but increases the CO2 emission.
@highlight XPS technique proved Cd presence in the plant by detecting the Cd 3p5 peak.
@highlight Fluorescence microscopy of the roots proved the toxic effect of Cd at this level.
