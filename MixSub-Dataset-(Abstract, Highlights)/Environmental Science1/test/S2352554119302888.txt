 The hydration and isomerization of the biomass turpentine have been studied in the presence of Purolite CT175 . The ion exchange resin catalyst was active for hydration and selective for producing terpenic alcohols with a conversion of 97 and showed 57 selectivity for terpineol using heating and stirring . The Purolite CT175 catalyzed isomerization of turpentine taken place in a high intensity ultrasound condition and showed conversion of 90 and 30 selectivity for camphene at 30min . Recyclability of ion exchange resin was evaluated in both reaction and its activity remained good even after four runs .
