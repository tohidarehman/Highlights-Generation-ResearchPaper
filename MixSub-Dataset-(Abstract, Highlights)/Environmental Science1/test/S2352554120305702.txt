 Organosilicon substances are ubiquitous in the environment due to their stability and numerous applications in consumer products . Therefore it is desirable to reduce their environmental persistency . Our study aimed to better understand the impact of silicon atoms in organic compounds on their environmental biodegradability as a contribution to sustainable chemistry . Accordingly we investigated the biodegradability of organosilicon compounds and their carbon analogues . OECD 301D test was used to assess ready biodegradability . In addition GC MS analyses were performed to study the fate of the compounds in the test . Three out of five carbon compounds and no organosilicon compound were found readily biodegradable . In all but one case higher biodegradation degrees could be observed for the carbon compounds . Hydrolysis was identified as a mandatory step prior to the biodegradation of organosilicon substances . The silicon free product of hydrolysis determined the rate of biodegradation . The silicon containing reaction products of hydrolysis were not biodegradable . The high biodegradability of one organosilicon compound can be attributed to faster hydrolysis due to an easily hydrolysable SiN bond and a high biodegradation rate of the resulting silicon free hydrolysis product . Insertion of such heteroatoms or functional groups into polysiloxane chains may be a promising approach to benign organosilicon compounds .
