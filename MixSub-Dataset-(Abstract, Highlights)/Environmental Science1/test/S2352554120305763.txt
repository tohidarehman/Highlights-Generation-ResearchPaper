 Almond gum was studied as an economically and environmentally viable corrosion inhibitor in 1M HCl on mild steel . Studies such as gravimetric NMR FTIR EIS PDP SEM EDAX UVVisible DFT and Monte Carlo simulation were performed to assess the potency of AG as a green inhibitor . Gravimetric study was done in the temperature range 30C60C I.E increased with increasing concentration and temperature giving significant inhibition efficiency of 96.37 at 300ppmat 60C.The adsorption of AG on MS followed Langmuir Adsorption Isotherm . Characterization by NMR and FTIR confirmed the structure of AG . UVVisible study confirmed the existence of complex Fe

@highlight Almond Gum AG a natural polysaccharide act as an effective green corrosion inhibitor for mild steel in 1M HCl.
@highlight The inhibition efficiency of AG dependent on both concentration and temperature.
@highlight PDP data reveals the mixed type of inhibition of AG.
@highlight DFT and Monte Carlo Simulation studies shows good adsorption and interaction of AG with mild steel surface.
