 In this paper we suggest integrating perspectives from indigenous and Western science into chemistry learning . Doing so is suggested to enhance students views on sustainability issues . Integrating indigenous and Western views can provide students with insight into using multiple perspectives . Cross disciplinary knowledge offers ways to solve problems more holistically and to promote respect for different worldviews . This claim is supported by a case study testing a lesson plan incorporating indigenous science in secondary and tertiary chemistry education . The study was carried out in Indonesia and used a socio scientific issues based sustainability oriented approach and the context of the Baduy community . University student teachers and upper secondary school students participated in this study . The study focuses on pesticide use including a discussion of alternative green pesticide use in an indigenous community . The lesson focuses on the role of different perspectives taken from indigenous and Western science and connects the issue with chemistry concepts from general and organic chemistry . A post intervention questionnaire was used to explore students feedback regarding the learners experiences and attitudes towards the lesson plan . Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and text analysis . Our findings indicate that students perception of the lesson was positive and that the lesson was considered to be interesting and relevant . Learning by integrating perspectives of indigenous and Western science aided students insight . It showed them that chemistry learning can be enriched by an interconnected system of worldviews in order to find solutions to sustainability issues .
