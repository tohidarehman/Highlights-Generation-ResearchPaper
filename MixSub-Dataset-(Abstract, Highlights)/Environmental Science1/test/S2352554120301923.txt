 Solid dispersions of poorly water soluble nifedipine using microparticles fabricated from chitin biomass were prepared to improve the drug dissolution in an aqueous medium . After the drug loading and solvent evaporation the drug loading capacity of 1 6 and 19 w w was obtained . In the microstructure the drug was dispersed on the porous chitin carrier with minor agglomeration leading to reduced crystallization and improved dissolution nearly 100 as compared to the pure nifedipine powder and the physical mixture with chitin . There was an interaction between functional groups of the drug and polymer consequently the release prolonged for the entire 6h with the maximum drug solubility of about 300g ml . An

@highlight Chitin was successfully used for sustainable pharmacy to enhance drug dissolution.
@highlight The solid dispersion with chitin minimized crystallization of nifedipine.
@highlight Chitin was compatible with nifedipine through the interaction of functional groups.
@highlight Porous chitin as an amino polysaccharide improved water solubility of nifedipine.
@highlight Nifedipine was stable at low humidity and temperature on the porous chitin carrier.
