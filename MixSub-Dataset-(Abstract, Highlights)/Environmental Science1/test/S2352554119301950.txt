 The aim of this work was to define optimum conditions to perform the mechanical and chemical pretreatment of empty fruit bunches and kernel shell . Mechanical pretreatment was based on particle size reduction to 0.5 1 and 2mm . For chemical pretreatment a solution of urea was added to the residues under stirring for 18h and 80C . Then samples were hydrolyzed with sulfuric acid and the resulting reducing sugars were quantified using the 3 5 dinitrosalicyclic acid method . In addition Van Soest and FTIR analyzes were performed to characterize the biomass suggesting acceptable cellulose contents and high lignin values . Results showed that the highest amount of TRS for EFBs was 105.3g L with urea concentration of 4 w v and a particle size of 0.5mm . For the KS the highest amount of TRS was 98.62g L using a urea concentration of 6 w v and a particle size of 0.5mm . According to these results it was concluded that pretreatments of oil palm biomass significantly enhance the performance of lignocellulosic material conversion into reducing sugars .

@highlight Particle size and acid solution concentration influence the TRS production from agroindustrial residues.
@highlight The particle size of 0.5 mm for empty fruit bunches and kernel shells showed the highest TRS yields.
@highlight The urea concentration of 4 and 6 w v reported the highest TRS yields for both palm oil residues.
@highlight The use of green solvents such as urea allowed to produce sugars from palm oil wastes in a more sustainable route.
