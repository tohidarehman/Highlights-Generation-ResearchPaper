 In this study biodiesel synthesis from waste cooking oil using waste oyster shells derived catalyst as a sustainable based heterogeneous catalyst under a microwave heating system technology was investigated . The CaO based catalysts were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared X ray diffraction Electronic Data System and Brunauer Emmett Teller measurements . Under optimized conditions this study has produced tentative results with considerable performances in relations to biodiesel synthesis as follows the intensification in relation to reaction time from 120 to 180min has significantly increases the biodiesel yield which declines with a more intensification to 120min the synthesis of biodiesel in this study has proved to increase with an upsurge reaction of power whereas 180min reaction time with 800W microwave power a methanol to oil molar ration of 9 1 a reaction temperature of 65C and 6wt catalyst concentration was revealed to be optimal and perfect reaction conditions for this present research work . The highest biodiesel yield was recorded at 87.3 in this study . Whereas the activation energy

@highlight A cleaner process for biodiesel synthesis from WCO using waste oyster shells under a MW heating system was investigated.
@highlight A new heterogeneous catalyst CaO based was synthesized from waste oyster shells under a MW heating system technology.
@highlight The activation energy 
@highlight  for the catalyzed transesterification reaction was found to be 9.56kJ mol.
@highlight Exploitation of waste oyster shells and WCO will minimize waste disposal challenge and reduce the biodiesel production cost.
@highlight Biodiesel yields of 87.3 was achieved from WCO as a feedstock while using a CaO based catalyst derived from waste material.
