 In this paper reported is the method of producing polyaniline in a green and sustainable way . This work follows the attempt to find an environmentally benign way of synthesizing PANI . The green innovation has been using the enzyme horseradish peroxidase Laccase and hemoglobin but being enzymes they lose the catalytic activities in the region where best conducting PANI is formed . To overcome the limitation of the biocatalyst the synthetic biomimic catalysts have been reported . The synthetic biomimic catalysts have involved the creation of tetra pyrrole porphyrin and chelated with metals and evaluated for their catalytic activities for the synthesis of PANI . Yet nature synthesizes the porphyrins in the clean green and sustainable way it was from this background that this research was done in modifying the chlorophyll a porphyrin by chelating it with iron and catalytic activities be evaluated .

@highlight Chlorophyll a porphyrin was chelated with iron III and evaluated for the catalytic activity.
@highlight The result showed that indeed the porphyrin showed catalytic activities for the synthesis of polyaniline.
@highlight When the evolution of polyaniline in the cuvettes at 650nm wavelength was evaluated with time it was observed that a 2500s was all needed to complete the reaction.
@highlight Meanwhile the uncatalyzed reaction even after 4000 s it would not show even initiation of reaction.
@highlight The nanostructures formed showed uniform elliptical shaped structures in the size range of 1023nm.
@highlight The polyaniline was moderately conducting with the conductivity of 0.14S cm.
