 Fluorescent nanomaterials have important applications in environmental monitoring and biomedicine and imaging . However their preparation often is cumbersome expensive and extremely small scale requires harsh conditions which limit their wide and practical applications . Herein by directly reusing waste fish scales with intrinsic fluorescent property as precursors we developed a facile large scale inexpensive and green method for extraction of fluorescent carbon nanoparticles for sensing of Fe

@highlight Waste fish scales were reused for extraction of fluorescent carbon nanoparticles.
@highlight The reported method for reusing fish scales is facile large scale and green.
@highlight Fluorescent carbon nanoparticles are irregular spheres contained smaller nanodots.
@highlight Nanodots with lattice fringes are found in natural fish scales for the first time.
@highlight The nanoparticles can be used as probes to detect Fe
@highlight selectively and sensitively.
