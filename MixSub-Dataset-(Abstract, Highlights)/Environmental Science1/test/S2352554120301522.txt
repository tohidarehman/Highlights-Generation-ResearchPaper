 Solid acid catalysts facilitate many organic reactions Cesium salt of tungstophosphoric acid exhibits excellent catalytic activity due to its safety efficiency strong acidity cost effectiveness and being water tolerant . CsPW has provided promising results under aqueous conditions with the high catalytic efficiency for the synthesis of target 1 3 4 oxadiazoles . The prepared catalyst was fully characterized by FT IR X ray diffraction BrunauerEmmettTeller

@highlight We explore the effect of cesium doped tungstophosphoric acid Cs PW for the synthesis of series of oxadiazole in water for the first time.
@highlight CsPW exhibits excellent yield up to 94 devoid of loss of catalytic activity even after four runs.
@highlight CsPW showed feasible mechanism to get target oxadiazole.
@highlight CsPW a solid acid catalyst could be hope for the synthesis of other azole moiety.
