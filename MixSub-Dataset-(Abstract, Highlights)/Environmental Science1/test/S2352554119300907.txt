 Power generation using dielectric elastomer artificial muscle has attracted attention because it is light weight low cost and high efficiency . This method generates carbon dioxide free electric power without exhausting rare earth materials or contributing to global warming earning it the status of an eco friendly system .

@highlight Power generation using dielectric elastomer DE has attracted attention because it is light weight low cost and high efficiency.
@highlight This power generation method generates carbon dioxide free electric power without exhausting rare earth materials or contributing to global warming earning it the status of an eco friendly system.
@highlight This paper considers such opportunities for a DE generator system namely using them to create the foundations of Recycling Energy Society.
@highlight The current status and future of DE generators will be also discussed.
@highlight We discuss two ways to use DEs more practically in applications 1 point power generation in which a single DE is used alone and 2 distributed power generation in which a large number of DEs are gathered as one cluster and distributed.
