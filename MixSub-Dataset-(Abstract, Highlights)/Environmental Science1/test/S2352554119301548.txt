 Glycerol is the main co product from biodiesel production and has been recognized as a sustainable solvent . Herein we used glycerol and waste glycerol in synthesis of two bioactive unsaturated ketones

@highlight Glycerol is a good solvent to synthesis of bioactive unsaturated ketones .
@highlight Glycerol has sustainable properties similar to water in the synthesis of unsaturated ketones .
@highlight Waste glycerol from biodiesel reaction was able to synthesize bioactive unsaturated ketones .
@highlight Glycerol from corn and sunflower oil transesterifications maintained their catalytic activity after four recycles .
