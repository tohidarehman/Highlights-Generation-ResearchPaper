 Three glucose derivatives namely Ethylenediamine modified glucose Tetramethylenediamine modified glucose and Hexamethylenediamine modified glucose with three different carbon chain lengths were synthesized using environmentally benign and low cost reactants at ambient temperature . The synthesized derivatives were evaluated as inhibitors for mild steel corrosion in 1M HCl using electrochemical surface analysis as well as computational techniques . The obtained results suggest that the synthesized glucose derivatives significantly mitigate the corrosion of mild steel and show a rise in the inhibition efficiency with increasing inhibitor dosage . The inhibitor adsorption obeyed the Langmuir isotherm . The XPS analyses provided an elucidation on the interaction of the inhibitors with the steel substrate . The DFT studies showed that the protonated forms of the inhibitors act more prominently compared to the neutral form . The inhibitor HMG having the alkyl chain with six carbon atoms exhibited the highest inhibition performance of 95 at 22.7110

@highlight Three glucose derivatives were synthesized in high yield at ambient temperature.
@highlight The three derivatives exhibited excellent corrosion inhibition performance.
@highlight The inhibition efficiency was higher for the longer chain glucose derivative.
@highlight AFM and XPS studies supported the formation of inhibitor film on the steel surface.
@highlight DFT studies suggested that the inhibitors mainly adsorb in the protonated form.
