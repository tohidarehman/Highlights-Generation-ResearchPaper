 Lignin is an aromatic biopolymer and a primary component of the cell walls in lignocellulosic biomass where it constitutes between 15 and 40 of its dry mass . This percentage can vary not only among plant species but also among different cell types . Currently the pulping and biorefinery industries worldwide extract large amounts of lignin which is mostly combusted to generate the power needed to productively transform the lignocellulosic biomass . The specific composition and structure of this technical lignin depends on its botanical origin and on the extraction method applied . In general however lignin possesses antioxidant and antimicrobial properties UV absorbing capabilities biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity . Moreover lignin can increase the mechanical strength of numerous processed biomaterials . Accordingly lignin is a promising aromatic raw material for the pharmaceutical and biomedical field . This work discusses the recent advances in the valorisation of lignin through the development of drug and gene delivery systems wound dressings tissue engineering or sunscreen actives . Finally a brief overview on the current challenges and opportunities for making lignin based products for pharmaceutical and medical applications a reality is also discussed .
