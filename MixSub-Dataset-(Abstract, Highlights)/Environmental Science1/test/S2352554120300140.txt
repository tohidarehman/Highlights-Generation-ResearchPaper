 The world s oceans are polluted by a continuous inflow of plastic . Plastic fragments finally into microplastic which can be taken up for example by plankton and subsequently by the entire ocean food web . An approach to reduce plastic pollution constitutes the accelerated microplastic degradation in marine environments . TiO
