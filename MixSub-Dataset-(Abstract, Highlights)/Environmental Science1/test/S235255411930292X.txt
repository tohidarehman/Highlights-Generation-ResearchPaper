 Keggin type heteropolyacids have been used as catalyst for the selective oxidation of olefins to the corresponding epoxides in multiphase conditions . Multiphase system allowed achieving a higher conversion and selectivity to epoxide than the corresponding homogeneous or biphasic systems in the presence of the same catalyst . Optimization of the multiphase system has been conducted considering reaction time temperature amount of the catalysts and quantity of the oxidant . The best found reaction conditions were then employed for the selective epoxidation of several substrates . Interestingly it was shown that in the multiphase system only an insignificant decomposition of hydrogen peroxide was observed .
