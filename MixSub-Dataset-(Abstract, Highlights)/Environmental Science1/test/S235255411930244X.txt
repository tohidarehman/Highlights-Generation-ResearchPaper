 The present investigation assessed the applicability of incense stick ash a novel and sustainable adsorbent for remediation of Victoria Blue dye from wastewater . Incense stick ash without any physical and chemical treatment has been applied to investigate the influence of various experimental parameters as pH loading of adsorbent concentration shaking time temperature and ionic strength on Victoria Blue remediation in a batch operation . Incense stick ash was characterized using BET DLS SEM EDS FTIR and XRD techniques . BET surface area pore volume and pore diameter of incense stick ash are obtained as 2.245m
