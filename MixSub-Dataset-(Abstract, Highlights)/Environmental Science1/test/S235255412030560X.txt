 Large quantities of natural fibers are available in the plant biomass that can be utilized for various purposes including three dimensional cell culture and tissue engineering due to their biocompatibility ecofriendly easy availability and cost effective . Especially leaf skeletons have a complex hierarchical architecture with novel properties . In this present invention describes about developing three dimensional scaffold from plant leaf skeletons for three dimensional cell culture . Plant leaf skeleton is prepared by simple and rapid method which using sodium hydroxide pretreatment under pressurized condition at 120C for 1 h. The prepared plant skeleton has microporous surface topography . Also the plant leaf skeleton is mainly composed by hemicellulose cellulose and lignin . The microscopic analysis clearly indicates that human mesenchymal stem cells attached and proliferated on plant leaf skeleton . Interestingly cell density of hMSCs is increased on plant leaf skeleton by incubation time dependent manner . Our study confirmed that sodium hydroxide via surface modified
