 This study deals with a series of operations to isolate the micro cellulose from the palm tree spathe sheath by using a modified chemical method to take into account the low cost and the completion speed and its characterization using X ray diffraction technique infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope coupled with element analyzer . The results showed that the extraction method succeeded in obtaining very pure microscopic fibers with a width of 210m with a crystallinity index equal to 79.21 containing the two cellulose features I and II that the conversion ratio of the first to the second was estimated at 32 87 .

@highlight The effectiveness and feasibility of cellulose material lies in its characteristics.
@highlight Cellulose microfibers were isolated through chemical modified method.
@highlight Resulting cellulose has two forms cellulose I and II.
@highlight Segal crystallinity index is estimated of 79.21 .
@highlight Microfibers have of 210m in width.
