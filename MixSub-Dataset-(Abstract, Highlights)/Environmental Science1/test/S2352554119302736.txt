 Silver is one of the valuable materials exist freely on earth crust . Worldwide massive demand in different purpose makes silver very valuable . On information nearly twenty percent of silver were collected from non ferrous metallurgical industry locally generated scrap and photographic film . The toxicity of silver directly impact on surface and ground ecosystem . So it s compulsory to treat and recycle silver from waste material . To fulfil the demand of silver from waste an enzyme from pineapple make of use . The aim of research work is to recover the silver metal from waste X ray film by bromelain enzyme as biocatalyst . Response surface methodology full factorial design was used to optimize three operating parameters for maximum recovery of silver . The result shows silver recovery increases with increase in protein concentration 5.4mg of pure silver can be recovered from 600mg of waste X rays film at most favourable condition of protein concentration 0.2857mg ml temperature 45C pH6.5 and stripping time 20min . At same optimised parameters papain biocatalyst shows 4.8mg and sodium hydroxide shows 5.2mg recovery of pure silver . The obtained silver powder having 91.12 purity and total silver recovered .

@highlight Silver metal is white soft transition element hold broad application.
@highlight Bromelain enzyme has greater efficiency as compared to papain and chemical catalyst.
@highlight Extraction process is fully depending on experimental condition and optimised with surface response methodology.
@highlight Optimization of experimental variable with surface response methodology.
@highlight Promising recovery of silver from x ray film can be achieved with biocatalyst.
