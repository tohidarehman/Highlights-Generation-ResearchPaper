 Erythromycin molecules are resistant in the environment due to the structure of its aromatic ring that makes it hard to remove or degradation . Nowadays the presence of ERY in water and wastewater has been reported are above the standard level in various researches . Therefore the removal and degradation of residues of ERY from wastewaters is important . The magnetic activated carbon is fabricated from Gogan almond shells and characterized and then applied to removal erythromycin from wastewater and water . Several techniques such as XRD SEM TEM Raman VSM TGA and BET were applied to characterize the adsorbent . Four important factors of sorbent weight contact time initial drug concentration and temperature were optimized by the Response Surface Methodology technique . The maximum adsorption of 95.125 is attained at the initial drug concentration of 65mgL

@highlight The removal of Erythromycin antibiotic by magnetic activated carbon is investigated
@highlight The Response Surface Methodology is conducted to optimize the variable factors
@highlight The CCD RSM optimized results indicated a maximum removal efficiency of 95 Erythromycin
@highlight Magnetic activated carbon is an efficient effective and reusable adsorbent for the Erythromycin removal
@highlight The Freundlich isotherm model show the best agreement with the experimental data
