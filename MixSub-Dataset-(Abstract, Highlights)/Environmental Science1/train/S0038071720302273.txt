 Microbial iron and sulfate reduction are the primary drivers of coastal acid sulfate soil passive bioremediation schemes . Microbial sulfate reduction is the limiting step for pyrite formation a desirable endpoint for CASS remediation . Little is known however about the impacts of microbial activity or species interaction on long term iron and sulfur cycling in CASS ecosystems . Using a combination of molecular biology geochemical speciation and artificial intelligence powered computational modelling we deduced from microbial activity patterns and geochemical measurements a best fit equation for predicting biogeochemical pyrite formation in a model CASS ecosystem . In addition to the time dependent activities of key sulfate reducing prokaryotic taxa e.g .

@highlight Coastal acid sulfate soil CASS is a global environmental issue.
@highlight Microbial activity can be modelled quantitatively to predict CASS remediation.
@highlight Sulfate reducing prokaryotes SRP play a key role in CASS remediation.
@highlight Predation on SRP with cultured representatives occurred during early wet up.
@highlight The above mechanism leads to increased activity among uncultured SRP.
