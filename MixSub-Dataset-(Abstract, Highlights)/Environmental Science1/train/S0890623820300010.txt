 Di phthalate is a known endocrine disruptor and diisononyl phthalate is a common DEHP replacement chemical . However little is known about late life consequences due to DEHP or DiNP exposure during adulthood . Thus this study tested the hypothesis that adult exposure to DEHP or DiNP affects female reproductive parameters during late life in female mice . Female CD 1 mice were dosed with either vehicle control DEHP or DiNP for 10 days and breeding trials were conducted at 12 and 15 months post dosing . Further ovaries and sera were collected at 12 15 and 18 months post dosing . DEHP and DiNP disrupted estrous cyclicity increased pregnancy loss decreased fertility altered the sex ratio of pups altered ovarian follicle populations and disrupted hormone levels . Collectively these data show that short term exposure to DEHP or DiNP during adulthood has long term consequences in late life .

@highlight DEHP and DiNP increased pregnancy loss one year following exposure.
@highlight DEHP and DiNP reduced overall fertility one year following exposure.
@highlight Preconception exposure to DEHP and DiNP alters sex ratio of pups.
@highlight DiNP alters ovarian follicle populations up to 18 months post dosing.
@highlight DEHP and DiNP alter hormone levels up to 18 months post dosing.
