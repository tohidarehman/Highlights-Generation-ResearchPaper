 Mesenchymal stem cells have unique potentials including migration and immunomodulation . Identification of the factors that enhance these activities can improve clinical applications of MSCs . This study aimed to investigate total antioxidant capacity and migration potential of mouse MSCs exposed to thymoquinone

@highlight TQ increases total antioxidant capacity of MSCs.
@highlight TQ may promote MSCs migration by activating c MET and CXCR4 signalling pathways.
@highlight TQ treated MSCs induce
@highlight  and
@highlight gene expression in mouse immune cells.
@highlight TQ treated MSCs reduce
@highlight and
@highlight gene expression in mouse immune cells.
@highlight TQ induces MSC immunogenicity by influencing
@highlight  and
@highlight gene expression.
