 Denitrification usually takes place under anoxic conditions and over short periods of time and depends on readily available nitrate and carbon sources . Variations in CO

@highlight Potential denitrification is closely related to water soluble OC in plant residues.
@highlight Amount of water soluble OC depends on the residue s chemical composition.
@highlight Chemical composition of water soluble OM controls the molar N
@highlight O N
@highlight  N CO
@highlight C ratio.
