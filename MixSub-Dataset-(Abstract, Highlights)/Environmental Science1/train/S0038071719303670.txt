 In agroecosystems efficient fertilizer use is key to optimizing productivity and reducing nutrient losses that can be detrimental for the environment such as nitrous oxide N

@highlight Nitrification and urease inhibitors affected N cycling genes transcripts.
@highlight This effect was small and transient mostly on denitrifiers and nitrifiers.
@highlight Inhibitors reduced the initial N
@highlight O peak and cumulative N
@highlight O emissions.
@highlight Inhibitors affected N
@highlight O emissions earlier than N cycling genes transcripts.
@highlight O emissions were lower when nitrite reducers were more abundant than N
@highlight O reducers.
