 Environmentally sound management ofplastic packaging wasteisan issue of concern around the worldbecause it causes potential threats to oceans and the environment upon disposal and mismanagement.This study examines the current efforts on recycling of the waste by extended producer responsibility in South Korea as well as other countries . Material flow analysis was performed on plastic packaging by life cycle . Based on the results in this study material footprint of common single use plastics by consumption was estimated to be on average 11.8kg or 638 disposable plastics per capita a year resulting in 32.6 billion disposable plastics and 603 000 ton of waste for disposal in South Korea . Approximately 3 million ton of plastic packaging waste from household waste streams in 2017 in South Korea was generated and treated by energy recovery with solid refuse fuels and heat recovery incineration without energy recovery material recycling and landfilling . Material recycling and recovery rates of plastic packaging waste from households were relatively low at 13.5 and 50.5 respectively . It was estimated that as much as 3.6 million ton of CO

@highlight About 3 million ton of plastic packaging waste was generated from households in 2017.
@highlight Material footprint of single use plastics consumption was estimated to be 638 units per capita a year.
@highlight A large fraction of the waste was incinerated by emitting greenhouse gasses.
@highlight The recycling of plastic packaging waste could reduce about 6.6 million ton of CO
