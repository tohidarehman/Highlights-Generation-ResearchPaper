 Currently the only methods for non genotoxic carcinogenic hazard assessment accepted by most regulatory authorities are lifetime carcinogenicity studies . However these involve the use of large numbers of animals and the relevance of their predictive power and results has been scientifically challenged . With increased availability of innovative test methods and enhanced understanding of carcinogenic processes it is believed that tumour formation can now be better predicted using mechanistic information . A workshop organised by the European Partnership on Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing brought together experts to discuss an alternative mechanism based approach for cancer risk assessment of agrochemicals . Data from a toolbox of test methods for detecting modes of action underlying non genotoxic carcinogenicity are combined with information from subchronic toxicity studies in a weight of evidence approach to identify carcinogenic potential of a test substance . The workshop included interactive sessions to discuss the approach using case studies . These showed that fine tuning is needed to build confidence in the proposed approach to ensure scientific correctness and to address different regulatory needs . This novel approach was considered realistic and its regulatory acceptance and implementation can be facilitated in the coming years through continued dialogue between all stakeholders and building confidence in alternative approaches .
