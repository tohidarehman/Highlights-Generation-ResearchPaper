 Foresters use diameter at breast height to estimate timber volumes quantify ecosystem services and predict other biometrics that would be difficult to directly measure . But DBH has numerous problems including a range of breast heights and challenges with applying this standard to divergent tree forms . Our study focuses on street trees that fork between 30 and 137cm of height which researchers have identified as particularly challenging in the ongoing development of urban allometric models as well as consistency in measurements across space and time . Using a mixed methods approach we surveyed 25 urban forestry practitioners in twelve cities in the northeastern United States about the measurement and management of multi stemmed street trees and intensively measured 569 trees of three frequently planted and commonly multi stemmed genera

@highlight Urban foresters address the challenge of multi stemmed DBH in a variety of ways.
@highlight Small statured trees are an increasing proportion of some street tree populations.
@highlight No multi stemmed DBH measurement method offers markedly superior predictive power.
@highlight There are substantial advantages to measuring multi stemmed trees below branching.
@highlight Two alternative techniquesD
