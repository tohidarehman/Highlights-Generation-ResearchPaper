 Modifications in soil fertility and microbiota structure driven by invasive plants can initiate a self promoting mechanism that facilitates their invasion process . This study aimed to resolve how the progression of invasion affects the chemical biochemical and microbial properties of soil using

@highlight Different invasion levels of
@highlight were simulated in pot trials.
@highlight Nutrients contents and enzyme activities increased with the higher invasion levels.
@highlight Invasion thresholds were identified for soil nitrogen organic matter and catalase.
@highlight Invasion levels affected some microbes related to nutrient cycling.
@highlight Positive plant soil feedback might be involved in the spread of weed
