 The home field advantage hypothesis predicts that plant litters decompose faster in the vicinity of the plant from which they are derived than away from home . Although we are aware that both litter quality and the efficiency of decomposers within soil communities are important drivers of HFA effects we know little on variation in HFA effects and underlying processes of these changes across years with varying climates . In order to address these questions we repeated four years with varying climates a reciprocal transplant experiment with four litter types crossing vegetation structure and soil fertility contrasts of both litter and ecosystems . We used the Decomposer Ability Regression Test for both types of years to search for evidence of HFA effects and conducted ANOVAs on the cross effects of vegetation structure and soil fertility contrasts to further identifying the underlying processes of changes in HFA across climates . HFA effects were only significant for the most recalcitrant litter of
