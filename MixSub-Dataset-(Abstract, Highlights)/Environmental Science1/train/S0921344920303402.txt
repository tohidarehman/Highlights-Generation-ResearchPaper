 This study examined the effects of product price increases on metal consumption greenhouse gas emissions and product sales via changes in the product replacement decisions of consumers . A dynamic discrete choice model was applied to air conditioners in Japan to determine these effects when product price is increased by from 5 to 30 in 5 increments . To illustrate a 5 increase in air conditioners was shown to reduce consumption of iron copper and aluminum by six one and two thousand tons respectively while increasing GHG emissions by 506 kt CO

@highlight Effects of product price rises on metal consumption GHG and sales are analyzed.
@highlight 5 price rise reduces iron copper and aluminum use by 6 1 and 2 thousand tons.
@highlight 5 price rise increases GHG by 506 KtCO
@highlight eq. and reduces sales by 56 billion JPY.
@highlight 30 price increase can reduce both metal consumption and GHG emissions.
@highlight Business models should be developed to overcome the resulting decrease in sales.
