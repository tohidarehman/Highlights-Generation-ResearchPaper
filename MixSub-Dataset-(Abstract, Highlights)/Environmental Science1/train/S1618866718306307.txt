 Despite being one of the largest and fastest growing cities of the world little is known about the urban forest of Karachi . The city consists of eighteen towns . Each town has different socioeconomic status . Therefore the present study investigates 1 the patterns and differences in the diversity and density of street tree communities across the towns of different socio economic status 2 the patterns and differences in the diversity and density of the communities of different road widths 3 the factors that cause variation in different attributes of the community . The study revealed significant variation in the diversity and density of the tree community of different towns and road categories . The socioeconomic status of towns and different road categories demonstrated statistically significant influence in determining their tree density and species diversity . Statistically significant correlation was found between socioeconomic status and tree density per thousand inhabitants of towns . The study divulges recurring planting of one or few species that decrease the species diversity in many towns and streets .

@highlight Monoculture planting is prevalent.
@highlight Affluent towns show greater tree density and species richness.
@highlight Wide Roads reveal higher density and diversity.
