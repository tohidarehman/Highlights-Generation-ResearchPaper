 Ecological classification has been proposed as a way to more tightly link microbial communities and ecosystem functions but few studies have attempted to relate ecological classifications of microbial communities with specific ecosystem functions . Here we conducted a 3 year experiment with nine levels of artificial precipitation in a typical semi arid steppe . The first five levels were considered a dry gradient and the last five were considered a wet gradient . Increases in precipitation under dry and wet gradients did not alter the alpha diversities of soil bacterial soil fungal or plant communities except that increases in precipitation under the dry gradient decreased bacterial alpha diversity . Increases in precipitation under the dry and wet gradients altered the composition of the soil bacterial community but did not alter the composition of the fungal or plant communities . Ecological clusters based on the relationships between the relative abundance of phylotypes and dry and wet gradients were correlated with soil C or N mineralization rates these ECs explained 1428 of the total variance in soil C and N mineralization rates . In contrast soil C or N mineralization rates were not correlated with the commonly measured properties of plant soil bacterial and soil fungal communities . Our findings indicate that the grouping of soil microorganisms into ECs based on responses to precipitation gradients can provide insights into the relationships between soil organisms and ecosystem functions .

@highlight Precipitation under dry and wet gradients did not alter alpha diversities of biotic communities.
@highlight Precipitation gradients only altered beta diversity of soil bacterial community but not for soil fungi or plant.
@highlight Commonly measured properties of biotic communities were not correlated with ecosystem functions.
@highlight Ecological clusters based on responses of soil microbial phylotypes to precipitation explain ecosystem functions.
