 This study aimed to assess the holistic impacts of climate change and irrigation management on food centric water energy land interlinkages in the Food Energy Water nexus specialized in agriculture . Accordingly we analyzed the trends and variation in productivity irrigation requirement and energy input for paddy rice production which is the representative crop in Korea from 1990 to 2099 with eight general circulation models as climate change scenarios . Results showed that the productivity of paddy rice would decrease owing to climate change and its variation would increase . Irrigation requirement under the MIROC ESM scenario was estimated as 849mm year

@highlight The interlinkages among food land water and energy in agriculture were affected by climate change and irrigation management.
@highlight We suggested the food energy water nexus specialized in agriculture with a case of paddy rice.
@highlight We assessed the impacts of intermittent and continuous irrigation on water energy and land footprints under various climate change scenarios.
@highlight We found the different trade offs between irrigation water saving and productivity by GCMs.
