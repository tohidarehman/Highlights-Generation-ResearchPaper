 Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi represent an important route for plant carbon inputs into the soil . Nonetheless the C input via AMF as well as its impact on soil organic matter stabilization and C sequestration remains largely unknown . A mycorrhizal wild type progenitor and its mycorrhiza defective mutant of tomato were continuously labeled with

@highlight Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi AMF reduced rhizosphere priming effect RPE .
@highlight N fertilization lowered the magnitude of RPE by decreasing enzymes.
@highlight The net rhizodeposition induced by AMF was dependent on N availability.
