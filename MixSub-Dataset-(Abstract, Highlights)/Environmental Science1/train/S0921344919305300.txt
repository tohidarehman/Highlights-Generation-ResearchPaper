 Waste printed circuit boards are a complicated and valuable fraction of electric and electronic waste . The recycling of them is critical to avoid environmental pollutions and to reuse resources . In particular the e waste import bans have been implemented in many traditional waste importing countries in recent years which is making the sustainable recycling essential and crucial for the advanced economies . In this study a sustainable approach using alkaline glycine solution for the extraction of copper from WPCBs and the leaching behaviour of other metals is presented . Various leaching parameters including initial pH glycine concentration solid content oxidant particle size temperature and time were investigated . A maximum Cu extraction of 96.5 was achieved with high co extraction of base metals . The extraction of BMs was dependent on the pH of leaching solution which was highly correlated with other variables . BMs extraction was largely influenced by glycine concentration and solid content while the sensitivity to H

@highlight Waste PCBs with most of electronic components were treated to 100 2mm.
