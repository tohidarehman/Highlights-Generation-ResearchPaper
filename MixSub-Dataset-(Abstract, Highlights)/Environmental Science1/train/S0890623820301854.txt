 Decidualization is essential for successful pregnancy in rodents and primates . Although L Tryptophan and its metabolites are essential for mammalian pregnancy the underlying mechanism is poorly defined . We explored effects of tryptophan and kynurenine on human in vitro decidualization in human endometrial stromal cell line and primary endometrial stromal cells . Tryptophan significantly stimulates the expression of prolactin and insulin growth factor binding protein 1 reliable markers for human decidualization . When stromal cells are treated with tryptophan tryptophan hydroxylase 1 remains unchanged but indoleamine 2 3 dioxygenase 1 is significantly increased suggesting tryptophan is mainly metabolized through kynurenine pathway . Kynurenine significantly stimulates insulin growth factor binding protein 1 expression . Aryl hydrocarbon receptor and its target genes are significantly increased by tryptophan and kynurenine . The induction of tryptophan and kynurenine on insulin growth factor binding protein 1 is abrogated by CH223191 an aryl hydrocarbon receptor inhibitor . Cytochrome P450 1A1 and P450 1B1 catalyze the oxidative metabolism of estradiol to catechol estrogens respectively . Insulin growth factor binding protein 1 is up regulated by 2 hydroxy estradiol and 4 hydroxy estradiol . Interferon significantly induces the expression of indoleamine 2 3 dioxygenase 1 aryl hydrocarbon receptor and insulin growth factor binding protein 1 . All the data are also verified in primary human stromal cells . Our data indicate that Interferon induced kynurenine pathway promotes human decidualization via aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling .
