 To reduce solid waste discharges into environment and virgin resource consumptions in construction waste seashells from seafood and aquaculture industry were recycled into powder form and reused in cementitious construction materials . This work aimed to use this biologically renewable waste material as a possible alternative to the nonrenewable limestone mineral used conventionally with Portland cement . The study explored roles of seashell powder as both a partial replacement and an additional additive to cement through evaluating the rheological and physico mechanical properties of early age cement paste . The cyclic rheological measurement including model analysis was conducted to reveal the time and shear dependent workability of fresh cement paste during the first 2h . Connecting to rheology physico mechanical measurements were carried out to understand hydration mechanisms of cement paste with seashell powder . Seashell powder was found to improve the rheological and early hydration behaviors of Portland cement paste . A parallel comparison between limestone and seashell powders was conducted to understand different roles of the two calcium carbonate minerals in cement system . Results from this study indicated the unique physical features and chemical reactivities of seashell powder in cement system and thus suggested a promising feasibility to recycle waste seashells with cementitious construction materials .
