 BIA 102474 carbamoyl 1H imidazol 4 yl pyridine 1 oxide is a novel fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor developed by BIAL for the treatment of medical conditions which would benefit from enhanced levels of endogenous anandamide such as pain disorders . During a Phase I clinical trial one subject died after receiving BIA 102474 and others displayed neurological signs . As part of series of papers presenting all the toxicology data available prior to the clinical trial we report here the nonclinical toxicology studies performed in cynomolgus monkeys .

@highlight During a Phase I clinical trial one subject died after receiving BIA 102474 and others displayed neurological signs.
@highlight Toxicology data in cynomolgus monkeys available prior to the clinical trial is reported.
@highlight Regulatory 4 and 13 week oral gavage studies followed by 2 or 4 week recovery periods respectively were performed.
@highlight Overall the results show that the toxicological potential of BIA 102474 is mainly characterized by functional effects.
@highlight These effects were generated by the pronounced pharmacological actions of this compound on the cannabinoid system.
