 The environmental performance of construction products and assemblies is a determinant factor for the environmental sustainability of buildings . Increasing willingness of stakeholders in the construction sector for green procurement better informed decisions and consideration of environmental aspects increase the need of transparent objective and independent information on the environmental performance of construction products . Environmental product declarations EPD based on the European standard EN 15804 are used in the construction sector since 2012 . In parallel since 2011 the European Commission EC has developed a common method for the assessment of the environmental performance of products the Product Environmental Footprint PEF . After a pilot phase the PEF method has evolved and some updates were published in early 2019 . The EN 15804 standard has also been revised and therefore it is the ideal time to seek the harmonization of Life Cycle Assessment LCA methods . This paper presents a pioneer study applied to the construction sector that focus on the comparison between the PEF method 2019 updated and the EPDs developed according to the Core rules for the product category of construction products presented in EN 15804 EN 15804 2012 A1 2013 recently updated by EN 15804 2012 A1 2013 A2 2019 .

@highlight PEF calculation and report method conflict with existing LCA standards.
@highlight The revision of EN 15804 intents to harmonized it with PEF.
@highlight Suggestions for the update of PEF converge with existing standards in some aspects.
@highlight After the update of PEF method and revision of EN 15804 there are still divergences.
