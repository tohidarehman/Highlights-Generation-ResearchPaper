 Alpine semi natural grasslands were formed by hundreds of years of traditional and extensive land use resulting in a distinct flora and fauna . Socio economic changes in the last century led to the abandonment of a large number of alpine pasturelands . Even though litter composition and quality will permanently alter due to shifts in plant species composition consequences of abandonment and the subsequent shrub encroachment on the feeding activities of decomposers are not well known .

@highlight Alpine earthworms and millipedes fed on high as well low quality litter.
@highlight Consumption rates and food selectivity varied greatly within and between species.
@highlight Low quality dwarf shrub litter was favoured in mixtures with grass and or forb.
@highlight Spectral analyses indicate differences in chemical composition of litter and faeces.
