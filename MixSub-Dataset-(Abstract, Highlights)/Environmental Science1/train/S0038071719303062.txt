@highlight Nitrogen fixing bacteria formed endophytic colonies in multiple boreal forest trees.
@highlight They enhanced the length and biomass of trees in a yearlong greenhouse trial.
@highlight They provided significant amounts of nitrogen to trees via biological nitrogen fixation.
@highlight Presence of
@highlight gene and nitrogenase enzyme required to fix nitrogen was confirmed.
@highlight These bacteria could be crucial to sustain tree growth on highly nitrogen poor soils.
