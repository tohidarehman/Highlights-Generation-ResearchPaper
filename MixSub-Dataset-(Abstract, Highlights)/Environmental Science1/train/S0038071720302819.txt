 The influence of temperature on mineralization of plant litter and pre existing soil organic matter involves not only the prevailing temperature but also how it has changed through time . However little is known about how temperature variability through time influences mineralization processes . Here we investigated how short term temperature history affects the mineralization of SOM and plant litter in soils from different agricultural management systems . We used soils from a long term experiment with conventional and organic management treatments to set up microcosms . The microcosms were exposed to eight days of contrasting temperature regimes . Microcosms were then returned to a common temperature of 16C

@highlight SOM and litter mineralization were both sensitive to short term temperature history.
@highlight History effects persisted for a week after temperature differences were removed.
@highlight Agricultural management did not alter mineralization or temperature history effects.
@highlight Litter mineralization indicated short term microbial acclimation to temperature.
