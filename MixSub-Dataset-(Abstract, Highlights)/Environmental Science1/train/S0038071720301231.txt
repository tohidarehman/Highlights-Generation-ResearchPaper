 A substantial portion of grassland photosynthates is allocated belowground to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi but controversy remains about whether this carbon contributes to soil organic carbon under warming . The goal of this study was to investigate how AMF biomass and C sequestered by AMF C

@highlight AMF biomass PLFA 16.15 did not decline at warming up to 16C above ambient.
@highlight About 107gC m
@highlight was sequestered by AMF over a period of three years.
@highlight Turnover of AMF biomass and necromass was 3675 days and 1.40.2 yr
@highlight respectively.
