 Technological development has led to increasing quantities of waste electrical and electronic equipment . At the same time the search for more efficient uses of energy is an urgent current issue . Both problems have relations to LED bulbs . The presence of hazardous and valuable materials in these bulbs makes their recycling essential . However due to the many different parts that compose an LED bulb the separation of LEDs from the bulbs is difficult but is crucial for proper recycling . This work describes a recycling process for LED bulbs solely using mechanical processing . Firstly the LED bulbs were dismantled and their components were characterized in terms of their weight and by DSC and SEM EDS analyses . Then operations including comminution sieving electrostatic separation magnetic separation and gravity separation were applied to separate the LED bulb components according to their characteristics . The operations were adapted in order to achieve the maximum possible separation of the components . A mechanical processing flowchart was proposed for LED bulb recycling . Characterization of LED bulbs revealed the presence of polymers and valuable and or hazardous materials including copper silver and lead . The results showed separation efficiencies in the range 98 100 for many components . A simplified economic analysis of the recycling process showed it to be feasible with estimated profit of US 639.82 ton of processed LED bulbs . The results indicated that the proposed mechanical processing was highly effective for the recovery of materials at high purity from LED bulbs .
