 This article provides a comprehensive and cross disciplinary overview of the phosphorus cycle through the wastewater and agri food system . While mineral phosphorus stocks are finite the use of mined phosphorus is accompanied with many losses leading to pollution of water bodies . Recovering phosphorus from human excreta can contribute to more efficient use of phosphorus to ensure its availability for food production in the future . Phosphorous can be recovered through different recovery technologies and consequently used in agriculture via different recycling routes . Each recycling route has its own particularities in terms of interactions with technologies actors and the environment to bring the recovered phosphorus back into agriculture . In this literature review we adopt a socio ecological technical approach to map three phosphorus recycling routes via municipal sewage sludge struvite recovered from municipal wastewater and source separated urine . We firstly show that improvements are still needed in all three routes for achieving high P recovery efficiency and a combination of these recycling routes are needed to achieve maximum recovery of phosphorus . Second we identify key issues for each recycling route that currently limit the use of recovered phosphorus in agriculture . We indicate where interaction between disciplines is needed to improve recycling routes and identify gaps in research on how recovered phosphorus accesses agriculture .

@highlight This article provides a cross disciplinary overview of the recycled phosphorus cycle.
@highlight Making P recovery work requires integration of the social ecological and technical sciences.
@highlight A socio ecological technical approach nuances the recycling potential of excreted P.
@highlight Recycling routes should be complementary to optimally replace mineral P with excreta.
