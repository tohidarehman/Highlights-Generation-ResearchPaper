 Fipronil is a phenylpyrazole insecticide used for the control of a variety of pest for domestic veterinary and agricultural uses . Fipronil exposure is associated to thyroid disruption in the rat . It increases thyroid hormone hepatic clearance . The effect on thyroxine clearance is about four fold higher than the effect on T4 plasma concentrations suggesting that the thyroid gland might develop compensatory mechanisms . The aim of this study was to document the potential effects of fipronil treatment on the thyroid transcriptome together with its effects on TSH and TH blood levels under well characterized internal exposure to fipronil and its main metabolite fipronil sulfone .

@highlight Fipronil decreases thyroid hormone plasma concentrations in the rat.
@highlight It modifies the transcriptomic thyroid profile.
@highlight It increases thyroglobulin expression and tends to increase Sodium Iodine symporter genes.
@highlight It modifies the thyroid expression of genes involved in cellular dynamic.
@highlight Results suggest non TSH dependent mechanisms related to thyroid hyperplasia.
