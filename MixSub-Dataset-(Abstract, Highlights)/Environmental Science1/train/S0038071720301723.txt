 Forest soils represent important terrestrial carbon pools where C is primarily fixed in plant biomass and then is incorporated in the biomass of fungi and bacteria . Although classical concepts assume that fungi are the main decomposers of the recalcitrant organic matter within plant and microbial biomass whereas bacteria are considered to mostly utilize simpler compounds recent studies have shown that fungi and bacteria overlap in substrate utilization . Here we studied the microbial contribution to the recycling of dead biomass by analyzing the bacterial and fungal communities in soil microcosms supplemented with

@highlight Both fungi and bacteria actively degrade complex plant and microbial biomass.
@highlight The pool of CAZymes was distinct in fungi and bacteria.
@highlight Fungal communities encode more specific CAZymes that degrade plant biomass.
@highlight Bacterial communities are richer in CAZymes that target microbial biomass.
@highlight Bacteria use structurally variable but complementary enzymatic systems.
