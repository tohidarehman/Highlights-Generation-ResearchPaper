 Non ferrous metallurgy slags are currently do not reach their full valorization potential . On a global scale these slags are landfilled or used in low value applications . Upcycling these slags to produce a sustainable cementitious binder e.g . inorganic polymers does not only substitute the vast CO

@highlight Non ferrous metallurgy slags show potential to be upcycled in construction materials.
@highlight Lower FeO CaO SiO
@highlight molar ratio in the slag resulted in higher 2 d strength.
@highlight Higher CaO content resulted in higher strength increases from 2 to 28 d.
@highlight The activating solution influences the kinetics and early age strengths.
@highlight At 28 d the optimum slag had compressive strength like CEM I 52.5 i.e. 53 MPa.
