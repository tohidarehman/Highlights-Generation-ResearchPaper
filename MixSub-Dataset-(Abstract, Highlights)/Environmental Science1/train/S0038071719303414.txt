 Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia is one of the three processes of soil nitrate reduction . However relationships between DNRA microbes and nutrient fertilization are poorly known . We studied the DNRA microbial community in a Ferralic Cambisol containing plots including control without fertilization swine manure fertilization chemical fertilization and chemical manure combined fertilization treatments . The abundance of DNRA microbes represented by the
