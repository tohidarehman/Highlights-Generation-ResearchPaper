 Urban parks are of great importance for residents health and well being . As two main factors influencing park visits distance to parks and park size have been studied and adopted in practice such as park planning and guidelines . This study aims to examine how travel distance and park size associated with park visits and how these effects may vary across different types of park visits in Beijing China . We conducted a city wide survey in 78 neighborhoods and interviewed 7362 residents on their park visit behaviors . Constraint line analysis Pearson correlation analysis and significant differences analysis were employed . We found that travel distance had an exponential limiting effect on park visits . The maximum park visits dropped exponentially as the travel distance to parks increased . No such effect was observed for park size . Visitors to nearby medium distance and distant parks varied significantly in terms of park visit frequency travel mode time spent in parks and activity . Their destination parks also differed in size vegetation cover and whether water body is present . Furthermore we identified four cut off points based on the constraint line functions as the accessible and maximum travel distance regarding different travel modes and visit frequencies of park visits . Our findings provided empirical evidence on the association among travel distance park size and visits which have important implications for future park studies and planning .

@highlight The maximum park visits decreased exponentially as the travel distance to parks increased.
@highlight Larger parks received more visits only if travel distance was taken into account.
@highlight The effects of travel distance on park visits varied across different visit types.
@highlight For people walking to parks over 50 of them chose parks within 1km.
@highlight For people visiting parks daily over 95 of them chose parks within 5km.
