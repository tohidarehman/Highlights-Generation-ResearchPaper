 Remote sensing optical sensors onboard operational satellites can not have high spectral spatial and temporal resolutions simultaneously . In addition clouds and aerosols can adversely affect the signal contaminating the land surface observations . We present a HIghly Scalable Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model algorithm to combine multispectral images of different sensors to reduce noise and produce monthly gap free high resolution observations over land . Our approach uses images from the Landsat and the MODIS missions both from Terra and Aqua platforms . We implement a bias aware Kalman filter method in the Google Earth Engine platform to obtain fused images at the Landsat spatial resolution . The added bias correction in the Kalman filter estimates accounts for the fact that both model and observation errors are temporally auto correlated and may have a non zero mean . This approach also enables reliable estimation of the uncertainty associated with the final reflectance estimates allowing for error propagation analyses in higher level remote sensing products . Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated products through comparison with other state of the art methods confirm the validity of the approach and open the door to operational applications at enhanced spatio temporal resolutions at broad continental scales .
