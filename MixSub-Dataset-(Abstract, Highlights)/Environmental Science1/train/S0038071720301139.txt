 Recently an increasing number of studies use ecoenzymatic stoichiometry for determining nutritional status or nutrient limitations of microbes . According to the ecoenzymatic stoichiometry theory the ratios of 1 4 glucosidase and 1 4 N acetylglucosaminidase or BG and NAG leucine aminopeptidase reflect microbial carbon vs nitrogen limitation with larger ratios indicating C limitation . However several studies reported that the ratios did not reflect the C vs N limitations . In this paper I propose a new conceptual model to distinguish when BG NAG reflects microbial C vs N limitation and when not If cellulose is a predominant C source BG NAG reflects the C vs N limitation as the enzymatic stoichiometry theory suggests while if chitin peptidoglycan and protein are dominant C sources C vs N limitation can not be determined by BG NAG .

@highlight I challenged the ecoenzymatic stoichiometry hypothesis.
@highlight BG NAG LAP ratio does not always reflect microbial C vs N limitation.
@highlight The ratio reflects C vs N limitation only when cellulose is the predominant C source.
