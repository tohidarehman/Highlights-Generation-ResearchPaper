 Human skin is a common pathway through which chemicals in our environment enter the body . To aid with risk management of environmental chemicals the US EPA utilizes mathematical models to estimate percutaneous penetration when experimental data is not available . Here the accuracy of predicted flux by the Potts and Guy model based on in vitro penetration is compared to human in vivo data of percutaneous absorption of various organic compounds . For most chemicals the flux was over or underestimated by a factor 10100 . In vitro flux was significantly correlated to experimental human in vivo flux however the physiochemical parameters used in the Potts and Guy equation Kp Koctanol and molecular weight did not correlate significantly with in vivo flux . We discuss possible explanations for why the computer model did not accurately predict in vivo flux . Further research is needed with different types of chemicals encountered in the environment and or as used in clinical practice . This manuscript discusses limitations to the mathematical models currently used and why the models should be further refined for use .

@highlight We compared the predicted percutaneous penetration of organic compounds based on in vitro data to human in vivo data.
@highlight There are significant differences in predicting penetration from the in vitro based model to the in vivo data.
@highlight We propose possible explanations for these differences between the in vitro based model and in vivo data.
