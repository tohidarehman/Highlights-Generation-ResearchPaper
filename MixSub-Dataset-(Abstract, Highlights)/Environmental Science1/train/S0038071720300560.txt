 Bacteria and archaea play important roles in soil biogeochemical cycles and the health of terrestrial organisms . They usually coexist in various soil habitats however the ecological patterns of bacteria and archaea in the same soil habitats still remain unclear . Here we compared the community features of the two domains in bulk soils under different vegetation covers . Generally both bacterial abundance and

@highlight Soil bacteria and archaea showed contrasting ecological patterns in this study.
@highlight Agricultural and non agricultural soils had distinct microbial community structures.
@highlight Archaeal community showed more distribution limitations than bacteria.
@highlight Similar edaphic factors but with distinct effects on the two domains were observed.
@highlight Both bacteria and archaea had key positions in microbial co occurrence networks.
