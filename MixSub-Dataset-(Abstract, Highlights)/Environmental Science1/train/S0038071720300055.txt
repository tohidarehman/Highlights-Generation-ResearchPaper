 Increasing atmospheric nitrogen deposition has substantially affected carbon and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems . However the responses of different soil organic carbon fractions with different turnover rates to N addition are highly divergent and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive . In this study we explored the responses of surface soil characteristics and microbial communities to six years of experimental N addition 0 50 100 and 150kgN ha

@highlight N addition did not change plant inputs soil enzyme activity and total SOC.
@highlight N addition reduced soil pH microbial biomass carbon and exchangeable Ca
@highlight N addition increased POC due to suppression of microbial biomass and decomposition.
@highlight N addition decreased MAOC because of weaker mineral sorption of microbial necromass and products.
