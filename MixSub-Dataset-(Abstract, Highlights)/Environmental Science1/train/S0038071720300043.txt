 It is not clear how soil organic carbon and its related microbial processes respond to climate warming in subtropical forest which limits our ability to predict the response and feedback of such forests to future warming . Here we translocated a forest microcosm from a high elevation site to a low elevation site in a subtropical forest to study the responses of SOC fractions microbial communities and enzyme activities to increases in soil temperature . Results showed that translocation to a warmer region significantly decreased the total SOC content by an average of 21.1 after three years of soil warming . Warming non significantly decreased the particulate organic C and microbial C content by 15.7 and 15.2 respectively and increased the light fraction organic C and dissolved organic C content by 15.5 and 2.3 respectively . By contrast warming significantly decreased the 53m fraction organic C and heavy fraction organic C content . Warming significantly decreased the relative abundance of total bacteria G

@highlight Climate warming enhanced mineral associated organic C decompaction.
@highlight Warming reduced bacterial biomass and shifted microbial community composition.
@highlight Warming increased the relative abundance of fungi and the ratio of fungi to bacteria.
@highlight Warming increased oxidase and mass specific oxidase activities.
