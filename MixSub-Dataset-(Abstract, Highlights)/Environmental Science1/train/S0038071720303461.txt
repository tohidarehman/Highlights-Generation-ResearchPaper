 Biogeochemical weathering of bedrock is the most important input of silicon and phosphorus to forest ecosystems . While soil microbes and in particular P solubilizing bacteria are known to accelerate the solubilization of Si and P from silicate rocks our understanding of the mechanisms driving biogenic weathering are still limited . To fill this gap incubation experiments with weathered parent materials of four soils and water extracts of the four soils differing in P stocks were conducted . We found that the net Si solubilization rate ranged from 5.0 to 91.0 nmol m

@highlight Microbes increased silicate weathering by a factor of up to 32.
@highlight Net Si solubilization was positively related to organic acids and negatively to pH.
@highlight Gross P solubilization rates were much higher in the P rich than in the P poor soil.
@highlight The abundance of P solubilizing bacteria was higher in the P poor than P rich soils.
