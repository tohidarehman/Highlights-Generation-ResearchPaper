 There is a current concern that the capacity of urban forests to recover from the effects of climate change may be diminishing . New management options are needed so that they can continue to provide ecosystem services to local communities . After a windstorm occurred on June 2014 pre and post disturbance stand conditions of the historical old growth holm oak forest of Parco Gussone were analysed by combining ground and satellite based methodologies . Results highlighted that Parco Gussone was primarily valued for its historical importance and despite the phytosanitary conditions of the trees no silvicultural treatments were made since 1986 most probably due to conflicts arisen between different stakeholders . Therefore in 2014 the windstorm damaged 406 trees and it was stand replacing on 1.53ha . Windthrows heterogeneously distributed and unequally sized 103 canopy gap ranging between 6 to 1632m

@highlight Capacity of urban woodlands to recover to storm damages needs to be considered.
@highlight Extreme windstorms in the Mediterranean basin might affect historical urban forests.
@highlight Forest Ecosystem Services might decline due to conflicts between stakeholders.
@highlight Management options of historical urban forests need to be carefully tailored.
@highlight Resilience of historical old growth urban forests could be restored and improved.
