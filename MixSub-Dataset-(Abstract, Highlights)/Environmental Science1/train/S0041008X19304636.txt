 Vanillin is a natural compound endowed with antioxidant and anti mutagenic properties . We previously identified the vanillin derivative VND3207 with strong radio protective and antioxidant effects and found that VND3207 confers survival benefit and protection against radiation induced intestinal injury in mice . We also observed that VND3207 treatment enhanced the expression level of the catalytic subunit of the DNA dependent protein kinase in human lymphoblastoid cells with or without irradiation . DNA PKcs is a critical component of DNA double strand break repair pathway and also regulates mitotic progression by stabilizing spindle formation and preventing mitotic catastrophe in response to DNA damage . In the present study we found that VND3207 protected intestinal epithelial cells

@highlight VND3207 promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in HIEC cells post IR.
@highlight VND3207 promotes DNA PKcs activity increasing autophosphorylation at S2056 site.
@highlight VND3207 reduces DNA DSBs and mitotic catastrophe after IR by activating DNA PKcs.
@highlight The activation of DNA PKcs is essential for the protective effect of VND3207 on RIII.
