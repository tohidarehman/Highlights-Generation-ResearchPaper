 The ISO standard 13571 estimates the time to the compromised tenability of people in enclosed fires . This is understood as the time which must be available for the structural design to pass an evacuation or an escape paradigm for the evacuation of burning buildings . As with all emergency response planning values such once in a lifetime events can not readily be validated side by side . Consequently risk assessors must refer to animal based reference data fitting the scenario of concern closely . The analysis detailed in this paper used the concentrationtime matrix of point of departures from rats acutely exposed to carbon monoxide which is amongst the most abundant toxic fire gases . The objective of the analysis was to clarify whether the time and effect adjusted nonlethal threshold concentration LCt
