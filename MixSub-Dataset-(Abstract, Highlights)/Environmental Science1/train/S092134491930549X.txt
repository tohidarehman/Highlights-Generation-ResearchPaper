 To assess the environmental and economic impacts of reusable and disposable blood pressure cuffs . Out patient clinic and ambulatory procedure rooms and five day in patient regular ward and intensive care unit health care encounters . Environmental modeling using life cycle assessment was employed to estimate greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts from cuff manufacturing packaging transportation use cleaning and landfill or incineration waste management . Cuff cleaning and packaging materials were identified and weighed directly . Both per encounter and per day low level disinfection scenarios were performed . Life cycle costs were determined with hospital data including procurement labor and waste disposal . For all use and cleaning scenarios the reusable cuff was environmentally preferable in terms of GHG emissions and other impact categories in some cases by a factor of 40 . Disposable cuff emissions are dominated by materials manufacturing while reusable cuff emissions are dominated by production of disinfection wipes . Reusable cuffs are far cheaper than disposables in the out patient settings . Disposable cuffs are slightly lower cost in the in patient setting where reusable BP cuffs are shared among patients and therefore require frequent cleaning . However reusable cuffs are also more economical in the in patient settings when patients have dedicated personal equipment Life cycle assessment and costing highlight environmental and financial trade offs between manufacturing and cleaning when comparing reusable and disposable BP cuffs .

@highlight Life cycle assessment is useful to compare pollution and costs of reusable and disposable BP cuffs.
@highlight Reusable BP cuffs are environmentally preferable to disposables in some cases by a factor of 40.
@highlight Reusable BP cuffs are more economical than disposable cuffs when dedicated to a patient.
