 Artificial impervious areas are predominant indicators of human settlements . Timely accurate and frequent information on artificial impervious areas is critical to understanding the process of urbanization and land use cover change as well as of their impacts on the environment and biodiversity . Despite their importance there still lack annual maps of high resolution Global Artificial Impervious Areas with longer than 30 year records due to the high demand of high performance computation and the lack of effective mapping algorithms . In this paper we mapped annual GAIA from 1985 to 2018 using the full archive of 30 m resolution Landsat images on the Google Earth Engine platform . With ancillary datasets including the nighttime light data and the Sentinel 1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data we improved the performance of our previously developed algorithm in arid areas . We evaluated the GAIA data for 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 and the mean overall accuracy is higher than 90 . A cross product comparison indicates the GAIA data are the only dataset spanning over 30 years . The temporal trend in GAIA agrees well with other datasets at the local regional and global scales . Our results indicate that the GAIA reached 797 076km

@highlight We improved the performance of Exclusion Inclusion approach in arid regions.
@highlight We mapped global artificial impervious areas GAIA with Google Earth Engine.
@highlight The mean overall accuracy over multiple years is higher than 90 .
@highlight GAIA reached 797 076km
@highlight by 2018 more than 2.5 times that of 1990.
@highlight The top five countries are China US India Russia and Brazil.
