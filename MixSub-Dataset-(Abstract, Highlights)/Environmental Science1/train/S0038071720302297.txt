 Peatlands store a significant carbon pool but global warming promotes growth of woody plants which may affect the C balance of peatlands . As shrubs and trees form symbioses with mycorrhizal fungi which are potentially effective decomposers of recalcitrant organic matter suitable tools to measure fungal biomass necromass and turnover rates are needed . Here we present a method optimized for studying chitin a marker of living and dead fungal mass in peatland ecosystems . Optimizations include enhancement of purification steps which enabled measurements of chitin concentration from both peat and from mycorrhizal mycelia in ingrowth bags with quartz sand . Adjustments proposed here will enable studying the role of fungi in peatland ecosystems .
