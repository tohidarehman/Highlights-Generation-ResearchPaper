 Forest aboveground biomass is a key variable in remote sensing based forest monitoring . Active sensor systems such as lidar can generate detailed canopy height products . Relationships between canopy height and biomass are commonly established via regression analysis using information from ground truth plots . In this way many site specific height biomass relationships have been proposed in the literature and applied for mapping in regional contexts . However such relationships are only valid within the specific forest type for which they were calibrated . A generalized relationship would facilitate biomass estimation across forest types and regions . In this study a combination of lidar derived and ancillary structural descriptors is proposed as an approach for generalization between forest types . Each descriptor is supposed to quantify a different aspect of forest structure i.e . mean canopy height maximum canopy height maximum stand density vertical heterogeneity and wood density . Airborne discrete return lidar data covering 194ha of forest inventory plots from five different sites including temperate and tropical forests from Africa Europe North Central and South America was used . Biomass predictions using the best general model nRMSE 12.4 R

@highlight Structural metrics to generalize forest biomass estimation from lidar are proposed.
@highlight The regression analysis included five megaplots from tropical and temperate sites.
@highlight The new approach performed almost as well as site specific estimation models.
@highlight The roles of metrics describing vertical and horizontal structure are analyzed.
