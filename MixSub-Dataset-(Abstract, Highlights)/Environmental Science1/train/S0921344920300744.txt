 Substantial losses of nitrogen and phosphorus to the environment occur during food production . These emissions of reactive N and P have adverse effects on the environment . The life cycle emissions of Nr and P due to resource consumption can be quantified using N and P footprints . In this study a common framework developed for the purpose of making comparisons was used to examine the food N and P footprints of China India and Japan from 1961 to 2013 . The footprints increased significantly in China after 1976 5.419.3kg Ncapita

@highlight Food N and P footprints of China India and Japan from 1961 to 2013 are compared.
@highlight To compare the six footprints a common methodological framework was developed.
@highlight The footprints were 5.428.3kg Ncapita

@highlight The Jp Ch case extended globally would result in global footprints 1889 larger.
@highlight The N footprint tends to be more sensitive to meat milk oil crops and fish.
