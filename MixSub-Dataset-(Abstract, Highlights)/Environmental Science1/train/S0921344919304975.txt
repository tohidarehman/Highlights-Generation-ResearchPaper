 Millions of tonnes of plastic waste are traded around the world every year which plays an important role in partially substituting virgin plastics as a source of raw materials in plastic product manufacturing . In this paper global plastic waste trade networks from 1988 to 2017 are established using the UN Comtrade database . The spatiotemporal evolution of the GPWTNs is analyzed . Attention is given to the country ranks inter and intra continental trade flows and geo visual communities in the GPWTNs . We also evaluate the direct and indirect impacts of Chinas plastic waste import ban on the GPWTNs . The results show that the GPWTNs have small world and scale free properties and a core periphery structure . The geography of the plastic waste trade is structured by Asia as the dominant importer and North America and Europe as the largest sources of plastic waste . China is the unrivaled colossus in the global plastic waste trade . After Chinas import ban the plastic waste trade flows have been largely redirected to Southeast Asian countries . Compared with import countries export countries are more important for the robustness of GPWTNs . Clearly developed countries will not announce bans on plastic waste exports these countries have strong motivation to continue to shift plastic waste to poorer countries . However the import bans from developing countries will compel developed countries to build new disposal facilities and deal with their plastic waste domestically .
