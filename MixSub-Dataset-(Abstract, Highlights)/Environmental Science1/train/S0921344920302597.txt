 In a transition country such as Serbia where the basic principles of waste management have not been fully achieved yet the management of biodegradable waste will undergo significant changes due to the rigorous conditions of the intended EU membership . Implementing the requested changes will also affect the flow of Phosphorus which is non renewable essential and with no substitute . In order to be able to develop a resource strategy a comprehensive analysis of all relevant BW flows and the P contained therein was conducted . In addition a combination of material flow analysis and substance flow analysis was used which has been proven as an effective method for decision making in resource management . The results of the study show that agricultural residues which account for the largest share of BW generated and are one of the largest contributors to P emissions have the largest potential for resource optimization . Sludge from wastewater treatment plants currently share 3 of the overall BW flow and 0.3 of P flow . The sludge is currently not utilized but represents a flow that the quantity will increase significantly due to the increased capacity and complexity of the planned future wastewater treatment . Total BW and P stock in landfills are low . In general the flows of BW and P are largely linear in Serbia resources are wasted and improvement of BW and P management has a great potential to improve environmental quality and contribute to EUs requirements .

@highlight Infrastructure for BW management in Serbia is on a very low level.
@highlight BW and P flows are evaluated with MFA SFA tool.
@highlight The most important BW and P flow both around 90 are agricultural residues.
@highlight In Serbia sludge from WWTPs currently share 0.3 of P flow but the quantity will increase.
@highlight P flows in BW management system are linear.
