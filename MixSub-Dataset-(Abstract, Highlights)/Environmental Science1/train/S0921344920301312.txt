 Centralized waste plastic recycling is economically challenging yet distributed recycling and additive manufacturing provides consumers with direct economic incentives to recycle . This study explores the technical pathways for DRAM of complex polymer composites using a case study of windshield wiper blades . These blades are a thermoplastic composite made up of a soft and hard material . The distributed manufacturing methods included mechanical grinding to fused granular fabrication heated syringe printing 3 D printed molds coupled to injection molding and filament production in a recyclebot to fused filament fabrication . The particle size angle of repose thermal and rheological properties are characterized for the two sub materials to define the conditions for the extrusion . A successful pathway for fabricating new products was found and the mechanical properties of the resultant components were quantified . Finally the means to convert scrap windshield wiper blades into useful high value bespoke biomedical products of fingertip grips for hand prosthetics was demonstrated . This study showed that the DRAM model of materials recycling can be used to improve the variety of solutions for a circular economy .
