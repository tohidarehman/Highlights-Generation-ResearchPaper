 This study investigated nickel and cobalt ion release from the metals and several alloys in synthetic gastric as well as interstitial and lysosomal lung fluids . Results were used to calculate the relative bioaccessible concentrations of the metals . Nickel release from SS 316L powder in gastric fluid was 300 fold lower than from a simple mixture of powders of the same bulk composition . Gastric bioaccessibility data showed 50 fold higher metal releases per gram of sample from powder than massive forms . RBCs of nickel and cobalt in the alloy powders were lower equal or higher in all fluids tested than their bulk concentrations . This illustrates the fact that matrix effects can increase or decrease the metal ion release depending on the metal ingredients alloy type and fluid consistent with research by others . Acute inhalation toxicity studies with cobalt containing alloy powders showed that the RBC of cobalt in interstitial lung fluid predicted acute toxicity better than bulk concentration . This example indicates that the RBC of a metal in an alloy may estimate the concentration of bioavailable metals better than the bulk concentration and the approach may provide a means to refine the classification of alloys for several human health endpoints .

@highlight toxicity are not accurately predicted by bulk metal concentration.
@highlight Co alloy acute inhalation toxicity correlates better with Co release in interstitial lung fluid than bulk concentration.
@highlight Relative Bioaccessible Concentration calculation of metals in alloys uses bioelution data from alloy and reference samples.
@highlight Relative Bioaccessible Concentration may be higher or lower than bulk concentration.
@highlight Relative Bioaccessible Concentration of metals in alloys can be used in weight of evidence to refine alloy classification.
