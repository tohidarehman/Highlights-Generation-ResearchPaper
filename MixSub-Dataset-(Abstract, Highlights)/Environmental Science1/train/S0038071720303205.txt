 Bacteria and fungi representing two major soil microorganism groups play an important role in global nutrient biogeochemistry . Biogeographic patterns of bacterial and fungal biomass are of fundamental importance for mechanistically understanding nutrient cycling . We synthesized 1323 data points of phospholipid fatty acid derived fungal biomass C bacterial biomass C and fungi bacteria ratio in topsoil spanning 11 major biomes . The FBC BBC and F B ratio display clear biogeographic patterns along latitude and environmental gradients including mean annual temperature mean annual precipitation net primary productivity root C density soil temperature soil moisture and edaphic factors . At the biome level tundra has the highest FBC and BBC densities at 3684 mg kg

@highlight Fungal and bacterial biomass distribution showed clear biogeographical patterns.
@highlight Biomass of fungi and bacteria and their ratio are controlled by different factors.
@highlight Global biomass carbon budget is 12 PgC for fungi and 4 PgC for bacteria in topsoil.
