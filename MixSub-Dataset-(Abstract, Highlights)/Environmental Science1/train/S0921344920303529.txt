 Three dimensional printing or additive manufacturing is regarded as an environmentally friendly and sustainable form of manufacturing which allows circular manufacturing as the 3D printed waste and products can be recycled for further 3DP operations . Due to the fact that the reclaimed material is commonly perceived to have poorer quality than the virgin material the pricing of materials and printed products are crucial for consumers to decide their printing and material selection decisions . We consider a closed loop competitive circular supply chain comprising a 3DP platform that provides 3DP services to print products from virgin and recycled materials material suppliers that provide virgin and recycled materials for the platform and end users who use the platform to print their products . We derive the prices demands and profits of the 3DP platform and material suppliers in Stackelberg equilibrium . We also conduct numerical studies using real life data to generate practical insights from the analytical findings . Most interestingly we find that while the platform prefers both types of suppliers avoid printing high quality products from recycled material . We derive management insights and policy implications from the analytical and numerical findings for the closed loop competitive circular supply chain .

@highlight Optimal pricing strategy for 3D printing platforms and material suppliers in a closed loop circular supply chain.
@highlight Two types of 3DP materials are considered virgin versus recycled material.
@highlight While the platform prefers both types of suppliers avoid printing high quality products from recycled material.
@highlight We derive policy implications that can lead to a resource balance within the closed loop circular supply chain.
