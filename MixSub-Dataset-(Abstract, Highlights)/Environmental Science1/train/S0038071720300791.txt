 Although studies examining changes in the structure and diversity of microbial communities in biological soil crusts have increased microbial interactions in BSCs are not currently fully understood . In this study we applied a random matrix theory based network approach to construct bacterial fungal and bacteria fungal interaction networks for the four developmental stages of BSCs in the Mu Us Sandy Land northwestern China . Our results showed that

@highlight The keystone microbial taxa change with biological soil crust development.
@highlight Microbial networks become more complex with biological soil crust development.
@highlight With biological soil crust development more competitions of bacteria than fungi.
@highlight Environmental factors constraint microbial interactions of biological soil crusts.
@highlight Network analysis is an effective method for studying microbial interactions.
