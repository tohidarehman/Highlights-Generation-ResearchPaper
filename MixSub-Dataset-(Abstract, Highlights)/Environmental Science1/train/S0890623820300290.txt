 Endocrine disruption continues to be a matter of high concern and a subject of intensive activities at the public political regulatory and academic levels . Currently available regulatory test guidelines relevant to the identification of endocrine disrupters are largely limited to estrogen androgen thyroid and steroidogenesis pathways . Thus there is an increasing interest and need to develop test methods biomarkers and Adverse Outcome Pathways for identification and evaluation of endocrine disrupters in addition to the EATS pathways . An activity focusing on the retinoid system has been jointly initiated by the Swedish Chemicals Agency and the European Commission . The retinoid system is involved in fundamental life processes and has been described in previous work at the OECD as a system susceptible to environmental endocrine disruption the disruption of which could contribute to the increasing incidence of certain disorders in humans and wildlife populations .

@highlight Endocrine disruption is a complex and important toxicological problem to consider.
@highlight The retinoid system is evolutionary conserved and central for endocrine regulation.
@highlight Regulatory tests are missing for assessing the retinoid system at any life stage.
@highlight Ongoing work by OECD member states will identify knowledge gaps and testing needs.
