 Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract include a broad group of birth defects . Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals is suspected to be one of the risk factors for CAKUT and the use of personal care products is a source of EDC exposure . Therefore this study aimed to investigate the relationship between CAKUT and the use of PCPs in a large birth cohort study .

@highlight Data from a large birth cohort study in Japan were analyzed.
@highlight Any association between CAKUT and exposure to EDCs was explored.
@highlight Use of personal care products was used as the marker of EDCs exposure.
@highlight The rate of CAKUT was seen to be 2.5 per 1000 live births.
@highlight No association between CAKUT and use of personal care products was seen.
