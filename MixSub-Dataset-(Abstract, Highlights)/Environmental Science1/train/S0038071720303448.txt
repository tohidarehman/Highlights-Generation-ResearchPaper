 Afforestation results in a wide range of soil resources with carbon nitrogen and phosphorus levels that rarely meet microbial elemental demands . Such stoichiometric imbalances result in the limitation of microbial activity by nutrients and have consequences for microbial C and nutrient use efficiency and ultimately the fate of soil C. However how microorganisms cope with stoichiometric imbalances following afforestation and how their responses regulate microbial driven C emissions remain unclear . We compared sites along a 42 year

@highlight Afforestation lowered stoichiometric imbalances and increased soil enzyme activity.
@highlight Afforesting farmland deregulated microbial C limitation but increased P limitation.
@highlight Soil bacteria was more sensitive to the C N P stoichiometric imbalances than fungi.
@highlight Forestation reduced microbial threshold elemental ratios raising C use efficiency.
@highlight Increased microbial C use efficiency and biomass turnover time reduced respiration.
