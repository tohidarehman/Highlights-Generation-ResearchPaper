 The rhizosphere priming effect which occurs in the presence of growing plant roots may either stimulate or reduce the decomposition of soil organic matter . The carbon and nitrogen cycling in forest soils could be more rapid or slower due to the RPE depending on the tree species and their growing conditions . Norway spruce

@highlight Rhizosphere priming effect from coniferous trees depends on light intensity.
@highlight Pine roots induced negative priming while spruce roots induced positive priming.
@highlight N availability rather than the root exudation rate regulated the priming effect.
@highlight At low N concentrations plant microbial competition suppressed SOM decomposition.
@highlight Roots stimulated gross N mineralization at high N but suppressed it at low N.
