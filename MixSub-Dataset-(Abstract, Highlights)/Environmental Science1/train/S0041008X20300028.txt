 Our previous report on pharmacokinetic evaluation of 6 2 fluorotelomer alcohol examined the biopersistence potential of its metabolites based on data published from single inhalation and occupational 6 2 FTOH exposure studies . We calculated internal exposure estimates of three key metabolites of 6 2 FTOH of which 5 3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid had the highest internal exposure and the slowest clearance . No oral repeated 6 2 FTOH exposure data were available at the time to fully characterize the biopersistence potential of the metabolite 5 3 acid . We recently received additional data on 6 2 FTOH and 5 3 acid which included a 90 day toxicokinetic study report on repeated oral 6 2 FTOH exposure to rats . We reviewed the study and analyzed the reported 5 3 acid concentrations in plasma liver and fat using one compartment PK modeling and calculated elimination rate constants k

@highlight 6 2 FTOH based PFAS used as greaseproofing agents for paper and paperboard.
@highlight First characterization of biopersistence of 5 3 acid after 6 2 FTOH exposure.
@highlight Times to steady state of 5 3 acid in plasma fat and liver of rats about 1year.
@highlight Impact on future toxicology studies extend 6 2 FTOH testing to at least 1year.
