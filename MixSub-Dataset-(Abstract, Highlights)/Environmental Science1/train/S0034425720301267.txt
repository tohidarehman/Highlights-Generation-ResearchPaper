 Climatology errors often cause large differences between soil moisture products . However relatively little work has been done to objectively evaluate soil moisture mean seasonal cycle information acquired from different sources . This study evaluates surface SMCs obtained from four land surface models two C X band and two L band remote sensing products using 5 dense networks and 75 sparse in situ soil moisture measurement sites located within the contiguous United States . Results show that relative to older C X band products derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS newer L band products derived from the Soil Moisture Ocean and Salinity mission provide more accurate SMC estimates . In fact the latest SMOS INRA CESBIO product provides SMC intra seasonal variability and dynamic range information that is 334 and 237 more accurate respectively than all four LSM based SMCs examined here . Hence SMC validation against SMOS IC SMC results may improve LSMs ability to accurately capture SMC characteristics and the common strategy of scaling remote sensing SMC information to match LSM SMC estimates is likely sub optimal for assimilating L band soil moisture retrievals . Although the SMOS IC product has made significant progresses towards retrieving absolute soil moisture values a temporally constant dry bias is found in SMOS IC surface SMCs over all land cover types . Addressing this bias should be a priority for future generations of SMOS retrieval algorithms .
