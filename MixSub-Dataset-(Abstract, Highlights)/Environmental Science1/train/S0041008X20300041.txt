 Metabolomics is a powerful tool for studying physiological state of the system . In this study we proposed a single injection targeted metabolomics method to identify reliable tripterygium glycosides efficacy and toxicity related biomarkers based on ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry . Through careful optimization of the UHPLC MS MS conditions a total of 289 metabolites can be quantified in single injection of 27min using both positive and negative scanning modes with rapid polarity switching . Tripterygium glycosides is widely used in clinical for its excellent anti inflammatory and immunosuppressive functions . However it is the most common drug that can cause hepatotoxicity . In this study the established metabolomics method was used for determination of biomarkers to reflect tripterygium glycosides efficacy and toxicity . Two different dosages were designed in the animal experiment including therapeutic dosage and toxic dosage . Statistical analysis based on metabolite concentrations showed that the glutathione metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism were the obvious interfering pathways . This was highly consistent with previous studies . A total of 22 and 47 metabolites were screened as potential biomarkers related to the efficacy and hepatotoxicity of tripterygium glycosides respectively . Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that ten metabolites including cytosine 5 methyluridine deoxyuridine 5 methylcytidine deoxycytidine triphosphate keto glutarate

@highlight A single injection targeted metabolomics method was developed based on UHPLC MS MS.
@highlight Cytosine and dihydrofolate were biomarkers of tripterygium glycosides efficacy
@highlight DCTP and other 8 metabolites were biomarkers of tripterygium glycosides toxicity.
@highlight Biomarkers found here were more sensitive than traditional liver function indexes.
