 Bornova metropolitan district is one of the most urbanised districts in Izmir metropolitan city Turkey with unknown e ects on the potential ecosystem services along urban rural areas . This study mapped the condition of ecosystem services potential and analysed their spatiotemporal dynamics and patterns between 1990 and 2018 for Bornova district . The methodology used in this study was based on an existing potential ecosystem services mapping methodology and spatially explicit index using open access available spatial data . The spatiotemporal changes in the potential ecosystem services along the urban rural gradient of Bornova district were assessed by global climate regulation microclimate mitigation and ecological integrity . The total vegetation cover in Bornova district increased from 18.41 to 27.95 to the last 28 years particularly in peri urban areas . Accordingly two of the selected ecosystem services potential has increased throughout the district except for ecological integrity . These changes were closely related to the deliberate efforts of the Bornova Municipal Council in increasing the amount of urban green and open spaces throughout the Bornova district in coordination with Izmir Metropolitan City Councils commitment to build a healthy and climate friendly city in the near future .

@highlight Strong relationships found between land cover pattern intensity and ecosystem services.
@highlight Spatially explicit maps highlight the multiple ecosystem service supply deficit areas.
@highlight The method is easy to replicate and can be applied to larger areas.
