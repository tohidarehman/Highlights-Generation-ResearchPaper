 Bismuth is a natural element present in the environmental media . Bismuth has been used medicinally for centuries specifically for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders . Although bismuth toxicity is rare in humans an outbreak of bismuth induced neurotoxicity was reported in France and Australia in the mid 1970s . The primary source of bismuth exposure in the general population is via food . US FDA estimated recommended daily intake for bismuth as 848mg bismuth day for GI tract disorders . Exposures to bismuth can be quantified by measuring concentrations in blood and urine . Biomonitoring equivalents were derived based on US FDA s RDI as a tool for interpretation of population level biomonitoring data . A regression between steady state plasma concentrations and oral intakes was used to derive plasma BEs . A whole blood plasma partitioning coefficient of 0.6 was used to convert plasma BE into whole blood BE . A mass balance equation with a urinary excretion fraction of 0.0003 was used to derive urinary BE . The BE values associated with US FDA s RDI for plasma whole blood and urine were 8.0 4.8 and 0.18g L respectively . These BE values together with bismuth biomonitoring data may be used in screening and prioritization of health risk assessment of bismuth in the general population .

@highlight Food represents the main source of bismuth intake in the general population.
@highlight Bismuth is also found in certain medications.
@highlight Prolonged intake of high doses of bismuth could lead to neurotoxicity.
@highlight Current publication describes derivation of blood and urine biomonitoring equivalents BEs for bismuth.
@highlight Derived BEs can be used as screening tools for interpreting population biomonitoring data for bismuth.
