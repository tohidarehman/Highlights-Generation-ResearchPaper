 Pristimerin a triterpenoid has exhibited potential anti inflammatory and anti tumor activities . Nevertheless the role and mechanism of pristimerin in intestinal inflammation and colon cancer require further investigation . Here we found that pristimerin protected mice from dextran sulfate sodium induced colitis restoring epithelial damage and reducing tissue inflammation and inflammatory cell infiltration . In addition pristimerin dramatically reduced the number and size of the tumors in a azoxymethane DSS induced colitis associated colorectal cancer model . Furthermore we found that pristimerin suppressed Wnt catenin signaling by RNA Seq . Pristimerin inhibited Wnt catenin signaling
