 Long term additions of lime and or phosphate fertilizer caused an indirect and or direct increase in the availability of P in mixed mesophytic deciduous forest soil on the unglaciated portion of the Allegheny Plateau southeast Ohio USA . As expected the activities of extracellular phosphatases declined across all treatments in both organic and mineral soil horizons . In contrast there were few effects of P availability on either C or N acquiring extracellular enzyme activities . However enzyme vector analysis showed the relative activity of phosphatases decreased with respect to N acquiring enzymes and the relative activity of C acquisition increased relative to the activities of both N and P acquiring enzymes . Thus the overall ecoenzymatic stoichiometry of extracellular enzymes was altered by P availability . Also the relative contribution of phosphodiesterase declined relative to phosphomonoesterase by an average of 1616 as overall phosphatase activity declined suggesting a reduction in the relative contribution of the less efficient enzyme as P demand decreased . Finally contrary to expectations the relative contribution of leucine aminopeptidase to total N acquiring enzyme activity did not increase with pH but showed a bimodal relationship to soil NH

@highlight Increasing soil pH and or inorganic phosphorus alters ecoenzymatic stoichiometry.
@highlight Phosphatase activities declined relative to N and C acquiring enzyme activities.
@highlight Increased P availability favored more efficient forms of phosphatase activity.
