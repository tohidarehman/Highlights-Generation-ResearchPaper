 Biomonitoring equivalents have been increasingly applied for biomonitoring purposes by regulatory bodies worldwide . The present report describes the development of a BE for titanium based on a 4 step process identification of a critical study point of departure supporting an established oral exposure guidance value review the available oral PK data and application of a pharmacokinetic model for titanium selection of the most appropriate biomarker of exposure in a specific tissue and calculation of steady state tissue levels corresponding to the PoD in the critical study and derivation of BE value adjusting for the uncertainties considered in the original OEGV assessment . Using the above 4 step approach a blood BE value of 32.5g titanium L was derived . Key components of the analysis included a pharmacokinetic model developed by investigators at the Netherlands National Institute of Public Health and a two year rodent bioassay of titanium conducted by the US National Cancer Institute . The most sensitive pharmacokinetic parameter involved in the current BE derivation is the oral absorption factor of 0.02 . The provisional BE proposed in this article may be updated as new information on the pharmacokinetics of titanium becomes available .

@highlight Titanium Ti as titanium dioxide is widely permitted by regulatory authorities for use as a food color additive.
@highlight Food represents the main source of titanium intake in the general population.
@highlight Food grade titanium particles occur primarily in non nano form and exist as aggregates.
@highlight Absorption of orally ingested titanium is very low and more than 97 of ingested titanium is eliminated through feces.
@highlight Biomonitoring equivalent BE values derived here are useful screening tools for evaluation of biomonitoring data on Ti.
