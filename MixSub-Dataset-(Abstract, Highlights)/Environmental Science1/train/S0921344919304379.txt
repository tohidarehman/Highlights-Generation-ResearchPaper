 Recent research and initiatives increasingly propose a new approach based on distributed plastic recycling for open source 3D printing technologies as a way to deal with the issue of plastic waste and to support the development of the circular economy . Distributed recycling can be thought of as a sort of smart grid composed of small and coordinated recycling units . However the operational complexity of this distributed approach limits its application . Furthermore the environmental and economic advantages have yet to be demonstrated . This article therefore explores the economic and environmental feasibility of this distributed plastic recycling approach from a logistics perspective as a step towards its validation . To achieve this an optimization mixed integer linear programming model was used as an evaluation tool representing a local closed loop supply chain network . The proposed model is illustrated using a case study of a university seeking to implement a distributed recycling demonstrator in order to recover 3D printing wastes from secondary schools in the northeast of France . Following this step a sensitivity analysis was carried out considering the market variations and the amount of available plastic waste derived from the schools . The results obtained show positive economic and environmental benefits of carrying out this new method of plastic recycling . This work serves as a basis for continuing to explore the feasibility and replication of the distributed plastic recycling network in other contexts .
