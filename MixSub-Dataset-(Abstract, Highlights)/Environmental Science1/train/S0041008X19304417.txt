 One of the main problems for the development of pulmonary formulations is the low availability of approved excipients . Polyglycerol esters of fatty acids are promising molecules for acting as excipient for formulation development and drug delivery to the lung . However their biocompatibility in the deep lung has not been studied so far . Main exposed cells include alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages . Due to the poor water solubility of PGFAs the exposure of alveolar macrophages is expected to be much higher than that of epithelial cells . In this study two PGFAs and their mixture were tested regarding cytotoxicity to epithelial cells and cytotoxicity and functional impairment of macrophages . Cytotoxicity was assessed by dehydrogenase activity and lactate dehydrogenase release . Lysosome function phospholipid accumulation phagocytosis nitric oxide production and cytokine release were used to evaluate macrophage function . Cytotoxicity was increased with the increased polarity of PGFA molecules . At concentrations above 1mg ml accumulation in lysosomes impairment of phagocytosis secretion of nitric oxide and increased release of cytokines were noted . The investigated PGFAs in concentrations up to 1mg ml can be considered as uncritical and are promising for advanced pulmonary delivery of high powder doses and drug targeting to alveolar macrophages .

@highlight Polyglycerol esters of fatty acids PGFA are promising as pulmonary excipient.
@highlight No toxicity of PGFAs on alveolar epithelial cells was observed.
@highlight Increased polarity of PGFA molecules caused increased macrophage cytotoxicity.
@highlight Slightly decreased phagocytosis was observed after exposure to 1mg ml of PGFAs.
@highlight PGFA concentrations 1mg ml may be used uncritically for drug delivery to the lung.
