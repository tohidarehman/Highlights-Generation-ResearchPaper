 The increase of waste from electric and electronic equipment has pushed the research towards the development of high sustainability treatments for their exploitation . The end of life printed circuit boards represent one of the most significant waste in this class . The interest for these scraps is due to the high Cu and Zn content with concentrations around 25 and 2 respectively combined with further precious metals . Currently the most common approaches developed for PCBs recycling include pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical treatments . On the other hand biohydrometallurgical strategies are gaining increasing prominence for the possibility to decrease both the environmental and the economic costs . Nevertheless these techniques show the main limit due to the possibility to treat low quantities of waste which makes unsustainable the further scale up . To overcome this criticality the present paper introduces an innovative bioleaching process carried out by

@highlight This work shows an innovative biotechnology for Cu and Zn extraction from PCBs.
@highlight PCBs concentration is relatively high without effect on bacteria metabolism.
@highlight The highest metal extraction efficiency is 94 for Cu and 70 for Zn.
@highlight The environmental impact is lower than state of the art hydrometallurgy.
