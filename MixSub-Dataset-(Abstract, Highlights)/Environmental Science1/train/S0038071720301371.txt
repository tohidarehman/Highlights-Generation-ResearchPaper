 Iron hydroxides serve as an efficient rusty sink promoting the stabilization of rhizodeposits into soil organic carbon . Our work aimed to understand the physicochemical and microbial mechanisms promoting rhizodeposit stabilization as influenced by goethite or nitrogen using

@highlight  FeOOH is a rusty sink for rhizodeposited C Rhizo C via Fe bound complexes FeOM stimulating aggregate formation.
@highlight Rhizo C mineralization and rhizosphere priming decreased in soil amended with FeOOH.
@highlight The rhizosphere microbial community was modulated by changed edaphic variables by FeOOH e.g. rhizo C availability .
@highlight Stabilization of rhizo C in aggregates and FeOM were associated with Actinobacteria and Basidiomycota.
