 Recently industrial parks have played a vital role for economic development in many countries . Enterprises in industrial park benefit from shared infrastructure services energy and resources etal . however the use or storage of large quantities of dangerous substances possess threat to human health and surrounding environment . Hence the management and control of environmental risk are crucial to industrial parks especially chemical industrial parks . Up to now there aren t any specific standard methods or guidelines for industrial park environmental risk assessment . Various qualitative and quantitative methods have been developed and adopted by researchers in literature . The purpose of this study is to summarize current approaches for industrial park ERA . As the identification of environmental risk source is the first and crucial step affecting the results of ERA significantly firstly we introduced the approaches for risk sources identification . Then we classified the risk characterization approaches based on their theories including analytic hierarchy process based method catastrophe progression method fuzzy mathematics based methods environmental risk field based method etc . and summarized their principles and applications . Through the comparison of the advantages and limitations of these approaches the future research trend for industrial park ERA is forecasted to help to manage and control environmental risk effectively .

@highlight Methods for identification of environmental risk sources were summarized.
@highlight Various qualitative and quantitative methods to characterize environmental risk of industrial park were summarized.
@highlight The advantages and disadvantages of ERA approaches were compared.
