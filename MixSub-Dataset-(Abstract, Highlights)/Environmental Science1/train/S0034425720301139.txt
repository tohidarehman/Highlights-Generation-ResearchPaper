 Change detection between images is a procedure used in many applications of remote sensing data . Among these applications the identification of damaged infrastructures in urban areas due to a large scale disaster is a task that is crucial for distributing relief quantifying losses and rescue purposes . A crucial consideration for change detection is that the images must be co registered precisely to avoid errors resulting from misalignments . An essential consideration is that some large magnitude earthquakes produce very complex distortions of the ground surface therefore a pair of images recorded before and after a particular earthquake can not be co registered accurately . In this study we intend to identify changes between images that are not co registered . The proposed procedure is based on the use of phase correlation which shows different patterns in changed and non changed areas . A careful study of the properties of phase correlation suggests that it is robust against misalignments between images . However previous studies showed that in areas with no changes the signal power in the phase correlation is not concentrated in a single component but rather in several components . Thus we study the performance of the
