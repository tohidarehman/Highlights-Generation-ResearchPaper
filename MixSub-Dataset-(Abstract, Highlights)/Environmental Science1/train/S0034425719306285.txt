 Sentinel 1 mission with its wide spatial coverage short revisit time and rapid data dissemination opened new perspectives for large scale interferometric synthetic aperture radar analysis . However the spatiotemporal changes in troposphere limits the accuracy of InSAR measurements for operational deformation monitoring at a wide scale . Due to the coarse node spacing of the tropospheric models like ERA Interim and other external data like Global Navigation Satellite System the interpolation techniques are not able to well replicate the localized and turbulent tropospheric effects . In this study we propose a new technique based on machine learning Gaussian processes regression approach using the combination of small baseline interferograms and GNSS derived zenith total delay values to mitigate phase delay caused by troposphere in interferometric observations . By applying the ML technique over 12 Sentinel 1 images acquired between MayOctober 2016 along a track over Norway the root mean square error reduces on average by 83 compared to 50 reduction obtained by using ERA Interim model .
