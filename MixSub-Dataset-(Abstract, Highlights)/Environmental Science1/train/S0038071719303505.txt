 Soil microbial communities play an essential role in driving multiple functions that are central to the global biogeochemical cycles . Long term fertilization has been reported to reduce the soil microbial diversity however the impact of fertilization on multifunctionality and its relationship with soil microbial diversity remains poorly understood . We used amplicon sequencing and high throughput quantitative PCR array to characterize the microbial community compositions and 70 functional genes in a long term experimental field station with multiple inorganic and organic fertilization treatments . Compared with inorganic fertilization the application of organic fertilizer improved the soil multifunctionality which positively correlated with the both bacterial and fungal diversity . Random Forest regression analysis indicated that rare microbial taxa rather than the dominant taxa were the major drivers of multifunctionality suggesting that rare taxa had an over proportional role in biological processes . Therefore preserving the diversity of soil microbial communities especially the rare microbial taxa could be crucial to the sustainable provision of ecosystem functions in the future .

@highlight Inorganic fertilization decreased soil multifunctionality.
@highlight Organic fertilization increased microbial diversity and multifunctionality.
@highlight Rare microbial taxa had an over proportional role in multifunctionality.
