 Despite the importance of plant litter decomposition for ecosystem nutrient cycling and soil fertility it is still largely unknown how this biogeochemical process is affected by different forms of nitrogen . Numerous studies have investigated the effects of exogenous N addition on leaf litter decomposition while the response of decomposing roots and their microbial communities to externally applied N is rarely studied . Fine roots however represent a key input to soil organic matter and understanding their decomposition under elevated atmospheric N deposition is important for predicting soil carbon dynamics in response to changes in climatic conditions . In this study we decomposed fine roots of five dominant grassland species for two years in field plots fertilized with different forms of N in a typical temperate grassland in Inner Mongolia . Ammonium nitrate was selected as inorganic N while urea and glycine were chosen as organic N . Equal amounts of N 10gNm

@highlight Response of root decomposition to different forms of N fertilization were studied.
@highlight All forms of N addition stimulated fine root decay rates.
@highlight Mixed N fertilization mostly promoted decomposition rates.
@highlight The effect of N addition on decomposition is not related with substrate lignin.
@highlight We can not ignore organic N when simulating N deposition research.
