 Changes in the isotopic composition of oxygen associated with phosphate can provide information on the impact of phosphatase activity on soil P dynamics whereas the use of radioactive P delivers information on P fluxes within soil systems . Although these two tracers may provide complementary data they have rarely been used together to study soil P cycling . We conducted a dual isotopic soil incubation study of one month with soils originating from four sites of a climatic gradient which provides well controlled geochemical and biological variations on soils derived from the same parent material . Three groups of soils were incubated in parallel the first group labelled with

@highlight Dual labelling with
@highlight P and
@highlight O provides complementary insights on soil P cycling.
@highlight P use revealed large amounts of P isotopically exchangeable with the resin P pool.
@highlight P use allowed quantification of the small fraction of P immobilized by microorganisms.
@highlight O was incorporated in microbial and resin P suggesting P turnover between them.
@highlight O incorporation was most pronounced at the most biologically active site 4.
