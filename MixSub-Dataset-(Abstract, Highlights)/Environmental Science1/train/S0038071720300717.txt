 Biotic interactions in the soil food web have been increasingly recognized as crucial for ecosystem functioning however there are still knowledge gaps in terms of the associations between macrofauna and microorganisms particularly in soil hotspot microsites . A manipulative study was performed to investigate the protist community in the drilosphere and casts of three earthworm species epigeic

@highlight Parasitic protist in drilosphere and cast was higher than in earthworm free soil.
@highlight Protist community composition depended on earthworm species and microsite type.
@highlight Protist communities were affected by pH and nutrient availability in drilosphere.
@highlight Earthworm feeding and elevated water content determined protist community in cast.
