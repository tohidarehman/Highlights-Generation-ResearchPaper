 Nitrogen mustard is a cytotoxic vesicant known to cause acute lung injury which progresses to fibrosis . Herein we developed a murine model of NM induced pulmonary toxicity with the goal of assessing inflammatory mechanisms of injury . C57BL 6J mice were euthanized 128 d following intratracheal exposure to NM or PBS control . NM caused progressive alveolar epithelial thickening perivascular inflammation bronchiolar epithelial hyperplasia interstitial fibroplasia and fibrosis peaking 14 d post exposure . Enlarged foamy macrophages were also observed in the lung 14 d post NM along with increased numbers of microparticles in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid . Following NM exposure rapid and prolonged increases in BAL cells protein total phospholipids and surfactant protein D were also detected . Flow cytometric analysis showed that CD11b

@highlight NM mustard causes acute lung injury and fibrosis in mice.
@highlight Toxicity involves inflammation oxidative stress and altered lung function.
@highlight Proinflammatory and profibrotic macrophages accumulate in the lung after NM.
@highlight NM causes activation of macrophage subsets implicated in pulmonary toxicity.
