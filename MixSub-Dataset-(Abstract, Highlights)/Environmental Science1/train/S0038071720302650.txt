 Microbial carbon use efficiency is defined as the portion of carbon incorporated into biomass relative to the total carbon consumed and plays a pivotal role in regulating microbially mediated C and nutrient transformations in soil . However little is understood about how CUE is impacted by edaphic properties like soil moisture . Soil moisture physically regulates microbial activity through its effects on both water potential and water content . Low water potential can result in high compensatory intracellular solute concentrations that may inhibit biochemical functions through cytoplasmic desiccation whereas low soil water content results in thin water films that can limit substrate diffusion reducing microbial access to dissolved substrates . Because these two aspects of soil moisture may affect microbial respiration differently than C assimilation they may have different effects on CUE . The purpose of this research was to evaluate the relative importance of water potential and water content in regulating CUE of soil microbial communities . Moist soil incubations of a sandy loam soil were used to determine the impact of both aspects of soil moisture on CUE and soil slurries were used to determine the impact of water potential alone . Both

@highlight Mechanistic effects of soil moisture on CUE evaluated.
@highlight Water content regulated CUE in a sandy loam soil.
@highlight No effect of water potential per se on CUE in a sandy loam soil.
@highlight Water content alone may be a sufficient predictor of microbial activity.
