 Currently Australian e waste management system under the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme consider television computer and IT peripheral products and MobileMuster only considers mobile phones . A large proportion of E waste from other categories is still unregulated . This study aims to estimate e waste generation from this unregulated e waste stream by a Weibull distribution based sales stock lifespan model from 2010 to 2030 . A total of sixteen unregulated products were selected for the estimation . The results of this study show that Australia will generate 342kilo tonnes of the e waste in 2020 which is predicted to grow to 461kt in 2030 with an annual increase rate of around 3.7 from the 16 unregulated electrical and electronic equipment . Home laundry appliances air treatment products refrigeration appliances large cooking appliances and heating appliances are the critical items that account for more than 70 of the total e waste generation . Base metals such as Fe Cu and Al will have a sharp increase by the year 2030 accounting 234.27kt 31.19kt 13.93kt respectively from the estimated e waste quantities . Electronics products will be a significant source of precious and rare earth elements . By 2030 the estimated economic value of the metals will vary in between 2.744.60 billion US . This study provides suggestion to policymakers in decision making for the future collection and recycling of e waste in Australia .

@highlight E waste generation of 16 unregulated products from 2010 to 2030 was estimated.
@highlight The annual growth rate of unregulated e waste will be around 3.7 .
@highlight By weight over 70 of the e waste will be from electrical appliances in Australia.
@highlight Fe Cu and Al amount was estimated to be 234.27kt 31.19kt 13.93kt by 2030.
@highlight Aggregated economic values of the material will be 2.744.60 billion US by 2030.
