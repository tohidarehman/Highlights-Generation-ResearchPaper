 In 2019 the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment initiated a review of the carcinogenic hazard potential of acetaminophen including an assessment of the long term rodent carcinogenicity and tumor initiation promotion studies . The objective of the analysis herein was to inform this review process with a weight of evidence assessment of these studies and an assessment of the relevance of these models to humans . In most of the 14 studies there were no increases in the incidences of tumors in any organ system . In the few studies in which an increase in tumor incidence was observed there were factors such as absence of a dose response and a rodent specific tumor supporting that these findings are not relevant to human hazard identification . In addition we performed qualitative analysis and quantitative simulations of the exposures to acetaminophen and its metabolites and its toxicity profile the data support that the rodent models are toxicologically relevant to humans . The preclinical carcinogenicity results are consistent with the broader weight of evidence assessment and evaluations of multiple international health authorities supporting that acetaminophen is not a carcinogenic hazard .

@highlight A weight of evidence assessment of long term rodent carcinogenicity and tumor initiation promotion studies was performed.
@highlight No increases in tumor incidence were observed or responses were not relevant to human hazard identification.
@highlight Qualitative assessment and quantitative simulations confirm relevance of rodent model data to humans.
@highlight Results demonstrate that acetaminophen is not a carcinogenicity hazard.
