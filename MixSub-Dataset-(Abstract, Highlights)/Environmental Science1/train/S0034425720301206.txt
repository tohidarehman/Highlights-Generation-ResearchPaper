 There is limited research focusing on Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar applications in the Great Lakes coastal wetlands with large water level fluctuations . In this study we investigated the potential of using C band SAR data to characterize marsh wetland and monitor water level changes along the coast of the Great Lakes . InSAR analysis was conducted using Radarsat 2 and Sentinel 1 data collected at Long Point Ontario Canada over the period of 20162018 . Observations indicated that both backscattering coefficients and coherence from tall plants short plants and water varied with different sensor modes in response to changes in phenology disturbance and water level . InSAR phase changes were closely related to fluctuations in water level and flow direction . We evaluated InSAR time series observations using measurements from water level loggers based on correlation and root mean square error . It was found that correlation between InSAR measurements and water level changes in the field varied depending on the site type of wetland vegetation incidence angle and polarization . Although results from some sensor modes provided good correlation at a few locations the low fringe rate and RMSE between 9 and 28cm indicated that InSAR observations of water level changes were generally underestimated .

@highlight Utility of C band InSAR is confirmed for monitoring water level in the Great Lakes.
@highlight SAR images are sensitive to marsh vegetation phenology and manmade changes.
@highlight Correlation between InSAR and field water level measurements varies in marsh.
@highlight High coherence is consistent in cattail and Phragmites dominated marsh areas.
@highlight C band InSAR interferogram is saturated in high water level changes.
