 Pectin is a fermentable soluble fiber that can be used as a thickener in formulas for infants and young children . The Joint FAO WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives concluded that pectin is not of concern for inclusion in infant formula at up to 0.2 . As part of the safety assessment of the suitability of pectin for young infants we conducted a 3 week dietary study in a neonatal pig model to 1 investigate the impact of pectin at different doses on neonatal pigs growth and 2 explore the potential explanation for the dose response . Male and female neonatal pigs were fed milk replacer containing 0 0.2 or 1 pectin beginning on postnatal day 2 for 21 days . Body weight feed intake and apparent ileal digestibility of dry matter crude protein and energy were reduced in pigs fed diets containing 1 pectin

@highlight Neonatal pigs were fed 0 0.2 or 1 pectin in milk replacer for 21 days.
@highlight Pigs fed 1 pectin demonstrated reduced growth and nutrient digestibility.
@highlight Pigs fed 0.2 demonstrated adequate growth and typical nutrient digestibility.
@highlight Pectin in milk replacer at 0.2 was safe well tolerated and did not result in adverse health effects.
