 Experimental data of all 143 organic pigments registered with the European Chemicals Agency of which 88 were listed in a nanomaterial inventory was retrieved from the registered substance fact sheets . Availability of the data was 93 for solubility 82 for bacterial mutagenicity 79 for acute oral toxicity 75 for irritation 59 for skin sensitisation 36 for repeated dose toxicity and 34 for each clastogenicity and mutagenicity in mammalian cells and 23 for toxicity to reproduction . Pigments mostly had a water and octanol solubility of significantly below 0.1mg L but fourteen were found to be of higher solubility . None were irritating to skin and eyes . Except for the metal salt and the naphthol pigments none of the insoluble pigments showed adverse effects up to limit doses indicating that poor solubility prevents systemic uptake of toxicologically relevant amounts . The few available toxicokinetic data shows absence of metabolism or significant uptake and is in support of this . Occasional effects observed on bacterial mutagenicity and skin sensitisation are attributed to impurities . There is no indication that for organic pigments other particle characteristics such as surface area or morphology have an impact on the investigated toxicological endpoints .

@highlight REACH substance fact sheets of insoluble organic pigments consistently showed no adverse effects in toxicity tests.
@highlight Not all of the 143 organic pigments were insoluble in water and octanol.
@highlight Organic pigments are considered as inert if they are insoluble in water octanol and stable in gastric acid and solvents.
@highlight Effects of impurities were detected in the Ames test and the skin sensitisation tests.
@highlight Differences in particle properties are not determining for the outcome of the investigated endpoints.
