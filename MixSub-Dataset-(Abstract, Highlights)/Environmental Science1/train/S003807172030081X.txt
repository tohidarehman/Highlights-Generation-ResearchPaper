 Natural forest regeneration on abandoned agricultural land is an increasingly common but understudied landcover change in the tropics . We studied whether observed changes in microbial community composition with forest regeneration led to changes in functional potential . We used GeoChip 3.0 to measure microbial functional potential for carbon nitrogen phosphorous and sulfur cycling genes in pastures early successional and late successional forests in Puerto Rico . We found lower abundance and diversity of genes involved in C N and P in late successional forests compared to other landcover types . Soil microbial communities were functionally similar in active pastures and early successional forests . Our results suggest microbial functional potential varies with forest age with potential implications for tropical biogeochemistry .

@highlight Microbial potential for C N and P cycling was lowest in late successional forests.
@highlight Microbial potential for S cycling was similar between forests.
@highlight Pastures and early successional forests were functionally similar.
