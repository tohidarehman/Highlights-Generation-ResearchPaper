 Failure of a tie in point in tree climbing can have severe consequences yet few studies have quantified the loads borne by and load bearing capacity of TIPs . In two separate experiments loads borne by the TIP during abrupt stops while a climber descended and simulated climber falls were quantified for a variety of TIPs rope types and rope lengths . Peak load ratios up to 10.6 were recorded a potentially dangerous value with respect to both TIP failure and personal injury . Peak load ratios decreased as the length of rope between the TIP and the location of the simulated fall increased and when trees were in leaf . Minimizing the potential fall distance during ascents is the surest way to reduce the likelihood of TIP failure and personal injury .

@highlight Two experiments demonstrated the effect of relevant parameters on loads during climbing and simulated climber falls.
@highlight Maximum loads were 4.3 times the climbers weight for an abrupt stop during a descent and 10.6 times the weight dropped to simulate a falling climber.
@highlight The magnitude of loads particularly when dropping a mass to simulate a falling climber were dangerously high and could cause failure of the tie in point or injury to the climber.
