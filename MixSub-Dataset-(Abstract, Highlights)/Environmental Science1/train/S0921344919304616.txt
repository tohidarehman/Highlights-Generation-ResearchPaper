 This work has two aims . Firstly to validate the ability of experimental models derived through near infrared spectroscopy for acrylonitrile butadiene styrene low density polyethylene polyethylene terephthalate and polypropylene in predicting polymers aging focusing on the degree of oxidation . Secondly to assess the reliability of non invasive age predictive models on waste plastic samples and on mechanically recycled samples . Aging time temperature and number of extrusion cycles were selected as independent variables to build the aging prediction models where they were calibrated on samples subjected to controlled conditions . The accuracy of the prediction models was assessed on external samples through the cross correlation technique and the Root Mean Square Error . The models exhibited good collinearity for the aging temperature and the number of extrusion cycles factors for all tested polymers but not for the aging time factor . The RSME value of the aging time factor was far from zero for all polymers . Plastic waste samples provided analogous results the aging time estimation was mostly negative in value . The estimations of aging time and number of extrusion cycles were always positive in values where the most reasonable aging factor estimation was the number of extrusion cycles .

@highlight We investigated NIR spectroscopy ability to predict the oxidation degree of polymers.
@highlight Aging prediction models were experimentally derived for ABS PE PET and PP.
@highlight Aging time temperature and no. of extrusion cycles were the independent variables.
@highlight The models were calibrated on artificially aged samples and waste polymers.
@highlight The no. of extrusion cycles proved to be a key parameter for the reliability of the models.
