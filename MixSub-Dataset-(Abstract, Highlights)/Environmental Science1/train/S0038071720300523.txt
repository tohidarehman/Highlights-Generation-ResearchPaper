 Beneficial microbes can be used as biocontrol agents against soil borne plant diseases . In addition to controlling plant pathogens and promoting plant growth an introduced biocontrol agent can cause shifts in the indigenous microbial community structure in the rhizosphere . However it remains unclear how biocontrol agents affect the distribution of rhizosphere microbial populations and whether population changes of particular dominant microbes in turn contribute to the role of the biocontrol agent in disease control and plant growth promotion . Our previous studies indicated that introduction of
