 Copper is an essential element for electric vehicle . Currently little efforts have been directed toward understanding the EV copper resource environment nexus . Autoregressive integrated moving average model combined with dynamic material flow analysis was developed for the nexus analysis in Fujian in China due to its vigorous EV promotion . Results showed that standardized passenger vehicle ownership would increase 3.34 times from 2018 to the peak year 2042 with about 12 times and 139 times increase of EV sales in baseline and aggressive scenarios respectively . Accordingly EV induced additional copper demand in Fujian would increase the same times as EV sales since 2018 leading to the expansion of copper processing that would incur increasing ripple effects including 1 aggressive scenario s accumulative additional copper ore demand during 2013 2050 exceed 40 times Chinese reserve in 2016 2 about 62 of on road EV s CO

@highlight The SPVO and its EV share will rapidly increase and peak at 2042 in Fujian
@highlight EV induced additional copper demand in AS peak year increase 139 times since 2018
@highlight EV induced copper use can induce serious ripple resource and environmental effects
@highlight Additional copper s ripple effects can offset EV s better on road benefits than FV
@highlight Rapid EV expansion relies on effective management of pyramid tip product
