 A process based understanding of soil carbon sequestration and stabilization has not been precisely characterized due to the lacking of linkage between microbial proliferation and mortality . In this study stable isotope probing of phospholipid fatty acids and amino sugars were used to determine the microbial responses and microbial residue retention in two soils with

@highlight PLFA AS SIP is powerful for exploring microbial process in mediating SOC accrual.
@highlight The activation of microbial responsiveness was controlled by starving effect.
@highlight Successional fungal growth in C poor Ultisol favored efficient C immobilization.
@highlight The conversion of labile C to microbial residues was rapid in C rich Mollisol.
