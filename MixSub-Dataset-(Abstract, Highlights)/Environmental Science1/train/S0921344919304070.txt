 Rising focus on solar power and better world environment have set ambitious plans in motion on the amount of solar power generation worldwide for the coming years . In the interest of socially responsible use of energy both developed and developing countries are exploring their potential of going green . However low solar adoption rates are a cause of pressing concern for some of these countries . This study investigates consumer intentions to adopt solar innovations with particular empirical interest in the adoption of solar equipment by Indian households . We use a cross sectional field survey approach to gather relevant data from four most populous cities in India . Structural equation modelling and logistic regression are employed to deduce results by analyzing data from 320 respondents . Building on characteristics from diffusion of innovation theory this study finds that relative advantage and compatibility strongly influence consumer intentions and such behavioral intentions have a positive and significant effect on the adoption of solar equipment .

@highlight Household solar adoption is empirically examined using Rogers innovation attributes.
@highlight Compatibility and relative advantage are the strongest predictors of user intentions.
@highlight User intentions positively influence consumer adoption of household solar.
@highlight Trialability fails to produce any significant impact on consumers use decisions.
