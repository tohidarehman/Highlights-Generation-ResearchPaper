 In urban areas one way of mitigating the adverse effects of air pollution is the sustainable rooftop practice known as green roofs . How green roofs can help reduce carbon emissions in urban areas directly and indirectly is the focus of this review which draws on recently published studies . The direct impact of green roofs on carbon sequestration involves vegetation and soil media which can capture and store air pollutants on a building scale . The indirect impact includes the long term green roof effect which can include reducing building energy consumption leading to a reduction in fossil fuel consumption . Consequently this process could reduce CO
