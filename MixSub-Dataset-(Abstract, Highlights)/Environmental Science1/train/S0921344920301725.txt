 This article aims to analyze the risk of waste fires in Sweden using the national data of fire anomalies remotely sensed by the NASA s Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite . Risk of fires was studied at 1 837 waste storage sites of eight different categories waste collection pre treatment and sorting sites middle storage of waste recycling of electrical items other recycling activities combustion landfills and wood related . In total 143 waste fires at 111 waste management sites with fire radiative power as high as 81 MW were detected over a period of seven years 2012 18 . Data shows that landfills and RCs are two major high risk groups for instigation of secondary fires . It is concluded that risk of wastefires at all stages of waste management chain can be mitigated by controlling the challenges of structural over capacities at the sites functioning up stream of waste management chain . Moreover there is need to establish an increased number of property close RCs to enhance quality of waste sorting . A novel technique for the analysis of risk of wastefires using remote sensing and GIS modeling is presented in this article . This technique can be extrapolated for other geographical settings for the assessment of risk of waste fires .

@highlight Landfills and Recycling Centers RCs pose highest risk for the instigation of secondary fires.
@highlight The RCs are facing challenges of structural over capacities for handling of residual waste.
@highlight An increased number of property close RCs can help in mitigation of waste fires.
@highlight Plantation of deciduous vegetation around storage sites can prevent spread of waste fires.
