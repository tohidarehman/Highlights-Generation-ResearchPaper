 Urban ecosystems provide green landscapes that are important to global biodiversity conservation . In tropical urban ecosystems exotic plants are widely used in landscaping and this can have several negative effects on the native plant and pollinator communities . Here we aimed to investigate the origin sexual and reproductive systems and fruiting of tree species occurring in 17 urban green spaces in the city of Recife Pernambuco located in the northeastern Brazilian Atlantic forest . A total of 114 tree species were registered in the urban green spaces 78 out of them were observed for fruiting . Overall 49.1 of the species are native to Brazil and 50.9 are exotic while 86 do not occur naturally in the northeastern Brazilian Atlantic forest . In terms of abundance of individuals these values were 37 native 63 exotic and 80.5 not occurring in the northeastern Brazilian Atlantic forest . Most of the species native or exotic are hermaphrodite and self incompatible . From the 78 species observed for fruiting 77 set fruits 43.7 had sub annual pattern all exotic species set fruits even the 13 exotic species that are self incompatible . Our results reveal that factors such as the high use of exotic species that successfully set fruits in tropical urban green spaces may indicate risks for plant animal interactions threaten the reproductive success of native plant species increase the risk of biological invasion and consequently impair the maintenance of biodiversity . We suggest that decision makers pay attention and consider the impacts of using exotic plant species in the dynamic of tropical urban ecosystems .

@highlight Exotic trees predominate in tropical urban spaces.
@highlight 100 of self incompatible exotic trees set fruit in tropical urban ecosystem.
@highlight Exotic trees pose risk to native species and threaten urban and natural ecosystems.
@highlight Native plants should be the first choice in tropical urban ecosystems.
