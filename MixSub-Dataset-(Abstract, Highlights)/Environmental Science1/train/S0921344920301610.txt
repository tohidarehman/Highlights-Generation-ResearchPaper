 Policies and regulations such as Extended Producer Responsibility have been implemented to potentially increase the recycling rate of electronic waste but the cost and environmental impacts of associated collection transportation material recovery material re processing and disposal could outweigh the benefits of recycling if the e waste management system is not effectively designed and implemented . This paper presents a quantitative holistic framework to systematically estimate life cycle impacts and costs associated with e waste management . This new framework was tested using data from the state of Washington s EPR program to represent e waste collection transportation processing and disposal . Sensitivity of process level life cycle model outputs to parameter and input variability was also conducted . Drop off using fossil fuel powered personal vehicles was found to be a key contributor to cost and carbon dioxide emissions . Decision makers must account for drop off and consider the feasibility of alternate e waste aggregation strategies to ensure life cycle benefits of e waste recycling are maximized .

@highlight We develop new process model based framework to analyze e waste management systems
@highlight We exercise the framework with data set representing Washington state s e waste recycling system
@highlight Consumer drop off is major contributor to carbon dioxide emissions and cost of e cycle program
@highlight Recycling benefits are sensitive to the recovery of valuable commodities and process energy use
@highlight Future waste projections could be evaluated using the modeling framework.
