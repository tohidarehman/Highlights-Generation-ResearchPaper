 The role of phosphorus mediating nitrogen transformation processes is poorly understood which raises an important question Does P like soil pH have a strong control in altering the cycling of soil N From 2010 to 2018 pH and or P availability was elevated with lime and P fertilizer in three mixed mesophytic deciduous forests on the unglaciated portion of the Allegheny Plateau southeast Ohio USA . We hypothesized that in addition to soil pH P addition can influence the cycling of soil N because both can change N dynamics which can alter nitrification rates . Increasing soil pH increased nitrification and nitrate pools by 30 and 4 times respectively during the growing season . Furthermore elevating P also stimulated nitrification and increased soil nitrate pools by 10 and 2 times respectively . However the influence of raising soil pH on nitrification was diminished when combined with P addition . Results suggest that N biogeochemical processes are sensitive to P availability but the mechanistic nature of this relationship appears complex with unclear feedback systems regulating nitrification rates from these deciduous forests .

@highlight Increases in phosphorus P availability can increase nitrification rates by 10 times.
@highlight Raising soil pH from 4.8 to 6.7 can increase nitrification rates by 30 times.
@highlight Elevating soil P or pH has no effect on NH
@highlight pools but increases NO
@highlight pools by a factor of 24.
@highlight While liming promotes ammonium immobilization this response is diminished when lime is added with P.
