 The diversity and structure of plant and soil microbial communities are influenced by temporal variability in environmental conditions however it is unclear whether the responses of these biotic communities to land use practices also vary over time . Here we investigated how harvesting hay by mowing and applications of N fertilization at different rates 0 2.5 5 10 20 and 40gN m

@highlight Bacteria and fungi responded differently to land use drivers in two years.
@highlight N fertilization only reduced the diversity of bacteria and fungi in the wet year.
@highlight Individual microbial taxa were more responsive to year than to land use drivers.
@highlight Rainfall changes might explain the inconsistent biotic responses to land use drivers.
@highlight The linkage between plant and soil microbes was tighter in the dry than wet year.
