 Dam management often involves tradeoffs among hydropower generation capacity environmental impacts and project costs . However our understandings of such tradeoffs under a full range of dam management options remain limited which hinders our ability to make sound and scientifically defensible dam management decisions . In order to assess the scope for theoretical tradeoffs a dynamic model of hydropower production important fish populations and project costs was developed using the system dynamics modeling technique . Three dam management options investigated the likely outcomes from dam removal fishway installation and no action . The model was applied to the Penobscot River located in Maine United States as a proof of concept where recent actions have been undertaken . We modeled theoretical influence of these actions on four significant sea run fish alewife

@highlight It is more cost effective to have fewer upstream dams with more generation capacity.
@highlight Basin scale management may better balance tradeoffs than individual dam management.
@highlight Diversifying dam management options increases efficacy of fish energy cost tradeoffs.
@highlight When balanced fish and energy can be at 60 of their maximums while cost is at 44 .
