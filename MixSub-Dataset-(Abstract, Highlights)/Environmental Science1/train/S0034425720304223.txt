 Over the past four decades satellite systems and land surface models have been used to estimate global scale surface soil moisture . However in areas such as densely vegetated and irrigated regions obtaining accurate SSM remains challenging . Before using satellite and model based SSM estimates over these areas we should understand the accuracy and error characteristics of various SSM products . Thus this study aimed to compare the error characteristics of global scale SSM over vegetated and irrigated areas as obtained from active and passive satellites and model based data Advanced Scatterometer Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 Soil Moisture Active Passive European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 and Global Land Data Assimilation System . We employed triple collocation analysis and caluclated conventional error metrics from in situ SSM measurements . We also considered all possible triplets from 6 different products and showed the viability of considering the standard deviation of TCA based numbers in producing robust results .

@highlight Satellite based SSM can provide better quality than model based SSM over densely vegetated areas.
@highlight The results from TCA based and conventional metrics are consistent.
@highlight Use of a single triplet for TCA can create biased results in SSM error estimations.
@highlight Synergetic use of satellite and model SSM ensures the strongest signal to noise ratio.
