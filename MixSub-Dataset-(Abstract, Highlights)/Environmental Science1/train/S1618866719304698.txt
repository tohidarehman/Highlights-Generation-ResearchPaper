 Urban residents are suffer from increased heat stress because of urban heat island intensification in combination with global climate change . Trees have been widely used for improving human thermal comfort . However when it comes to practical design it is not always clear what characteristics of trees are most important or how trees should be arranged to optimize thermal conditions . This study undertook an in depth analysis of several tree species in various configurations . Fifty scenarios were evaluated in terms of how each tree and each configuration affected the energy fluxes of a person on hot sunny days . Results showed that the largest effect in all scenarios was on radiation flux with a much smaller effect on the convective and evaporative fluxes . An even distribution of trees was found to be overall most effective as it maximized the shaded area by avoiding unnecessary overlap . While the solar radiation reduction was the largest effect a detailed analysis provided additional insight into the sometimes large effect of terrestrial radiation . Taller trees with low branching height and dense crowns had the largest effect on solar radiation reduction . Terrestrial radiation was most affected by leaf albedo and sky view factor . Buildings surrounding a treed area increased both solar radiation and terrestrial radiation . The results are universally applicable as the tree characteristics are not species specific and the energy fluxes are based on first principles .

@highlight In depth analysis of thermal effect of trees for design decision making.
@highlight Trees mainly affect energy budget by radiation flux especially by solar radiation.
@highlight Even distribution is the most effective reducing the most absorbed solar radiation.
@highlight Taller trees with low branching height and dense crowns is the preferable tree species.
@highlight The shadow analysis of urban environments should be before tree planting design.
