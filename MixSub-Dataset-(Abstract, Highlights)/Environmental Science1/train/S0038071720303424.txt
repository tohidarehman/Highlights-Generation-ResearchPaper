 Root associated microbiota is important for plant health but there is limited knowledge of how plant pathological condition influences the succession of soil microbial communities especially the fungal community in plant soil systems . We investigated the fungal community succession across a gradient from bulk soil to the plant endosphere of diseased and healthy lisianthus plants using quantitative real time PCR amplicon sequencing and metabolomics . Fungal diversity and richness gradually decreased from the bulk soil to root endosphere and there were fewer fungi in the rhizosphere soil of diseased plants than healthy plants . While the rhizosphere fungal communities developed to be similar with that of the endosphere in both diseased and healthy plants from flowering to harvesting the rhizosphere fungal community developed more quickly in diseased plants than healthy plants . More potential antifungal members were present in the bulk soil and rhizosphere of healthy plants while potential pathogens were more prevalent in the diseased samples . There were significantly more

@highlight Infected plants upregulated the secretion of short chain organic acids and sugar alcohols.
@highlight Diseased plants were associated with the faster development of rhizosphere fungal communities.
@highlight Potential pathogens proliferated faster in the diseased rhizosphere.
