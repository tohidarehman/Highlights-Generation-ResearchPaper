 In mid latitude regions of North America many soils are subjected to freeze thaw conditions during the late winter and early spring months . FrTh events are usually accompanied by flushes of C and N mineralization yet the concomitant response of nitrification has not been consistently characterized . A laboratory experiment was conducted on three soils that differ in their annual history of exposure to freeze thaw events and where both ammonia oxidizing bacteria and archaea are capable of contributing to nitrification activity at 10 and 16C under NH

@highlight Nitrification was fully active in soils with a history of freezing within 1d of thawing.
@highlight Nitrification emerging from soil with a history of freezing was due to AOA activity.
@highlight Temperature of incubation affected the rate of AOA activity but not the emergence.
@highlight Nitrification emerging from soil with no history of freezing was due to AOB activity.
@highlight Temperature of incubation and NH
@highlight availability influenced emergence of AOB activity.
