 Production of biodiesel is one of the most important European targets within renewables for the future . To consider biodiesel a feasible alternative to fossil fuel unconventional resources need to be exploited . This review aims to provide up to date knowledge on the existing reuse of lipids from urban wastewater to produce biodiesel . Lipids are readily removed by mixed microbial populations during wastewater treatments in sewage plants . Assessment results on potential annual European market supply indicate 3 414 10

@highlight Challenges and possibilities of transition in the urban water cycle were addressed.
@highlight Sewage sludge has a high potential as a possible biodiesel feedstock.
@highlight Optimizing conditions may lead to higher lipid yields from selected strains.
@highlight Quality criteria and change of waste status have to be defined by legislation.
@highlight WWTP operators have to make certain changes in their way of thinking and working.
