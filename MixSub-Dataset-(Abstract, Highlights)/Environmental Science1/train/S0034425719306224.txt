 The original data produced by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission tend to have an abundance of voids in mountainous areas where the elevation measurements are missing . In this paper deep learning models are investigated for restoring SRTM data . To this end we explore generative adversarial nets which represent one state of the art family of deep learning models . A conditional generative adversarial network is introduced as the baseline method for filling voids in incomplete SRTM data . The problem regarding shadow violation that possibly arises from the CGAN restored data is investigated . To address this deficiency shadow geometric constraints based on shadow maps of satellite images are devised . In addition a shadow constrained conditional generative adversarial network which incorporates the shadow geometric constraints into the CGAN is developed . Training the SCGAN model requires both the remote sensing observations and the ground truth data . The integration of the multi source training data enables the SCGAN model to be characterized by comprehensive information including both mountain shape variation and mountain shadow geometry . Experimental results validate the superiority of the SCGAN over the comparison methods i.e . the interpolation the convolutional neural network and the baseline CGAN in SRTM data restoration .
