 Heavy metals can be released into all alcoholic beverages during production and storage . However there is at least a theoretical risk that they could be present in higher and potentially toxic concentrations in those produced in the household and small scale stills common in Central and Eastern Europe which lack quality control and whose products are unrecorded by authorities . Yet so far few studies comparing concentrations of heavy metals in recorded and unrecorded spirits have been published . In this study we ask whether there is any difference between heavy metal concentrations in recorded and unrecorded spirits and thus the related health risk . The levels of heavy metals were determined in recorded and unrecorded spirits using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometric analysis and applied to population based risk assessments considering average regular and chronic heavy drinkers . Concentrations of Cu Zn and Sn were significantly higher in unrecorded spirits than those in their recorded counterparts and recorded spirits contained significantly higher levels of Fe Mn and Ni than unrecorded spirits . Combined exposure to heavy metals posed a potential health risk in chronic heavy drinkers consuming recorded spirits . However when compared to the health risk arising from drinking large volumes of ethanol the risk is negligible . Consequently there are no grounds to worry about the adverse effects of heavy metals from spirits .

@highlight The heavy metal content of recorded and unrecorded spirits was determined.
@highlight The concentrations of copper tin and zinc were significantly higher in unrecorded spirits.
@highlight The levels of iron manganese and nickel were significantly higher in recorded spirits.
@highlight Combined exposure to heavy metals posed a potential health risk in chronic heavy drinkers consuming recorded spirits.
@highlight The health risk is likely to be negligible when compared to that from heavy ethanol drinking.
