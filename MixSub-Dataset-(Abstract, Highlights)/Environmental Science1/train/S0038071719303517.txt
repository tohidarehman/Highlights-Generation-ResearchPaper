 Microbially derived nitrogen has been considered as one of important contributors to soil organic N but few studies have quantified the rate of necromass N decomposition . Here via an

@highlight We showed the microbial necromass N decomposition rate in a temperate forest soil.
@highlight Approximately 40 of microbial necromass
@highlight N was recovered in soil after more than two years incubation
@highlight We found no difference in necromass N decomposition rate among microbial groups.
