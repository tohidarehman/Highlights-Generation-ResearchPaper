 The circular economy rationale is increasingly promoted as a means to move from a global plastic waste dilemma to a plastics economy that is aligned with the principles of sustainable development . However any such effort will have to account for the socio economic settings in low income and middle income countries of the global south which are the main entry points of mismanaged plastic wastes into the environment . Since waste management and recycling in these economies are characterized by a great degree of informality there is an urgent need to find models for partnering with the informal recycling sector in an effective scalable and sustainable manner . In this work we present the case of a for profit company located in Nairobi Kenya that operates on the interface between formal and informal by processing post consumer plastics sourced from local waste pickers through a fair trade like business model .

@highlight A case study of linking waste pickers and industrial plastics recycling was made.
@highlight Polyolefin recyclates from waste pickers were comparable to established recyclates.
@highlight Social benefits for waste pickers and high quality recycling can go hand in hand.
@highlight Incentives trust and state of the art technology were key for success.
