 Substantial progress has been made in characterising the risk associated with exposure to allergens in food . However absence of agreement on what risk is tolerable has made it difficult to set quantitative limits to manage that risk and protect allergic consumers effectively . This paper reviews scientific progress in the area and the diverse status of allergen management approaches and lack of common standards across different jurisdictions including within the EU . This lack of regulation largely explains why allergic consumers find Precautionary Allergen Labelling confusing and can not rely on it . We reviewed approaches to setting quantitative limits for a broad range of food safety hazards to identify the reasoning leading to their adoption . This revealed a diversity of approaches from pragmatic to risk based but we could not find clear evidence of the process leading to the decision on risk acceptability . We propose a framework built around the criteria suggested by Murphy and Gardoni for approaches to defining tolerable risks . Applying these criteria to food allergy we concluded that sufficient knowledge exists to implement the framework including sufficient expertise across the whole range of stakeholders to allow opinions to be heard and respected and a consensus to be achieved .

@highlight Quantitative limits for unintended allergen presence have in general not been defined across and within jurisdictions.
@highlight Inability to define what risk is tolerable is a major obstacle to defining those limits.
@highlight Diverse approaches pragmatic to risk based have been adopted to define quantitative limits for other food safety hazards.
@highlight How tolerability decisions were reached in the case of those hazards is unclear.
@highlight We propose a framework for transparent decisions on risk tolerability founded on full participation of stakeholders.
