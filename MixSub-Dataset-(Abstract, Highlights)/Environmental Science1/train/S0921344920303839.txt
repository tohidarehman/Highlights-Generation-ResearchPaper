 Printed circuit boards contain metallic and non metallic fractions that are hazardous and toxic when disposed of in a landfill . This paper emphasizes the feasibility of using NMF reclaimed from waste PCB s as a replacement to fly ash and metakaolin in a geopolymer mortar . Geopolymer mortar mixes were prepared with five FA MK replacement ratios of 100 0 90 10 80 20 70 30 and 60 40 and for each mix FA was also replaced with NMF by 5 10 15 and 20 . The compressive strength and microstructures of geopolymer mortar were investigated and it was found that the addition of NMF enhanced the compressive strength . Maximum strength gain was found with 30 of MK and 15 of NMF in FA . The pozzolanic action of alumino silicates was studied through SEM and XRD which reflected the formation of C S H gel with a dense geopolymer matrix along with the formation of CaCO

@highlight Environmental friendly hybridized geopolymer mortars were developed with non metallic fractions from waste PCBs.
@highlight An addition of 15 NMF improves the performance of geopolymer concrete. A typical acicular structure of aragonite is found in SEM which helps in strength gain.
@highlight Aragonite and mullite is found in abundance under XRD analysis which is responsible for the improvement in performance.
@highlight The hybrid geopolymer can be used for concrete blocks sewer gates paving blocks and all other places where concrete is used.
