 Forest ecosystem services such as clean water wildlife habitat and timber supplies are increasingly threatened by drought and disturbances which can have great impacts on stand development and water balance . Improved understanding of the hydrologic response of forested systems to drought and disturbance at spatiotemporal resolutions commensurate with these impacts is important for effective forest management . Evapotranspiration is a key hydrologic variable in assessing forest functioning and health but it remains a challenge to accurately quantify ET at landscape scales with the spatial and temporal detail required for effective decision making . In this study we apply a multi sensor satellite data fusion approach to study the response of forest ET to drought and disturbance over a 7 year period . This approach combines Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ET product time series retrieved using a surface energy balance model to generate a multi year ET datacube at 30 m resolution and daily timesteps . The study area 900km

@highlight Impacts of drought and disturbance on forest are investigated using ET time series.
@highlight The impact of drought on managed forest ET decreases with stand age.
@highlight Stand disturbance and recovery signals are identified in ET based moisture stress.
@highlight ET time series complement vegetation indices for monitoring land water use change.
