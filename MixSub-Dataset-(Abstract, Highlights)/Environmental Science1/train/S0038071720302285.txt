 Previous studies on upland soils showed that 13C natural abundance can successfully reveal C stabilization pathways between aggregates and soil organic matter density fractions . The direction of C stabilization in paddies can however deviate from that in upland soils owing to i periodic dryingrewetting cycles with oxygen pulses under oxic conditions and thus shifts in microbial processing of organic residues and ii intensive organic and mineral fertilization . To trace C stabilization in paddies soil was sampled from a long term field experiment under an unfertilized Control and NPK NPK straw and NPK manure fertilizer regimes . Soil was analyzed for total C microbial biomass and dissolved organic C and separated into three classes based on aggregate size followed by density fractionation of each class to obtain free and occluded light fractions as well as dense and mineral heavy fractions . Pathways of C were determined based on C content and

@highlight Fertilization of paddy soils increased carbon C stabilization in macroaggregates and mineral fraction.
@highlight C flow is ongoing from macro to microaggregates.
@highlight C flow in paddy soils is ongoing from mineral to free light fraction which is opposite to upland soils.
@highlight Pathways of C between light fractions are separate from those in heavy fractions.
