 There has been a growing interest in studying the labile C pool in order to promote the sequestration and stabilization of soil organic carbon . Although labile SOC fractions have emerged as standardized indicators because of their potential to detect early SOC trends over time the relationships between microbial attributes and labile SOC remains poorly understood . In this study we explored the influence of labile SOC fractions on the topsoil bacteria archaea community across 28 sites with different land use climate aridity and soil types across a wide range of SOC content in central Chile . We applied Illumina sequencing to the 16S rRNA to examine shifts in the diversity and composition of these soil microbial communities . Additionally labile SOC fractions such as the permanganate oxidizable carbon and light fraction organic matter along with the soil physicochemical properties were analyzed . The results demonstrated that among all of the environmental factors tested the pH POXC SOC ratio and LFOM were key drivers of microbial community structure . The diversity metrics exhibited a decreasing trend when aridity increased and community structure was found to vary with high POXC SOC in sites associated with drier conditions . In addition POXC SOC ratios and LFOM were clearly related to shifts in the relative abundances of specific taxonomic groups at genera level . When there was high POXC SOC and low LFOM content members of Bacteroidetes

@highlight Soil pH and POXC SOC were the major drivers of the microbial community structure.
@highlight POXC had a significant effect on the bacterial diversity indices.
@highlight Climate regimes play an important role in the microbial community structure.
@highlight Microbial community composition was largely modulated by labile fractions.
