 The Synthetic Aperture Radar mode sea level anomalies of Sentinel 3A altimetry mission around the Australian coastal region were validated using eight in situ tide gauge sea level records and retracked Jason 3 datasets from a modified Brown peaky retracker . The MBP is a modified version of our existing Brown peaky retracker aimed at enhancing BP s performance . We compared the noise of Sentinel 3A SLAs averaged across three posting rates with the 1Hz noise of MBP derived Jason 3 SLAs . At distances 10km from the coast the noise level of 1Hz Sentinel 3A SLAs is lower than that of the MBP retracked Jason 3 SLAs . Moreover the noise level of 2Hz Sentinel 3A SLAs is comparable to that of the 1Hz MBP derived Jason 3 dataset indicating that Sentinel 3A can provide precise SLAs at finer spatial scales . The Root Mean Square Error of differences between the tide gauge SLA time series and the equivalent SLA time series at each along track altimeter point was used to assess pointwise data quality . For both Sentinel 3A and MBP retracked Jason 3 the along track RMSEs of 20Hz SLAs vary between 0.05m and 0.2m . The mean and standard deviation of 1Hz SLA differences at crossover points were computed for each individual altimetry mission to assess overall data quality . When compared with the crossover analysis results the quality of Sentinel 3A SLAs is superior to that of the retracked Jason 3 dataset in terms of smaller STDs at crossover points .

@highlight The 2 Hz Sentinel 3A and 1 Hz retracked Jason 3 sea level data are equally precise.
@highlight Within 5km to the coast both Sentinel 3A and Jason 3 datasets are problematic.
@highlight The overall data quality of Sentinel 3A is superior to retracked Jason 3 dataset.
