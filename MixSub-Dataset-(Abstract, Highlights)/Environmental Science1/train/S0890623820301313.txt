 The flame retardant and plasticizer tetrabromobisphenol A has rapidly become a common component in the manufacture of circuit boards and plastics worldwide . It is also an analog of bisphenol A an endocrine disrupting chemical identified by the Endocrine Society . As such TBBPA needs to be investigated for similar potential human health risks . Using rats as a model we exposed pregnant dams and their progeny to 0 0.1 25 or 250 mg TBBPA kg of body weight until the offspring reached adulthood and assessed the first generation of males for any reproductive tract abnormalities . We found no differences in the morphology of testes sperm prostates or secondary sex organs from post natal day 21 through one year of age . A delay in the time to preputial separation was found with the 250 mg kg treatment . Also minor differences of sperm count at one year old with the 25 mg kg treatment and expression levels of two steroidogenic pathway enzymes at either post natal day 90 or one year old in the 250 mg kg treatment group were detected but spermatogenesis was not disrupted . While these results may lead to the supposition that TBBPA is less harmful than its parent compound BPA more studies need to be conducted to assess long term exposure effects .

@highlight Tetrabromobisphenol A TBBPA is an analog of the plasticizer Bisphenol A.
@highlight Rats were exposed to TBBPA early in gestation throughout weaning and to adulthood.
@highlight Male reproductive organs were examined for abnormalities up to one year of age.
@highlight No overt poor outcomes were found in tissues or spermatozoa.
