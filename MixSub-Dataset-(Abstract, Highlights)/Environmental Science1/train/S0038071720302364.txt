 Soil pH is among the most important drivers of soil bacterial community composition and diversity . However most studies exploring the spatial distribution of soil bacterial communities have focused on the top 1020cm of soil leaving our knowledge of the composition diversity and forces structuring subsoil communities relatively unexplored . Moreover in agricultural soil managed without tillage fertilizers often generate an acidified soil layer in the seed zone rendering no till soils a unique system in which to study the relative impacts of pH and soil depth on microbial communities . We characterize the composition and diversity of bacterial communities in a no till wheat based cropping system from eastern Washington across soil depths . Soil depth was a strong driver of bacterial community composition and diversity . Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria dominated the soil surface Acidobacteria peaked in relative abundance at 10cm and Actinobacteria and unidentified taxa were greatest in relative abundance below 25cm . However acidified soil disrupted relationships between soil depth and bacterial communities resulting in a low diversity and distinct composition of bacterial communities at the 10cm depth . Co occurrence networks of bacterial taxa revealed groups of co occurring taxa that responded primarily to soil pH or depth . This work provides an insight on the distribution and drivers of bacterial communities in deep soil profiles in dryland wheat based cropping systems .

@highlight Bacterial communities are highly variable with depth in deep loess soils of no till dryland wheat in the Pacific Northwest.
@highlight Nitrification caused depth specific soil acidification and Acidobacteria domination.
@highlight Deeper depths 25100cm were dominated by oligotrophs Actinobacteria .
@highlight Shallow layers 010cm were dominated by root associated copiotrophs Proteobacteria .
