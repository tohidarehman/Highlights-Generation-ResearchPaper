 Understanding plant roots induced changes in soil organic matter decomposition the rhizosphere effect is critical to predict soil carbon and nutrient cycling within and across biomes . Root functional traits are proposed to regulate the rhizosphere effect . We measured the rhizosphere effect on SOM decomposition by incubating rhizosphere and bulk soils sampled from 14 hardwood species with distinct mycorrhizal associations Arbuscular mycorrhizal AM

@highlight The rhizosphere effect on SOM decomposition is linked to root functional traits.
@highlight The rhizosphere effect increases with root N concentration across 14 hardwood species.
@highlight The rhizosphere effect decreases with root diameter across 14 hardwood species.
@highlight The rhizosphere effect does not differ between AM and ECM species.
@highlight Interspecific rhizosphere effect is controlled by plant resource use strategy.
