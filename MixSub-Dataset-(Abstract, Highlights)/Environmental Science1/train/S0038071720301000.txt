 Combining bioenergy land use with biochar production could represent a win win management strategy to increase energy production whilst reducing greenhouse gas emissions . However a fuller understanding of the effects that these changes in land use and soil amendment could have on soil biodiversity and processes is needed . We performed a 2 year field experiment to determine the consequences of adding three different amounts of biochar 10tha

@highlight Biochar reduced earthworm densities but promoted microarthropods and enchytraeids.
@highlight Biochar did not affect earthworm functional structure but species richness.
@highlight The new C was assimilated by earthworms but it did not support population growth.
@highlight Biochar additions may result in loss of ecosystem services provided by earthworms.
