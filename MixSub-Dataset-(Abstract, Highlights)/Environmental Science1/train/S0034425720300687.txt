 The seasonal snow cover contributes significantly to the water resource in the Indian Himalayas and snow density is one of the vital parameters in the determination of the hydrological potential of snow . The application of conventional methods for snow density retrieval using fully polarimetric SAR data is constrained by the properties of snow primarily due to the melt and frost cycles as compared to fresh dry snow . The surface component of backscatter is significant in case of melt and frost . In the conventional decomposition based methods the surface component is not considered for the inversion of permittivity as proposed in this study . In this paper we also propose a methodology for the estimation of snow density using bi temporal fully polarimetric C band RADARSAT 2 synthetic aperture radar data . We utilize the relation between the differential modified Mueller matrix components the attenuation constants and the Fresnel transmission coefficients . The permittivity of snow is derived using the inversion of the Fresnel transmission coefficients which is used to determine the snow density using a state of the art empirical relation . The snow density estimates from the proposed method are compared with other methods based on coherency matrix decomposition and evaluated against in situ measurements collected during a field campaign carried out in Dhundi in the state of Himachal Pradesh in India . The snow density estimates using the proposed method are observed to correlate with the in situ measurements and were also found to be better than the decomposition based methods .
