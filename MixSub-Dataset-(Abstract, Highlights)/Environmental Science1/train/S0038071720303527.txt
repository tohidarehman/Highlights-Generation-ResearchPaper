 Increased rainfall may affect soil phosphorus cycling in tropical forest ecosystems yet the key biotic and abiotic factors that govern soil organic P transformations remain unclear . In this study we conducted a long term rainfall manipulation experiment in the field to examine the effects of increased rainfall in the wet season on soil P dynamics in a tropical forest . We found that an increase in rainfall in the wet season enhanced the maximum P adsorption capacity of forest soil as a result of a greater availability of soil organic matter and organic iron aluminum oxides . Newly formed stable ternary complexes between soil organic matter metals and P increased the surface adsorption of soil organic P. Moreover the alkaline phosphomonoesterase activity was reduced under our experimental treatment owing to a decrease in the abundance of both ALP producing bacteria
