 Previous data obtained in piglets suggested that despite structural analogy with Bisphenol A Bisphenol S elimination may proceed more slowly resulting in a much higher systemic exposure to unconjugated BPS than to BPA . Interspecies allometric scaling was applied to predict the toxicokinetic parameters of BPS namely plasma clearance in humans from values obtained in animals and thus contribute to assessment of the human internal exposure to BPS .

@highlight Allometric scaling was used to predict BPS pharmacokinetic parameters in humans.
@highlight In all species BPS plasma clearance was directly related to body weight.
@highlight Human BPS clearance was estimated at 0.92L min for a bodyweight of 70kg.
@highlight Human BPS clearance was about two times lower than that of BPA.
