 Green spaces in urban parks are an essential part of urban planning not only meeting the environmental demands of urban dwellers but also absorbing greenhouse gases generated in urban regions . Mineralization of soil organic carbon is one of the most important processes of C cycling and links C sequestration and emission . However few studies have been focused on SOC mineralization in urban parks especially in scenarios involving rising temperature . Here soils from different ages of deciduous forest evergreen forest and lawn were collected from the urban parks of Chengdu megacity . A soil incubation study was conducted to examine SOC mineralization in three temperature regimes three vegetation types and three vegetation ages making 27 treatments in total . Results demonstrate that increases in temperature stimulated the daily SOC mineralization rate cumulative SOC mineralization and mineralization intensity in the soils from urban green spaces especially in soils under the 5 year old plantings . Furthermore results from principal component analysis showed that the soil labile organic carbon fraction especially readily oxidizable carbon soil enzyme activity and soil pH are the major factors influencing SOC mineralization . During the incubation the average temperature sensitivity

@highlight SOC mineralization rate increases with increasing incubation temperature.
@highlight Soil microorganisms are preferred to mineralize ROC at higher temperature.
@highlight Soil ROC enzyme activity and pH are primary factors controlling SOC mineralization.
@highlight SOC stored in lawn soils is less susceptible to climate warming.
