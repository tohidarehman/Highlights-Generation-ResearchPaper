 Current plastic packaging waste management practices in Europe but also in other countries require improvement due to legal and societal requirements . To meet high recycling rates significant changes among others in post consumer packaging waste sorting become necessary . This waste stream is dominated by plastic packaging . Inorganic fluorescent tracer materials oxide crystals doped with ytterbium Yb

@highlight To meet future challenges current polymer sorting technology needs to be improved supported or replaced by other means for fast high throughput sorting.

@highlight sensitizer ions and either erbium Er
@highlight  holmium Ho

@highlight  activator ions enable up conversion fluorescence as a unique means for polymer marking and product identification.
@highlight Selected polymer products film and blow moulded products made from PE HD equipped with 10 100 and 1000ppm tracer materials were used in optical measurements.
@highlight In the optimal case all markers can be mixed with white or yellow pigments without any restrictions. There are also no limitations to mix the NIR marker with colour pigments except for black pigments.
