 Due to the rapid urbanization in China and its citizens increasing need for thermal comfort space heating especially district heating has developed rapidly in recent years . Reliance on low efficient coal boilers has led to significant energy consumption and serious environmental implications . The Chinese government has made clean heating a national strategy emphasizing that plans for regional heating development should be formulated based on local resources and conditions . In this study Northern China was divided into 1 047 third level administration regions of which the local heat demand and possible heating potentialsincluding combined heat and power plant industrial surplus heat wastes and biomasswere investigated . Through a supply and demand analysis regional heat balances were assessed and mapped to indicate the characteristics of heating resources in northern China . The results showed that 699 regions have access to clean heating resources besides wastes . Possible development pathways are also discussed for different regions based on the availability of resources . The results from this study provide a solid foundation for future clean heating developments in Northern China .

@highlight CHP industrial surplus heat biomass and waste resources in 1 047 urban units of Northern China are investigated and mapped.
@highlight Space heating demands of urban units in Northern China are investigated and the regional heat balances are analyzed.
@highlight 88 of the urban building area are found to have clean heating resources available.
@highlight 46 of the urban building area have CHP and industrial surplus heat resources as dominant heating sources.
@highlight Regional clean heating roadmaps based on availability of resources are discussed.
