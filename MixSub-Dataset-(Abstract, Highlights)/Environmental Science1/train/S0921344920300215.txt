 China used to receive more than 50 of the global post consumer plastics export the largest share of which was PET bottles . However China recently banned the import of foreign wastes including waste plastics . The original intention of this ban was to protect Chinas ecosystem quality and human health while its environmental implications have yet to be examined . This study analyzes the life cycle environmental impacts of this ban on post consumer PET under a number of post ban scenarios . Our analysis shows that the ban may substantially exacerbate environmental impacts both in China and globally if China in the absence of imported recyclates increases its virgin PET fiber production using carbon intensive coal as the feedstock . Recycling waste PET bottles within the countries that generate them to replace Chinas virgin PET fiber production however is shown to significantly reduce life cycle environmental impacts both in China and globally . Our study highlights the potential unintended environmental consequences of the ban and the need to consider marginal technologies and their consequences in policy decisions . Our results call for cost effective recycling infrastructure among the waste producing countries and the mechanism to coordinate plastics recycling on a global scale .

@highlight We analyze the potential impacts of Chinas import ban on waste plastics.
@highlight The ban may increase coal based virgin feedstock use for PET fiber in China.
@highlight As a result the ban may exacerbate environmental impacts both in China and globally.
