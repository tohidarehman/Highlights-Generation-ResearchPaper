 Olfactory signals are critical for soil inhabitants to communicate and respond to the environment . In addition to the well documented volatile cues from herbivores and herbivory induced plants attraction of both entomopathogenic nematodes and insect prey was recently shown to be induced by a saprophytic fungus

@highlight volatiles repelled non fungivorous weevil larvae.
@highlight The volatiles attracted insect killing nematodes EPNs and fungivorous fly larvae.
@highlight EPNs plus volatiles killed fruit flies more effectively and weevils less effectively.
@highlight Responses to volatiles may reflect the evolution of these tritrophic relationships.
