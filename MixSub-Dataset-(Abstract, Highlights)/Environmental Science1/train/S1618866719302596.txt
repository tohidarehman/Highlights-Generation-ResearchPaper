 Impervious surfaces in modern cities can be used for revegetation . However the ecological quality of belowground ecosystem components and constrained soil space are crucial factors that limit habitat restoration . The long term development of Bonsai trees has resulted in mature theories and techniques that suggest optimal root canopy ratios . Considering the similarities with constrained pot landscapes some enlightenments or key findings derived from Bonsai theory can also be applied to urban special revegetation . In this study we analyzed the root shoot correlations of the different styles of Bonsai trees and provide and assessment on the relationships between Bonsai theory and USR . Using an on site survey and biomass experiment nine enlightenments from Bonsai theory are proposed positive root canopy correlation environmental stress increasing the root shoot ratio connectivity of the tree bark water line rebalancing after disruption of the root canopy balance precise root and canopy design artificial auxiliary fixation of the root control of growth horticultural reshaping skills and plant diversity . In particular for the successful establishment of urban rebuilt environments it is essential to understand the mechanisms of root canopy correlations . Therefore we suggest that the four main types of USR should follow the core principle based on the root shoot balance to effectively design both the root and canopy .
