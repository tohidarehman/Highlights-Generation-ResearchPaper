 The interaction between root exudates and soil microbes has been hypothesised as the primary mechanism for the biodegradation of organic pollutants in the rhizosphere . However the mechanisms governing this loss process are not completely understood . This study aimed to investigate the effect of two important compounds within root exudates on

@highlight Organic acids found within the rhizosphere play an important role on the behaviour of PAHs in soil.
@highlight The total extractable fraction of
@highlight C phenanthrene from soil can be increased by citric and malic acid.
@highlight Increases on the PAH extractability in the presence of the organic acids were not reflected in increases in biodegradation.
