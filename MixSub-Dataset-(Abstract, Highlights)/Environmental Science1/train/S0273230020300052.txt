 FDA developed the interim reference level for lead of 3g day in children and 12.5g day in women of childbearing age to better protect the fetus from lead toxicity . These IRLs correspond to a blood lead level of 0.5g dL in both populations . The current investigation was performed to determine if the IRL for WOCBA should apply to the general population of adults . A literature review of epidemiological studies was conducted to determine whether a BLL of 0.5g dL is associated with adverse effects in adults . Some studies reported adverse effects over a wide range of BLLs that included 0.5g dL adding uncertainty to conclusions about effects at 0.5g dL however no studies clearly identified this BLL as an adverse effect level . Results also showed that the previously developed PTTDI for adults of 75g day lead may not be health protective supporting use of a lower reference value for lead toxicity in this population group . Use of the 12.5g day IRL as a benchmark for dietary lead intake is one way FDA will ensure that dietary lead intake in adults is reduced .

@highlight FDA has an interim reference level IRL of 12.5g day for dietary lead exposure in women of childbearing age.
@highlight The IRL corresponds to a blood lead level BLL of 0.5g dL.
@highlight Epidemiology studies were reviewed to determine if a BLL of 0.5g dL was associated with adverse effects in adults.
@highlight No studies clearly identified a BLL of 0.5g dL as an adverse effect level.
@highlight The results support use of the 12.5g day IRL for the general population of adults.
