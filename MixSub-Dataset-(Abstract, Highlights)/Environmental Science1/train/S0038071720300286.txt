 The feeding ecology of soil animals is seldom investigated in the winter when the soil is covered with a layer of snow . Collembola are winter active arthropods that appear on the snow surface especially on sunny days and remain active in microhabitats under the snow . Since winter active Collembola must be consuming food we assessed the food resources for these Collembola with stable isotope and bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing methods . We collected two

@highlight Food resources of winter active Collembola mainly derived from snow.
@highlight Cyanobacteria were one of the predominant food resource bacteria.
@highlight A large proportion of Collembola associated bacteria were putative symbionts.
