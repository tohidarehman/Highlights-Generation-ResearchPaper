 The extent timing and duration of seasonal freeze thaw state exerts dominant control on boreal forest carbon water and energy cycle processes . Recent and on going L Band spaceborne missions have the potential to provide enhanced information on FT state over large geographic regions with rapid revisit time . However the low spatial resolution of these spaceborne observations makes it difficult to isolate the primary contributions to the FT signal in boreal forest . To better quantify these controls two L Band radiometers were deployed at a black spruce
