 Food energy and water are critical resources for human well being and an essential part of Sustainable Development Goals . The food energy water nexus can create cascading effects that influence critical earth system processes . However how to promote FEW nexus safeguarding within the planetary boundaries is still unclear . Based on global datasets of official SDG statistics an operating framework combined planetary boundaries and the FEW nexus was constructed . We found that although there are substantial differences in the FEW nexus performances among various countries the overall development of three branches is coordinated . However the massive resource consumption associated with promotion of the FEW nexus can severely transgress multiple planetary boundaries . Optimistically if the highest efficiency is considered the conflict between biophysical resource consumption and FEW nexus will be alleviated . Therefore considering the utilization efficiency and independent contribution of biophysical resource we suggest that CO

@highlight The spatial pattern of the FEW nexus at the global level is measured.
@highlight Biophysical resource utilization efficiency for the FEW nexus is measured.
@highlight Biophysical indicators independent contribution to the FEW nexus is identified.
@highlight Prior biophysical indicators for promoting the FEW nexus are suggested.
