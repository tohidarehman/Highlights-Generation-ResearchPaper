 The general population including children and adolescents is exposed to 4 methylimidazole in the diet . 4 MI is a by product of caramel color manufacturing . It has been previously classified as a possible human carcinogen and displays potential reproductive toxicity . A follow up assessment of reproductive toxicity was conducted in rats utilizing the reproductive assessment by continuous breeding paradigm in which multiple generations were exposed to 4 MI in diet at 750 2500 and 5000 ppm . 4 MI exposure was associated with delays in preputial separation and vaginal opening impairment in reproductive performance and concomitant histopathological findings in the prostate testis and epididymis at 2500 and 5000 ppm . The Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level for reproductive and developmental toxicity was 750 ppm equivalent to approximately 5060 mg kg bw day .

@highlight 4 MI is a reproductive and developmental toxicant in male and female rats.
@highlight The effects did not worsen with subsequent exposures or across generations.
@highlight We did not obtain a No Observable Adverse Effect Level NOAEL in this study.
@highlight These findings may aid risk assessment of this caramel coloring byproduct.
