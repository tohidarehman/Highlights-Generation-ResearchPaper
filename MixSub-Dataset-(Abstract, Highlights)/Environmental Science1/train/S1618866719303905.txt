 Reconstructing spatial and temporal pollution gradients in natural and anthropogenic areas is of paramount importance to undertake proper mitigation strategies . To this end air biomonitoring based on chemical analysis of selected bioaccumulators provides useful information not only on the pollutant concentration gradients but also on their possible effects on biota and ecosystems .

@highlight Specific industrial activities locally affect As Mn Ni and Pb air concentrations.
@highlight In urban sites diffuse pollution sources determine high concentrations of several PTEs.
@highlight Remote areas are affected by high Cd air concentrations.
@highlight Air PTE concentrations are decreasing as generally observed in Europe.
