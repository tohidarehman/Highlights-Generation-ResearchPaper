 The Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data identifies an approach for representing nonclinical data in a structured format which has been widely adopted by the pharmaceutical industry as it is required for data submission to the United States Food Drug Administration . The SEND Implementation Guide allows for considerable flexibility in how data is represented interpretation of these guidelines has led to significant variability in the approach to SEND dataset creation . The purposes of this manuscript are to identify common variability in certain SEND domains and to describe how variability can be managed to enable valuable cross study analysis use cases . The example of extracting a commonly used data point animal age is used to illustrate the complexity and variability of SEND datasets . Developing a solution framework to the variability problem that includes all stakeholders involved in the creation and use of SEND datasets may enable future routine analysis of warehoused SEND data . Harmonizing the implementation and use of SEND is expected to benefit all involved stakeholders and to ultimately contribute to the goal of increased productivity in nonclinical research .
