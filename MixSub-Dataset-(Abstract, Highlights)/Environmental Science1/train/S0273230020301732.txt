 In Germany the severity of a narcotic offence is determined based on the classification into different categories of quantity . Recently an amendment to the Narcotics Law regarding the not inconsiderable quantities was introduced . The new limits for methamphetamine are derived from the varying potency of the respective enantiomers . Switzerland however does not practice this distinction and there is only one limit quantity without considering the isomeric structure . To examine whether this single value is still contemporary 26 Thai pill samples from the years 2000 2001 2007 2009 and 2017 were analyzed by HPLC MS MS and GC MS .

@highlight Analyzed Thai pills mainly consist of the more potent S methamphetamine.
@highlight Enantiomeric mixtures of R S methamphetamine are rarely in equimolar ratio.
@highlight Legal limit quantity should be adapted to the potency of the respective enantiomers.
