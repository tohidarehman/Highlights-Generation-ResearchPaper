 The European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing convened a Blue Sky Workshop on new ideas for non animal approaches to predict repeated dose systemic toxicity . The aim of the Workshop was to formulate strategic ideas to improve and increase the applicability implementation and acceptance of modern non animal methods to determine systemic toxicity . The Workshop concluded that good progress is being made to assess repeated dose toxicity without animals taking advantage of existing knowledge in toxicology thresholds of toxicological concern adverse outcome pathways and read across workflows . These approaches can be supported by New Approach Methodologies utilising modern molecular technologies and computational methods . Recommendations from the Workshop were based around the needs for better chemical safety assessment how to strengthen the evidence base for decision making to develop standardise and harmonise NAMs for human toxicity and the improvement in the applicability and acceptance of novel techniques . Disruptive thinking is required to reconsider chemical legislation validation of NAMs and the opportunities to move away from reliance on animal tests . Case study practices and data sharing ensuring reproducibility of NAMs were viewed as crucial to the improvement of non animal test approaches for systemic toxicity .

@highlight Moving away from animal data requires both technological and regulatory advances.
@highlight Investment is needed to help NAMs advance to support decision making.
@highlight Current risk management practices and protection goals require evaluation.
@highlight Case studies and workflows are essential to implementation of NAMs.
