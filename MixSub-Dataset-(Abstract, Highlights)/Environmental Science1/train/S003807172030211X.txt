 In forests in Mongolia tree roots and ectomycorrhizal fungi must survive several months of soil freezing in winter . To investigate the ectomycorrhizal community after winter we collected fine roots of Scots pine

@highlight Ectomycorrhizas remain vital in soils frozen for several months.
@highlight Ectomycorrhizal communities differ in co occurring pine species.
@highlight Soil leucine amino peptidase activity is cold adapted.
