 Recent evidence suggests that a significant proportion of stable soil organic matter is derived from microbial necromass which can be evaluated by measuring biomarker amino sugars . However our understanding of the vertical distribution and control of amino sugars in soil profiles at the global scale is still limited . Here we synthesized the concentrations of amino sugars relative to soil mass and to soil organic carbon concentration in various soil horizons from 131 forest grassland and cropland sites . We found that the concentration of soil amino sugars declined with soil depth ranging from 5.90mg g soil in O horizon soil and 1.56mg g soil at 020cm depth to 0.24mg g soil at 100cm depth . However the proportion of amino sugars in soil organic C significantly increased from 18.1mg g C in O horizon soil to 61.983.3mg g C in mineral soil . The concentration of amino sugars was positively correlated with soil organic C and microbial biomass C concentrations . The proportion of amino sugars in soil organic C was significantly higher in microaggregates and in soil with low carbon to nitrogen ratios . Microbial biomass carbon and soil pH had positive and negative effects respectively on the concentration of amino sugars in topsoil and together explained 58.8 of the total variation in the concentration of amino sugars . These results suggest that soil biogeochemical properties are more important than climatic variables and latitude in determining the long term persistence of microbial residues in soils .

@highlight Amino sugars account for 6.198.33 of soil organic carbon.
@highlight The concentration of amino sugars declines with soil depth.
@highlight The proportion of amino sugars in soil organic carbon is greater in deeper soil.
@highlight The concentration of amino sugars is greater in microaggregates.
