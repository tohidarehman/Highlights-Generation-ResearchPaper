 Roots and the associated rhizospheric activities regulate the mineralization of native soil organic matter which is referred to as the rhizosphere priming effect . Although the importance of RPE for carbon cycle has increasingly been recognized experimental evidence for how soil structural changes modulate the RPE is still unavailable . We addressed this issue by growing soybean plants C
