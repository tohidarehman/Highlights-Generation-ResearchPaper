 Accurate representations of canopy cover are essential for directing natural resource management efforts targeted at issues such as carbon storage habitat modeling fire spread water resources and ecosystem services . A two phase classification approach utilizing an iterative classification of high resolution aerial imagery to develop training data for a regional scale classification of percentage woody canopy cover using Sentinel 2 imagery is presented in this study and is tested for a large portion of South Texas . The modeled PWCC for the study area belonged to the respective classes as follows PWCC
