 The area known as Farrapos wetlands is a Protected Natural Area of Uruguay and is a RAMSAR site . It is characterized for being one of the most extensive fluvial wetlands of the country with an important heterogeneity of environments . The aim of this work was to survey native legumes and the nodulating rhizobial symbionts present in this protected area in order to contribute to the conservation of native biological resources . Nodules of legumes growing in their natural habitat were collected for the isolation of rhizobia . Interestingly each legume species presented nodules with distinct morphologies reinforcing the idea that nodule phenotype can be included as additional information in legume taxonomy studies . Nodulation ability of selected isolates was assessed in gnotobiotic conditions . Isolates were identified by analysing 16S rRNA sequences and characterized by phylogenetic analysis . Papilionoideae legumes harbour rhizobia from the

@highlight In natural conditions the association between rhizobia and its cognate legume is highly specific.
@highlight In Calliandra parvifolia two genera of rhizobia Rhizobium and Paraburkholderia were found as symbionts.
@highlight Several isolates reported in this paper may represent new legume rhizobia symbiotic associations.
@highlight Nodule phenotype may be included as an additional information for legume taxonomy.
