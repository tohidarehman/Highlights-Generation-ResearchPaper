 Urban green spaces provide multiple benefits and public parks in particular have a key role in supporting ecological and social sustainability in cities contributing to human nature interactions . We studied the interrelationships between uses experiences and the environment by adopting a novel concept of urban biocultural diversity . The concept identifies three interlinked spheres of urban BCD materialised lived and stewardship . We conducted place based research in 33 parks located in four European capitals Helsinki Berlin Bucharest and Lisbon . A total of 1474 visitors were interviewed concerning their motivations to use the park and their experiences during the visit . Using an open ended survey we revealed more than 50 motivations for park use and over 100 features people enjoyed during their visits . On the other hand visitors mentioned far fewer things that disturbed them . We revealed that despite the fact motivations to use parks were strongly human oriented visitors widely enjoyed the environmental characteristics of parks and especially nature . We found that parks located in neighbourhoods with low socio economic status and outside the central area of the city were structurally less diverse than parks located in the city core . The structurally diverse parks enhanced motivations to use them and increased overall enjoyments of the environment . We revealed clear differences in motivations and enjoyments between cities implying that the day to day practices of people using and experiencing nature varies between cities .

@highlight Motivations to use parks cantered around enjoyment of the environment.
@highlight Structural diversity of parks changed along the city gradient.
@highlight Structural diversity of parks enhanced diverse uses and enjoyments.
@highlight More visitors enjoyed nature in parks with high structural diversity.
