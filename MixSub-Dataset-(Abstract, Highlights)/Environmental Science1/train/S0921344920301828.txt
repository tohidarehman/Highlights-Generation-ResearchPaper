 Health care is one of the largest and fastest growing service sectors in OECD countries and a significant contributor to climate change . Health care is also indispensable for human well being . It is therefore crucial to understand how the health care sector can reduce its emissions without undermining its service quality .

We calculated the carbon footprints of Austrian health care providers and further decomposed the emissions attributable to hospitals the largest health care provider in Austria . We estimated detailed life cycle assessments of the carbon emissions attributable to energy use the use of selected pharmaceuticals and medical goods and induced private travel .
