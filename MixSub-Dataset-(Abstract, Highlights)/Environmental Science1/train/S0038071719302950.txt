 Climate change may profoundly influence soil organic carbon dynamics through effects on soil temperature and water but the mechanisms and magnitude of those effects remain uncertain . We measured the response of residue C and native SOC in six soils with diverse texture subjected to artificial heating after transplanting to a common field site . The soils three from each of two climatic zones in Canada were amended with

@highlight Greater loss of native SOC than residue C in warmer soil.
@highlight Similar losses of residue C in ambient and heated soil.
@highlight No effect of soil warming on distribution of residue C in aggregates.
@highlight Increased heterotrophic respiration with soil warming.
@highlight Temperature explains CO
@highlight flux more than soil water.
