 In a previous work we showed that the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos reduces the protective chemoreflex and baroreflex responses in rats . However whether the antidotes atropine and pralidoxime are capable of restoring these reflex functions remains unexplored . Rats were poisoned with CPF 30mg.kg

@highlight Atropine and pralidoxime distinctively restore chemoreflex impaired by chlorpyrifos poisoning.
@highlight Pralidoxime rescued the hypertensive and atropine reversed the bradycardic dysfunction.
@highlight Both antidotes improved the chemoreflex tachypneic response.
@highlight Combination of antidotes is important for cardiorespiratory chemoreflex boosting.
