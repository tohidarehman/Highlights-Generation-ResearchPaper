 This paper examines the perceived spill over effects of proximity to golf courses on life satisfaction based on a large scale individual survey conducted in Beijing in 2013 . We find a positive association between residential proximity to golf courses and life satisfaction . This association is more pronounced for residents living at the closest distance margins and tends to vary by housing and golf landscape characteristics . Additional results quantify the evidence on potential complementary effects of public green spaces and golf courses . Findings of this study suggest that club based green amenities should be considered in land use policies aiming to improve urban greenness and landscape .
