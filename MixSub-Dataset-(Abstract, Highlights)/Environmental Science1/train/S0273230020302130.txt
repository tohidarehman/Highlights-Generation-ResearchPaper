 Bisphenol A belongs to a group of chemicals used in the production of polycarbonate polysulfone and polyethersulfone which are used among other applications in the manufacture of dialyzers . While exposure to BPA is widespread in the general population dialysis patients represent a population with potentially chronic parenteral BPA exposures . To assess the potential risk of BPA exposure to dialysis patients through dialyzer use exposure estimates were calculated based on BPA levels measured by ultra high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry following extractions from dialyzers manufactured by Fresenius Medical Care . Extraction conditions included both simulated use leaching and exaggerated extractions to evaluate possible leachable and extractable BPA respectively from the devices . The mean BPA concentrations were 3.6 and 108.9ppb from simulated use and exaggerated extractions respectively from polycarbonate containing dialyzers . No BPA was detected from polypropylene containing dialyzers . Margins of Safety were calculated to evaluate the level of risk to patients from estimated BPA exposure from the dialyzers and the resulting MOS were 229 and 45 for simulated use and exaggerated extractions respectively . The findings suggest that there is an acceptable level of toxicological risk to dialysis patients exposed to BPA from use of the dialyzers tested in the current study .

@highlight Simulated use and exaggerated extractions conducted on dialyzers for BPA analysis.
@highlight BPA was measured in extracts of polycarbonate containing dialyzers.
@highlight Toxicological risk assessment conducted on measured BPA for hemodialysis exposure.
@highlight Even under exaggerated conditions acceptable level of risk was determined.
