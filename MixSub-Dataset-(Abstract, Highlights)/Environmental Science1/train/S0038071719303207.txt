 The kinetics of extracellular enzymes produced by soil microorganisms regulate soil organic matter decomposition and other ecosystem functions . Atmospheric nitrogen deposition creates a soil environment with elevated reactive N which is expected to affect the kinetic parameters

@highlight for C and N degrading hydrolytic enzymes decreases with increasing N addition levels.
@highlight and
@highlight for P degrading enzyme increase with N addition levels.
@highlight The
@highlight and
@highlight for PPO respond nonlinearly to N addition levels.
@highlight Soil acidification drives the decreased
@highlight for C degrading enzymes.
@highlight Decreased microbial respiration is due to decreased
@highlight and
@highlight for BG under N deposition.
