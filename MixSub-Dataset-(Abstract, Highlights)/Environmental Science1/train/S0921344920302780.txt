 Material stocks are the physical basis of production and consumption and shape the dynamics of resource use and socio economic outcomes . We present an inflow driven long term estimation of material stocks for the United Kingdom covering 12 major materials from 1800 to 2017 . We find the trajectory of the UK s stocks characterized by slow increases during the 19th century followed by rapid growth and a slowdown in recent years . After a slump following the 2007 8 financial crisis stock growth again accelerated to currently 1 per year . Per capita stocks barely increased during the 19th century . Proliferation far beyond population growth only started after WWI and pushed stocks to currently 272 tons capita . Since WWI material requirements for stock growth constituted a large share of domestic material consumption indicating the importance of stock stabilization for reducing the size of societies metabolism . We find that materials required for stock buildup were increasingly imported while more and more end of life metals and paper were exported . Over the past 60 years energy and CO

@highlight Continued expansion of UK material stocks at 1 per year.
@highlight Increasingly stock building materials are imported end of life material exported.
@highlight Efficiency gains in building and operating stocks counteracted by stock expansion.
@highlight Material stocks coupled to GDP first signs of relative decoupling since 1995.
