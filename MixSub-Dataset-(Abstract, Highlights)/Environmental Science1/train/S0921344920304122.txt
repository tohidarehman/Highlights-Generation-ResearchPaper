 Climate change exacerbates the vulnerability of water resources and water energy carbon nexus makes water management morecomplicated . This paper attempts to explore the water resource synergy management paths within urban metabolic system against the background of human actively respond to climate change . We hold that Climate change would aggravate water scarcity risk from a supply based perspective . Meanwhile the normal metabolism of water consumers and energy consumption and mitigation options against climate change would directly and indirectly respectively affect the water usage from a demand based perspective . Agriculture has great water saving potential resulting from drip irrigation and drought resistant technologies but the potentials would be gradually endangered by biomass crop popularization . Industrial water saving mainly lies in energy efficiency renewable energy and CO

@highlight Climate change exacerbate water crisis from supply and demand based perspectives.
@highlight Low carbon technologies increase water usage from an indirect demand perspective.
@highlight Agricultural water saving could compensate industrial water in the short terms.
@highlight BECCS will strengthen the nexus between agricultural and industrial water usage.
@highlight Climate change requires water synergy management of urban metabolic systems.
