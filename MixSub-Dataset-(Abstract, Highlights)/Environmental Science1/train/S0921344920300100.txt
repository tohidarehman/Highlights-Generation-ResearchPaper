 Proper disposal and resource recovery of spent batteries are crucial for environmental protection and sustainability . This study evaluated the adsorption performances of spent lithium iron phosphate and spent lithium manganate cathodes as adsorbents toward heavy metals in water . The effects of adsorption time initial adsorbate concentrations and co existing ions on adsorption kinetics were examined . SLFP and SLMO demonstrated outstanding adsorption capacities for heavy metals that were higher than or comparable with other reported adsorbents . SLFP shows adsorption capacities of 44.28 39.54 25.63 and 27.34 mg g

@highlight Cathodes from used or spent lithium ion batteries efficiently adsorb heavy metals from water.
@highlight Pristine and spent lithium iron phosphate and lithium manganate exhibited different adsorption kinetics and capacities.
@highlight Heavy metal adsorption on cathode adsorbents is characterized as endothermic chemisorption.
@highlight Spent LIB cathodes are potential cost effective adsorbents for heavy metal removal from water.
