 Tree killing forest disturbances such as storms and bark beetle outbreaks can lead to notable changes in the carbon balance and functioning of forest ecosystems . In this study the effects of a storm in 2010 followed by an outbreak of European spruce bark beetle

@highlight Similar effects of storm and
@highlight on soil C and microbiology were observed.
@highlight The amount of litter detritus was highest on beetle disturbed plots.
@highlight SOC stocks did not differ between undisturbed storm and beetle disturbed plots.
@highlight Abundances of ECM fungi and fungal and microbial biomass were lower on disturbed plots.
@highlight Time since disturbances storm 57yr vs. beetle 14yr probably influenced the comparison.
