 This study investigates if Cu and Pb act as endocrine disruptors affecting endometrial cells . Primary EnSCs and EnECs were exposed to Cu or Pb and assessed for viability decidualization apoptosis and proliferation on EnSCs and wound healing and adhesion capabilities on EnECs . Cu exposure decreased significantly cell viability in a dose dependent manner . Cu and Pb negatively affected

@highlight Cu decreases EnSC and EnEC viability.
@highlight Cu and Pb negatively affect
@highlight decidualization of EnSC.
@highlight Cu and Pb decreases adhesion and regeneration capability in EnEC.
