 Dissolved organic matter drives many fundamental biogeochemical processes in forest soil . However the molecular level characteristics of DOM derived from different types of tropical forest soils are poorly understood . Here water samples at different soil depths from tropical legume

@highlight Molecular characters of DOM in legume non legume tropical plantations were studied.
@highlight DOM particularly aromatic and low mass 300Da DOM was reduced with depth.
@highlight DOM at legume plantation had greater molecular weight and aromaticity.
@highlight DOM at legume plantation had greater microbial and protein contributions.
