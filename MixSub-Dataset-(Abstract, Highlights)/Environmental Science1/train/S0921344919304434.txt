 Dissipative losses of metals are unrecoverable material flows representing the real consumption of metals . They occur during any process in the global metal cycle from primary production to waste management and have different receiving mediums . Avoiding dissipative losses can reduce both primary material requirements and potential negative environmental impacts of metals . However there are currently no quantitative indicators available for the assessment of global dissipative losses of metals covering all processes before and after the use phase . Here we present three indicators the Dissipation to Extraction Ratio the Dissipation to Final Production Ratio and the Expected Lifetime in the Anthroposphere . These indicators are further applied to 18 metals . The results show that the severity of dissipative losses throughout the periodic table differs a lot . Dissipation ratios are lowest for mass metals like iron aluminum and nickel and highest for technology metals like gallium germanium and tellurium . Expected lifetimes vary between just months for metals with high dissipation ratios and up to a century for aluminum and iron . The assessment shows that there are important measures in material efficiency and recycling efforts to be taken to decrease dissipative losses for a wide range of metals . For each metal the most effective options for action can be identified based on our results .

@highlight Dissipative losses are unrecoverable material flows into a receiving medium.
@highlight Dissipation ratios compare annual dissipation to extraction and final production.
@highlight Expected lifetime in the anthroposphere quantifies the speed of dissipation.
@highlight Aluminum iron and nickel show lowest dissipation ratios among 18 metals.
@highlight Technology metals and by products have high dissipation ratios and low lifetime.
