 Recent advances in soil organic carbon formation indicate that labile plant C is disproportionately important for stable SOC pool because it is utilized more efficiently by soil microbes . Rhizodeposited C accounting for 520 of photosynthates are highly bioavailable and readily metabolized substrates for soil microbes . However it remains poorly understood how different microbial functional groups contribute to transforming rhizodeposited C to SOC . Here we synthesized 23 studies performing

@highlight The fate of rhizodeposited C in soil microbial groups was assessed with PLFA SIP.
@highlight Fungi and gram negative GN bacteria assimilated most of the rhizodeposited C.
@highlight Fungi have a higher capability to acquire rhizodeposited C than other microbes.
@highlight GN and fungi produced the most microbial residues via rhizodeposition derived C.
