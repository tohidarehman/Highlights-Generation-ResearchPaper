 Polar orbiting ocean color satellites such as Landsat 8 Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership and Sentinel 3 offer valuable image data for the derivation of water bathymetry in optically shallow environments . Because of the multi spectral limitation however it is challenging to derive bathymetry over global shallow waters without reliable mechanistic algorithms . In this contribution we present and test a physics based algorithm for improved retrieval of bathymetry with multi spectral sensors . The algorithm leverages the temporal variation of water column optical properties in two satellite measurements . By incorporating two remote sensing reflectance spectra in an optimization procedure it enhances the spectral constraining condition for the optimization thus leading to improved retrieval accuracy . This scheme is evaluated using synthetic multi spectral data . It is shown that the new approach can provide accurate estimation of water depths over 030m range with three types of benthic substrates and for a wide range of water column optical properties . Based on the degree of improvement Landsat 8 appears to be benefited the most followed by SNPP and then Sentinel 3 . The application of the new approach is demonstrated with satellite images over shallow waters dominated with coral reefs seagrass and sand respectively . This proof of concept study confirms the promise of multi spectral satellite sensors for accurate water depth retrieval by accounting for the temporal characteristics in multiple measurements suggesting a path forward for the derivation of bathymetry from the existing satellites over global shallow waters .
