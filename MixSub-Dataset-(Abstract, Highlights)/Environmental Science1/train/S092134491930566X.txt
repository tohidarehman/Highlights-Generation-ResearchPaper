 The theory of planned behavior allows researchers to identify the determinants of environmental behavior and subsequently target these factors in interventions . Multiple studies on conservation behaviors have recently applied this theoretical framework in both organizational and domestic settings . To shed more light on how the TPB was used in these studies we conducted a literature review with the following objectives 1 explore which individual green behaviors were studied though the lens of the TPB 2 understand how scholars have used the theory and what variance the theory has helped to explain and 3 formulate recommendations if necessary for improving the use of the theory . The review of the results from 126 publications demonstrated that the majority of scholars tend to overlook the importance of identifying and evaluating indirect variables that affect behaviors . More than half of the analyzed articles did not report the amount of explained variance which undermines the principal strength of the theory . Scholars could obtain more substantial and consistent results if the guidelines regarding the application of the theory are consistently respected . More specifically four aspects should be considered in the application of the theory choice of framework decision to extend the original model methodology and results . To help scholars overcome these commonly encountered problems this article suggests a roadmap with several guiding questions and possible answers .

@highlight The TPB was used to explore numerous conservation behaviors.
@highlight Scholars tend to overlook mediating variables when predicting green behaviors.
@highlight Additional variables consistently increase the predictive power of the theory.
@highlight A roadmap provides useful guidance to scholars that intend to apply the TPB.
