 Phytate is considered a poorly available plant P source but proved to be useful for particular soil bacteria strains . In soil free conditions it has been shown that bacteria locked up the mineralized phosphorus from phytate whereas bacterial grazers like nematodes were able to deliver P to plants . Here we aimed to determine if the interactions between phytate mineralizing bacteria bacterial grazer nematodes and mycorrhizal fungi could increase plant P acquisition from phytate in high P adsorbing soils .

@highlight In contrast to trees and ectomycorrhizal fungi bacteria can mineralize phytate.
@highlight We used a high P sorbing cambisol amended with phytate to study plant P acquisition.
@highlight We studied bacteria grazer nematodes ectomycorrhizal fungi interactions on plant P.
@highlight The ectomycorrhizal fungus and bacteria increased plant P use from phytate.
@highlight Non mycorrhizal plants depend on bacterial grazing to get P from soil phytate.
