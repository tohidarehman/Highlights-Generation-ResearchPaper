 Plastic recycling is mainly limited by their sorting as their natures forms and formulation are very numerous and most of them are strongly incompatible leading to poor mechanical properties . Several industrial sorting technologies exist and others are in development . However each of them has drawbacks . Especially NIR HSI is limited by the use of carbon black mainly as a pigment and UV agent in the case of thermoplastics . MIR HSI could be a suitable and viable alternative to resolve this issue . Hence this work based on laboratory FTIR ATR focuses on possible sources of spectral alteration which could impair identification of usual polymers using industrial MIR HSI . It aims to help simple and rapid laboratory characterization and give tools to avoid misidentification or enable specific segregation during industrial sorting . First acquisition parameters were degraded to simulate those imposed by industrial conditions short acquisition time diminished resolution and blank defaults . Then impact on formulations of usual WEEE plastics were evaluated with PE PP ABS and HIPS as matrices and carbon black calcite talc titanium oxide and some flame retardants as additives . Several patterns found in homemade standard samples were recognized within a stock of about one hundred of real waste samples .

@highlight FTIR ATR was studied to assess MIR HSI theoretical ability to sort plastics.
@highlight Limited resolution and SNR can strongly affect identification.
@highlight With 20w carbon black loading identification is harder but still possible.
@highlight Common fillers can be spotted and recognized on plastic spectra.
@highlight Some flame retardants are easily spottable and can disrupt identification.
