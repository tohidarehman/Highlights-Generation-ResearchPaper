 Strong earthquakes especially in continental mountainous areas can trigger extensive mass wasting producing large amounts of debris that accumulates along the hillslopes or in drainage channels . The coseismic deposits and disturbed slopes are prone to be reactivated or remobilized by heavy rainfalls in the subsequent years after the earthquake . Predicting how long post seismic landslide activity will return to the pre earthquake level is a key to risk assessment and management . However this is still poorly understood and lacks quantitative prediction approach . The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake triggered an unprecedented number of landslides creating an extraordinary natural laboratory to investigate the evolution of post seismic landslides and their impacts on environment . Using the vegetation recovery rate as an indicator we present the observational evidence of the post seismic landslide evolution based on MODIS NDVI time series between 2000 and 2018 . Using a simple vegetation recovery rate function we quantify the rate of vegetation regrowth in the Wenchuan earthquake affected area and discuss the decaying trend of post seismic landslide activities . Our findings show that 83 of the co seismic landslides become inactive within a decade . The NDVI trend suggests that landslide activity may return to the pre earthquake level within 18 years . The sensitivity of vegetation regrowth to post seismic landsliding thus offers a great potential to improve our understanding of the spatio temporal evolution of the post seismic landslide activities .
