 Large amounts of construction and demolition waste are generated annually and will increase in the future . Until now only a small fraction of concrete by products is re used as recycled concrete aggregates for the manufacture of concrete . In this paper the feasibility of using RCA obtained from old precast concrete block was investigated for the industrial scale production of new blocks . Concrete building blocks with different substitution rates of natural aggregates by the same volume fraction of RCA were manufactured in a factory and the mechanical properties and durability of concrete blocks were monitored . The results show that incorporating RCA slightly decreases the compressive strength and impairs the durability of concrete blocks . However the compressive strength of concrete blocks made with 100 RCA could reach 11.1MPa after 28 days which is within the requirement in Belgian codes for this type of block . The concrete blocks produced with 30 and 100 of RCA reached the strength capillary water absorption drying shrinkage and freeze thaw resistance requirements for concrete blocks specified by Belgian codes . A cradle to gate life cycle assessment was performed on both classical blocks with only NA and with substitution of NA by RCA . When considering the additional use of RCA from a nearby C D waste recycling centre the substitution of 30 or 100 of NA by RCA led to a reduction in the land use category in addition to supporting the implementation of the circular economy .

@highlight Compressive strength of block made with 100 RCA could reach 11.1MPa after 28 days.
@highlight Use of RCA slightly decreases compressive strength and impairs durability of block.
@highlight The environmental impact of block produced with RCA has been performed by using LCA.
@highlight Use of RCA from precast by products in the production of block can be envisaged.
