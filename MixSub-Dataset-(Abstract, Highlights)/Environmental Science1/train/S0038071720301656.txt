 Application of biochar to soils has been proposed as a novel approach to managing wood residuals enhancing soil carbon storage and improving soil fertility however the majority of biochar studies have been conducted in agricultural systems that rely on tillage and nutrient inputs associated with annual cropping schemes . Few studies have evaluated the influence of biochar on soil processes in semi natural rangeland ecosystems that feature more complex plant communities lack deep soil disturbance and have relatively few external nutrient inputs . In August 2018 biochar produced using wood waste from a lumber mill in Columbia Falls MT USA was applied to surface soils in replicated plots at an experimental ranch in western Montana to test the impact of biochar on soil C storage and nutrient management . A series of soil biochemical properties including total soil C and nitrogen microbial N functional genes available phosphorus and the net accumulation of nutrients below surface soil layer were evaluated over a one year period following biochar addition with or without a poultry litter based organic fertilizer . Biochar used alone slightly reduced soil NH

@highlight Biochar reduced soil inorganic N accumulation at depth over one season.
@highlight Biochar addition significantly increased surface soil biologically based P.
@highlight Biochar used alone had positive effect on available P accumulation at depth.
