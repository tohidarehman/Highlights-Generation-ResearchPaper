 Metaldehyde a xenobiotic cyclic ether is used as molluscicide of choice in agriculture and horticulture but recently its detection in drinking water sources has become a major cause of concern . We isolated eight new metaldehyde degrading bacterial strains from allotment and agricultural soils and identified a highly conserved gene cluster shared amongst one gamma and five beta proteobacteria and absent from closely related non degrading type strains . Chemical mutagenesis and heterologous expression in

@highlight 8 novel soil metaldehyde degrading bacterial strains were isolated and characterized.
@highlight Gene cluster responsible for the initial steps of metaldehyde degradation identified.
@highlight Metaldehyde degrading population in soil is proliferating in response to metaldehyde.
@highlight Accelerated biodegradation of metaldehyde was found in multiple soils.
