 Plastic bags are abundant globally and pose a significant amount of environmental and public health concerns . The purpose of this research is to examine individual variables that predict plastic bag consumption in 3 Northern Philippine municipalities that do not have plastic bag bans and exhibit wide variations in the quality of their solid waste management systems . These include Sarrat Vintar and Solsona in the province of Ilocos Norte . An equal number of respondents were surveyed from each municipality . Results suggest that age municipality dumping solid waste in public areas compared to dropping it off at designated locations and composting solid waste compared to dropping it off at designated locations are all predictors of weekly plastic bag consumption . Education variables were not predictors of weekly plastic bag consumption nor were perceptions of plastic bags as bad for the environment . This suggests that additional educational programs and incentives are needed at the local levels to reduce plastic bag consumption .

@highlight Age and municipality predicted weekly plastic bag consumption.
@highlight Dumping solid waste in public places predicted weekly plastic bag consumption.
@highlight Composting solid waste predicted weekly plastic bag consumption.
@highlight Perceiving plastic bags as convenient predicted weekly plastic bag consumption.
@highlight Education and reports of plastics as bad for the environment were not predictors.
