 Elevated nitrogen deposition and increased precipitation often occur simultaneously and have an interactive effect on terrestrial ecosystems particularly in N limited temperate forests . However the effects of interactions between elevated N deposition and increased precipitation on soil communities are unclear . In the present study we employed a novel approach to simulate N deposition and precipitation by applying N solution and water to the forest canopy and explored how throughfall chemical properties and soil nematode communities responded to elevated N deposition and increased precipitation . We found that N deposition positively affected nematode communities by increasing the abundance of nematodes in some bacterivorous and fungivorous nematode groups . In contrast increased precipitation suppressed bacterivorous and fungivorous nematodes particularly of those guilds related to nutrient enrichment . Our results suggest that the positive effects of N deposition on nematode communities may be cancelled out by increased precipitation in temperate forest ecosystems when elevated N deposition and increased precipitation occur simultaneously . This was not observed in previous studies simulating N deposition and precipitation which was probably due to that they have been mostly based on understory manipulation without considering canopy processes .

@highlight Precipitation and N deposition have a synergistic effect on forest ecosystems.
@highlight Canopy processes must be considered in N deposition and precipitation study.
@highlight Canopy N addition increases the abundance of soil microbial feeding nematodes.
@highlight Increased precipitation negatively affects the soil nematode community.
@highlight Increased precipitation cancels out the effects of N deposition on soil nematodes.
