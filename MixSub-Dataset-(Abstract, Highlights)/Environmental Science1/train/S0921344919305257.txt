 The production of electrical and electronic equipment is a fast growing industrial sector which also results in growing generation of waste electrical and electronic equipment . An efficient separation is a prerequisite in order to achieve a high recyclability of WEEE plastics and produce pure types of plastics . The scope of the paper is to investigate the influence of particle size on the recyclability of post shredding plastic fractions from WEEE pre processing . For this purpose different shredding technologies for WEEE their output particle size the sorting technologies and their required input particle size were investigated and compared . Sample analysis of plastic flakes provided from pre processors is performed . The results show that the different sorting technologies require different particle size ranges for efficient separation . Three scenarios were investigated in order to identify optimal output particle sizes for improved plastic recycling . The results suggest that a particle size between 1020 mm increases the sorting efficiency and thus recyclability of the plastic fractions and minimizes the losses into fines . Further recommendations to pre processors and recyclers include improving the communication between the end of life actors to standardize the particle size range as well as not to dispose the fine fraction but to find recyclers operating appropriate fines sorting technologies .

@highlight An adequate shredding technology for WEEE must be used to produce the optimal particle size for plastic sorting.
@highlight Every sorting technology have its own particle size range to work with highest separation efficiency.
@highlight The recommended particle size range of plastic flakes from WEEE treatment is 1020 mm.
@highlight Plastic flakes after pre processing should not be smaller than 10 mm to ensure proper recycling.
