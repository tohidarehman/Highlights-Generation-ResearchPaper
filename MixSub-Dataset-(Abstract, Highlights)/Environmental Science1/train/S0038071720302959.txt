 Increasing frequency and magnitude of climatic extremes such as heat waves are expected to enhance abiotic stresses on ecological communities . It has been proposed that ecological communities in disturbed habitats may be most sensitive to climatic extremes as disturbance may reduce density and diversity of higher trophic level organisms like predators . However there is little experimental evidence that climatic extremes indeed have stronger impact on functioning of such trophically downgraded ecosystems . Here we experimentally examine how removal of predators from soil communities affects plant performance under periodic heat waves . We used a native plant species and a congeneric native that is currently expanding its range because of climate change . We used soil nematode communities as the model system as these are most abundant soil animals and their communities are trophically diverse . Predatory nematodes were manually removed from intact soil nematode communities to create a trophically downgraded soil . Intact nematode communities and communities with reduced predatory nematodes were added separately to soils that were planted with either the native

@highlight No such effects were observed in a range expanding plant.
