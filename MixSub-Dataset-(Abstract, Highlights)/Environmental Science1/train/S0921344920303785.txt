 Macrobenthic species are considered as indicator organisms to characterize water quality . However few studies focused on the internal interaction between each species . In our research about 4 seasons and 20 sites of bio data in 2019 were sampled in Chenghai Lake . Based on correlation analysis the biological network was established to connect different species for analyzing internal linkages . Additionally we selected 10 biological indicators to assess habitat quality for each sites . As the results about 30 kinds of macrobenthic species were collected which were classified in 7 orders and 13 families . Firstly the oligochaete and chironomid became dominant throughout the year . Secondly the richness of gastropoda were relative small . According to the habitat quality assessment it was concluded that 4 areas had been disturbed possibly by exogenous pollutants . In general the habitat quality of north was better than the south the east was better than the west in Chenghai Lake . It was concluded that
