 Urbanisation is one of the most rapidly expanding forms of landscape modification by humans and leads to large scale loss and fragmentation of native habitat . This can alter the structure composition and function of remnant habitat . Therefore understanding the influence of both landscape and patch characteristics is important for understanding factors affecting the distribution of organisms in urbanised landscapes . Consequently the aim of this study was to establish the responses of forest dwelling mammals to landscape and habitat structure in an urban forest mosaic in the EThekwini Municipality Area Durban South Africa . Using presence and absence data of mammals from camera traps we modelled occupancy of species using the occupancy modelling framework . The occupancy by

@highlight Habitat and landscape characteristics affects species distribution in urban landscapes.
@highlight Responses of forest mammals to landscape and habitat structural variables in an urban forest mosaic were investigated.
@highlight Using the occupancy modelling framework we modelled the occupancy of various mammal species.
@highlight Some species appeared less vulnerable to the loss and degradation in habitat quality while others were vulnerable.
@highlight Landscape management approaches that consider multiple species are likely to be more successful.
