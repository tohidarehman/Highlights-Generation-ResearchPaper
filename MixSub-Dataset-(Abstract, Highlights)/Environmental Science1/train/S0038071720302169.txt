 The interactions of fungal guilds have recently been proposed as drivers of organic matter transformation in forest soils . We conducted a pot experiment with Norway spruce seedlings planted in spruce needle litter inoculated with several fungal strains belonging to different ecological guilds to assess how the fungi and their interactions affect the transformation of humic substances and phosphorus in the litter . Several methods for the characterization of P forms and HS were employed including

@highlight Fungal interactions affect the flow of phosphorus in spruce needle litter.
@highlight Fungal interactions direct the transformation of decaying organic matter.
@highlight Dark septate fungi increase a share of carboxylic moieties in the humus.
