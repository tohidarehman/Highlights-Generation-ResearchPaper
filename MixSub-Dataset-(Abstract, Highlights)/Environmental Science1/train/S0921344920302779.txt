 The increasing demand for water in urban areas of developing countries has been given more importance to rainwater harvesting techniques in the last decades . However there is still a lack of general approaches to show and compare the potential to benefit effectively from direct roof runoff at different locations . Past studies mainly focused on specific design conditions making it difficult to interpret and upscale their results in zones with similar conditions . This research explores the influence of rainfall characteristics and design parameters storage tank size catchment area and daily water demand on rainwater harvesting systems designed for water supply . Sixteen locations in Ecuador with varying hydroclimatic characteristics were selected to evaluate our methodology . A mass balance method using satellite records of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission was employed to estimate optimal dimensions based on the reliability of the system . Our results suggest that locations with similar annual rainfall and seasonality have similar performances of rainwater harvesting systems . Based on that premise regional approaches can be formulated . They can be employed as a tool to support decision makers promoting policies related to rainwater harvesting at local and regional scales .

@highlight Designing rainwater harvesting systems depends on rainfall and seasonality
@highlight Design curves were obtained for different regions in Ecuador
@highlight Area volume and water demand are key design parameters
