 In light of the environmental policy orientation of continuous upgrading emission limits quantitatively understanding the comprehensive cost of wastewater treatment of chemical industrial parks a common landscape globally will be vital for facilitating sustainable water management of the parks . This study modeled the economic cost of wastewater treatment in chemical industrial parks from the perspective of life cycle thinking . The full process cost of wastewater treatment is accounted including freshwater withdrawal construction and capital costs of wastewater treatment facilities operation costs sludge treatment costs and feed in tariffs of wastewater to centralized wastewater treatment plants of the park . After applying the model to HSEDA a typical chemical industrial park we found the total wastewater treatment cost of the chemical industrial park in 2016 was 654 million Chinese Yuan accounting for 29 of the tax revenue of the park . Energy chemicals and labor costs in the sum accounted for more than 60 of the full process cost . The cost of freshwater withdrawal in plant treatment cost and CWWTP cost accounted for 54 33 and 13 of the total cost respectively . The top two pillar industriesthe dyestuff manufacturing industry and the pharmaceutical industry have a cost of 29 CNY and 21 CNY per ton of wastewater respectively . Moreover the marginal cost increment associated with a much stricter emission standard by targeting TN control is discussed by employing different technologies . Finally key measures for improving wastewater treatment in the chemical industrial park are proposed .

@highlight Wastewater treatment cost of a chemical industrial park is modeled by life cycle thinking.
@highlight Annual cost 654 Million 27 CNY t accounted for 28.6 of the parks tax revenue.
@highlight Removal TN further to 12 mg L will request a cost of 5.2 CNY t adding 13 more cost.
@highlight A water stewardship system driven by systematic thinking driven is proposed.
