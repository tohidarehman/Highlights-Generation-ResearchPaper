 Fire is an ecological disturbance that alters soil microbiomes and the functions they mediate in terrestrial ecosystems . Soil microbial diversity in Mediterranean Basin ecosystems shows resilience to fire following the restoration of plant soil feedbacks . We hypothesised that microbial functions related to organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling might show similar patterns of recovery . We quantified the rates of microbial respiration and enzymatic activities related to C N and P cycling in three 20 year fire chronosequences including 150 transects in 50 burned and unburned plots in a paired experimental design . Microbial functions except for the hydrolysis of N compounds were sensitive to fire but recovered the levels of unburned plots in approximately 2024 years . The recovery of microbial functions responded to abiotic and biotic drivers . Total soil nitrogen concentration was overall strong predictor of microbial functions . In addition fungal phylogenetic diversity significantly explained the post fire trajectories of potentially mineralizable C while bacterial diversity was involved in the restoration of organic C and P hydrolysis . Our results suggest that the long term recovery of soil biodiversity in Mediterranean Basin ecosystems creates resilience to restore essential ecosystem functions after fire .

@highlight Fire reduces decomposition rates and enzymatic activities related to C and P cycles.
@highlight Recovery of ecosystem functions may take 20yr in fireprone ecosystems.
@highlight Resilient microbial communities restore the key ecosystem functions.
