 Gastric cancer ranks as the third leading cause of cancer related death worldwide . The uncontrolled tumor growth and robust metastasis are key factors to cause the cancer patient death . Mechanistically aberrant activation of Notch and NF B signaling pathways plays pivotal roles in the initiation and metastasis of gastric cancer . Despite great efforts have been made in recent decades the effective drug against the advanced and metastatic gastric cancer is still lacking in the clinical setting . In this study we found that triptonide a small molecule purified from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F effectively suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft mice without obvious toxicity at the doses we tested resulting in potent anti gastric cancer effect with low toxicity . Triptonide markedly inhibited human metastatic gastric cancer cell migration invasion proliferation and tumorigenicity . Molecular mechanistic studies revealed that triptonide significantly reduced Notch1 protein levels in metastatic gastric cancer cells through degrading the oncogenic protein Notch1 via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway . Consequently the levels of Notch1 downstream proteins RBPJ IKK IKK were significantly diminished and nuclear factor kappa B phosphorylation was significantly reduced . Together triptonide effectively suppresses gastric cancer growth and metastasis via inhibition of the oncogenic Notch1 and NF B signaling pathways . Our findings provide a new strategy and drug candidate for treatment of the advanced and metastatic gastric cancer .
