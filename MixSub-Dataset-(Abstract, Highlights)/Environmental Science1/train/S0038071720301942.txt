 Rather than simple accumulation of individual populations microorganisms in natural ecosystems form complex ecological networks that are critical to maintain ecosystem functions and services . Although various studies have examined the patterns of microbial community diversity and composition across spatial gradients whether microbial co occurrence relationships follow similar patterns remains an open question . In this study we determined the biogeographic patterns of microbial co occurrence networks of bacteria fungi and nitrogen fixer via analyses of high throughput amplicon sequencing data of 16S rRNA ITS and

@highlight Microbial co occurrence networks for six American forests were analyzed.
@highlight More complex co occurrence networks were found in temperate forests.
@highlight Temperature was a major factor mediating microbial co occurrence patterns.
