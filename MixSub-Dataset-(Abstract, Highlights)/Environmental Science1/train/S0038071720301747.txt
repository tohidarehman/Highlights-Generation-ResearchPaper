 Climate change is expected to affect rainfall dynamics and the global average temperature . Here we evaluated the effects of those changes the intense water deficit and warming on a tropical grassland soil . We tested the correlation between soil extracellular enzyme activities and soil respiration CO

@highlight The temperature increase of 2C had low influence in a tropical grassland soil.
@highlight The soil was more vulnerable to a drought that decreased moisture by 50 .
@highlight  glucosidase xylanase and acid phosphatase were the most affected enzymes.
