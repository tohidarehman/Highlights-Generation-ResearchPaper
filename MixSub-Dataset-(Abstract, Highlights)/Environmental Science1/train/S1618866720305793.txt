 The use of throwlines has made it easier for climbers on the ground to set a tie in point near the top of the tree . But doing so may increase the likelihood of TIP failure because smaller branches have less load bearing capacity and close inspection of the TIP from the ground is difficult . We measured rope tension during climber ascents on stationary rope systems on ten TIPs from two species . The climber ascended using three techniques and we repeated trials when trees were in and out of leaf . From the load time history of each trial we computed the magnitude and frequency of loading and we counted the number of peak loads . Ascending with two foot ascenders and a hand ascender induced greater loads than footlocking or using two foot ascenders and gripping the rope by hand and there were distinct loading frequencies when using two foot ascenders but not footlocking . The presence of leaves was associated with more peak loads but not when footlocking . The presence of leaves increased the maximum load induced when ascending on foot and hand ascenders but decreased the maximum load when footlocking . Our results both align with and address important limitations of previous work .

@highlight Two experiments demonstrated the effect of ascent technique and the presence of leaves on the magnitude and frequency of loading during climber ascents into ten trees five individuals each of two species . Consistent with previous work measured loads were maximally 1.5 times the climbers weight with his climbing gear . Loading frequency was different when using two foot ascenders which featured two distinct frequenciesone approximately twice the other compared to footlocking which showed an approximately six fold range of loading frequencies .
