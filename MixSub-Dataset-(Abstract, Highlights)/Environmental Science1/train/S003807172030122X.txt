 Microbes play critical roles in the cycling of nutrients in forest ecosystems . Many studies have shown that the application of organic fertilizer can alter bacterial diversity however the responses of soil microbial functional genes to organic fertilization have not been elucidated as yet . We examined the responses of the abundance diversity and composition of soil microbial functional genes under five years of fertilization . This fertilization involved low and high application rates of biogas slurry at 250 and 375m
