 Aerobic methane oxidation is driven by both abiotic and biotic factors which are often confounded in the soil environment . Using a laboratory scale reciprocal inoculation experiment with two native soils and the gamma irradiated fraction of these soils we aim to disentangle and determine the relative contribution of abiotic and biotic controls of methane oxidation during re colonization . Methane uptake was appreciably higher in incubations containing gamma irradiated paddy than upland soil despite the initial difference in the methanotrophic community composition . This suggested an overriding effect of the soil edaphic properties which positively regulated methane oxidation . Community composition was similar in incubations with the same starting inoculum based on quantitative and qualitative

@highlight Relative importance of a biotic controls of methane oxidation was determined.
@highlight Edaphic properties seem to be more important in regulating methane oxidation.
@highlight Initial composition determines the trajectory of methanotroph succession.
@highlight Type II methanotrophs were favored during re colonization.
