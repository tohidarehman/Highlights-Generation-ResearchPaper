 Resveratrol has a protective effect on osteoarthritis nevertheless the underlying mechanisms of RES towards obesity related OA are still unclear . This study is aimed to determine whether leptin resistant mechanism presents in articular cartilage of obesity related OA and whether the protective effect of RES is involved in the regulation of leptin signal by affecting suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 . Male C57BL 6J mice were fed with standard chow diet high fat diet or high fat diet with RES for 22weeks . Knee joints of mice were evaluated by histological and immunohistochemistry analysis . Serum level of leptin was measured by ELISA . The leptin leptin receptor SOCS3 mRNA expression and JAK2 STAT3 OB Rb and SOCS3 protein expression in cartilage were determined by real time RT PCR and western blot . In addition SW1353 cells were pretreated with or without AG490 and stimulated with leptin in the presence or absence of RES to detect JAK2 STAT3 matrix metalloproteinase 13 and SOCS3 expression . We found that HFD could induce obesity related OA and RES prevented its progression . Serum leptin and mRNA expression in cartilage was up regulated by HFD while RES ameliorated the elevation . Besides RES significantly inhibited the JAK2 STAT3 signaling pathway in cartilage as well as SOCS3 . In in vitro study RES exhibited the same effect in SW1353 cells which stimulated with leptin . In conclusion no significant leptin resistance existed in cartilage of obesity related OA and the inhibitory effect of RES on obesity related OA via alleviating JAK2 STAT3 signaling pathway is independent of SOCS3 .
