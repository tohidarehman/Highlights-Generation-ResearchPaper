 The widespread use and high abuse liability of tobacco products has received considerable public health attention in particular for youth who are vulnerable to nicotine addiction . In this study adult and adolescent squirrel monkeys were used to evaluate age related metabolism and pharmacokinetics of nicotine after intravenous administration . A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was created to characterize the pharmacokinetic behaviors of nicotine and its metabolites cotinine

@highlight A PBPK model was developed for nicotine in adult and juvenile monkeys
@highlight Juvenile monkeys clear nicotine and cotinine faster than adults
@highlight Age dependent differences in monkeys may help inform nicotine kinetics in humans
