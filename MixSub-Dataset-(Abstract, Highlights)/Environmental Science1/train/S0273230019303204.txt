 In 2016 one person died and others had neurological sequelae during a clinical trial with BIA 102474 carbamoyl lH imidazol 4 yl pyridine 1 oxide a novel fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor being developed for the treatment of medical conditions such as pain . Prior to the clinical trial a full battery of regulatory toxicology tests were carried out and this paper describes the genotoxicity mutagenicity tests undertaken with BIA 102474 using the Ames

@highlight In a phase 1 trial with the FAAH inhibitor BIA 102474 several subjects were hospitalized with neurological symptoms.
@highlight Mutagenicity was evaluated using the Ames reverse mutation and
@highlight WP2
@highlight A forward mutation tests.
@highlight Genotoxicity was evaluated the chromosome damage assay in human lymphocytes and the micronucleus test in mice.
@highlight None of the test results were judged to be positive with regards to the mutagenicity genotoxicity of BIA 10 2474.
