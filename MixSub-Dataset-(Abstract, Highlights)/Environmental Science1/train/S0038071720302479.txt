 In the last 100 years climate warming has been affecting the European Alps faster and more severely than globally observed temperature patterns . Temperature changes are known to affect soil properties and microbial community structures and land use change in Europe is an expected socio economic consequence of climate change . However few studies have simultaneously investigated how land use and climate related changes shape microbial communities in this region . Therefore here we have investigated sites within a Long Term Socio Ecological Research area in South Tyrol characterizing soil properties and microbial communities and diversities . We investigated three important land use types at 1500m above sea level as well as an elevational gradient of pastures .

@highlight Alpine meadows differed most clearly in terms of soil properties from forests and pastures.
@highlight Elevation and elevation dependent soil properties shaped prokaryotic and fungal communities.
@highlight Land use affected mainly the fungal microbiome.
@highlight Clear indicator taxa for land use variations and elevation were established.
@highlight Disturbances e.g. drought fertilization seem to increase soil microbial diversities.
