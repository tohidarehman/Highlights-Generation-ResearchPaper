 Mexican sandy beaches are a natural resource that provides environmental services and contribute to the economic growth of the country . However due to mismanagement of solid waste discharges of wastewaters and other land and marine activities they can be polluted by microplastics . This research aimed to quantify and classify the microplastics found in Mexican beaches . Samples were taken in 33 beaches along the five marine regions of the country following a systematic method that allows comparison of results . Microplastics concentration varied from 31.7545.8MP m

@highlight The first national assessment of microplastics in Mexican beaches is presented.
@highlight A standardized straight and replicable methodology is described.
@highlight The concentration of microplastics was higher in the Gulf of California.
@highlight Majority of microplastics were rigid and semirigid fragments made of polyolefin. and white
