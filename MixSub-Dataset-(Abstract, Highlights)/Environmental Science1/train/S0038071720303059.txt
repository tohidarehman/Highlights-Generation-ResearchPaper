 The nitrification inhibitor 3 4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate is used to limit nitrogen losses incurred following nitrification of applied N fertilisers . Inhibitor efficacy changes with soil conditions including pH and organic matter content both of which can be stratified down the soil profile . An incubation study was conducted using acidic soil that exhibited pH stratification . Soil samples were collected from the field in 2cm depth increments to a depth of 10cm . Two liming treatments were applied to each depth where the pH

@highlight Liming significantly improved DMPP efficacy.
@highlight Nitrification rates increase with liming.
@highlight Highest DMPP efficacy occurred in layers below 4cm for limed soils.
@highlight AOB
@highlight abundance decreases with soil depth.
@highlight AOB
@highlight gene copies only present at 810cm in limed soils.
