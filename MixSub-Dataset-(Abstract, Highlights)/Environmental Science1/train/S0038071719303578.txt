 Microbial activity in drylands is mediated by the magnitude and frequency of growing season rain events that will shift as climate change progresses . Nitrogen is often co limiting with water availability to dryland plants . This study investigated how microbes important to the nitrogen cycle and soil N availability varied temporally and spatially in the context of a long term rainfall variability experiment in the northern Chihuahuan Desert . Specifically biological soil crust chlorophyll content fungal abundance and inorganic N were measured in soils adjacent to individuals of the grassland foundation species

@highlight Microbes and nutrients did not respond to rainfall magnitude or frequency.
@highlight Biocrust chlorophyll but not fungal abundance was higher in watered plots.
@highlight Biocrusts and fungi were more abundant near plants.
@highlight Rainfall increased soil NH
@highlight  but the decline in NH
@highlight did not differ by event size.
@highlight Little
@highlight N added to biocrusts was detected in plants after tracer addition.
