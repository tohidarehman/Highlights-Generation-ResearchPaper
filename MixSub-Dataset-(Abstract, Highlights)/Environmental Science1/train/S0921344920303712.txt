 Promoting waste source separation is one of the policy priorities for public authorities at all levels in China as well as other developing countries undergoing an extremely rapid expansion in waste generation . This paper views the selective waste collection schemes in pilot cities of China as one typical nudging policy and empirically examines its impacts on household waste source separation . Using a novel nationally representative dataset from the Chinese General Social Survey we find that the pilot program significantly increases the frequency of household waste sorting which are reinforced for people with high levels of social trust or low individualism . In addition further evidence points to that the pilot program not only increases the frequency of household waste source separation in neighboring cities but also prominently stimulates waste prevention and reduction practices in targeted people . Finally waste related knowledge and interpersonal interaction are likely operative channels of impacts .

@highlight This study examines the link between the selective waste collection schemes and waste source separation in China.
@highlight The pilot program significantly enhances the frequency of household waste sorting.
@highlight Social trust increases the effectiveness of the pilot program whereas individualism decreases it.
@highlight The pilot program has pronounced spillover effects on both neighboring cities and other waste related behaviors.
@highlight Interpersonal interaction and waste related knowledge are likely operative channels of impacts.
