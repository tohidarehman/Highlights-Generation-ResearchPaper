 Currently natural resources are consumed at an alarming rate than their production . This imposes unprecedented pressure on the environment . The problem seems to get worse with the present increase in population and demand for infrastructures . To alleviate these and other related problems a circular approach to construction material flow is crucial . Recycling construction and demolition wastes to generate high quality materials is essential to ensure materials circularity in the construction sector .

@highlight An effective and cheap method of sorting and recycling EoL concrete into clean aggregates introduced.
@highlight ADR and HAS technologies provide a prospective future to fully close the materials loop and to effectively implement circular economy in the construction sector.
@highlight ADR and HAS are mobile technologies and this prompts additional benefit for on site recycling of EoL concrete waste.
@highlight Concrete made with coarse and fine recycled aggregates processed by ADR and HAS display comparable compressive strength as the reference concrete.
