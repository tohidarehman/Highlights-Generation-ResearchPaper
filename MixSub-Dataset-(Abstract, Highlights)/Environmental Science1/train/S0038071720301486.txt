 Urbanisation involves major changes in environmental conditions such as light temperature humidity and noise levels but the effect of urbanisation on soil conditions and soil biodiversity has received less attention . The reported effects on species richness across a rural to urban landscapes are not unequivocal . Positive negative and neutral effects have been found but what is causing this ambiguity in the relationship between species richness and urbanisation is poorly understood . Here we tested whether and how urbanisation affects isopod diversity and whether this depends on habitat soil type . We recorded isopod species presence and soil type in each 1km

@highlight Urbanisation effects on soil fauna diversity depend on soil type.
@highlight Community mean drought resistance and body size of isopods increase with urbanisation.
@highlight Functional traits of soil fauna species predict shifts in biodiversity.
