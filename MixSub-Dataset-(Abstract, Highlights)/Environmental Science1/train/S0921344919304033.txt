 Greenhouse gas burdens of steel and aluminum production and life cycle benefits of vehicle lightweighting in China were evaluated . Production of advanced high strength steel and wrought aluminum have average cradle to gate GHG emissions of 3.9 and 17.5kg CO

@highlight Cradle to gate GHG burdens of aluminum and AHSS production in China are presented.
@highlight Fuel savings and cradle to grave GHG reductions from lightweighting in China are evaluated.
@highlight Lightweighting using AHSS has net GHG savings in all cases.
@highlight Maximum GHG savings occur using aluminum in cases with high on road fuel savings.
@highlight Congested traffic conditions favor emission reductions from lightweighting.
