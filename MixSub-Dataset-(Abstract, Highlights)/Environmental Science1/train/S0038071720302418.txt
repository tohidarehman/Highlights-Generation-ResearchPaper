 Microbial carbon use efficiency measures the partitioning between anabolic and catabolic processes . While most work on CUE has been based on carbon mass flows the roles of organic C energy contents and microbial energy demand on CUE have been rarely considered . Thus a bioenergetics perspective could provide new insights on how microorganisms utilize C and ultimately allow evaluating their role in C stabilization in soils . Recently the calorespirometric ratio the ratio of heat dissipation and respirationhas been used to characterize the efficiency of microbial growth in soils . Here we formulate a coupled mass and energy balance model for microbial growth and provide a generalized relationship between CUE and CR . In the model we consider two types of organic C in soils an added substrate and the native soil organic matter to also account for priming effects . Furthermore we consider both aerobic and fermentation metabolic pathways . We use this model as a framework to generalize previous formulations and generate hypotheses on the expected variations in CR as a function of substrate quality metabolic pathways and microbial traits . In turn the same equations can be used to estimate CUE from measured CR .

@highlight A general mass and energy balance framework for soil is proposed.
@highlight The framework is used to interpret observed calorespirometric ratios CR in soils.
@highlight CR depends on rates and microbial yields for different metabolic pathways.
@highlight CR can be used to estimate C use efficiency CUE for given metabolic pathway.
@highlight The framework links CR CUE and soil organic matter priming with a simple formula.
