 Deep rooting perennial grasses are promising feedstocks for biofuel production especially in marginal soils lacking organic material nutrients and or that experience significant water stress . Perennial grass roots influence surrounding soil conditions and microbial activities and produce extracellular polymeric substances composed primarily of extracellular polysaccharides . These polymers can alleviate microbial moisture and nutrient stress and enhance soil characteristics through improved water retention and aggregate stabilitywhich may in turn enhance carbon persistence . In this study we used a

@highlight Switchgrass SG roots enhance soil extracellular polysaccharide EPSac content.
@highlight Monosaccharide hexose pentose ratios indicate microbial origin of EPSac.
@highlight SG roots enhance available C and cause diurnal changes in soil moisture.
@highlight Soil aggregation covaries positively with EPSac and is enhanced in drier soil.
@highlight SG cultivation in the field enhances EPSac content relative to annual row crops.
