 Operations management is a core organizational function involved in the management of activities to produce and deliver products and services . Appropriate operations decisions rely on assessing and using information a task made more challenging in the Big Data era . Effective management of data along with staff capabilities support firms to leverage big data analytics and organizational learning in support of sustainable supply chain management outcomes . The current study uses dynamic capability theory as a foundation for evaluating the role of BDA capability as an operational excellence approach in improving sustainable supply chain performance . We surveyed mining executives in the emerging economy of South Africa and received 520 valid responses . We used Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling to analyze the data . The findings show that big data analytics management capabilities have a strong and significant effect on innovative green product development and sustainable supply chain outcomes . Big data analytics talent capabilities have a weaker but still significant effect on employee development and sustainable supply chain outcomes . Innovation and learning performance affect sustainable supply chain performance and supply chain innovativeness has an important moderating role . A contribution of the study is identifying two pathways that managers can use to improve sustainable supply chain outcomes in the mining industry based on big data analytics capabilities .
