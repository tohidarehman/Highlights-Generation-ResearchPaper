 Northern latitude tundra heaths have accumulated large amounts of organic carbon in the soil . Changes in climatic conditions such as temperature and winter precipitation might affect the C balance and potentially change these tundra ecosystems from being C sinks to sources of CO

@highlight More snow summer warming and shrub removal increase arctic tundra net CO2 emissions.
@highlight Snow effect on carbon balance due to delayed leafing and low spring photosynthesis.
@highlight Warming effect on carbon balance due to increased ER and unchanged GEP.
@highlight Carbon isotope composition may indicate increased decomposition of old SOM by warming.
@highlight Shrub removal effects on carbon balance mainly due to reduced photosynthesis.
