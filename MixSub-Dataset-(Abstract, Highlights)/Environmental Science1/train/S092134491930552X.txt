 With todays continued drive to increase recycling rates of plastics the low hanging fruit of clean mono streams of plastic waste has long since been picked . If Europes ambitious recycling targets are to be met plastics waste streams that have until now been labeled problematic and have consistently been sent to incineration must be considered as well . One such stream is the sink fraction obtained from float sink sorting of mixed post consumer packaging waste . It is a very complex stream in terms of composition . Moreover it contains a sizeable amount of PVC which is considered detrimental to further mechanical recycling of any mixed plastic waste . Within the current research the sink fraction was extensively analyzed for composition and mechanical properties as well as treated for removal of PVC and non ferrous metals . Subsequently the Design from Recycling strategy was applied to successfully develop a new product with this material called the Greentile . The Greentile was effectively manufactured and found to be a useful construction element for slanted green roofs .

@highlight Design from Recycling was applied to bring a complex plastic waste stream sink fraction from incineration to recycling.
@highlight This Greentile product passed mechanical load simulations outdoor testing LCA and an exploratory market study.
@highlight PVC content remains a challenge for the complex sink fraction.
@highlight The composition of the sink fraction may shift over the coming years depending on changes in policy state of technology and waste management systems.
