 Endothelial mesenchymal transition is a frequent event in endothelial dysfunction which is associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension . MiR 181 family members exert diverse effects in multiple biological processes . However the relationships between miR 181b 5p and EndMT in PAH are not well understood . In this study Sprague Dawley rats were injected with monocrotaline to establish PAH model and primary rat pulmonary arterial endothelial cells were treated with TNF TGF1 and IL 1 in combination to induce EndMT . Then we explored miR 181b expression and examined its functional role in PAH . Our data showed that miR 181b was down expressed in PAH and its overexpression attenuated the hemodynamics pulmonary vascular hypertrophy right ventricular remodeling and EndMT process in MCT induced PAH rats . In I EndMT rPAECs we observed that inducing miR 181b reversed the decrease of endothelial markers and increase of mesenchymal markers . However knockdown of miR 181b induced similar effects to EndMT . In addition endocan and TGFBR1 levels were also increased in EndMT which were negatively regulated by miR 181b . Luciferase activity results indicated that endocan and TGFBR1 were direct target genes of miR 181b . In summary our findings firstly demonstrate that the beneficial effect of miR 181b on PAH may be associated with endocan TGFBR1 mediated EndMT providing a new insight into the diagnosis and treatment of PAH .
