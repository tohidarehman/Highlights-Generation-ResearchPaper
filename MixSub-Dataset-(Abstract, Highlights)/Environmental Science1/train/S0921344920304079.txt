 Waste printed circuit boards were pretreated by either microwave or conventional pyrolysis prior to acid leaching processes . Microwave pyrolysis can provide higher weight loss of waste PCBs and better metal recycling than conventional pyrolysis . After microwave and conventional pyrolysis of waste PCBs the overall copper recovery rates of two stage acid leaching can be up to approximately 96 and 75 respectively . The gold recovery rates of thiourea leaching from microwave and conventional pyrolyzed PCBs were approximately 80 and 69 respectively . Therefore size reduction processes for the pretreatment of waste PCBs would not be necessary as long as microwave pyrolysis is applied prior to hydrometallurgical processes . The gold recovery rates of this study should be credible since the sum of recovery and non recovery rates was close to 100 . The initial acid leaching of copper may be governed by the copper content in the PCBs as well as the concentration of oxidizing agent in the leaching solution . Besides the reaction rate of thiourea leaching of microwave pyrolyzed PCBs may be largely influenced by the thickness of product layer . Both acid and thiourea leaching experimental results were better fitted by the pseudo second order reaction model . However the maximum recovery rate determined by using the pseudo first order reaction model should be more reasonable .
