 This paper wishes to add to the rich literature of studies exploring the reasons behind the energy efficiency gap . To this direction it presents the results of a stated preference survey conducted on a representative sample of Greek households via computer assisted web interviewing in the context of the Consumer Energy Efficiency Decision making project . The survey was designed and conducted so as to reach every type of household and gather information on the factors influencing households energy efficiency choices . The emphasis was given on certain issues that previous studies identified as needing further research such as the impact of EU labelling scheme on consumers decision making the connection between pro environmental behaviour and willingness to invest in more energy efficient appliances and the role of peer effects misinformation about current electricity prices and imperfect understanding of energy operating costs on the energy efficiency gap . The findings of the survey are not an end to itself but a vehicle for behavioural research in energy efficient decisions . The data collected and analysed can be used to populate theoretical models regarding energy efficiency gap and determine the degree to which each factor contributes to the phenomenon . Moreover they could help decision makers in better understand the energy paradox and thus could contribute to crafting better public policy responses that would maximise private and social benefits associated with the adoption of energy efficient choices .

@highlight A stated preference survey explores the reasons behind the energy efficiency gap.
@highlight The impact of current EU labels on energy efficient investments is investigated.
@highlight Consumers are not inattentive to energy efficiency but they suffer from other biases.
@highlight Monetary labels could encourage consumers to purchase more efficient appliances.
@highlight There is a significant heterogeneity in consumers investment behaviour.
