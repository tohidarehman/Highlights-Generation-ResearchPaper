 The ameliorating effect of deep banding of nutrient rich organic amendments termed subsoil manuring on improving physical structure of sodic high clay subsoils has been often attributed to organic amendments

@highlight Nutrient rich organic amendments enhanced deep root proliferation in sodic clay subsoils.
@highlight Root length density was positively correlated with the formation of large macroaggregates.
@highlight The stimulation of microbial growth partly contributed to root induced macroaggregation.
@highlight The effectiveness of wheat straw NPKS was attributed to marked increase in fungal growth.
@highlight Plant roots showed a contrasting effect on clay dispersion.
