 Management of the soil microbial community to increase crop productivity is one of the main challenges of modern agriculture and bacterial inoculants can help to overcome this challenge . In this work two plant growth promoting bacteria were evaluated under contrasting soil conditions in order to test a rhizosphere ecology model . This model states that plants select for phosphate solubilizers in poor nutrient soils and Indolic Compounds producers in rich nutrient soils . Rice plants were single or co inoculated with strains of

@highlight Bacterial plant growth promotion effect was successfully predicted by functional traits.
@highlight Microbial inoculation efficiency was diversity dependent with greater effects in low diversity.
@highlight Microbial production of plant hormones was negatively correlated to nutrient solubilization.
@highlight Number of keystone taxa decreased with diversity but their network influence increased.
