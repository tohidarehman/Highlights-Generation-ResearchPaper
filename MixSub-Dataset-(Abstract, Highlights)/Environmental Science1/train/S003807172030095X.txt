 Arbuscular mycorrhizal plants and fungi associate with lower soil organic matter higher pH lower phosphorus and higher nitrogen than ectomycorrhizal ones . However soil conditions correlate with climatic factors and we suggest that temperature and humidity have also direct roles in the success of mycorrhiza types . The hypothesis here is that EM perform better at low temperatures than AM and AM resist drought better than EM .

@highlight Arbuscular mycorrhiza AM may resist drought better than ectomycorrhiza EM .
@highlight EM may resist low temperature better than AM.
@highlight Drought reduced AM formation but not EM in dual mycorrhizal
@highlight More EM formed at 14 than at 20 and 26C and more AM at 20 and 26 than at 14C.
@highlight Temperature may be a more important determinant for mycorrhiza than thought before.
