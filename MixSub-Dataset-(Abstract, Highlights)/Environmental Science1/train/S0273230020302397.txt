 In order to develop new and effective medicines pharmaceutical companies must be modality agnostic . As science reveals an enhanced understanding of biological processes new therapeutic modalities are becoming important in developing breakthrough therapies to treat both rare and common diseases . As these new modalities progress concern and uncertainty arise regarding their safe handling by the researchers developing them employees manufacturing them and nurses administering them . This manuscript reviews the available literature for emerging modalities and provides considerations for occupational health and safety oriented hazard identification and risk assessments to enable timely consistent and well informed hazard identification hazard communication and risk management decisions . This manuscript also points out instances where historical exposure control banding systems may not be applicable and where other occupational exposure limit systems are more applicable .
