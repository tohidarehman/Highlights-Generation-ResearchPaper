 Silver is used in a wide range of products and during their production and use humans may be exposed through inhalation . Therefore it is critical to know the concentration levels at which adverse effects may occur . In rodents inhalation of silver nanoparticles has resulted in increased silver in the lungs lymph nodes liver kidney spleen ovaries and testes . Reported excretion pathways of pulmonary silver are urinary and faecal excretion . Acute effects in humans of the inhalation of silver include lung failure that involved increased heart rate and decreased arterial blood oxygen pressure . Argyriaa blue grey discoloration of skin due to deposited silverwas observed after pulmonary exposure in 3 individuals however the presence of silver in the discolorations was not tested . Argyria after inhalation seems to be less likely than after oral or dermal exposure . Repeated inhalation findings in rodents have shown effects on lung function pulmonary inflammation bile duct hyperplasia and genotoxicity . In our evaluation the range of NOAEC values was 0.110.75mg m

@highlight Inhaled silver is distributed to several organs. Few cases of argyria are reported.
@highlight Excretion of silver includes faecal and to a lesser extent urinary pathways.
@highlight Most affected endpoints in rodents are lung function and pulmonary inflammation.
@highlight Ions show a higher effect but the toxicity pattern is similar to nanoparticles.
@highlight Silver was evaluated to be genotoxic based on
@highlight and
@highlight studies.
