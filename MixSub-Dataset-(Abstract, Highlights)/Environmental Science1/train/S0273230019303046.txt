 BIA 102474 is a novel fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor developed for the treatment of medical conditions which would benefit from enhanced levels of endogenous anandamide such as pain disorders . During a Phase I clinical trial one subject died after receiving BIA 102474 and four other subjects displayed neurological signs . As part of series of papers presenting all the toxicology data available prior to the clinical trial we report here the preclinical toxicology studies examining once a day oral administration of BIA 102474 to male and female Wistar rats . These included a 14 day dose range finding a 4 week study and 13 and 26 week studies . The 13 and 26 week studies also included a 4 week recovery arm and a toxicokinetic arm for the parent compound BIA 102474 and the two major metabolites were also measured in the 26 week study .
