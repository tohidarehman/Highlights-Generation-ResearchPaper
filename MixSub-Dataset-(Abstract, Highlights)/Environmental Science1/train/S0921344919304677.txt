 This paper investigates the tendencies of Chinas green total factor productivity and its factors for regional green growth . We strengthen the robustness by constructing three different DEA models . For this purpose we develop and compare three new measures i.e . the biennial weight modified Russell model the biennial bounded adjusted model and the biennial range adjusted model . We further propose a related Luenberger productivity indicator and decompose green growth with two different methods namely the tradition decomposition view and the factors decomposition view . We apply the proposed methodology to Chinas provincial data between 1999 and 2013 . The main findings are as follows First Chinas green productivity has exhibited measurable improvements between 1999 and 2013 and technological progress is the main driving force while efficiency deterioration has a weak negative effect . Second the energy conservation and emission reduction performance are also the critical drivers of green productivity . Specifically the performance of emission reduction is larger than that of energy conservation . Third energy conservation and emission reduction improve the green productivity through promoting technical progress which supports the Porter hypothesis . Fourth the East and Central areas achieved win win situation and the effect attained in the East is more remarkable while the West encountered the double deterioration effect .

@highlight Chinas green total factor productivity TFP and its components are investigated.
@highlight Three kinds of non radial measures are used.
@highlight Technological progress is the critical driving force of Chinas green TFP.
