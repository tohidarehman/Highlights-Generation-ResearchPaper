 Humans are extracting and consuming unprecedented quantities of materials from the crust of the Earth . Contributing to this consumption university campuses require large amounts of materials to operate . This offers opportunities for the implementation of circular economy principles that optimise material use and demonstrate best practice to future generations of decision makers globally .

@highlight We conduct a material flow analysis of the procurement of the University of Melbourne
@highlight We used detailed procurement data covering 11555 purchases mapped to 189 material archetypes
@highlight We convert material inflows to embodied environmental flows using input output analysis
@highlight Procurement related inflows represent 92.8Mg or around 4 of the total material outflows
@highlight We propose circular economy strategies to reduce material flows and associated embodied environmental flows.
