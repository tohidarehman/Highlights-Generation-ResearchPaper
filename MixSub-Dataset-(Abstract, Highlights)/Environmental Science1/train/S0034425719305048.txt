 A statistical regression based microwave sea surface temperature retrieval algorithm has been developed within the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative SST project . The retrieval algorithm was used to generate a climate data record of passive microwave SST from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System and its follow on instrument AMSR2 for the period June 2002October 2017 . Multisensor Matchup Datasets which includes satellite orbital data collocated with in situ and auxiliary data was used to derive consistent algorithms for AMSR E and AMSR2 . The retrieval algorithms consist of wind speed retrievals and SST retrievals with corresponding uncertainty retrievals . The WS retrieval consists of a two step regression model where the second step is a localized algorithm trained to perform well over restricted WS intervals . A two step multiple linear regression retrieval with localized algorithms is used to retrieve SST . The first stage algorithm is trained to perform well over restricted latitude intervals for ascending and descending orbit respectively whereas the second stage retrieval uses localized SST and WS algorithms . Furthermore a new and effective method for detecting and screening for Radio Frequency Interference was developed .
