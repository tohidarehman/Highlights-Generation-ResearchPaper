 Spent coffee grounds have a potential to be used as a feedstock for higher value added products such as biodiesel . However the environmental implications of the valorisation of SCGs are largely unknown . This study evaluates the life cycle environmental impacts of utilising SCGs for biodiesel production in comparison with the widely used disposal of SCGs as a waste stream incineration landfilling anaerobic digestion composting and direct application to land . The scope is from cradle to grave and the functional unit is defined as treatment of 1 tonne of SCGs . The results show that the most environmentally sustainable option is incineration of SCGs with net negative impacts in 14 out of 16 categories followed by direct application of SCGs to land with 11 net negative impacts . Biodiesel production is the least sustainable option with the highest impacts in 11 categories followed by composting . The paper also demonstrates that following various waste hierarchy and resource valorisation guidelines instead of a life cycle approach could lead to a choice of environmentally inferior SCG utilisation options . Therefore these guidelines should be revised to ensure that they are consistent and underpinned by life cycle thinking thus aiding sustainable resource management in a circular economy context .

@highlight First life cycle assessment different valorisation routes for spent coffee grounds.
@highlight Waste to energy routes have lower impacts than biodiesel production.
@highlight Incineration and direct application are environmentally the most sustainable options.
@highlight Ranking on environmental impacts contradicts waste and value added hierarchies.
