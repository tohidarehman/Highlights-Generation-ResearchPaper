 Soil microbes can be limited by phosphorus availability . A significant proportion of cellular P is accounted for by the phospholipids that comprise membranes . Experiments with aquatic microbial communities and isolated microbes have shown one way microbes can reduce their cellular P requirements is by substituting phospholipids with P free polar lipids . We do not know if soil microbial communities can also spare P by using P free lipids instead of phospholipids .

@highlight We examined intact polar lipids from 16 soils with widely differing N and P status.
@highlight The dominant polar lipids among sites were PE PC and betaine lipids.
@highlight At low P sites a larger proportion of polar lipids was accounted for by betaine lipids.
@highlight In the most severely P deficient soils phospholipids were only 61 of total polar lipids.
@highlight Soil microbial communities can minimise P requirements by using betaine lipids.
