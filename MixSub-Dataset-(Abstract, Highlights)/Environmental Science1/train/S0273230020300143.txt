 1 2 Propylene glycol and glycerin principal components of e liquids can thermally degrade to form acetaldehyde acrolein and formaldehyde when heated in electronic nicotine delivery systems . Recently the flavors in e liquids were suggested to be the major source of these aldehydes . We used the same 10 ENDS devices to test 5 e liquid formulations and measured device mass loss and levels of acetaldehyde acrolein and formaldehyde . Despite finding reasonable variability in measurements of device mass loss two out of 10 ENDS devices tested produced outlier values for aerosol levels acetaldehyde acrolein and formaldehyde . After removing these devices from further analysis acceptable variability in aerosol levels of acetaldehyde and formaldehyde were found . The flavored formulations tested resulted in a consistent and selective increase of 150 200 in acetaldehyde no increase or decrease in acrolein and depending on the flavor formulation an increase a decrease or no change in formaldehyde levels . Comparison of our results to the literature illustrates the need for development of a standardized ENDS testing protocol . Our results further support that device variability must be fully characterized and considered before assessing the impact of e liquid formulations .
