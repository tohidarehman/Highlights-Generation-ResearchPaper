 Chronic nitrogen deposition from anthropogenic emissions alter N cycling of forests in Europe and in other impacted areas . It disrupts plant microbe interactions in originally N poor systems based on a symbiosis of plants with ectomycorrhizal fungi . ECM fungi that are capable of efficient nutrient mining from complex organics and their long distance transport play a key role in controlling soil N mineralization and immobilization and eventual nitrate NO

@highlight Nitrogen input of 1200kgN ha
@highlight at a moderate rate boosted forest soil microbes.
@highlight Microbial community adapted through structural and functional changes to N input.
@highlight N input enriched a community by copiotrophs nitrophilic fungi and saprotrophs.
@highlight N addition rates matter when simulating an ecosystem s shift towards N saturation.
