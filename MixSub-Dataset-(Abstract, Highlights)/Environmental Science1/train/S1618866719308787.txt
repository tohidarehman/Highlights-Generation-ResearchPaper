 Public urban green spaces are crucial for citizens wellbeing and are an important part of daily life in cities . To maximize their benefits to quality of life a thorough knowledge of citizens preferences and preference heterogeneity is crucial in the planning and design of urban green spaces . This study investigated visitors perception of typical green spaces with a focus on vegetation structure and the presence of typical historic city walls as well as preferences within the context of perceived stress and safety . We conducted this study in the historic city of Padua in north eastern Italy . In 2017 face to face interviews of citizens were held and choice sets based on modified images of different green space scenarios were used to test users preferences connected to both stress relief and safety perception . The study highlighted that general stress relief and safety perception related preferences of the respondents depend on different site characteristics . Respondents preferred a complex but not too wild scenario with sparse trees and aesthetically appealing features such as colourful flowers . Historic walls had a negative effect on general preferences . While general preferences were very similar to stress relief preferences preferences within the context of safety differed for some attributes . It seems that the vegetation structure and the presence of features linked to human recreational uses are important factors in planning and designing urban green spaces . Management and planning should take into consideration what users demand from green spaces as this will influence their suitable design .

@highlight General and stress relief preferences seem to be relatively consistent.
@highlight Presence of people in green spaces is a very important feature for visitor preferences.
@highlight People and presence of manmade elements are positive features for perceived safety.
