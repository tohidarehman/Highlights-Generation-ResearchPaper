 Sustainable Development Goal no . 15 addresses the protection of terrestrial ecosystems and sustainable forest management and Target 15.2 encourages countries to sustainably manage forests and halt deforestation by 2020 . SDG indicator 15.1.1 proposes tracking forest area as an indicator for achieving that SDG . Though mangrove forests represent only about 5 of Belize s overall forest cover the critical ecosystem services they provide are recognized in the country s Forests Act which regulates the modification of mangrove ecosystems . Preceding the SDGs from 2008 to 2009 the Government of Belize piloted a complete moratorium on mangrove removal building on the Forests Act . As Earth Observation systems provide a means to track effectiveness of Belize s management of its mangrove forests this paper examines historic and recent changes in mangrove cover across all of Belize applying statistical adjustments to rates of change derived from Landsat satellite data . Particular attention was paid to the country s only World Heritage Site the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System where mangrove clearing was prohibited since the site s designation in December 1996 . The data indicate that within the BBRRS approximately 89ha of mangroves were lost from 1996 to 2017 compared to the estimated loss of 2703ha outside the BBRRS during the same period and nationwide loss of almost 4100ha from 1980 to 2017 . Thus compared to the mangroves outside of the BBRRS the annual rate of mangrove loss within the BBRRS over the period 19962017 was merely 4.24ha per year versus 129.11ha per year outside the BBRRS . Furthermore almost 75 of the 19962017 mangrove loss outside the BBRRS were concentrated in three particular geographic zones associated with tourism infrastructure . It was also estimated that Belize s overall mangrove cover declined 5.4 over 36years from 76 250ha in 1980 to 72 169ha in 2017 . In terms of its implications in addition to contributing to SDG 15 this work also addresses SDG Target 14.2 regarding sustainable management of marine and coastal ecosystems . This study serves as a use case of how EO data can contribute to monitoring changes in baseline data and thus tracking of progress toward SDG Targets .

@highlight Mangrove loss rates across Belize were examined for 19802017.
@highlight Remote sensing data were statistically adjusted.
@highlight The Belize Barrier Reef World Heritage Site lost 89ha. of mangroves over 21years.
@highlight Outside the World Heritage Site 2703ha of mangrove were lost.
@highlight Belize s overall mangrove area declined by 5.4 from 1980 to 2017.
