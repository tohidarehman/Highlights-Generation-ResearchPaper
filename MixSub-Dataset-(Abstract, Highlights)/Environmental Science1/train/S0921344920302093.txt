 Decreasing stocks of natural resources and continuously increasing demand for platinum group metals sustain interest in studies on spent catalytic converters . Recycling spent catalytic converters to extract PGMs not only provides raw materials for the precious metals sector but also provides a sustainable recycling method for further development . However recovering PGMs is hard since the catalytic converters contain refractory compounds . In the present study a pyrometallurgical iron matte process was adopted to separate PGMs from spent catalytic converters . PGM recovery using the classical iron smelting process requires very high temperatures but the smelting temperature used in this process was less than 50 that of the classical process . The influences of the B

@highlight PGMs were extracted from catalytic converters by using of iron matte as a collector.
@highlight The process was studied at a relatively low temperature 950C .
@highlight The highest recovery percentages were 99 Pt 99 Pd and 97 Rh at 950C for 75min.
@highlight Iron matte was shown to be a promising process for PGM recovery.
