 Reducing lead exposure is a public health priority for the US Food and Drug Administration as well as other federal agencies . The goals of this research were to 1 update the maximum daily dietary intake of lead from food termed an interim reference level for children and for women of childbearing age and 2 to confirm through a literature review that with the exception of neurodevelopment which was not evaluated here no adverse effects of lead consistently occur at the blood lead level associated with the IRL . Because no safe level of lead exposure has yet been identified for children s health the IRLs of 3g day for children and 12.5g day for WOCBA were derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reference value of 5g dL BLL the level at which public health actions should be initiated . The literature review showed that no adverse effects of lead consistently occurred at the BLL associated with the IRLs . The IRLs of 3g day for children and 12.5g day for WOCBA should serve as useful benchmarks in evaluating the potential for adverse effects of dietary lead .

@highlight Interim reference levels IRLs were developed to evaluate dietary lead exposure.
@highlight IRLs were based on the CDC reference value of 5g dL blood lead level BLL .
@highlight IRLs for children and women of childbearing age are 3 and 12.5g day respectively.
@highlight Lead exposure was associated with adverse effects in children and pregnant women.
@highlight No adverse effects evaluated in this review consistently occurred at 0.5g dL BLL.
