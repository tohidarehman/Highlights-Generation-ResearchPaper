 Industrial parks are main sites for industrial sectors and are critical clients for water and energy management . However the water energy nexus at the industrial park level is still poorly understood . This study established high resolution profiles of water use and energy consumption and their linkages in Chinese industrial parks for the first time . Based on this inventory the water use and energy consumption of 209 Chinese national industrial parks were uncovered from a life cycle perspective . The total water use of these parks accounted for 6 of national industrial water use while the total energy consumption accounted for 10 of national energy consumption . Surface water and coal played an undeniably dominant role in direct water and energy structures with a share of 95 and 74 respectively . The water energy nexus was then analyzed and we observed that the indirect water use embodied in the energy sector was much more significant than the indirect energy consumption induced by the water sector . Moreover water and energy were closely linked and positively correlated in industrial parks energy intensive parks generally tended to be water intensive . Finally water use and energy consumption in the parks toward 2020 and 2030 were targeted according to cap and intensity controls highlighted in national strategies . The results indicated that to achieve the governing goals water and energy should be managed jointly particularly considering the indirect water use embodied in the energy sector .
