 In the EU one of the key determinants in the regulation and management of substances to ensure adequate protection of human health is the outcome of toxicity studies . These studies should therefore be performed in a way that the data generated are adequate to fulfil all regulatory requirements . However in recent years an increasing number of toxicity studies use dose levels that induce only slight or even no toxicity while the top dose lies well below the limit dose of 1000 mg kgbw d. The results of these studies have limited value for the hazard and subsequent risk assessment and risk management of substances . This paper shows why conducting toxicity studies with too low doses has severe consequences for among others classification and labelling identification of endocrine disruptors health impact assessment and incident management .

@highlight Testing of substances at dose levels inducing no or only slight toxicity increases .
@highlight Studies with too low doses may miss hazardous effects of relevance for humans .
@highlight Not knowing intrinsic hazards impairs proper classification and ED identification .
@highlight Reliable hazard assessment is essential for imposing proper risk management measures .
@highlight Inappropriately dosed toxicity studies negatively impact human safety regulation .
