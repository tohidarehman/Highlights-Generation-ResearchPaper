 Cycling for recreational or commuting purposes has multiple benefits . Understanding the factors that influence the use of bicycles is important to formulate policies and promote their use . Previous studies have reached a consensus on the impact of built environments on the use of bicycles . However very few studies have used actual cycling data to measure bicycle use and differing opinions exist on the impact of greening on cycling . In this study a large sample of actual shared bicycle use data is adopted to study the factors associated with the use of shared bicycles particularly the influence of greening factors . Taking Shenzhen as an example travel information on 248 000 shared bicycles in the city is obtained by using a web crawler and a total of 901 760 trips are identified . Regression analysis confirms the positive impact of eye level greening on cycling and finds that the Green coverage index has no significant impact on cycling . This study suggests that in order to build a cycling friendly urban environment more attention should be paid to three dimensional eye level greening rather than to traditional plane greening such as urban green land . It also shows the web crawled shared bicycle use and street green view image are novel and reliable data source for measuring eye level urban greenness and its association with cycling which is also applicable to cycling studies in other cities .

@highlight Obtained 248 000 shared bicycles information identified 901 760 actual cycling trips.
@highlight Confirmed the positive impact of streetscape greening on cycling and the green coverage rate has a minimal impact on cycling.
@highlight Greenway and urban road network densities have no significant influence on cycling. Enhancing three dimensional greening could promote the use of shared bicycle.
