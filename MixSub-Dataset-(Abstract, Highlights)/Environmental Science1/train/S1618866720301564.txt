 The growing evidences suggest an association between street green space and health in cities . Pollen released by street trees has a considerable adverse impact on human health . This study aims to analyze the characteristics and assess the seasonally allergenic risk of street trees in Qingyang District Chengdu City . There are 495 streets in Qingyang District which have been divided into five categories according to their width . Fifty seven species were identified belonging to 46 taxa and 28 botanical families in these streets . However no significant differences in average diameter at breast height tree height and crown width of street trees were found among the five defined street categories . Both the street trees per capita and the number of tree species are significantly higher than that in many Chinese cities . The Shannon s diversity index of street categories are clearly different ranging from 0.94 to 3.84 . Street category 5 has the highest tree density area ratio and SHDI of all street categories . In addition Chengdu City is exposed to high allergenic risk of street trees . The index of urban green zone allergenicity I
