 Adenosine 5 triphosphate is the primary source of energy for cells and oral supplementation with ATP offers numerous different health benefits including the regulation of blood flow and muscle contraction . In this study ATP disodium salt was administered by gavage to rats for 90 consecutive days at doses of 0 500 1000 and 2000mgkg BW

@highlight 90 days of oral disodium adenosine 5 triphosphate ATP was tested in rats.
@highlight Daily ATP doses up to 2000mgkg BW
@highlight did not induce toxicological effects.
