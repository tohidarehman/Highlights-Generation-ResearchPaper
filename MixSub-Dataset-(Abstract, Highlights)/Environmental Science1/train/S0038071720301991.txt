 The fate of soil carbon under climatic warming predominantly depends on temperature sensitivity of soil microbial functioning but it is poorly understood . Using temporal measurements of soil respiration in an incubation experiment with cross inoculation of microbial communities to contrasting soils we constrained a microbial explicit C model to infer temperature responses of two general microbial functional groups fast growing r vs slow growing K strategists . We found that the two groups exhibit distinct non monotonic temperature responses and fast growing r strategists are more sensitive to temperature changes than slow growing K strategists . Both historical environments under which the microbial communities were originated and current environment under which the microbial communities are colonized adapted significantly shape the temperature responses of the two groups . Our findings highlight the importance of combined effects of historical and current environment on microbial decomposition for regulating soil C dynamics under warming . We suggest that distinct non monotonic temperature responses of microbial functional groups may cause pronounced feedbacks between soil C dynamics and warming depending on climate soil microbe interactions .
