 Soil microorganisms affect both the formation and decomposition of soil organic carbon . We investigated how nitrogen N 25 vs. 100kgN ha

@highlight Fertiliser induced changes in root derived C incorporation into MBC.
@highlight N fertilisation increased MBC
@highlight under low P as a result of higher rhizodeposition.
@highlight N fertilisation increased MBC
@highlight under high P as rhizodeposition reduced.
@highlight Rhizodeposition mediated the N and P fertilization effect on CUE and turnover.
@highlight Microbes used labile root derived C more efficiently than recalcitrant SOC.
