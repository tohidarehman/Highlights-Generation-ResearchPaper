 Substrate design is important for stormwater retention and plant survival on green roofs . Green roof substrates are mostly inorganic providing long term stability while organic components reduce substrate weight and increase water retention depending on rate and type . Selection of organic components depends on availability and organic waste materials can improve sustainability and reduce costs . We aimed to use organic waste materials to create lightweight substrates with good aeration and increased plant available water to support plant growth on green roofs . We evaluated the effects of five locally available organic waste components on the physical and chemical properties of a scoria based substrate when added at 0 5 10 15 and 20 by volume . We also examined their phytotoxic effects on plant growth using lettuce

@highlight Substrate design determines green roof stormwater retention and plant survival.
@highlight Organic wastes may lighten substrates increase water retention and improve sustainability.
@highlight We evaluated the effects of organic wastes on substrate properties and plant growth.
@highlight Overall higher rates of organic wastes made substrates lighter and improved PAW.
@highlight However although nut waste materials lightened substrates they inhibited plant growth.
