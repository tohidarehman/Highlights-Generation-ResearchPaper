 Nanomaterial characteristics may affect the pulmonary toxicity and inflammatory response including specific surface area size shape crystal phase or other surface characteristics . Grouping of TiO

@highlight Inflammation and acute phase response was highest and more persistent for TiO
@highlight tube.
@highlight TiO
@highlight tube and DQ12 caused pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.
@highlight Rutile TiO
@highlight NMs were more inflammogenic in terms of neutrophil influx than anatase.
@highlight BET surface area strongly correlated with neutrophil influx for both crystal phases.
@highlight BET surface area crystal phase and shape of TiO
@highlight NMs are predictors for the effects.
