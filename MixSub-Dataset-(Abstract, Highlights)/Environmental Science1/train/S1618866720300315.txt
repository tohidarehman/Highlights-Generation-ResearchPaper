 Previous studies that quantified or simulated loads on a tie in point during climber ascents abrupt stops during descents and falls considered crown anchored stationary rope systems . But climbers also use basal anchored SRS when working in trees and because both parts of the ropelead and fallcarry a load the TIP presumably bears a greater load than on a crown anchored SRS . In this study tension in the fall and lead of a rope used in a basal anchored SRS was measured during climber ascents and abrupt stops during descents . As expected loads borne by the TIP were greater than on a crown anchored SRS . Loads also varied among three species selected for varying degrees of bark roughness greater loads were borne on the TIPs of a smooth barked species . It was also noteworthy that pre loading a TIP to determine its safety which climbers do before ascending increased the total load during ascents presumably because tension set during the pre load was not released in the fall of the rope prior to the ascent . To reduce the likelihood of TIP failure climbers are advised to take care when selecting a TIP that will support a basal anchored SRS .

@highlight This is the first study to quantify tension in the lead and fall of a rope as a climber ascended and stopped abruptly during descents.
@highlight During ascents combined rope tension was as high as 2.4 times the climbers weight during descents the multiple was as high as 4.8.
@highlight Combined rope tension expressed as a multiple of the climbers weight was greater on species with smooth bark and less on species with rough bark.
