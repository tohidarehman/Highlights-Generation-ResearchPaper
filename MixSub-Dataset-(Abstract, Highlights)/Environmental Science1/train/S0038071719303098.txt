 While it has long been held that invasive plants alter ecosystem processes the magnitude and direction of these effects have rarely been quantified

@highlight Invasive C4 grasses modify SOM decomposition in temperate deciduous forests in the USA.
@highlight SOM decomposition hinged on mycorrhizal association of the dominant trees.
@highlight measurements revealed enhanced SOM decomposition in ectomycorrhizal systems.
@highlight In arbuscular dominated systems the invasive grass reduced SOM decomposition.
@highlight Invader effects depend on dominant trees and edaphic characteristics of the stand.
