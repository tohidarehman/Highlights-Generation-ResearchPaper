 Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are very abundant in many agricultural soils and are important in increasing and maintaining the sustainability of agricultural systems . However high soil fertility especially high available soil phosphorus status often limits AM fungal development in intensively managed agricultural systems and results in the C costs to the host plant outweighing any benefits from AM colonization . Some promising approaches can minimize negative effects on soil biota while providing the desired agricultural benefits . However the influence of these agricultural practices on the benefits of root mutualistic associations remains poorly understood . Here we collected indigenous AM fungi from a long term field experiment with different application rates of cow manure and conducted a pot experiment with different soil P levels . Using high throughput sequencing we demonstrate that increasing cow manure application changed the community composition of AM fungi and reduced community diversity in the field . Phosphorus addition in a bioassay experiment produced a mycorrhizal growth response and the mycorrhizal P response shifted from positive to negative regardless of the origin of the inoculum . An increase in intraradical and extraradical AM fungal structures enhanced maize shoot biomass and P uptake under low and moderate 20mgP added kg

@highlight Indigenous AM fungi showed great potential for promoting plant growth and P uptake. .
@highlight Increased fertility in the field soil changed the community composition of AM fungi and reduced community diversity.
@highlight A higher indigenous AM fungal diversity was more beneficial to plants at a moderate soil P level.
