 Many studies have shown that solar induced fluorescence has a good potential to predict gross primary production of vegetation . What we measured by remote sensing or near surface platforms is top of canopy SIF SIF

@highlight Total emitted SIF SIF
@highlight  can be estimated from top of canopy SIF SIF
@highlight  .
@highlight The sensor only received on average 22.9 of total emitted SIF.
@highlight SIF
@highlight improves the diurnal estimate of canopy GPP.
@highlight SIF
@highlight produced a stronger correlation with GPP for plants with complex structure.
@highlight The SIF
@highlight  GPP relationship shows a stronger resilience to environmental stresses.
