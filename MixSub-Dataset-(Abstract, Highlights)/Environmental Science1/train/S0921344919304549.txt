 Waste baby diapers constitute a significant part of hygiene waste and currently are primarily landfilled or incinerated . The present study explores the applicability of shredded waste diapers as an innovative viscosity modifying admixture for cement grouts and concrete . A model was proposed which formulates the chemicals that SWDs add to concrete . The model was combined with the building and environmental standards to present the legal framework about using SWDs in different types of concrete . Cement grouts and self consolidating concrete were designed to validate the viscosity modifying properties of SWDs . A Bingham viscosity model and flow tests were used to evaluate the viscosity modifying performance of SWDs . The present results show that the SWDs are a sustainable route to manufacture highly effective viscosity modifying admixtures for concrete .

@highlight A novel valorization of waste diaper is explored in concrete industry.
@highlight An effective viscosity modifying admixture is made from shredded waste diapers SWDs .
@highlight The applicability of using SWDs in concrete is confirmed by the proposed model.
@highlight The viscosity modifying effect of SWDs is validated by cement paste and concrete.
@highlight The SWDs did not affect the compressive strength of SCCs at the studied dosages.
