 Plant can accelerate or slow down the soil organic carbon decomposition by the rhizosphere priming effect . In forest ecosystems the change of light availability due to canopy gap formation strongly influences growth of young trees and rhizosphere microbial activities in soil . However the responses of RPE of forest young trees to light availability and its driving mechanisms remain elusive . We investigated the effects of about 60 shading on RPE of two dominant forest tree species over the four months of the growing season using the

@highlight Under natural light negative RPE of maple and oak prevailed over the growing season.
@highlight Competition between roots and microbes for N may be responsible for the negative RPE.
@highlight Shading caused more positive RPE of maple and oak than natural light conditions.
@highlight The increase of soil enzyme activities after shading led to more positive RPE.
