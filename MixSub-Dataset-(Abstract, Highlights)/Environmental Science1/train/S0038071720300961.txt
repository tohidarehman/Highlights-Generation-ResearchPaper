 In drylands where soil fertility is typically low plant litter decomposition provides particularly critical carbon and nitrogen inputs into soil . Although climate change is projected to increase the already large global extent of drylands it is unknown how warmer temperatures will affect core ecosystem processes such as plant litter decomposition in these systems . To address this key unknown we conducted a litterbag study in a long term dryland warming experiment in southeastern Utah USA . Unexpectedly we did not find an overall effect of warming on leaf litter mass loss over time . Instead our results indicated both positive and negative effects of warming on mass loss which offset one another . In particular our findings suggested that a warming induced degradation of biological soil crusts increased soil litter mixing thereby accelerating decomposition . Results also suggested that a warming induced reduction in litter moisture slowed decomposition . In addition we found that warming lowered the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the decomposing litter . These results showed that warming did not alter the total litter mass loss rates in this ecosystem but that decomposition patterns were affected through more nuanced changes to both the biological and physical environment of dryland soils .

@highlight Use of a long term warming experiment to study dryland litter decomposition.
@highlight No overall impact of warming on mass loss because of multiple opposing controls.
@highlight Warming degraded biocrust which increased soil litter mixing.
@highlight Increased soil litter mixing accelerated decomposition.
@highlight Warming reduced rates of litter mass loss likely due to moisture limitations.
