 As the most basic transportation mode road transportation is a main contributor to atmospheric pollution . Different geographical locations and socioeconomic conditions intensify regional differences in atmospheric pollutant emissions . Understanding the spatial disparities and drivers of APEs from road transportation is crucial to China s national efforts in atmospheric pollution control . This study proposes an integrative research framework to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics and driving mechanism of regional APEs CO SO

@highlight Spatiotemporal features of atmospheric pollutants from road transportation are explored.
@highlight An integrative research framework is established combining four methods.
@highlight Gaps for CO and SO
@highlight emissions across regions narrow but enlarge for NO
@highlight emissions.
@highlight High High aggregation appears in the east and low low aggregation appears in the northwest.
@highlight Promotive and inhibitive drivers and their contributions to emissions are identified and quantified.
