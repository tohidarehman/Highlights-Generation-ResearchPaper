 This study concerns the assessment of the environmental impacts of geothermal power generation systems using life cycle assessment approach . Particularly four types of typical geothermal power generation systems in China based on different technologies are involved in the case study and critical environmental impacts of acidification potential global warming potential and eutrophication potential are evaluated for the above geothermal power generation systems based on their energy system analysis models . Analytical results reveal that environmental impacts of geothermal power generation systems are significantly affected by well drilling process . In general construction process contributes more than 60 of acidification potential while running process is the major source of eutrophication potential . Environmental impacts vary for each geothermal power generation system due to their different configurations as well as reservoir conditions . Acidification potential global warming potential and eutrophication potential of the cases are among 30.43250.05 mgSO
