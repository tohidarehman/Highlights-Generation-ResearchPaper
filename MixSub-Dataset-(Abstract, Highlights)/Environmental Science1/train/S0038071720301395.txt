 Beta diversity is a key component of biodiversity with implications ranging from species dynamics to ecosystem functioning . However diversity and its drivers have received little attention especially for micro eukaryotes which play key roles in soil functioning . We studied the diversity of soil micro eukaryotes in a Swiss lowland floodplain using high throughput Illumina sequencing of soil DNA . We determined the temporal

@highlight We studied floodplain soil micro eukaryotic diversity by Illumina sequencing of e DNA.
@highlight Alpha and beta diversity varied more spatially among habitats than seasonally.
@highlight The edaphic drivers of and diversities changed among habitats and seasons.
@highlight These patterns reflect seasonal flood dynamics and soil biogeochemical cycles.
@highlight Thus microbial ecology of dynamic systems should best be studied over time and space.
