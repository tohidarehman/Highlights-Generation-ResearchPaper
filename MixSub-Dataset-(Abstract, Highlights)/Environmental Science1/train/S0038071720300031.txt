 Shifting from conventional tillage to a no till system can contribute to improving soil carbon sequestration and sustaining crop productivity . However our understanding of the soil nitrogen process through insights into the no till effect on soil denitrification remains elusive . Here we compiled data from 323 observations in 57 studies and quantified the responses of soil denitrification and the size and activity of the denitrifying community to no till vs. conventional tillage . Across all studies no till significantly increased soil denitrification compared to conventional tillage . The no till effect on soil denitrification was significantly dependent upon N fertilizer management with a greater increase with N fertilization than without . The increased soil denitrification under no till was attributed to increases in the size and activity of the denitrifying community . On average the potential denitrification activity the total number of denitrifiers and the abundance of denitrifying genes were increased by 66 116 and 1470 respectively in response to no till . Our results demonstrate that soil denitrification under no till leads to increased soil nitrous oxide N
