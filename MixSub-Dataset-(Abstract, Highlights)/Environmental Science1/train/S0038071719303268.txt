 The input of labile organics by plant roots stimulates microbial activity and therefore facilitates biochemical process rates in the rhizosphere compared to bulk soil forming microbial hotspots . However the extent to which the functional properties of soil microorganisms are different in the hotspots formed in soils with contrasting fertility remains unclear . We identified the hotspots related to different levels of

@highlight The hotspots around roots were successfully localized by tiny wet needle approach.
@highlight Stimulation on microbial growth in the hotspots was soil specific.
@highlight Roots modulated enzyme affinity to substrate.
@highlight The fertile soil showed greater catalytic efficiency than the poor soil.
