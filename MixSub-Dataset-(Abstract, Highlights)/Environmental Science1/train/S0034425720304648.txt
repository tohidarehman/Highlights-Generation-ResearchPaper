 Spectrally based retrieval of bathymetry is challenging in inland coastal waters due to variations in factors other than water depth across a water body including bottom type optically significant constituents water surface roughness and others . Optimal band ratio analysis is the most widely used method to deal with these confounding effects to retrieve water depth . OBRA identifies the pair of bands that provides the highest accuracy among all possible pairs when using a log transformed band ratio model . However this approach fits a single ratio model to all training samples without fully accounting for the heterogeneity of the aforementioned complicating factors . To deal with this problem we introduce a novel method called Sample specific Multiple bAnd Ratio Technique for Satellite Derived Bathymetry . The proposed SMART SDB technique partitions the feature space of the spectral data and creates for every subspace a different band ratio model that performs better than the other models within that subspace . Bathymetry is then predicted based on the closest model s in the feature space by performing a sample specific k nearest neighbor
