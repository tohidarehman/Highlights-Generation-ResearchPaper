 Though mitochondrial oxidant stress plays a critical role in the progression of acetaminophen overdose induced liver damage the influence of mitochondrial bioenergetics on this is not well characterized . This is important since lifestyle and diet alter hepatic mitochondrial bioenergetics and an understanding of its effects on APAP induced liver injury is clinically relevant . Pyruvate dehydrogenase is critical to mitochondrial bioenergetics since it controls the rate of generation of reducing equivalents driving respiration and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 regulates PDH by phosphorylation . We examined APAP induced liver injury in PDK4 deficient PDK4

@highlight PDK4 deficient mice were protected against acetaminophen hepatotoxicity
@highlight The protection did not involve inhibition of drug metabolism or JNK activation
@highlight PDK4 deficient mice showed less mitochondrial oxidant stress and dysfunction
@highlight Early mitochondrial oxidant stress is distinct from late amplification mechanisms
