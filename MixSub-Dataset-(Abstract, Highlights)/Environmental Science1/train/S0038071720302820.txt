 Organic C has many benefits for soil but it is depleted by tillage and crop harvest and especially so for biofuel crops . Accordingly strategies such as partially retaining stover or planting a cover crop can help ameliorate the negative effect of C removal . We used a long term field experiment to study the impacts of stover retention and planting a cover crop on soil organic matter its extractable components and the soil microbial community . SOM chemical composition characterization was determined by electrospray ionization coupled with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry in sequential water methanol and chloroform CHCl

@highlight Soil carbon was characterized by ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry.
@highlight Corn stover and rye cover crop changed composition of extractable soil organic C.
@highlight Corn stover retention enhanced lignin like compounds.
@highlight Cover crop enriched more condensed hydrocarbons.
@highlight Soil bacterial community composition corresponded to certain SOM compositions.
