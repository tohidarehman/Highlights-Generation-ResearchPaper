 The quantification of vegetation height for the circumpolar Arctic tundra biome is of interest for a wide range of applications including biomass and habitat studies as well as permafrost modelling in the context of climate change . To date only indices from multispectral data have been used in these environments to address biomass and vegetation changes over time . The retrieval of vegetation height itself has not been attempted so far over larger areas . Synthetic Aperture Radar holds promise for canopy modeling over large extents but the high variability of near surface soil moisture during the snow free season is a major challenge for application of SAR in tundra for such a purpose . We hypothesized that tundra vegetation height can be derived from multispectral indices as well as from C band SAR data acquired in winter . To test our hypothesis we used C band SAR data from Sentinel 1 and multi spectral data from Sentinel 2 . Results show that vegetation height can be derived with an RMSE of 44cm from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and 54cm from Tasseled Cap Wetness index . Retrieval from C band SAR shows similar performance but C VV is more suitable than C HH to derive vegetation height . An exponential relationship with

@highlight Use of frozen condition backscatter allows vegetation height retrieval in tundra.
@highlight C band SAR shows similar capabilities like multi spectral indices.
@highlight The Tasseled Cap Wetness Index is specifically applicable in northern tundra.
@highlight The evaluation across different regions suggests circumpolar applicability of C VV.
@highlight Combination of Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 allows treatment of ambiguities.
