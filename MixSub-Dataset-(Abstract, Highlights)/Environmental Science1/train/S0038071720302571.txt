 Quantifying and characterizing Extracellular Polymeric Substances and especially exopolysaccharides is an issue for understanding the hydro physical and biological functioning of the rhizosphere . However few comparative studies of extraction techniques have been carried out on soils and none on calcareous Mediterranean soils . Three soil bound EPS extraction techniques i.e . Cation Exchange Resin EDTA and NaOH Formaldhyde were compared on three contrasted Mediterranean soils . CER presented the lowest extraction efficiency of EPSac but also the lowest contamination of EPS by extractants and extracellular compounds . Contamination with intracellular compounds was low and similar with the three methods . Mid Infrared spectra enabled the best discrimination of the EPS extracts when they were prepared with CER . CER is then identified to be the suitable extraction technique of EPS from soils including calcareous soils . This technique was applied on rhizospheric and bulk soils harvested in an experimental field of tomato cultivation . A rhizospheric effect was highlighted during the growth of plants of two cultivars with both the soil bound EPSac amounts and the MIR spectra of extracted EPS . Extraction of soil bound EPS and their further analysis by spectral and chemometric approaches is a promising way for relating EPS chemical characteristics to their biological and hydric impacts within the plant rhizosphere in a context of agro ecological transition and climatic change .

@highlight CER causes less extracellular extractant residues contamination.
@highlight CER is lower extraction efficient but is more reproducible and more discriminating.
@highlight CER EPS extraction is applied on soil samples from industrial tomato field.
@highlight Bound EPS CER extraction allows differentiation between rhizosphere and bulk soil .
@highlight Soil bound EPS CER extraction allows differentiation between different cultivar.
