 Earth remote sensing using reflected GNSS signals is currently an emerging trend especially in ocean surface wind measurements . Unlike the existing scatterometer missions GNSS R uses L Band navigation signals that can penetrate through clouds and rain . Rain may have a negligible impact on the transmitted signal in terms of path attenuation at this wavelength . However there are other effects due to rain such as changes in surface roughness and rain induced local winds which can significantly alter the measurements . Currently there is no observation based characterization of all possible impacts of rain on radar forward scatter which is the nature of operation of GNSS R missions . In this study we propose a 3 fold rain model which accounts for attenuation surface effects of rain and rain induced local winds . We utilize the large dataset of measurements made by the CYGNSS mission to separate these different effects of rain . The attenuation model suggests that a total of at least 96
