 Unopposed estrogenic action in the uterus can lead to the development of endometrial cancer in both humans and rats . Aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation gives rise to anti estrogenic actions and may consequently reduce the development of endometrial cancer . In this study the anti estrogenic potential of the AHR ligands 2 3 7 8 tetrachlorodibenzo p dioxin and DELAQ a metabolite of the pharmaceutical laquinimod was assessed in in primary human and rat endometrial epithelial cells with and without co exposure to endogenous hormones .

@highlight AHR ligands show a reversed potency between primary human and rat epithelial endometrium cells.
@highlight Hormones reduce the expression of the AHR in rat endometrium cells but not in human cells.
@highlight Anti estrogenic effects by AHR ligand were observed in human endometrium cells but not in rat cells.
