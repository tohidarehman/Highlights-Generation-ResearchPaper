 Since 2010 the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite mission monitors the earth emission at L Band . It provides the longest time series of Sea Surface Salinity from space over the global ocean . However the SSS retrieval at high latitudes is a challenge because of the low sensitivity L Band radiometric measurements to SSS in cold waters and to the contamination of SMOS measurements by the vicinity of continents of sea ice and of Radio Frequency Interferences . In this paper we assess the quality of weekly SSS fields derived from swath ordered instantaneous SMOS SSS distributed by the European Space Agency . These products are filtered according to new criteria . We use the pseudo dielectric constant retrieved from SMOS brightness temperatures to filter SSS pixels polluted by sea ice . We identify that the dielectric constant model and the sea surface temperature auxiliary parameter used as prior information in the SMOS SSS retrieval induce significant systematic errors at low temperatures . We propose a novel empirical correction to mitigate those sources of errors at high latitudes .
