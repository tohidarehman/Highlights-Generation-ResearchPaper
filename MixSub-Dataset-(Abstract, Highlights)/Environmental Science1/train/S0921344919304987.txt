 A low carbon economy requires low carbon consumption by the public . Despite the importance of consumers in low carbon economies so far most studies have ignored low carbon consumer behaviour in developing countries that are vulnerable to climate change and its consequences . This indicates inattention to the socio economic aspects of the general life style of the people in promoting sustainable consumption and accountability . This study examines the determinants of low carbon consumption behaviour of consumers in climate vulnerable developing countries by focusing on consumers in Sri Lanka . Combining the Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Theory of Perceived Marketplace Influence the data collected from 440 Sri Lankan consumers was analysed using a structural equation model . The findings revealed the antecedent variables of TPB and the additional variables that fully explains the carbon conscious decision making phenomenon in a developing country setting . The results confirm the appropriateness of the proposed model for predicting low carbon consumer behaviour in climate vulnerable developing countries such as Sri Lanka as it increases the predictive power of the TPB framework . Accordingly policy level implications and strategies for promoting individual low carbon consumption behaviour are proposed .

@highlight Examined low carbon consumer behaviour LCCB in Sri Lanka a climate vulnerable developing country.
@highlight Extended the theory of planned behaviour TPB by adding low carbon self identify LCSI and implementation intention.
@highlight LCSI and other variables explain the LCCB in climate vulnerable developing countries.
@highlight The extended TPB has strong predictive potential and robustness in the proposed framework.
@highlight Potential strategies for encouraging LCCB in developing countries are discussed.
