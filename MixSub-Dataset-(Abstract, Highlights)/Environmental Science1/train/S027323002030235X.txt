 Under the European chemicals legislation REACH the use of chemicals posing an unacceptable risk for humans and the environment can be restricted . This requires that regulatory authorities of EU member states or the European Chemicals Agency on request of the Commission submit a restriction proposal in which they suggest one or multiple risk management options . The options are recommended to be evaluated in a socio economic analysis using defined criteria . This paper explores the drivers of the selection of the preferred RMO in 32 restriction dossiers . Applying principal component analysis reveals that the selection of the preferred RMO and the evaluation of possible trade offs between alternative RMOs is determined by criteria characterizing a measure s effectiveness and practicality in particular its risk reduction capacity

@highlight Analysis of selecting restriction options in 32 REACH restriction dossiers.
@highlight Most influential criteria for selecting the preferred restriction option identified.
@highlight The effectiveness of a measure seems to be the most important selection criterion.
@highlight High risk reduction capacity and low costs increase the chance for option selection.
@highlight Less and more transparent evaluation criteria can strengthen the selection process.
