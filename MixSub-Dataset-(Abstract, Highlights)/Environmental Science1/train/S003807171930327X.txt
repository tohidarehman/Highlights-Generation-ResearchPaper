 The improvement of aeration conditions in the rhizosphere is beneficial for crop growth and productivity . However its effects on the soil microbial community are less known . Due to microbial sentivity to environmental changes transporting micro nano bubble water to the crop rhizosphere is expected to shift soil microbial community . A two year MNBW irrigation field experiment consisting of two mixing ratios of MNBW and groundwater and a control treatment was conducted in a sugarcane plantation station at Guangxi China . The results indicated that MNBW irrigation particularly with the high level changed the composition and potential functionality of the soil bacterial community reduced its diversity and altered microbial co occurrence patterns . Structural equation modeling demonstrated that MNBW irrigation directly affected soil microbial community and soil fertility and indirectly promoted sugarcane yield . Overall this study highlighted that the application of MNBW improved plant yield and this response was strongly associated with a better nutritional content of MNBW irrigated soils and changes in the bacterial community .

@highlight MNBW altered soil bacterial community composition co occurrence pattern and functionality.
@highlight Soil available nutrient contents were significantly correlated with soil bacterial traits.
@highlight MNBW directly shifted bacterial community and soil fertility and indirectly promoted sugarcane yield.
