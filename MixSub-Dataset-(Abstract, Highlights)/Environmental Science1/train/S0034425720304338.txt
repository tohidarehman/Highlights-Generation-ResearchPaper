 The Central Valley in California is characterized by a semi arid climate prone to droughts a variable surface water supply and immense agricultural areas dependent on groundwater irrigation . The groundwater is stored in a complex aquifer system composed of alternating layers of coarse sediments and fine grained sediments acting as confining materials . Groundwater fluctuations are coupled with both the elastic and inelastic land surface deformation historically observed in the Central Valley . Surface deformation poses a hazard to the California Aqueduct which supports Central Valley agriculture and large urban populations in Southern California . The risk of reduced aqueduct efficacy and expensive repairs compels water resource managers to carefully monitor land deformation in the Valley .

@highlight UAVSAR detects rapid subsidence adjacent to 10.5 km of California Aqueduct.
@highlight Exceptional drought conditions from 2012 to 2016 coincide with subsidence acceleration.
@highlight Permanent aquifer volume storage loss is greater than 7122 m
@highlight  day for 2.7years.
