 An increasing number of studies demonstrate that tree species biodiversity can affect primary productivity and nutrient cycling in forests due to several factors such as complementarity facilitation or selection effects . For instance resource partitioning in soils has been found to allow a more optimized nutrient uptake in mixed species plots compared with monocultures . However how these effects will be modified by climate change such as water availability is not as well understood especially in deep soil layers . Therefore we specifically asked how water availability may influence the effect of tree mixtures on soil microorganism activity by measuring extracellular enzyme activities and available nutrients along the soil profile in a 10 year old plantation in southwestern France which manipulates tree species composition

@highlight Synergistic effect of tree diversity on C and N enzymes in the mid soil.
@highlight Irrigation increased N and P enzyme activities in the upper soil layers.
@highlight No interaction effect between tree species composition and water availability.
@highlight Strong positive correlation between the available P and the C
