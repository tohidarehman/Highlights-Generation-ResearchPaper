 In principle greenhouse gas emissions can be offset by increasing soil carbon stocks . Full utilisation of that potential however requires a good understanding of the controls on carbon stocks to identify factors that can be modified through management changes and distinguish those from factors that are inherent soil properties that can not be modified . Here we present a conceptual model of protected carbon stocks in soils based on observations from two farms in New Zealand and from a combined soils data set from observations from throughout New Zealand . These data showed that

@highlight We found a strong linear correlation between SOC and specific surface area

@highlight Slopes and intercepts of these regression lines decreased with soil depth.
@highlight Hence protected SOC 
@highlight  is protected by the mineral matrix not biochemically.

@highlight To mitigate climate change better to deposit C on soils with high surface area.
