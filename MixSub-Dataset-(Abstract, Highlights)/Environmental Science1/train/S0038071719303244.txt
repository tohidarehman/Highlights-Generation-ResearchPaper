 Soil organic matter is the dominant reservoir of terrestrial organic carbon and nitrogen and microbial necromass represents a primary input to it . However knowledge of stabilization mechanisms and direct measurements of the decomposition of microbial derived SOM are lacking . Here we report a novel

@highlight Microbial cell walls are as recalcitrant to decomposition as soil proteins.
@highlight Major decomposition products of soil peptidoglycan are muropeptides.
@highlight Bacterial peptidoglycan decomposition is correlated with microbial necromass.
@highlight Fungal chitin decomposition is correlated with soil texture and pH.
