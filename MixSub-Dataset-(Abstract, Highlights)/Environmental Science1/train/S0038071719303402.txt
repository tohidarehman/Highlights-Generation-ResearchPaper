 Multiple and rapid environmental changes in the Arctic have major consequences for the entire ecosystem . Soil water chemistry is one component with important implications for understanding climate feedbacks plant growth microbial turnover and net greenhouse gas emissions . Here we assess the contrasting growing season soil water chemistry in a Low arctic Greenlandic mesic tundra heath and a fen which have been subjected to factorial treatments of summer warming using open top chambers snow addition using snow fences which increase soil temperature in late winter and shrub removal mimicking herbivory attack . Dissolved Organic Carbon and plant nutrients including NO

@highlight Soil N and DOC had mixed responses to climate change in a fen and a mesic tundra.
@highlight Deeper winter snow decreased DOC content in the fen but increased DOC in the heath.
@highlight Simulated herbivory resulted in increased plant available N and DOC.
@highlight Herbivory had most effect during drought likely due to less plant transpiration.
