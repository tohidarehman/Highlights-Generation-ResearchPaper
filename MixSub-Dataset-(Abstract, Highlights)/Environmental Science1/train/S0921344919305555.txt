 As society works to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels the demand for renewable energy has grown rapidly in recent years . Photovoltaic solar power is one such source of renewable energy and has seen significant growth over the past several decades . While End of Life PV volumes remain relatively small at this time the number of EoL PVs is estimated to grow dramatically in the near future . This raises concerns about the management of EoL PVs . Effective EoL management methods need to be aggressively developed and implemented in order to prevent large volumes of hazardous wastes from being disposed in landfills . At the same time PV waste can also be viewed as a potential source of valuable materials . The development of effective processing technologies to isolate these materials will help divert waste away from landfills while reducing dependence on virgin resources and enhancing economic sustainability . This paper proposes the circularization of the PV industry by applying the notion of Life Cycle Symbiosis an extension of Industrial Symbiosis . By identifying waste streams that may have value as potential raw material feedstock through the development of collaborative business economic interactions among a diverse set of organizations we have applied LCS in the context of EoL PVs . The avoided global warming potential and ecotoxicity impacts 2750kg CO

@highlight Dramatic growth in use of solar power is due to recent advances in photovoltaic technology.
@highlight Continued growth of PV based solar power is reliant on availability of several key material resources.
@highlight End of life PV solar panels represent a source from which critical resources may be recovered.
@highlight Industrial Symbiosis IS could be one way to achieve a circular materials economy and promote sustainability.
@highlight Life cycle symbiosis LCS extends the notion of IS over the entire product lifecycle resulting in a greater degree of IS.
