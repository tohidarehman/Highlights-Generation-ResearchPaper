 Sodium valproate is a first line treatment for various forms of epilepsy however it can cause severe liver injury . Ginsenoside compound K is the main active ingredient of the traditional herbal medicine ginseng . According to our previous research SVP induced elevation of ALT and AST levels as well as pathological changes of liver tissue was believed to be significantly reversed by G CK in LiCl pilocarpine induced epileptic rats . Thus we aimed to evaluate the protective effect of G CK on hepatotoxicity caused by SVP . The rats treated with SVP showed liver injury with evident increases in hepatic index transaminases activity alkaline phosphatase level hepatic triglyceride and lipid peroxidation significant decreases in plasma albumin level and antioxidant capacity and obvious changes in histopathological and subcellular structures . All of these changes could be mitigated by co administration with G CK . Proteomic analysis indicated that hepcidin soluble epoxide hydrolase sEH UniProt ID

@highlight G CK displayed a protective effect against SVP induced hepatotoxicity.
@highlight The antioxidant effect mediated the hepatoprotective effect of G CK.
@highlight Hepcidin and sEH P80299 were involved in the hepatoprotective effect of G CK.
