 The attention towards possible link of earthquakes and ionosphere in the form of seismo ionosphere anomalies has increased exponentially by utilizing new data and more accurate observations . The integrated atmosphere and ionosphere monitoring satellites has played a decisive role in this development and provided detection and analysis of anomalies attributed to seismic processes . In this paper we study EQ anomalies in ionosphere from IGS permanent Global Navigation Satellite Systems based Total Electron Content and

@highlight Earthquakes ionospheric and atmospheric anomalies are investigated.
@highlight Possible Seismo Ionospheric Anomalies SIA occurred during UT 10 12.
@highlight The Remote Sensing data supports the evidences of SIA in different RS parameters.
@highlight The main findings showed the coupling of lithosphere atmosphere ionosphere.
