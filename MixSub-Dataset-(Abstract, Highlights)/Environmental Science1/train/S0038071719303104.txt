 Tree growth on weathered soils in lowland tropical forests is limited by low phosphorous availability . However nutrient manupulation experiments do not always increase the P content in these trees which raises the question whether trees are taking up added P. In French Guianese lowland rainforest we measured changes in nitrogen and P availability before and up to two months after N and P fertilizer addition in soils with intact root systems and in soils where roots and mycorrhizal fungi were excluded by root exclusion cylinders . When the root system was excluded P addition increased P availability to a much greater extent and for a longer time than in soils with an intact root system . Soil N dynamics were unaffected by root presence absence . These results indicate rapid P uptake but not N uptake by tree roots suggesting a very effective P acquisition process in these lowland rainforests .

@highlight Trees quickly and effectively take up P after fertilization with NxP fertilizer.
@highlight Nitrogen is not rapidly taken up after fertilization.
