 Hospital is one of the areas that affect the mental and psychological conditions of the children and the poor design of these environments may affect physical and psychological health . This study investigated the effect of a typical Dish Garden as a surrogate for green spaces in improving the physical and neuropsychological characteristics of hospitalized children . For this purpose 54 hospitalized children were randomly divided into intervention and control groups . The children in the experimental group were placed in a pre designed room with a Dish Garden for 72 h and the control group did not receive any intervention . In this research a pre test and post test design were applied . The results showed that the group exposed to the Dish Garden was significantly healthier than the control group in terms of physical and neuropsychological factors . The recorded vital signs including systolic and diastolic blood pressures heart and respiration rates decreased to normal rates in the experimental group . The neuropsychological indices in the experimental group included the emotional index the cognitive index and the non symptom index . The Dish Garden enhanced physical and neuropsychological health of the children through visual distraction . Therefore using Dish Gardens can be suggested as low budget and low risk tools to create favourable environments in children s hospitals .

@highlight The effect of dish gardens on the health of the hospitalized children was examined.
@highlight The recorded vital signs decreased to normal rates in the experimental group.
@highlight The neuropsychological indices in the experimental group were also improved.
@highlight A suitable landscape surrogate can create a healthier hospital for children.
