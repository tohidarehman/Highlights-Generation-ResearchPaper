 Non small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer with a disappointing prognosis . The aim of this study was to investigate the anticancer effect of sesamin and the underlying mechanism . The MTT assay was used to detect the proliferation of NSCLC cells . The cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry . The protein levels of Akt p Akt p53 cyclin D1 CDK2 MDM2 p MDM2 were detected by western blotting . The expression of p Akt p53 and Ki67
