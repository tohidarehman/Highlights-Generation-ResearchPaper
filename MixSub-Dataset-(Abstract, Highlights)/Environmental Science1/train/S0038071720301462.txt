 The conversion of rainforests to plantations leads to about 50 loss in the organic carbon content of the soil and strongly influences nitrogen cycling potentially increasing greenhouse gas emissions . However the effect of land use change in forests on the microbial communities responsible for C and N cycling processes remains poorly understood . This study quantified C and N fractions of soil organic matter in a tropical forest rubber agroforestry system 5 and 15 year old rubber plantations . The community structure and abundance of fungi and bacteria were studied using high throughput sequencing and q PCR . Forest conversion substantially altered community structure and abundance of microbial communities . Rainforest conversion to plantation enhanced bacterial diversity and reduced the soil C mineralization rate . In addition land use change also enhanced the soil N mineralization rate in 5 year old rubber plantation and agroforestry system . A structural equation modelling suggested that soil microbial communities played more dominant roles in driving the shift in C and N cycles caused by land use change than soil C and N pools . These mechanistic insights into the differential control of soil fungal and bacterial communities on C and N mineralization has implications for managing land use changes in tropical forest ecosystems .

@highlight Rainforest conversion into rubber based plantations decreased soil C and N pools.
@highlight Bacterial abundance was reduced but oligotrophic bacteria are less affected by land use change.
@highlight Land use change increased relative abundance of fungi.
@highlight Shifts in the soil bacterial and fungal communities explained ecosystem functions.
