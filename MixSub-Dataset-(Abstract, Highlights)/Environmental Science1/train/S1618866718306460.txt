 Urban trees composition and diversity are gaining more relevance for academic urban planning and sustainability purposes . Despite their free ecosystem services little is documented on urban trees especially in developing countries such as Nigeria . This study assessed the composition diversity structural characteristics and provenance of trees in two cities of North western Nigeria . Landsat images for 2015 were used to classify each city into five broad land cover classes to facilitate stratified sampling . Data on tree species height Diameter at Breast Height and provenance was collected from a total of 373 plots of 3030m dimension . A total of 1558 trees belonging to 56 species in 46 genera and 22 families were assessed with generally more categories of native than exotic species but higher populations of exotic stems .

@highlight Despite their growing relevance in urban areas urban tree species are not evenly distributed in some cities in North western Nigeria.
@highlight The studied cities are dominated by relatively few tree species with exotic species category having higher stems population.
@highlight Urban trees composition diversity and growth characteristics vary significantly across the cities and to some extent the land use cover types.
@highlight This study highlights the need for extensive science based tree planting programme across cities in North western Nigeria.
