 A systematic review and inventory of recent research relating to optical remote sensing of Arctic vegetation was conducted and thematic and geographical trends were summarized . Research was broadly categorized into four major themes of time series including NDVI trends and shrub expansion disturbance and recovery including tundra fires winter warming herbivory permafrost disturbance and anthropogenic change vegetation properties including biomass primary productivity seasonality phenology and pigments and classification and mapping . Remaining challenges associated with remote sensing of Arctic vegetation were divided into three categories and discussed . The first are issues related to environmental controls including disturbance hydrology plant functional types phenology and the tundra taiga ecotone and understanding their influence on interpretation and validation of derived remote sensing trends . The second are issues of upscaling and extrapolation related to sensor physics and the comparability of data from multiple spatial spectral and temporal resolutions . The final category identifies more philosophical challenges surrounding the future of data accessibility big data analysis sharing and funding policies among major data providers such as national space agencies and private companies as well as user groups in the public and private sectors . The review concludes that the best practices for the advancement of optical remote sensing of Arctic vegetation include a continued effort to share and improve

@highlight Optical RS of Arctic vegetation benefits from legacy and emerging technologies.
@highlight NDVI time series dominate recent optical remote sensing in the Arctic.
@highlight Derivation of Arctic tundra vegetation properties lacks in situ validation.
@highlight Better characterization of environmental controls on Arctic RS trends is needed.
@highlight Sensor continuity and comparability are necessary for temporally dense datasets.
