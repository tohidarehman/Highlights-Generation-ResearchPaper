 Air quality has proven to be closely related to economic levels . China is a vast country with substantial economic level and air quality disparities among cities . Consequently policy makers face challenges in implementing regional collaborative governances . Here we use the bivariate local indicator of spatial association statistic to reveal the spatial heterogeneous relationship between local per capita GDP and nearby air quality especially fine particulate matter PM

@highlight Bivariate LISA statistic is effective to reveal the city typologies.
@highlight cities have 60 more coal fired power plants than
@highlight cities.
@highlight cities have 2.3 times as many iron and steel plants as
@highlight cities.
@highlight Local economic transition benefits for nearby air quality in northern cities of China.
@highlight Air pollution policies should consider city typologies instead of being uniform over China.
