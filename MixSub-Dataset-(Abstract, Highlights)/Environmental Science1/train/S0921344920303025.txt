 Total Resource Management in industry 3.5 relates to the evaluation and improvement of performance through the use of intelligent tools or methods in enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of operations . This paper illustrates a study of TRM in the rubberwood processing industry to prepare it towards a sustainable transition to industry 4.0 . The rubberwood processing industry operates using massive production data . Such big data emerge from production using multi processes because the various products come in different sizes and quality levels . The rubberwood processing company in this study faces significant problems of inaccurate and delayed data . These problems introduce mistakes in inventory management and wage payment . The company also faces an economic issue due to confirmation which is labour intensive . This study applied the Genetic Algorithm technique to verify accepted material or woodpiece and use data analytics to improve the efficiency of the verification system . Furthermore a Web Based Application is developed for production data management . The results show a significant drop in the percentage of data inaccuracy when the GA confirmation method is applied and also a decrease in the percentage of production data discrepancy among processes . This successful sustainable transition is attributed to TRM because the achieved performance improvement enriches effectiveness in production material labour and service resources .

@highlight This study contributes to the sustainable transition in the total resource management of rubberwood processing firms in Industry 3.5.
@highlight A Genetic Algorithm application is developed to improve the efficiency of the verification system using data analytics.
@highlight The GA application is then developed into a Web Based Application for production data management.
@highlight The results indicate a significant drop in percentage of data inaccuracy when the GA method is applied.
