 Application of biochar has been widely suggested as a remediation tool for trace element polluted soils but the impact of biochar on microbial communities and on native plants remain largely unknown . To overcome this knowledge gap biochar produced from rice husk and olive pit were applied at a rate of 8tha

@highlight Biochar was applied in moderately and highly polluted soils under field conditions.
@highlight Biochar application increased bacterial and plant diversity in highly polluted soil.
@highlight Bacterial diversity slightly changed in moderately polluted soil with biochar.
@highlight Soil pH was key factor of bacterial community structure.
@highlight Seasonal changes affected microbial community soil respiration and vegetation.
