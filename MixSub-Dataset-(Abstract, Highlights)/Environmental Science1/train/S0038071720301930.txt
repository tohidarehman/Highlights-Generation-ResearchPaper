 Altered drying rewetting patterns due to climate change may affect soil nitrogen and phosphorus cycling in terrestrial ecosystems . The responses of soil N and P cycling to drying and rewetting cycles can vary with drying rewetting patterns experimental methods ecosystems and soil types thus making a synthesis of these studies necessary for understanding mechanisms and predicting future responses to climate change . Here we compiled data of 1882 observations from 79 studies for a meta analysis of the responses of soil N and P pools and fluxes to drying and rewetting and how these responses are modified by experimental conditions . Results showed that 1 experimental drying increased NH

@highlight We compiled data of 1882 observations and conducted a meta analysis.
@highlight Drying and rewetting significantly affected soil N and P pools and fluxes.
@highlight Soil microorganisms could recover from drought on rewetting.
@highlight There were higher effect sizes of N and P in laboratory than in field.
@highlight The responses of soil N and P also depended on soil and land use types.
