 Contemporary changes to climate pose increasing hydro meteorological risks to cities . In Glasgow key hydro meteorological risks include alluvial and pluvial flooding and overheating . While the need to address these risks are clear it is equally important to tackle these in a climate just manner . Having understood the benefits Green Infrastructure can provide in tackling the impact of climate change while ensuring environmental equity for Glasgow we attempt to assess the equitability of GI distribution in Glasgow especially in relation to the potential for GI to reduce vulnerability and exposure of deprived communities to climate risk in terms of flooding and overheating . We map potential of ecosystem services within urban areas to provide cooling and increase resilience to surface flooding and highlight the geographical mismatch between social deprivation and the preponderance of these ecosystem services . We explore the implications for a climate just transition using GI as a performance indicator .

@highlight Green Infrastructure GI can provide ecosystem services to tackle key urban climate change concerns.
@highlight GI could indicate the geographical correspondence between deprivation and ecosystem service potential.
@highlight Thus GI could serve as a proxy to monitor climate just transition.
