 In order to meet the EU s climate and resource efficiency targets changes in our daily life behaviours as well as business models are urgently necessary . More insights are needed to make real changes based on research with a systems perspective . We developed a system dynamics model to analyse the environmental benefits of a transition from ownership based to access based household laundry activities . The model considers demographic technological and behavioural aspects and thereby assesses the environmental impact of laundry activities . The model is applied to the Swedish as well as the European context and allows cross country comparisons . The results indicate a significant potential of the sharing economy . The higher utilisation of shared machines and extended lifespans of the machines can cut greenhouse gas emissions by a third and lower raw material usage overall and lower primary raw material in production due to higher recycling rates . The carbon intensity of the energy mix is a crucial factor for the environmental consequences that arise through changes in energy usage due to sharing economy practices . This case study shows the value of adopting policies that could promote sharing and extended life spans .

@highlight System dynamics model for transitions from owning to sharing with GHG emissions.
@highlight Sharing of laundry facilities has considerable potential in EU countries.
@highlight Sharing may save more GHG emissions in countries with higher energy carbon intensity.
