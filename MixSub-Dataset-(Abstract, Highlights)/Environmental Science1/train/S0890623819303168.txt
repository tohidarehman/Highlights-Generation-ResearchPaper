 We explored whether maternal alcohol intake in early pregnancy is associated with pubertal timing in sons and daughters . In total 15 819 children born 20002003 within the Danish National Birth Cohort gave half yearly self reported information on pubertal development from 11 years during 20122018 . Information on maternal average alcohol intake in first trimester and binge drinking episodes in first trimester was self reported by mothers during pregnancy . Average alcohol intake of 5 weekly drinks in first trimester was not associated with pubertal timing in sons . A tendency towards earlier pubertal timing was observed in daughters months when combining the estimates for all pubertal milestones . Binge drinking was not associated with pubertal timing in neither sons nor daughters .
