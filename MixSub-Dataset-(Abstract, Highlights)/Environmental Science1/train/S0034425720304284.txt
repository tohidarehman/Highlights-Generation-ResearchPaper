 This study provides the first report of reflectance spectra of coral spawn slicks and their detection using optical satellite data . The reflectance spectra show that coral spawn slicks can be discriminated from other sea surface features such as wave foam and floating

@highlight First report of reflectance spectra of coral spawn slicks and their detection.
@highlight The reflectance spectra can be discriminated from other sea surface features.
@highlight Satellite constellations allowed observation after a coral mass spawning event.
@highlight The red green band ratio detected coral spawn slicks successfully.
@highlight Detected slicks were small possibly because of the 2016 coral bleaching event.
