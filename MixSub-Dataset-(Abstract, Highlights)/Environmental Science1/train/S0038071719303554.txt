 Earthworms enhance soil structure the decomposition of organic matter and the dissemination of beneficial soil organisms such as the entomopathogenic nematodes . Nevertheless the effects of earthworm feeding behavior or cutaneous excreta on the performance of EPNs as biological control agents is poorly understood . We hypothesized that the presence of earthworms or their excreta reduces EPN fitness measured in terms of pathogenicity and reproductive success . In laboratory experiments we first evaluated the killing ability of EPNs against

@highlight Cutaneous excreta CEx of earthworms might interfere with entomopathogenic nematode activity.
@highlight Entomopathogenic nematodes are affected by CEx in a species specific manner.
