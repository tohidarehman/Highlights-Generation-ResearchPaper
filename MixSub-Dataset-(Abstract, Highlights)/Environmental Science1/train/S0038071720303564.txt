 Feremycorrhiza is a newly discovered plant fungus symbiosis that improves plant growth and nutrition without development of interface structures . The host plant range in the FM symbiosis is currently unknown . We report the results of controlled environment investigations characterizing the capability of crops to establish FM symbiosis with
