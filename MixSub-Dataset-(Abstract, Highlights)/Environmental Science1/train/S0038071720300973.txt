 Application of organic amendments nutrients and gypsum to sodic subsoils is of great interest to improve soil functionality and crop yield . However controversy remains about the impact of the priming effect on native soil organic carbon and the mechanisms governing the dynamics of the PE by OAs . To address these gaps in knowledge this nine month study applied C

@highlight Labile C in OAs controlled the positive priming effect PE in the first 2 months.
@highlight Extra nutrients in OAs increased the magnitude of the PE after 2 months.
@highlight The PE was negatively related to soil mineral N availability suggesting N mining.
@highlight Gypsum did not alter the magnitude of the PE by OAs in the sodic subsoil.
