 Nitrogen stabilizers e.g . nitrification inhibitor urease inhibitor or combined NIs and UIs have been recommended to reduce N losses and improve fertilizer N use efficiency and crop yield . However the effectiveness of N stabilizers on rice yield and NUE varies greatly and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood . We performed a series of

@highlight Mechanisms of the effectiveness of N stabilizers on rice yield are not well understood.
@highlight The effects of N stabilizers on soil N transformation and rice yield were studied with a
@highlight N tracing approach.
@highlight Matching soil N transformation and plant N preference is critical to improve rice yield and NUE.
@highlight Effectiveness of N stabilizers on yield is dependent on the matching between soil N and plant N preference.
