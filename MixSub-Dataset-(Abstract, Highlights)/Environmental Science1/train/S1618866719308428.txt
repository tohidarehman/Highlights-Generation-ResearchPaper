 The negative impacts of urbanization on biodiversity can be mitigated via afforestation particularly if the trees provide food e.g . flowers and fruits . However it is necessary to highlight the effectiveness of the tree species in attracting and supporting primary consumers in cities . Addressing animal tree interactions in urban areas is useful for identifying such efficacy and consistently selecting native tree resources . Here we investigate the role of the native tree species

@highlight Visits to
@highlight flowers by urban birds were investigated.
@highlight This native tree provide nectar and water for birds from different lifestyles.
@highlight Interactive categories were identified particularly perching bird pollination.
@highlight Nectar was foraged during resource scarcity at the height of the dry season.
@highlight might be a management tool to promote urban biodiversity
