 Public open space constitutes a significant part of the sustainable urban environment . Urban green spacewhich includes parks sports fields and wetlandsis a crucial type of public open space in a healthy urban ecosystem . Most studies on urban green spaces comprise large scale objective evaluations with relatively few related theoretical studies from the perspective of human behavior . This is predominantly due to the technical constraints involved in obtaining small scale public open space population activity data . To address this issue this study examines the crowd activities of an urban green space by combining Wi Fi probe and location data to discern population distribution characteristics . This study uses Yanfu Greenland Park a green space in a central area of Shanghaia typical high density cityas a case study . This study proposes a technical method for measuring population distribution in a small scale public space demonstrating its applicability through an analysis of the population density distribution and activity trajectory in an urban green space . The methodology demonstrated in this study can help urban planning designers and managers create more successful public open spaces . This technical method may also assist urban planning and related research on different scales .

@highlight Proposes a new method for examining population behavior in public open space POS .
@highlight Uses Wi Fi probe data to analyze population activity in Yanfu Greenland China.
@highlight Identifies when and how spaces are used to evaluate green space design and planning.
@highlight Method enables study of population density and activity trajectory in small spaces.
@highlight Can aid POS design and research by mitigating funding and sample size limitations.
