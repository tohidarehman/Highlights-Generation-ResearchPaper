 Since the number of cancer survivors is increasing it is imperative that we better understand the long term consequences of these survivors . We assessed the risk of developing a second primary malignant neoplasm after an index potentially HPV associated cancers . We constructed a population based cohort of patients with P HPV AC using Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registry data . We limited patients to those with invasive P HPV AC based on the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology 3rd edition . Excess SPMN risks were calculated based on standardized incidence ratios and excess absolute risks per 10 000 person years at risk . A total of 105 644 patients with an index P HPV AC were identified and 7.8 developed a SPMN . In all P HPV AC patients the overall SIR was 1.73 and EAR of 70.72 per 10 000 PYR . All index P HPV AC sites showed statistically significant increases in the risk of SPMN except for anal cancer among men compared with the general population . The greatest increase in risk of SPMN was observed among patients diagnosed with an index P HPV oropharyngeal cancer . Men developed SPMN mostly in aero digestive tract whiles women developed SPMN both in aero digestive tract and other HPV associated cancer sites . P HPV AC survivors experienced excess risk of SPMN . These findings have the potential to affect future surveillance practices and improve preventive healthcare for survivors of P HPV ACs .

@highlight Quantified the risks and burden of SPMN among survivors of potential HPV associated cancers.
@highlight The risk and burden of SPMN was high overall.
@highlight 1 in 12 survivors of potentially HPV associated cancers developed SPMN.
@highlight SPMNs were predominantly in the aero digestive tract and other HPV associated sites.
@highlight Finding calls for strategies that prevent or detect SPMN early in cancer survivors.
