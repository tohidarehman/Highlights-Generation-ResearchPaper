 Ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast is considered to be a non obligate precursor of invasive breast cancer . This suggests that risk factors for DCIS should be a subset of those for IBC . To this end we investigated whether demographic lifestyle and reproductive factors that have been linked to IBC risk are also associated with DCIS risk . This study was conducted in 263 788 women aged 4069 years at enrolment into the UK Biobank population based cohort . Information on demographic reproductive and health factors was collected at baseline using computerized questionnaires while incident DCIS was ascertained through linkage to UK cancer registries . Age adjusted and multivariable hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models in the total sample and by menopausal status . During an average of 7 years of follow up 1 016 women developed DCIS . Multivariable analysis indicated that age physical activity height family history of breast cancer menopausal status parity and years between menarche and first live birth had associations with DCIS risk . Among post menopausal women not using hormone replacement therapy body mass index 30kg m

@highlight Anthropometric and reproductive risk factors for invasive breast cancer have been associated with risk of ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS of the breast.
@highlight No prospective study has evaluated the association of these factors with risk of DCIS in both pre and post menopausal women.
@highlight Using the UK Biobank data we confirmed some of the DCIS risk factors previously reported by other studies.
@highlight We report for the first time that height and body mass index BMI among post menopausal women are associated with increased DCIS risk.
@highlight These findings suggest that BMI is potentially involved in breast tumorigenic development at an earlier stage than previously proposed.
