 The cumulative burden from rare cancers has not been adequately explored in Canada . This analysis aims to characterize the occurrence of rare cancers among Canadians and estimate the probability of being diagnosed with a rare cancer among cancer patients with different demographic characteristics . The Canadian Cancer Registry was used for this analysis . Cancer types were classified in three ways using the SEER site recode scheme by histology group and by site histology group . The age standardized incidence rate and 95 confidence intervals for each cancer type was estimated for diagnoses from 2006 to 2016 . Two ASIR thresholds were used to classify cancers as rare 6 100 000 year and 15 100 000 year . Log binomial regression was used to estimate the adjusted probability of having a rare cancer among those with cancer by age sex and geographic region . Using the 6 100 000 year threshold the incidence proportion of rare cancers ranged from 9.7 17.0 and ranged from 19.2 52.5 using the 15 100 000 year threshold . The adjusted probability of being diagnosed with a rare cancer was highest among those aged 19 years . There was higher concordance in estimates of the burden of rare cancers across methods to classify cancer types when the lower incidence rate threshold was used to define rare cancers . This analysis yielded evidence that rare cancers comprise a substantial proportion of annual cancer diagnoses among Canadians . Findings from this analysis point to using a lower incidence rate threshold to generate estimates of the burden of rare cancers that are robust to different cancer classification schemes .

@highlight There was an annual average of 154 900 cancer diagnoses among Canadians 20062016.
@highlight The proportion of rare cancers ranged 9.752.5 using different definitions of rare.
@highlight Estimated burden of rare cancers was stable across cancer classification schemes with a lower incidence threshold.
@highlight The probability of having a rare cancer was low when cancers were defined by histology vs site.
@highlight The effect of sex on probability of having a rare cancer varied by age.
