 The routes to diagnosis and the time intervals along the diagnostic pathway affect cancer outcomes . Some data on routes to diagnosis and milestone dates can be extracted from registries or databases . When this data is incomplete inaccurate or non existing other data sources are needed . This study investigates the agreement between multiple data sources on routes to diagnosis and milestone dates of cancer pathway . Information on routes to diagnosis and milestone dates were compared across four data sources for breast colorectal lung and ovarian cancers across the UK Scandinavia Canada and Australia . Agreement on routes to diagnosis and milestone dates was assessed by Kappa and AC1 coefficients and Lins concordance correlation coefficient . 4502 patients were included in the analysis of routes to diagnosis . The agreement was almost perfect for breast cancer substantial to almost perfect for colorectal and ovarian cancers and substantial for lung cancer . 2287 patients were included in the analysis of milestone dates . The agreement was adequate for all cancer types highest agreement was seen for date of diagnosis . We found a reasonable agreement between patient physician questionnaires and registry data for routes to diagnosis and milestone dates . The agreement on routes to diagnosis was generally higher for breast cancer than for colorectal ovarian and lung cancers . Lower agreement was seen on date of first presentation to primary care and date of treatment initiation compared to date of diagnosis .

@highlight We found reasonable agreement on routes to diagnosis and milestone dates in the cancer pathway between patient physicians and cancer registry.
@highlight Agreement on routes to diagnosis was higher for breast cancer than for colorectal ovarian and lung cancers.
@highlight Agreement on date of diagnosis date was higher than for date of first presentation to primary care and date of treatment.
@highlight Combining multiple data sources can provide more complete and reliable information on the cancer diagnostic pathway.
