 There are conflicting reports on the association of vasectomy and the risk of prostate cancer . Our objective was to evaluate the association between vasectomy and PCa from a nationwide cohort in Finland . Sterilization registry of Finland and the Finnish Cancer Registry data were utilized to identify all men who underwent vasectomy between years 19872014 in Finland . Standard incidence ratio for PCa as well as all cause standardized mortality ratios were calculated . We identified 38 124 men with vasectomy with a total of 429 937 person years follow up data . The median age at vasectomy was 39.7 years 35.944.0 after vasectomy PCa was diagnosed in 413 men . SIR for PCa for the vasectomy cohort was 1.15 . By the end of follow up 19 men had died from PCa while the expected number was 20.5 . The overall mortality was decreased among men with vasectomy . We found a small statistically significant increase in PCa incidence after vasectomy but in contrast the mortality of vasectomized men was significantly reduced . This may be due to higher likelihood of vasectomized men to undergo prostate specific antigen testing having healthier general lifestyle and other biological factors e.g . high reproductive fitness .

@highlight Incidence of prostate cancer is increased after vasectomy.
@highlight Incidence of prostate cancer increases during the first ten years after vasectomy.
@highlight Men with history of vasectomy had nearly 50 decreased risk for overall mortality.
