 Important social disparities in colorectal screening exist in Canada . Few studies have assessed disparities further along the cancer control continuum . Here we assess the associations between social and material deprivation physician density rural residence and the absence of provincial mail based screening programs and colorectal cancer stage at diagnosis . Colorectal cancer cases and stage data were obtained through the Canadian Cancer Registry . Cases were linked to 2006 Canadian Census Dissemination Area level data on rural urban status exposure to a provincial mail based screening program and social and material deprivation and to Scotts Medical Database 2011 physician density data . Age sex and predictor adjusted Generalized estimating equation Poisson models were used to determine independent associations between predictors and late stage at diagnosis . Half of CRC cases are diagnosed at stage III or IV with younger age groups experiencing higher late stage prevalence . The covariate adjusted late stage prevalence was 2 percentage points higher in most materially and socially deprived areas and in provinces with no mail based screening programs . No significant differences were observed according to rural residence or physician density . Social disparities in late stage CRC diagnosis are modest . Continued surveillance of these disparities may be warranted as provinces continue to promote early cancer detection through screening and stage distributions may change overtime .

@highlight Half of colorectal cancer cases in Canada are diagnosed at stage III or IV.
@highlight Younger age is associated with later stage at diagnosis.
@highlight Late stage prevalence is slightly higher in more socially deprived areas.
@highlight Late stage prevalence is slightly higher in more materially deprived areas.
@highlight Opportunistic settings vs mail based programs are associated with later diagnosis.
