 Advances in early detection and treatment of breast cancer have led to better survival . Consequently more women with BrCA now die from non BrCA causes . We investigated all cause and other cause survival among women with BrCA . From the Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian cohort we selected women diagnosed with BrCA from 1994 2014 . To compare survival of cases to non cases we used exposure density sampling . We computed standard mortality ratios and performed Cox proportional hazards models with matched case control sets controlling for demographics and additional covariates . We also examined survival by stage within BrCA cases . Among 78 215 women enrolled in PLCO there were 1211 in situ and 4790 invasive BrCA cases . 15 year survival rates were 97.1 and 77.2 among in situ and 86.4 and 73.4 among invasive cases . For other cause mortality in situ cases had lower risk in models I and II versus controls . All cause mortality HRs for in situ cases were 0.83 and 0.85 in Models I and II respectively . Other cause mortality was similar among invasive cases and controls . Within BrCA cases higher stage was associated with increased other cause mortality HRs were 1.2 and 1.7 for stage II and III IV versus stage I . Mortality from other causes exceeded that of BrCA in both in situ and invasive cases highlighting the importance of managing patients chronic conditions during and following cancer treatment .

@highlight More women with breast cancer die of other causes than of their cancer.
@highlight Women with in situ breast cancer have better survival than age matched controls.
@highlight Other cause survival decreases with increasing breast cancer stage.
