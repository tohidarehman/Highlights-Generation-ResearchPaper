 This study compares the side effects of active surveillance prostatectomy radiation with or without adjuvant endocrine therapy watchful waiting and palliative therapy on patient reported outcomes in a nationwide population based cohort of Danish men with prostate cancer . A total of 15 465 participants completed questionnaires over a 5year period . Condition specific quality of life focusing on urinary function bowel incontinence sexual function and hormonal symptoms were investigated using the validated EPIC 26 questionnaire at diagnosis 1 year and 3 year follow up . Patients were identified from the Danish Prostate Cancer Registry with data linked to several national healthcare registries . Longitudinal analysis with linear mixed effects models were fitted to compare changes over time on quality of life symptom scores for five treatment modalities adjusting for age clinical TNM stage PSA value Gleason score Charlson Comorbidity score education disposable income and urbanization measured at time of prostate cancer diagnosis . There was a more than10 point decrease in mean scores across all symptom domains at 1 year follow up . Thereafter mean scores for all symptom domains improved marginally and remained relatively unchanged at 3 year follow up . Prostatectomy had the greatest negative effect on sexual function and urinary incontinence . Overall quality of life was most adversely affected by sexual function regardless of treatment modality . Clinical interventions for improving symptoms should focus particularly on the first year after prostate cancer diagnosis . Greater emphasis on improving sexual function should be practiced in clinical and rehabilitative care since this area has the single greatest impact on symptom specific QoL after primary treatment for prostate cancer .

@highlight We investigated treatment side effects on patient reported outcomes in a cohort of Danish men diagnosed with prostate cancer over a 5 year period.
@highlight Overall quality of life was most adversely affected by sexual function regardless of treatment modality.
@highlight Prostatectomy resulted in the greatest decline in sexual function scores in the short term follow up.
@highlight Our findings suggest that clinical interventions for improving symptoms should focus on the first year after prostate cancer diagnosis.
