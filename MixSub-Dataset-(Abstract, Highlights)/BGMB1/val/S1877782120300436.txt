 Aggregation of all Black populations in US cancer mortality profiles masks remarkable heterogeneity by place of birth . Comparing U.S born African Americans with African and Afro Caribbean immigrants may highlight specific cancer prevention and control needs and clarify global cancer epidemiology . Such a comparison has yet to be undertaken on a population basis . Using 20122017 vital statistics data from California Florida Minnesota and New York age standardized cancer mortality rates were computed for distinct Black populations . Comparisons were made to the majority White population using mortality rate ratios obtained from negative binomial regression . Of the 83 460 cancer deaths analyzed among Blacks nearly 20 were immigrants . African males and females had the lowest all sites combined cancer mortality rates African Americans had the highest while Afro Caribbean were in between . The average Black White MRR was significant for prostate endometrial stomach multiple myeloma premenopausal breast liver and cervical cancers . While in aggregate Blacks in the US have high cancer mortality rates race itself is not the primary determinant of these disparities . Black immigrant populations show lower cancer mortality than both African Americans and Whites especially for cancers where environmental factors feature more predominantly lung colorectal and breast . Even for cancers with high mortality among all African descent groups this study suggests a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors . Endometrial cancer was unique mortality rates were similarly high for all three analyzed Black groups .

@highlight Aggregating Black populations in the US overlooks important cancer differences.
@highlight US Blacks had the highest mortality rates for common and infection related cancers.
@highlight Caribbean Blacks had intermediate rates African Blacks had the lowest rates.
@highlight Prostate cancer rates were higher in West Africans East Africans had high liver rates.
@highlight Research on genetic and environmental cancer risk within Black populations is needed.
