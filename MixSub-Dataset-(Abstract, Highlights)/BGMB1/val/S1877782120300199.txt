 This study investigated the association of breast lobular involution status and three inflammatory markers as predictors of survival among breast cancer patients in the Multiethnic Cohort . Lobular involution was evaluated in tissue sections of normal breast tissue and COX 2 TNF and TGF proteins were assessed by immunohistochemistry in tumor microarrays . A summary score added the expression levels of the three markers . Cox regression was applied to estimate hazard ratios and 95 confidence intervals with age as the time metric and adjustment for factors known to affect mortality . Among 254 women with pathologic blocks and follow up information 54 all cause and 10 breast cancer specific deaths were identified after a mean follow up time of 16.0 3.1 years . For 214 participants an inflammatory score was available and 157 women had information on lobular involution . Lobular involution was not significantly associated with survival . Expression of both COX 2 and TNF were significant predictors of lower survival while the association for TGF was weaker . When combined into one overall inflammation score both intermediate and high scores were associated with higher mortality but only the latter was statistically significant . No significant association with breast cancer specific mortality was detected . These results suggest that strong expression of inflammatory markers in breast tissue predicts a poorer prognosis possibly due to a system wide state of chronic inflammation .

@highlight Little is known about the influence of the tissue specific characteristics with survival among women diagnosed with breast cancer.

@highlight Strong expression of inflammatory markers but not involution in breast tissue predicted a poorer prognosis among women with breast cancer.
@highlight Addressing underlying causes of chronic inflammation in breast cancer patients may help to improve overall health and life expectancy.
