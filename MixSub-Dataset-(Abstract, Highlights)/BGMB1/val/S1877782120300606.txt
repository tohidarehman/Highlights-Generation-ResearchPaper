 Colombians in coastal Tumaco have a lower incidence of infection was confirmed by Steiner stain and serology using African and European origin strains . Gastric histology and serum inflammatory biomarkers in dyspeptic Tumaco or Tuquerres patients were evaluated to predict progression of gastric lesions . infection was nearly universal by Steiner stain and serology . IgG response to European origin An IL 5 association with progression of gastric lesions is novel and could be evaluated in addition to TFF3 and pepsinogen I II ratio as a non invasive prognostic screen . Results suggest Tumaco patients were exposed to infectious diseases beyond Results support a prior recommendation to evaluate TFF3 and pepsinogen I II together to predict aggressive gastric histology . Our data indicate IL 5 should be further evaluated as prognostic parameter .

@highlight Coastal Colombians have lower
@highlight  associated gastric cancer compared to the Andes despite comparable infection and gastritis.
@highlight Lesion progression was associated with significant odds ratios for serum IL 5 trefoil factor 3 TFF3 and low pepsinogen I II ratio.
@highlight Low risk patients had elevated serum inflammatory biomarkers that reflect higher exposure to infectious diseases beyond
@highlight Data suggest IL 5 TFF3 and pepsinogen I II ratios should be evaluated in combination to predict aggressive gastric histology.
