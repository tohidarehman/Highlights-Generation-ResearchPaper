 Epidemiologic information on rare cancers is scarce outside of the Western countries . The project surveillance of rare cancers in Asia provides for the first time the burden of rare cancers in some Asian countries based on the latest list . 1 to assess whether the European list of rare cancers fits the Asian setting and 2 to compare the incidences of rare cancers between Europe and Asian countries . Population based cancer registry data on patients diagnosed from 2011 to 2015 in Japan Korea and Taiwan and patients diagnosed from 2000 to 2007 in 94 European registries were analysed . The incidences for all cancers were calculated they were then grouped into several tiers and families according to the rare cancer list and whether cancers rare was examined . Rare cancer counts according to the list in the observed population were 196 in Japan 203 in Korea 198 in Taiwan and 198 in the EU . The proportions of rare in overall incidence were 16.3 in Japan 23.7 in Korea 24.2 in Taiwan and 22.2 in the EU . The numbers of newly diagnosed rare cancer cases in 2015 were 140 188 in Japan 52 071 in Korea and 24 147 in Taiwan . Most rare cancers in Europe were also rare in the Asian countries considered . The observed differences were due to well known risk factors . The European definition and list of rare cancers appear to reflect well cancer incidence in East Asia .

@highlight Proportions of rare in overall incidence were around 1624 in the 3 Asia and in EU.
@highlight Most rare cancers in Europe were also rare in the Asian countries considered.
@highlight Observed differences were due to well known risk factors.
