 Cancer survival has improved in Western Australia over recent decades . Loss of life expectancy is a useful measure for assessing cancer survival at a population level . Some previous studies estimating LOLE have required a minimum follow up beyond diagnosis to reduce the impact of modelled extrapolation while others have not . The first aim of this study was to assess the impact of minimum length of follow up on LOLE estimates for people diagnosed in 2006 with female breast colorectal prostate lung cervical combined oesophageal and stomach cancers and melanoma . Based on these results the second aim was to assess temporal changes in LOLE for these cancer types for diagnoses between 1982 and 2016 . Person level linked cancer registry and mortality data were used for invasive primary cancer diagnoses for WA residents aged 1589 years . The analysis for aim one included cases diagnosed from 1982 to the end of 2006 followed to the end of 2006 2011 or 2016 . To achieve the second study aim the diagnostic period was extended to the end of 2016 . Life expectancy estimates were obtained after fitting flexible parametric relative survival models . Single year age and sex specific death rates were used as a reference to estimate LOLE and proportionate loss of life expectancy . Temporal changes were not reported for prostate cervical oesophageal and stomach cancers or melanoma due to differences in LOLE estimates by minimum follow up time or estimate imprecision . Marked reductions in LOLE were observed for female breast and colorectal cancer . There was minimal absolute reduction for lung cancer where LOLE remained high . This study considered the appropriateness of including recent cancer diagnoses when assessing temporal changes in LOLE finding variation in estimates with differing minimum follow up or high parameter uncertainty for most included cancer types . Temporal changes in LOLE in turn reflected changes in the life expectancy of the general population cancer detection and management . These factors must be considered when estimating and interpreting LOLE estimates .

@highlight Loss of life expectancy LOLE is an adjunct to existing cancer survival measures.
@highlight The effect of minimum follow up is important for assessing long term temporal trends.
@highlight LOLE in Western Australia differed by minimum follow up time for cervical prostate oesophageal and stomach cancers and melanoma.
@highlight LOLE decreased for female breast and colorectal from 1982 to 2016.
@highlight LOLE remained high for lung cancer e.g. 16.7 years for a male aged 65 years diagnosed in 2016 .
