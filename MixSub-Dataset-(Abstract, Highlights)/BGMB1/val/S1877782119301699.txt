 The principal target age for Australian BreastScreen services was 5069 years in 19912013 and 5074 years from 2014 . History of BreastScreen NSW screening participation of NSW women diagnosed with breast cancer in 20052014 was examined using linked BreastScreen and Cancer Registry data . Differences in BreastScreen participation were investigated by sociodemographic and tumour characteristics and diagnostic period using the Pearson Chi square test or Fishers Exact test when numbers were small and by multivariate logistic regression . At breast cancer diagnosis a history of BreastScreen participation varied by age from 23 for 4049years to 68 for 5059 years 72 for 7074 years and 78 for 6069 years . Among women experiencing breast cancer at age 5069 years 60 had participated in BreastScreen 24 months of diagnosis . Higher odds of BreastScreen participation applied to residents of inner regional and remote compared with major city areas and for women with localized compared with more distant cancer spread . BreastScreen participation was lower in Indigenous than non Indigenous women . Differences in participation existed by country of birth and residential location but they were not pronounced . The history of BreastScreen NSW participation of 60 24 months for women aged 5069 years at breast cancer diagnosis is less than the 70 target for biennial screening coverage at a population level but this target has never been reached by an Australian jurisdiction . Qualitative research of screening barriers and opportunities may provide a useful guide for reducing barriers across the population .
