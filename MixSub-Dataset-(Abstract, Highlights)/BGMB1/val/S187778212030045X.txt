 Long term childhood and young adult cancer survivors are at increased risk of the late effects of multiple chronic conditions . In this study we estimate the cumulative burden of subsequent malignant neoplasms cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalisations in long term survivors of childhood and young adult cancers and associated treatment risks . Five year survivors of cancer diagnosed aged 029 years between 19922009 in Yorkshire UK were included . The cumulative count of all hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory conditions and all SMNs diagnosed up to 2015 was calculated with death as a competing risk . Associations between treatment exposures and cumulative burden were investigated using multiple failure time survival models . A total of 3464 5 year survivors were included with a median follow up of 8.2 years . Ten years post diagnosis the cumulative incidence for a respiratory admission was 6.0 a cardiovascular admission was 2.0 and SMN was 1.0 with an average of 13 events per 100 survivors observed . The risk of experiencing multiple events was higher for those treated with chemotherapy drugs with known lung toxicity . Survivors of childhood and young adult cancer experience a high burden of morbidity due to respiratory cardiovascular diseases and SMNs up to 20 years post diagnosis . Statistical methods that capture multiple morbidities and recurrent events are important when quantifying the burden of late effects in young cancer survivors .

@highlight Survivors of childhood cancer have increased risk of multiple and recurrent disease.
@highlight Cumulative risk of hospitalisations for cardiovascular or respiratory conditions or cancer registration for SMN analysed.
@highlight 10 years post diagnosis an average of 13 events per 100 survivors were observed.
