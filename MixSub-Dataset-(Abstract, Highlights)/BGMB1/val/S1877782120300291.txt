 Social inequalities in survival after cancer diagnosis have been described in several high income countries all cancer sites combined and for several specific cancer sites . The objective of this study was to analyze 5 year net survival after cancer diagnosis in a middle income country according to the characteristics at the district level . Costa Rican Cancer Registry is a national population based registry . All cases diagnosed between January 1 2011 and December 31 2015 were included . Deaths that occurred before December 31 2018 were identified . An ecological study was implemented . The 477 districts were described using the 2011 Census . Urbanity and wealth was assessed . Socioeconomic inequalities in cancer survival were measured using multivariable flexible parametric models . Life tables by socio economic status were used . 5 year net survival ranged from 9 for liver cancer to 98 for in situ cervical cancer . Patients living in socioeconomically disadvantaged districts experienced poorer cancer survival at 5years after taking into account the inequalities in survival in the general population . This result was robust and was found at 1 2 and 5years in all cancer combined and in low medium and high lethality cancers . There was no difference according to the area except for low lethality cancers at 1year . Despite its universal and solidarity based health system Costa Rica is experiencing social inequalities in survival after cancer diagnosis .
