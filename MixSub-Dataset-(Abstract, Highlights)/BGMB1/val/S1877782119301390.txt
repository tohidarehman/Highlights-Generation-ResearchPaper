 Preventable risk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukemia remain largely unknown . The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between adherence to nutrition based guidelines for cancer prevention and CLL in the MCC Spain casecontrol study . A total of 318 CLL cases and 1293 population based controls were included in the present study . The World Cancer Research Fund American Institute for Cancer Research score based on the 2018 recommendations for cancer prevention was constructed . We used logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounders . Individuals in the highest tertile of the WCRF AICR score had an odds ratio for CLL of 1.25 compared with individuals with low adherence . Each point increment in the score was associated with an OR for CLL of 1.06 . Analyses by severity of disease did not show significant heterogeneity of effects . Overall our results do not support an association between the WCRF AICR score and CLL yet we might have been limited by statistical power and study design to detect modest associations . Further research ideally with a prospective design long follow up and including additional lymphoma subtypes is warranted to confirm the impact of composite healthy lifestyle behaviors on lymphoma risk .

@highlight The 2018 WCRF AICR guidelines were examined in relation to chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL .
@highlight 318 CLL cases and 1293 controls from the MCC Spain study were included.
@highlight Adherence to the 2018 WCRF AICR recommendations was not associated with CLL.
