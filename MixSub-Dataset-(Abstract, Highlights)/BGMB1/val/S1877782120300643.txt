 The association between coffee consumption and colorectal cancer risk generally appears null but recent evidence suggests that risk may vary by coffee type . We examined associations of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee intake with colorectal cancer risk overall and with colon and rectum separately among older U.S. men and women . In 1999 47 010 men and 60 051 women with no previous diagnosis of cancer aged 4796 years in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort completed a food frequency questionnaire that assessed caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee intake consumption was updated in 2003 . A total of 1829 colorectal cancer cases were verified through June 2015 . Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate multivariable adjusted hazard rate ratios and 95 confidence intervals adjusting for smoking history alcohol caffeinated decaffeinated coffee intake and other colorectal cancer risk factors . Consumption of 2 cups day of decaffeinated coffee compared to no decaffeinated coffee was associated with lower risk of overall colorectal cancer HR 0.82 95 CI 0.690.96 In this prospective study higher intake of decaffeinated coffee was associated with lower risk of colorectal colon and rectal cancers . Further study on associations of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee with colorectal cancer risk by subsite is needed .

@highlight Decaffeinated but not caffeinated coffee was associated with lower CRC risk.
@highlight Risk associated with caffeinated coffee varied by subsite.
@highlight Additional research should confirm subsite specific findings observed herein.
