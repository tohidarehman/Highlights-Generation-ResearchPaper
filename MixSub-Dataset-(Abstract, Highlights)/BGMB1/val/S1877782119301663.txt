 There has been a rapid increase in colorectal cancer cases in Asian countries including Malaysia . CRC is usually diagnosed at a late stage and early detection of CRC is vital in improving survival . This study was conducted to determine the uptake rate of the immunochemical faecal occult blood test the response rate to colonoscopy and the CRC detection rate . We also wanted to identify the association between colorectal neoplasia and the Asia Pacific Colorectal Cancer Screening scoring system . We recruited 2264 individuals from The Malaysian Cohort participants aged 3565 years who consented to colorectal screening using the iFOBT kit from July 2017 until January 2019 . The response rate and positive iFOBT test rate of this study were 79.6 and 13.1 respectively . Among those with positive results 125 individuals underwent colonoscopy CRC was detected in six of them while 45 others had polyps . The overall CRC detection rate was 0.3 while the colorectal neoplasia detection rate was 2.3 . The APCS scoring indicated a significant association with colorectal neoplasia risk with increasing trend by severity from moderate to high risk compared to low risk . Most of the participants who were positive for iFOBT were those at high risk . The awareness of CRC risk and iFOBT screening are important strategies for early detection of CRC . We showed a CRC detection rate of 0.3 among those who volunteered to have the iFOBT screening .

@highlight IFOBT is a suitable screening tool with detection rate higher than in previous studies.
@highlight People who were aware of their risk were more inclined to be screened.
@highlight High neoplasia detection served in early prevention of CRC.
