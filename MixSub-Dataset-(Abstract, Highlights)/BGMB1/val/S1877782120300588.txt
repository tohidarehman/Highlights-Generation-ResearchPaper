 Prostate specific antigen testing for early detection of prostate cancer is low value when it is not indicated by guidelines and the harms outweigh the benefits . In this retrospective cohort study we identify provider and patient factors associated with PSA testing particularly in situations where testing would be low value . We used electronic health record data from 2011 to 2018 representing 1 738 021 health system encounters in the United States . Using logistic generalized estimating equation models we examined patient factors provider factors and overall time trends associated with PSA testing in low value and appropriate settings . Comorbid illness 0.0 for 3 conditions vs none and no prior PSA testing were associated with a lower likelihood of PSA testing in low value situations while family history of prostate cancer and high prior PSA test results were associated with a greater likelihood . Men aged 5565 years were at greatest risk for PSA testing in low value situations . We identified several patient and provider factors associated with PSA testing in low value settings . Some aspects suggest attention to relevant factors for PSA testing in low value settings while others may encourage PSA testing in low value settings . The greatest likelihood of PSA testing in low value settings is among men within the age range most commonly recommended by guidelines .

@highlight Low value PSA testing is most likely among patients with prior PSA values.
@highlight Men 5565 year old are most likely to receive low value PSA testing.
@highlight Urologist are most likely among providers to order low value PSA testing.
