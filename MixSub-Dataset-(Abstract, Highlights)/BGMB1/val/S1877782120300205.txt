 Loss of life expectancy provides valuable insights into the impact of cancer . We evaluated the temporal trends in LOLE for Australian cancer patients and the gain in life years for recently diagnosed patients due to survival improvements . Analysis was conducted using an Australian population based cohort aged 5089 years who were primarily diagnosed with one of 19 leading cancers between 19822015 . Flexible parametric survival models were used to estimate LOLE and the proportion of life lost by year age group sex and for New South Wales only spread of disease . The total years of LOLE and gain in life years due to survival improvements were estimated for those diagnosed in 2014 . For 19 cancers combined LOLE and POLL were significantly lower for more recent diagnoses . Cancer specific temporal trends were consistent by age sex and spread of disease although the magnitude varied . Prostate kidney or non Hodgkin lymphoma experienced the largest decreases in POLL over time . For the 2014 diagnoses an estimation of 403 094 life years lost will be caused by the 19 cancers . With the increase in cancer survival over time the 2014 cohort will gain an extra 432 588 life years compared to that experienced by the 1982 cohort . While reduced impact of a cancer diagnosis on LOLE over time is encouraging the growing number of cancer survivors in Australia is likely to pose complex challenges for cancer patients their care givers and health care systems .

@highlight Loss of life expectancy and proportion of life lost significantly reduced over time among Australian cancer patients.
@highlight Prostate non Hodgkin lymphoma and kidney cancers had the largest decrease in proportion of life lost.
@highlight The 19 cancers included in this study were estimated to cause 403 094 life years lost among Australians diagnosed in 2014.
@highlight An estimated 432 588 life years were gained for the 2014 diagnoses due to improved cancer survival since 1982.
