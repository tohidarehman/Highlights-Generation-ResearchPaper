 A growing body of evidence has suggested an association between Hepatitis C virus infection and risk of pancreatic cancer . Herein we conducted a meta analysis of available evidence to explore this association . We systematically retrieved studies that investigated the association between HCV infection and risk of PAC . Pooled odds ratio with corresponding 95 confidence interval of PAC for patients with HCV infection was calculated using the fixed or random effects model . A total of 16 studies were included in this meta analysis . Combined patients with HCV infection were more likely to develop PAC than people without it pooled OR 1.51 95 CI 1.31 1.74 HCV infection was associated with increased risk of PAC but this association was attenuated among studies that adjusted their results for potential risk factors for PAC . Future prospective cohort studies are needed to confirm this association .

@highlight This meta analysis showed that HCV infection was associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer.
@highlight Adjusting for diabetes alcohol intake and smoking attenuated the association.
@highlight Future population based prospective cohort studies are highly recommended.
