 Military women are faced with unique circumstances including frequent relocation and occupational factors that may influence their participation in routine cervical cancer screening . No data on programmatic participation in cervical cancer screening in Canadian Armed Forces women has been synthesized to date . To estimate cervical cancer screening rates in Canadian military women using clinical and administrative data sources . Actively serving Regular Force females who were 25 years of age between January 1st 2015 and December 31st 2017 were included in the study . Scanned documents containing Papanicolaou test results were extracted from electronic health records and further linked to demographic data sources . Screening coverage rates were calculated over the three year study period and results were stratified by both military command and rank . The study period yielded over 23 000 person years of data . The average screening rate over this period was 77.7 and was highest in the 4560 year age group . Variations in rates were observed by rank and command with higher screening rates observed in Officers and Royal Canadian Navy staff . Overall screening rates showed a declining trend for all groups across the study period . Cervical cancer screening rates amongst CAF members are currently below recommended guidelines and appear to be declining . These trends mirror those observed more widely in the general Canadian population and may be a consequence of recent changes to guidelines for both cervical cancer and human papillomavirus screening .

@highlight Canadian military women face a unique set of occupational circumstances.
@highlight Cervical cancer screening rates have not yet been studied in Canadian military women.
@highlight Using administrative data this study estimates screening coverage in Canadian military women at 77.7 .
@highlight This coverage rate is below the 80 recommended target and appears to be declining over time.
