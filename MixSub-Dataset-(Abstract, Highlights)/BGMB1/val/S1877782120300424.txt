 The population based Estonian Cancer Registry has maintained a database of cancer cases since 1968 . Between 2001 and 2007 the ECR was prohibited from linking cancer records to death certificates . In January 2008 the prohibition was lifted and two years later the ECR was able to begin tracing back unmatched deaths . This paper estimates the effect of the linkage ban on reported cancer incidence and survival . Incident cancers in 20012007 were extracted from the ECR database in May 2018 to allow for late registrations . Two datasets were created one with all incident cases and another without death certificate initiated cases . Using both datasets age standardised incidence rates and their ratios age standardised five year relative survival ratios and excess mortality rate ratios were calculated . In 20012007 46 535 incident cancers were registered in the ECR . Of them 2299 were DCI cases . The inclusion of DCI cases increased the ASIR for overall cancer by 6 in men and 3 in women . An increase 10 in ASIR for lung liver and pancreatic cancer was observed . The effect of accrued DCI cases to the ARSR was minor . Excess mortality in the dataset without DCI cases was 4 underestimated in men and 3 in women . Biases in cancer incidence and survival measures generated by the temporary record linkage ban were largely correctable by using trace back procedures when this became possible . Nevertheless this type of ban and the arguments put forward to justify it harm disease registration and register based research .

@highlight A ban to link cancer and death records biases incidence and survival measures.
@highlight The ban results in significant underreporting of lung liver and pancreatic cancers.
@highlight The ban discredits disease registration register based research and researchers.
