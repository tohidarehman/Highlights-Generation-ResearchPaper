 Although a number of previous studies have noted the association between body mass index and upper gastrointestinal cancer risk little evidence exists in the Chinese esophageal squamous dysplasia population . This prospective study investigated the association between BMI and UGI cancer risk in the Linxian Dysplasia Nutrition Intervention Trial cohort . A total of 3298 participants were included in the final analysis . Asian specific BMI cut offs were used to define BMI subgroups underweight 18.5 kg m During over 30 years of follow up we identified 654 incident esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cases and 434 gastric cancer cases which included 88 gastric non cardia carcinoma and 346 gastric cardia carcinoma cases . Relative to normal weight overweight or obesity were associated with a significantly reduced risk of ESCC after multivariate adjustment including age at baseline gender smoking drinking family history of cancer education and consumption of fresh fruit . Subgroup analyses found that clear effects were evident in women and subjects with a family history of cancer . No association with gastric cancer was observed in any subjects or subgroups . Overweight obesity was associated with decreased risk of ESCC in this dysplasia population particularly in women and persons who had a family history of cancer . Future studies are needed to confirm these findings .

@highlight This study was the first study to examine the association between BMI and risk of UGI cancer in dysplasia population.
@highlight Overweight or obese could decrease the risk of ESCC particularly in women and persons with family history of cancer.
@highlight No associations between BMI and GC risk were observed in any subjects or subgroups.
