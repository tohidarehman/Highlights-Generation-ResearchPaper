 The objective of this study was to analyze the survival of patients with lung cancer by TNM stage in the 4 year periods 20032006 20072010 and 20112014 treated in the Basque Health Service and to compare this with survival in an equivalent sample of the general population . A retrospective observational design was applied to cases from the Hospital Cancer Registry of Euskadi . A cohort of 11 635 patients had complete data for the following variables TNM stage age sex histology date of diagnosis vital status and date of death . Relative survival and Cox and parametric regression models were used to assess changes in survival . The lung cancer 5 year survival probability decreased with increasing stage from 5065 in patients with stage I disease to 23 in those with stage IV disease . Comparing patients diagnosed from 20112014 and 20032006 we found that survival improved the risk of death in 20032006 was 1.66 for stage I 1.51 for stage II 1.21 for stage III and 1.10 for stage IV the 5 year relative survival increased from 11.0 to 17.8 in the period 20112014 and the years of life lost decreased significantly from 20032006 to 20112014 varying between 6.16 and 16.21 . Survival from lung cancer by stage in the Basque Country has lengthened significantly across all disease stages . Nonetheless since we estimated that lung cancer patients still have significantly lower mean survival times than the general population there is a need for more research to improve these outcomes .

@highlight Lung cancer survival increased over the period 20032011 in the Basque Country.
@highlight The 5 year probability of death from lung cancer remained slightly above 80 .
@highlight The years of life lost varied from 6.16 Stage I to 16.21 Stage IV .
@highlight Lung cancer patients survival time is a fifth that of the general population.
