 Cancers comprise a significant proportion of urologic workload . The epidemiology of prostate and renal cancers is well described . We report the incidence survival and predictors of survival for non prostate non renal urologic cancers between 1977 and 2013 . All patients in the South Australian Cancer Registry diagnosed with bladder testis penis renal pelvis ureteric and other male genital organ cancers between 1977 and 2013 were included . Demographic data included age sex year of diagnosis grade and metropolitan rural status . Changes in incidence survival and predictors of survival are reported for each cancer type . Between 1977 and 2013 bladder cancer was the most common of the studied urologic cancers . Age standardized incidence rate for bladder cancer decreased from 15.69.0 per 100 000 in 2013 0.97 p 0.05 . Between 1977 and 2013 mortality has increased in patients with bladder cancer . Testicular cancer diagnoses increased from 1.7 to 4.7 per 100 000 through 19772012 . Survival has increased . Incidence of penile cancers has increased from 0.23 to 0.46 per 100 000 Penile cancer survival has remained static .Five and ten year survival estimates were highest for testicular cancer 93.4 and 91.1 respectively and lowest for renal pelvis 36.3 and 24.6 . The incidence of non prostate non renal urologic cancers remains low and stable . The age standardized incidence of testicular cancer has increased whilst there has been a decline in the age standardized incidence of bladder cancer . Bladder cancer survival has decreased since the 1970s .

@highlight This study examines non prostate non renal urologic cancers from 1977 to 2013 in South Australia.
@highlight Incidence of testis cancer is rising.
@highlight Testis cancer had the best survival. Renal pelvis and ureter cancers have the worst survival.
@highlight Age and grade at diagnosis are consistent predictors of all cause mortality.
@highlight Bladder cancer survival has decreased since the 1970s.
