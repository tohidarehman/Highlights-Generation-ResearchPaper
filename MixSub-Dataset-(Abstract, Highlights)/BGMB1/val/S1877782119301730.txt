 Using data from the National Cancer Registry of Ukraine we analyzed recent trends in incidence rates and used these to predict the future cancer incidence burden up to 2022 . All cancer cases for the years 20032012 were retrieved from the NCRUs database and laryngeal and lung cancers . Assuming these trends will continue lung cancer will remain the most common male cancer in 2022 followed by prostate cancer colorectal cancer and cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx . In females the order of the four most common cancers will not change in 2022 compared with 2012 with cervical cancer remaining the fourth most common cancer . We predict an overall increase of 18 in the number of cancer cases in Ukraine to 179 493 cases in 2022 . The anticipated increase in the number of cancer patients in Ukraine clearly has knock on effects on a healthcare system undergoing reforms . Tobacco control appears to be the only functioning aspect of cancer prevention in the country and there is a need for a broader national cancer control plan . The continued monitoring and evaluation of implemented cancer control measures by the NCRU will help prioritize targets and allocate future resources to cancer services .

@highlight The incidence rates of the common cancers in Ukraine were increasing during 20032012.
@highlight We predict an overall 18 increase in the number of cancer cases from 2012 to 2022.
@highlight While tobacco control has been implemented there is a need for a broader cancer control plan.
