 We examine recent trends in the major cancers occurring in the Golestan province a high risk region for upper gastrointestinal cancers in Northern Iran and provide short term cancer predictions of the future cancer burden . New cancer cases diagnosed in Golestan 20042016 were obtained from the Golestan population based cancer registry database and age standardized rates by cancer site year and sex calculated per 100 000 person years . Using IARCs The number of new cancer cases in 2025 is predicted to increase by 61.3 from 2678 cases in 2016 to 4319 cases . While a 17.6 reduction in the number of esophageal cancer cases is predicted by 2025 the number of new cases for each of the remaining major cancers is predicted to increase over the next decade including cancers of the stomach colorectum lung female breast prostate and leukemia . The changes in the population structure and risk contributed 37.8 and 23.5 respectively to the overall increase in incidence . Other than for the major upper gastrointestinal cancer types the incidence rates of common cancers observed in the province are on the rise reinforcing the need for continuous surveillance as well as the design and implementation of effective cancer control programs .

@highlight Cases are predicted to rise by 61 by 2025 with 38 and 24 due to changes in population structure and risk respectively.
