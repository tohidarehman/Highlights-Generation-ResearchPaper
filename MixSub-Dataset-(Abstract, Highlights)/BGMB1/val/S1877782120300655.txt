 The parental age at conception has been reported to be a risk factor for childhood acute leukaemia however the relationship is controversial . The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between parental age at conception and the risk of AL in Mexican children a population with a high incidence of the disease and a high prevalence of pregnancies in adolescents and young adults . A multicentre case control study was conducted . Incident AL cases younger than 17 years of age diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 were included . Controls were matched with cases according to age sex and health institution . Using logistic regression analysis adjusted odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals were calculated for each maternal stratum after adjusting for paternal age at conception of index child . The maternal age between 25 and 29.99 years was selected as the reference category . In most strata where maternal and paternal ages were assessed no association was found with the risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia in their offspring . An increased risk for AML was observed when the mother was between 20 and 24.99 years of age and the father aged 2529.99 years . In addition there was a positive association for ALL when the mothers age was between 20 and 24.99 years and the father was 20 years of age however a very wide confidence interval was noted . In the present study maternal and paternal ages assessed in different strata showed little association with risk of developing ALL and AML in children . Positive associations between risk of both types of childhood AL were observed with younger paternal and maternal ages .

@highlight In most of parental ages strata no association with leukaemia risk was found.
@highlight A positive association between risk of childhood ALL was observed with younger parental ages.
@highlight A positive association between risk of childhood AML was observed with younger parental ages.
