 Socioeconomic deprivation is associated with poor prognosis in patients with solid tumors . However few studies have assessed the association between socioeconomic parameters and prognosis in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and these report conflicting results . Our monocentric study assessed the impact of socioeconomic deprivation using the validated EPICES questionnaires were given to patients receiving intensive chemotherapy for newly diagnosed AML at the Paoli Calmettes Institute between July 2012 and December 2014 . Study participants were categorized as non deprived deprived or very deprived . The primary endpoint was Overall Survival . The independence of EPICES score effects was analyzed via Cox regression with adjustment for confounding factors . 209 AML patients received the questionnaire 149 patients responded . The median EPICES score was 23.6 26.8 and 10.1 of patients were deprived and very deprived respectively . OS was 23.16 months . According to multivariate analysis a very deprived EPICES score European Leukemia Net categories age smoking and the absence of allogeneic stem cell transplantation were independent factors associated with decreased OS . Our results underscore the importance of integrating nonbiological factors in the prognostic stratification of AML patients . The very deprived population exhibited worse OS confirming that socioeconomic parameters play a role in patient outcomes in AML . Very deprived patients with AML should receive specific attention and adapted clinical management .

@highlight In intensively treated AML patients 26.8 were deprived and 10.1 very deprived according to the EPICES index.
@highlight The very deprived subgroup and patients with any history of smoking had worse overall survival OS independently of others known prognostic factors.
@highlight The most deprived patients may benefit from adjusted therapeutic management.
@highlight Effect of deprivation assessed with the EPICES index should be studied in a larger and multicenter study.
