 Central nervous system malignancy is the commonest cause of cancer death in children and adolescents in high income settings . There is limited data on survival inequalities by race ethnicity and socioeconomic position for young patients we aim to analyse their influence on survival from childhood CNS tumour . 9577 children and adolescents diagnosed with primary malignant CNS tumours during 20002015 followed up until Dec 31st 2015 and reported to cancer registries were included in the analysis . Cox regression models estimated the hazard ratios for race ethnicity SEP and individual insurance status adjusting for sex age diagnostic period and tumour type . Individual level insurance status data were available from 2007 . 62.5 children and adolescents were non Hispanic White 10.6 were non Hispanic Black and 26.9 were Hispanic . Race ethnicity was strongly associated with survival even after adjusting for SEP with Black and Hispanic children having higher hazards of death than White children . This association remained after adjusting for insurance status . There was an apparent positive association between SEP and survival that was largely attenuated after adjustment for insurance status . Survival was comparable between those privately and Medicaid insured . Non Hispanic Black and Hispanic children had lower survival than their White counterparts . This association not fully explained by differences in SEP tumour subtype or health insurance could be related to racially ethnically driven barriers to optimal healthcare warranting further investigation .

@highlight Central nervous system malignancy is the commonest cause of childhood cancer death in a high income setting.
@highlight Hispanic and non Hispanic Black children had significantly lower survival than White children even after accounting for socioeconomic position.
@highlight Children living in lower socio economic areas tended to have lower survival than those in higher socio economic areas.
@highlight However after accounting for race ethnicity and insurance status SEP was not significantly associated with death hazard.
@highlight Individual insurance status was not associated with survival.
