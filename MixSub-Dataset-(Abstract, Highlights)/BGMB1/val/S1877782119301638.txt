 Cancer recurrence is a meaningful patient outcome that is not captured in population based cancer surveillance . This project supported National Program of Cancer Registries central cancer registries in five U.S. states to determine the disease course of all breast and colorectal cancer cases . The aims were to assess the feasibility of capturing disease free status and subsequent cancer outcomes and to explore analytic approaches for future studies . Data were obtained on 11 769 breast and 6033 colorectal cancer cancers diagnosed in 2011 . Registry trained abstractors reviewed medical records from multiple sources for up to 60 months to determine documented DF status recurrence progression and residual disease . We described the occurrence of these patient centered outcomes along with analytic considerations when determining time to event outcomes and recurrence free survival . Disease free status was determined on all but 3.8 of cancer cases . Among 14 458 cases that became DF 6.1 of breast and 13.0 of colorectal cancer cases had a documented recurrence . Recurrence free survival varied by stage for stage II III cancers at 48 months 83.2 of female breast and 69.2 of colorectal cancer patients were alive without recurrence . The ability to distinguish between progression and residual disease among never disease free patients limited our ability to examine progression as an outcome . This study demonstrated that population based registries given intense support and resources can capture recurrence and offer a generalizable picture of cancer outcomes . Further work on refining definitions sampling strategies and novel approaches to capture recurrence could advance the ability of a national cancer surveillance system to contribute to patient centered outcomes research .

@highlight Standards for defining cancer recurrence do not exist and data are limited.
@highlight Disease free recurrence data collection feasible but costly and in need of data standards.
@highlight We show an approach to estimate population based cancer recurrence and recurrence free survival.
@highlight If never disease free capture of progression was elusive but less critical due to poor survival.
