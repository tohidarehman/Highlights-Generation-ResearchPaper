 Progression free survival and tumour response have been investigated as surrogate endpoints for overall survival in advanced colorectal cancer however their validity has been shown to be suboptimal . In recent years meta analytic methods allowing for use of multiple surrogate endpoints jointly have been proposed . Our aim was to assess if PFS and TR used jointly as surrogate endpoints to OS improve their predictive value . Data were obtained from a systematic review of randomised controlled trials investigating effectiveness of pharmacological therapies in aCRC including systemic chemotherapies anti epidermal growth factor receptor therapies and anti angiogenic agents . Multivariate meta analysis was used to model the association patterns between treatment effects on the surrogate endpoints and the final outcome . Analysis of 33 trials reporting treatment effects on all three outcomes showed reasonably strong association between treatment effects on PFS and OS however the association parameters were obtained with a large uncertainty . A weak surrogate relationship was noted between the treatment effects on TR and OS . Modelling the two surrogate endpoints TR and PFS jointly as predictors of treatment effect on OS gave no marked improvement to surrogate association patterns . Modest improvement in the precision of the predicted treatment effects on the final outcome was noted in studies investigating anti angiogenic therapy however it was likely due to chance . The joint use of two surrogate endpoints did not lead to marked improvement in the association between treatment effects on surrogate and final endpoints in advanced colorectal cancer .

@highlight Progression free survival is a moderate surrogate for OS in colorectal cancer.
@highlight Tumour response and PFS are modelled as joint predictors of OS.
@highlight There was no marked improvement when using two surrogate endpoints jointly.
