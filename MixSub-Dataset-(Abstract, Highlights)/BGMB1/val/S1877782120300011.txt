 Parental occupational exposures are suggested as contributing causes of childhood cancer . Children age 19 born in Denmark and diagnosed with leukemia central nervous system cancers and likely prenatally initiated cancers neuroblastoma retinoblastoma and acute lymphoid leukemia n 4268 were identified using Danish registries . We randomly selected twenty five controls per case matched on birth year and sex . Parents and their employment histories were extracted from nationwide registries . We examined occupational dust exposures perinatally and postnatally in both parents . Odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals were estimated using conditional logistic regression . Maternal wood dust exposure from birth to diagnosis was associated with increased risks of leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia exposure to paper dust was associated with CNS cancer .. Paternal exposure to wood dust was associated with astrocytoma in both periods and CNS cancer in the perinatal period . The increased risk observed for potentially prenatally initiated cancers in relation to wood was driven by ORs for neuroblastoma and hepatoblastoma . An OR of 2.58 for CNS cancer was associated with both parents working in textile industries postnatally . The study suggests that parental exposure to wood dust may increase risk of specific childhood cancers .
