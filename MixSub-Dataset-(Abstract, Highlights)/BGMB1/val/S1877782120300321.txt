 Rural dwellers have poorer cancer outcomes than urban counterparts for reasons which are unclear . At healthcare institution level poorer access to investigations and different clinical decision making by rural primary healthcare practitioners could be important . To compare access to investigations attitudes to cancer diagnosis and clinical decision making between rural and urban PCPs . A vignette based cross sectional survey of rural and urban PCPs in 20 European countries . Data on PCPs decision making and attitudes to cancer diagnosis were based on clinical scenarios . Comparisons were made using tests of proportion univariable and multivariable binary logistic regression . Of the 1779 PCPs completing the survey 541 30.4 practiced rurally . Rural PCPs had significantly less direct access to all investigative modalities ultrasound endoscopy x ray and advanced screening . Rural PCPs were as likely as urban PCPs to take diagnostic action at the index consultation in all four clinical vignettes for lung 0.90 0.721.12 ovarian 0.95 0.751.19 breast 0.87 0.691.09 colorectal 0.98 0.751.30 . Rural PCPs were less likely to refer to a specialist at the index consultation for ovarian cancer . Rural PCPs were significantly more likely to report that their patients faced barriers to accessing specialist care but practitioners did not report greater difficulties making specialist referral than their urban counterparts European rural PCPs report poorer access to investigations but are at least as likely as urban PCPs to investigate or refer patients that might have cancer at the index consultation .

@highlight Rural cancer patients have poorer cancer outcomes than urban counterparts.
@highlight The study reports data from 1779 primary care practitioners from across Europe.
@highlight European rural primary care practitioners have less direct access to cancer investigations.
@highlight But European rural practitioners take diagnostic action for potential cancer just as promptly.
@highlight Service organization is a more likely cause of rural cancer inequality than practitioner behaviour.
