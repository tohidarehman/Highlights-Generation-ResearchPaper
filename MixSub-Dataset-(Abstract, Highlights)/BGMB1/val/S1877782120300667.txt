 Excess brain cancers observed after computed tomography scans could be caused by ionizing radiation . However as scans are often used to investigate symptoms of brain cancer excess cancers could also be due to reverse causation bias . We used finite mixture models to differentiate CT exposures that are plausibly causal from those due to reverse causation . Persons with at least one CT scan exposure and a subsequent diagnosis of brain cancer were selected from a cohort of 11 million young Australians . We fitted FMMs and used the posterior probability to inform the choice of exclusion periods . We validated our findings using a separate clinical dataset describing the time between first symptoms and brain cancer diagnosis . The cohort included 1028 persons with a diagnosed brain tumor and exposed to a total of 1 450 CT scans . The best fitting model was a generalized linear mixture model using the exponential distribution with three latent classes and two covariates . The 99th percentile classifier cutoff was 18.9 months . The sample size weighted mean of the 99th percentile of the PSI derived from clinical data was 15.6 months . To minimize reverse causation bias in studies of CT scan and brain cancer the optimal exclusion period is one to two years . This information will inform the interpretation of current and future studies .

@highlight Finite mixture models can be used to identify CT scans used for the diagnostic workup of brain cancer.
@highlight 99 of brain scans classified to reverse causation occurred less than 18.9 months before cancer diagnosis.
@highlight The sample size weighted means of the 99th percentile of the prediagnostic symptomatic interval was 15.6 months.
@highlight The optimal exclusion or lag period to apply to CT scan radiation cohorts for the minimization of reverse causation bias is one to two years.
