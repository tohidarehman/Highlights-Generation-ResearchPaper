 The association of population mixing using surrogates of genetic and environmental PM . ALL incidence data were obtained from Texas Cancer Registry and county population statistics from the US Census Bureau . Poisson regression was used to compare ALL incidence and PM . There is substantial and variable genetic and environmental PM among counties in Texas . Indicators of genetic PM including proportion of multiracial households ratio of Hispanics to non Hispanics and ratio of foreign to native born residents were all significantly associated with a higher incidence of ALL IRR These findings are consistent with prior patterns and magnitudes of PM association with ALL . Our findings suggest that the implicated mechanism of leukemogenesis in PM may be genetically transmitted rather than environmental .
