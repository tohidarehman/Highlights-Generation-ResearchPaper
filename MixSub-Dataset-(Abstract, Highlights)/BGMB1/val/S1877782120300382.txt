 The incidence of early onset colorectal cancer has been reported to increase and patients with eoCRC seem to be diagnosed at more advanced stages compared to elderly patients . The aim of this study was to describe patient and disease characteristics symptomatology and the incidence of eoCRC in a national cohort . 521 eoCRC patients diagnosed with histologically verified colorectal cancer during the years 20012013 were identified in national databases and compared to more than 15 000 CRC patients aged 6675 years . Age adjusted incidence was calculated for eoCRC patients and various sub analyses were performed . More advanced stages were seen in eoCRC patients compared to elderly patients . Differences were statistically significant in colon cancer but not in rectal cancer . A significant difference in sex distribution was seen between right and left sided tumors in the eoCRC group . The age adjusted incidence rate increased during the study period and significant annual percent changes were seen in young females and left sided tumor localization respectively . In this nationwide cohort of eoCRC patients our results confirm that young patients are diagnosed at advanced stages and that the incidence of eoCRC is increasing .

@highlight This study was an attempt to contribute data from a complete national cohort of patients with early onset colorectal cancer eoCRC .
@highlight Our data confirms that eoCRC patients present with more advanced stages compared to elderly CRC patients.
@highlight The incidence of eoCRC was rising in the study period especially in young females and patients with left sided colon and rectal cancers.
@highlight Results from this study can be used as inspiration to further research in this topic.
