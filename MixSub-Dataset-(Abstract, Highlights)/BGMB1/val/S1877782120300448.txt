 We investigated the influence preexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus and antidiabetic drugs have on all cause and cause specific mortality among Medicaid insured women diagnosed with breast cancer . 9221 women aged 64 years diagnosed with breast cancer and reported to the New York State Cancer Registry from 2004 to 2016 were linked with Medicaid claims . Preexisting T2DM was determined by three diagnosis claims for T2DM with at least one claim prior to breast cancer diagnosis and a prescription claim for an antidiabetic drug within three months following breast cancer diagnosis . Estimated menopausal status was determined by age . Hazard ratios and 95 confidence intervals were calculated with Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for confounders . Women with preexisting T2DM had greater all cause cancer specific and cardiovascular specific mortality hazard compared to nondiabetic women . In subgroup analyses the association between T2DM and all cause mortality was found among non Hispanic White and postmenopausal women but not among other race ethnicity groups or premenopausal women . Additionally compared to women prescribed metformin all cause mortality hazard was elevated among women prescribed sulfonylurea or insulin . Among Medicaid insured women with breast cancer those with preexisting T2DM have an increased mortality hazard especially when prescribed sulfonylurea or insulin . Further research is warranted to determine the role antidiabetic drugs have on survival among women with breast cancer .

@highlight Among women with breast cancer those with type 2 diabetes had higher mortality hazard than nondiabetics.
@highlight Women prescribed sulfonylurea or insulin had an elevated mortality hazard compared to women prescribed metformin.
@highlight Among women 50 years of age and older with breast cancer those with type 2 diabetes had a 47 higher mortality hazard.
