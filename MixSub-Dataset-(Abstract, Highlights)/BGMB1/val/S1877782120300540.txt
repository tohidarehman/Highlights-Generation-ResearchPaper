 A recent meta analysis of global research found cancer patients living in rural locations are 5 less likely to survive than their urban counterparts a survival disadvantage that has never been satisfactorily explained . To describe and compare primary care involvement in the diagnosis of cancer between rural and urban patients in Scotland . To compare the length of key diagnostic pathway intervals between rural and urban cancer patients in Scotland . Participating GPs in the Scottish National Cancer Audit of cancer diagnosis collected data from primary care medical records on the diagnostic pathway of patients diagnosed in 2014 . Residential postcodes designated the patients as rural or urban dwellers . Key cancer diagnostic pathway intervals were compared using binary logistic regression . Descriptive analysis included comparison of patient characteristics and routes to diagnosis . 73 Scottish general practices provided data on 1 905 cancer diagnoses . Rural patients did not have higher odds of prolonged diagnostic intervals compared to urban patients but were significantly more likely to have had a cancer alarm feature at presentation and three or more primary care consultations prior to referral . Rural GPs were significantly more likely to perceive an avoidable delay in their patients diagnostic pathway . There was no evidence that rural patients were more likely to be subject to prolonged cancer diagnostic delays than urban patients . Rural patients may experience primary care differently in the lead up to a cancer diagnosis . The effect on outcome is probably negligible but further research is required to confirm this .

@highlight Rural patients had more cancer alarm features at first presentation.
@highlight Rural patients had more pre referral consultations and blood tests.
@highlight Rural GPs were more likely to perceive they caused avoidable delays for patients.
@highlight Prolonged diagnostic pathway delays were not more likely four rural patients.
@highlight In Scotland rurality does not appear to delay cancer diagnosis or treatment.
