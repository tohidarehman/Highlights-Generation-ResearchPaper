 Lack of participation in cervical cancer screening in underserved populations has been attributed to access to care particularly among women in rural areas . Federally Qualified Health Centers were created to address this need in medically underserved populations . This study observed proximity to three health centers in relation to cervical cancer screening rates in South Carolina . Data were obtained from FQHC patient visits between 20072010 and were limited to women eligible for cervical cancer screening . ArcGIS was used to geocode patients addresses and FQHC locations and distance was calculated . Modified Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risk of obtaining cervical cancer screening within one yearor ever stratified by residential area . Findings differed markedly by center and urban rural status . Increased travel distance significantly increased the likelihood of cervical cancer screening at two FQHC sites while significantly decreasing the likelihood of screening at the 3rd site .

@highlight Low cervical cancer screening may be attributed to lack of access among women in rural areas in South Carolina.
@highlight Distance had a mixed impact on cervical cancer screening for patients in the three health centers.
@highlight Center specific environmental and contextual factors may have had an impact on the association between travel distance and screening rates.
