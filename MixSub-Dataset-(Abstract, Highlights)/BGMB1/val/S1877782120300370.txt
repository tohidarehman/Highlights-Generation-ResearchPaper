 Sub optimal use or interpretation of imaging investigations prior to diagnosis of certain cancers may be associated with less timely diagnosis but pre diagnostic imaging activity for urological cancer is unknown . We analysed linked data derived from primary and secondary care records and cancer registration to evaluate the use of clinically relevant imaging tests pre diagnosis in patients with bladder and kidney cancer diagnosed in 2012 15 in England . As pre diagnostic imaging activity increased from background rate 8 months pre diagnosis we used logistic regression to determine factors associated with first imaging test occurring 48 months pre diagnosis considering that such instances may reflect possible missed opportunities for expediting the diagnosis . 1963 patients with bladder or kidney cancer had at least one imaging test in the 8 months pre diagnosis . 420 of patients had their first imaging test 48 months pre diagnosis that being ultrasound CT and X ray in 48 43 and 9 of those cases respectively . Factors associated with greater risk of a first imaging test 48 months pre diagnosis were kidney cancer diagnosis at stages other than stage IV first imaging having been an X ray test requested by GP and absence of haematuria before the imaging request . About 1 in 5 patients with urological cancers receive relevant first imaging investigations 48 months prior to diagnosis which may represent potential missed diagnostic opportunities for earlier diagnosis .

@highlight Suboptimal imaging test use may represent missed opportunities for more timely diagnosis of bladder and kidney cancer.
@highlight Our novel linked dataset described patterns of imaging test use and predictors of a first imaging test use in patients with these cancers.
@highlight 1 in 5 patients received a longer than average time to diagnosis of 48 months after a first imaging test.
@highlight Patients with less specific symptoms and with kidney cancer were more likely to receive a first imaging test 48 months before diagnosis.
