 Anal squamous cell carcinoma is relatively rare but its incidence and mortality have been steadily climbing in marginalized populations . We explored the impact of insurance status education and income on survival and receipt of chemoradiation therapy . We included patients with ASCC from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program database from 2004 to 2016 . Socioeconomic variables included insurance status level of education income and unemployment rate . Cox proportional hazards and multivariate logistic regression were used to determine predictors of survival and receipt of chemoradiation . We included a total of 10 868 cases of ASCC . The median age was 55 10.4 were black and 65.4 were female . Overall 74.1 of patients received combination chemoradiation . In multivariate analysis poorer survival was found for Medicaid and uninsured patients and for communities with the lowest rates of high school education lowest income and highest unemployment . Patients were less likely to receive combination treatment if they were black had Medicaid insurance or lower education . Insurance status level of education income and employment impact survival and receipt of treatment in patients with ASCC . Identifying high risk patients and developing targeted interventions to improve access to treatment is integral to reducing these disparities and improving cancer survival .

@highlight Anal cancer is treatable but mortality of marginalized populations is increasing.
@highlight Survival was poorer in patients with Medicaid no insurance and lower education.
@highlight Patients with Medicaid and lower education received treatment less frequently.
@highlight Policies that improve access to treatment for these patients can improve survival.
