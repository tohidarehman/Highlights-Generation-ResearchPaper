 On average 185 children are diagnosed each year in France with a cancer in their first year of life representing 11 of cancers diagnosed in children less than 15 years . A retrospective population based observational study was conducted between 2000 and 2014 of all infants with a diagnosis of cancer using the National Registry of Childhood Cancers Database . Out of 2760 cases of primary cancers in infancy there were mainly neuroblastomas 30.1 central nervous system tumors leukemias retinoblastomas and Wilms tumors . Embryonal malignancies accounted for 55.2 of cases . Most diagnoses showed a male excess particularly for malignant gonadal germ cell tumors with a 17.5 sex ratio . The annual incidence rate 242.9 per million infants overall was stable over the study period for all types of cancer . Most deaths occurred within the first month of life . The 5 year overall survival was 81.0 with large contrasts between diagnoses . The best 5 y OS were observed for retinoblastomas carcinomas nephroblastomas GCT neuroblastomas and hepatoblastomas . Conversely the lowest 5 y OS were observed for acute myeloid leukemias CNS tumors and lymphoid leukemias . We observed no substantial change over time in 20002004 and 82.6 in 20102014 for all cancers combined . The same result has been found whatever the diagnostic group . Our results contribute to better understand these tumors by quantifying their impact on the French population and assessing the burden of some devastating infant cancers .
