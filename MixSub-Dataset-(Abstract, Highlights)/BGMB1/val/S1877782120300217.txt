 We aimed to present the time trends and geographical distribution of lung cancer in Golestan province a high risk area for pulmonary tuberculosis in Northern Iran . Data on incident primary lung cancers were obtained from the Golestan population based cancer registry . The data were analyzed by CanReg 5 software to calculate the age standardized incidence rates . We used Joinpoint software for time trend analysis . Average annual percent changes were calculated . The contribution of population aging population growth and risk to the overall changes in incidence of lung cancer were determined using partitioning analysis . Overall 1829 cases of lung cancer were registered by the GPCR during 2004 2016 of which 1274 were men and 555 were women . The results of Joinpoint regression suggested a significant increasing trend in incidence of lung cancer in Golestan province during 2004 and 2016 with more prominent increasing in rural population . The number of new cases of lung cancer increased by 131.6 of which 34.1 22.3 and 75.3 were due to population size population aging and risk respectively . Hot points of lung cancer were found in western parts of the Golestan . With high incidence rates and increasing trends of lung cancer further studies are warranted to clarify the role of TB and other risk factors on its burden in this population .

@highlight Golestan province Iran is a high risk area for esophageal cancer and tuberculosis TB .
@highlight We presented trends and distribution of lung cancer LC in Golestan during 2004 2016.
@highlight We found high rates and significant increasing trends in incidence of LC in Golestan.
@highlight The trends were more prominent in rural area and hot points were found in western part.
@highlight Further studies are needed to clarify the role of TB and other risk factors on LC burden.
