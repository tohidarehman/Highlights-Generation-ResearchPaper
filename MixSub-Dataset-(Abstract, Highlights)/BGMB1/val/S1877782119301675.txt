 Androgen deprivation therapy remains the mainstay treatment for locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer . However potential effects of ADT treatment on neurocognitive dysfunction remain unclear . The present study was conducted to assess the relation between ADT treatment and risk of cognitive decline in Asian men with PC . A population based cohort of 24 464 men with PC each newly diagnosed between 2000 and 2008 was selected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database . Subjects were further grouped by treatment as non ADT or ADT members of the latter subjected to bilateral orchiectomy or medical treatment . A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model with ADT as time dependent covariate was used to generate adjusted hazard ratios of subsequent cognitive decline including dementia Alzheimer s disease and Parkinsons disease . ADT showed a significant association with overall risk of cognitive decline especially for PD dementia and non Alzheimer dementia . When stratified by various ADT regimens antiandrogen only recipients displayed significantly heightened risks of subsequent AD non AZD and PD . However combined androgen blockade also imposed an increased risk of PD . There was no apparent correlation between duration of ADT exposure and cognitive dysfunction . Various ADT therapies may have disparate impacts on cognitive function . Prospective studies exploring pertinent clinical characteristics more fully are needed to confirm these findings .

@highlight There was a significant association between ADT and the risks of cognitive decline.
@highlight ADT users receiving anti androgen alone significantly increased with subsequent risks of AD non AZD and PD.
@highlight An increased risk of PD was also observed in combined androgen blockade group.
