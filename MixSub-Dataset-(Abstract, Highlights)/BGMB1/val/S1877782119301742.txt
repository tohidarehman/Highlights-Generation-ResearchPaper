 While radiotherapy is a major risk factor for thyroid cancer after childhood cancer factors contributing to increased thyroid cancer risk after adulthood cancer remain unclear . We evaluated second primary papillary thyroid cancer risk among 3 175 2161 year adult survivors of non thyroid malignancies from US population based cancer registries using standardized incidence ratios . Because heightened surveillance may increase detection of indolent thyroid tumors and earlier detection of advanced tumors we examined SIRs by PTC stage and time since first cancer . SIRs for second primary PTC were statistically significantly 1.23.5 fold elevated overall and after 23 27 first cancer types evaluated with generally similar risks for localized and regional distant PTC . SIRs for regional distant PTC were highest after pancreatic 1.96.5 and soft tissue cancers followed by melanoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma diffuse large B cell lymphoma and larynx kidney and brain central nervous system cancers . SIRs typically decreased with increasing latency but remained statistically significantly elevated for regional distant PTC 5 years after diagnosis of cancers of the rectum pancreas lung bronchus soft tissue female breast uterine corpus prostate and kidney and after melanoma Hodgkin lymphoma CLL SLL and follicular lymphoma . Neither total nor regional distant PTC were clearly associated with initial course of radiotherapy or chemotherapy . PTC risk was elevated after a range of first primary adult cancers but was not clearly related to treatment . Although surveillance may contribute to elevated short term risks of PTC longer term elevations in regional distant PTC may be attributable to shared risk factors .

@highlight Risks for second primary papillary thyroid cancer PTC were elevated after a broad range of first primary cancer types.
@highlight Second primary PTC risk generally decreased with latency but remained statistically significantly elevated following a number of first primary types.
@highlight Risks were generally similar for localized and regional distant second primary PTC.
