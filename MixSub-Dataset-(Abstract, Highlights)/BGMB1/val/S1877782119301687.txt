 To evaluate whether anti diabetic medications are related to colorectal cancer risk in type 2 diabetes patients . The study was performed from a population based prospective cohort provided by the National Health Insurance Corporation . Among the 2 084 602 patients newly diagnosed as type 2 diabetes in this period the cases had incident CRC identified at least 3 years after the diagnosis and the controls were matched to each case by age sex body mass index fasting plasma glucose level and year of the diagnosis . Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio and its 95 confidence intervals for CRC by anti diabetic medications . A total of 4 228 cases were identified and 4 228 controls were matched to the cases . Sulfonylurea use increased the risk for CRC 1.14 showing an increasing trend with increasing cumulative doses Our results suggest that sulfonylureas except for gliclazide increase the CRC risk in type 2 diabetic patients . Long term follow up studies are necessary to clarify the association of newer anti diabetic medications with the CRC incidence .

@highlight Most of the anti diabetic medications may have neutral effect on the colorectal cancer incidence among the patients with type 2 diabetes.
@highlight However sulfonylurea drugs except for gliclazide increase the risk for colorectal cancer in these patients.
@highlight It is inconclusive whether thiazolidinedione and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors can modify the risk for colorectal cancer.
@highlight Long term follow up studies are necessary to clarify the effect of newer anti diabetic drugs on colorectal cancer risk.
