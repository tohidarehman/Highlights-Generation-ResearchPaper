 Delivering health care timely and geographically accessible are determining factors for the prognosis of children with cancer . This study analyzed geographic access and timeliness to diagnostic services in Colombia . In this Colombian national childhood cancer database based study patients and their diagnostic facilities were individually and separately space positioned . Distances between the household to the diagnostic facility and between the clinical date of suspicion and diagnosis were determined . 27 of the sample of 731 patients had access to diagnostic centres in less than 30min . The travel distance to diagnostic centres was lowest in the Caribe and Andina Regions . However in Amazona and Orinoqua Regions 87 and 81 had to travel more than 90 km representing very long travel times . For more than 23 of patients time to diagnosis was more than 90 days in Orinoqua this was above 90 days for 1 3 of patients . Despite relatively short travel distances in the Caribe Region for 61 time to diagnosis exceeded 30 days . This study identified clear shortcomings in the Colombian Health System related to the quality of childhood cancer related health care in terms of timeliness cancer networks and geographic access . These inequities not only depend on sociodemographic characteristics and should be intervened upon .

@highlight Less than 50 of Colombian childhood cancer cases were diagnosed within 30 days.
@highlight Travel distances are long many childhood cancer cases travel from other departments.
@highlight Despite universal health insurance diagnostic and treatment opportunities show disparities.
@highlight Cancer care networks are as vital as communication between providers and insurers.
