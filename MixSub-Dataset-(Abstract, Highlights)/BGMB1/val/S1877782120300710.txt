 Biological differences between the sexes have a major impact on disease and treatment outcome . In this paper we evaluate the prognostic value of sex in stage IV non small cell lung cancer in the context of routine clinical data and compare this information with other external datasets . Clinical data from stage IV NSCLC patients from Hospital Puerta de Hierro were retrieved from electronic health records using big data analytics . In addition data from the Spanish Lung Cancer Group Tumor Registry and from a published study available from the cBioPortal were analyzed . Survival curves were estimated using the KaplanMeier method . A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the prognostic value of sex . A meta analysis to compare the outcome for males and females in terms of overall survival and progression free survival was performed . The median OS time was 12 months for males and 19 months for females . Similarly females with stage IV NSCLC harboring an Using routine clinical data we confirmed the previous finding that among stage IV NSCLC patients females had a significantly better prognosis than males . The effect size of the sex was notable highlighting the fact that survival rates are usually estimated and patients are generally managed without considering the sexes separately which may lead to suboptimal results .

@highlight Sex is a major factor in disease but it is seldom taken into account for survival estimations.
@highlight Using RWD we confirm that NSCLC females had a significantly better prognosis than NSCLC males.
@highlight The effect size of sex on survival is high supporting sex based medicine as a new paradigm in medical practice.
