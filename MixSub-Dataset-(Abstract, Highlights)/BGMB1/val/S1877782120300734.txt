 Cancer is the single leading cause of human deaths worldwide . The highest incidence and mortality are recorded from Africa . The last two decades have witnessed extensive research which has led to emerging prognosis and new gene therapy technologies . Cancer therapy in Africa is derived with little input from African population data . While a number of cancer studies on African populations have suggested varied susceptible variant no comprehensive review of these studies has been undertaken to assess their coverage across Africa . This study aimed to undertake a review of all molecular genetic studies that interrogated the genetic variants of cancers in African based populations . Our search methodology was modelled after the Cochrane systematic review protocol which included MeSH terms and related keywords . Ninety seven articles studying 13 cancer types were reviewed . 91 articles screened for polymorphisms using PCR based techniques while three used SNP array two used whole exome sequencing and one used pyrosequencing . North African countries undertook 51 97 studies on 12 13 cancer types while the Sub Saharan Africa countries undertook 46 97 studies on 7 13 cancer types . Twelve out of these thirteen cancer type studies suggested susceptibility to their target polymorphism . No study replicated or validated variants detected . Research on genetic determinants in African based population cancer offers translational benefits . We recommended large scale multi national genome association studies using high throughput techniques . SSA needs to receive more attention due to the shortage of this type of study and data in the region .

@highlight Cancer is the single leading cause of human deaths worldwide.
@highlight African population exhibit a higher genetic diversity than other ethnic groups.
@highlight No comprehensive review on African based cancer has been undertaken.
@highlight Risk variants of African based cancers derived from limited African based studies will not depict causal variant.
@highlight Large scale studies with high throughput techniques are required to characterise candidate genes for African based cancers.
