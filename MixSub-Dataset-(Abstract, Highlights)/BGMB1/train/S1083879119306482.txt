 Post transplantation cyclophosphamide reduces the risks of severe acute and chronic graft versus host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation . Yet the standard clinical dose and timing of PTCy were partly extrapolated from MHC matched skin allografting models and were partly empirical . Here we investigated the impact of differential dosing and timing of PTCy on its efficacy in preventing GVHD in a murine MHC haploidentical HCT model . Administration of PTCy on days 3 4 was superior to administration on days 1 2 5 6 or 7 8 whereas low dose PTCy on days 1 2 actually led to accelerated death . Although the optimal timing of PTCy dosing was day 2 or 3 in the skin allografting models in our MHC haploidentical HCT model PTCy on days 2 3 was inferior to PTCy on days 3 4 at lower doses . PTCy administered on days 3 4 4 5 or 3 5 were similarly efficacious . Single day versus 2 day dosing schedules demonstrated that PTCy is maximally effective when given on day 4 . Flow cytometric analysis showed that optimal PTCy dosing schedules both decreased alloreactive CD4

@highlight The dose timing and cumulative exposure of post transplantation cyclophosphamide all are critical for its efficacy.
@highlight The maximal efficacy of post transplantation cyclophosphamide peaks at day 4.
