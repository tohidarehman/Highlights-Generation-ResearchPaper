 Basiliximab has been used successfully as a second line treatment for steroid refractory acute graft versus host disease in adult patients after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant but has not been studied separately in the pediatric setting . We retrospectively reviewed 100 pediatric patients after haplo HSCT receiving basiliximab for grades II III and IV SR aGVHD between January 2015 and December 2017 . The median number of basiliximab doses was 4 . The day 28 overall response rate was 85 with complete response in 74 of patients partial response in 11 of patients and no response in 15 of patients . The day 28 overall response rates were 94.6 in skin SR aGVHD 81.6 in gut SR aGVHD and 66.7 in liver SR aGVHD . Infectious complications included bacterial infection presumed or documented fungal infections cytomegalovirus viremia Epstein Barr virus viremia human herpesvirus 6 viremia and herpes simplex virus viremia . The 3 year overall survival disease free survival nonrelapse mortality and relapse rates between responders and nonresponders were 81.3 versus 46.7

@highlight This study represents the first report on the outcomes of basiliximab as a treatment for steroid refractory SR acute graft versus host disease aGVHD in pediatric patients after allo HSCT.
@highlight The overall response rate of basiliximab was 85 including complete response in 74 and partial response in 11 .
@highlight No life ending complications could be attributed solely to basiliximab.
