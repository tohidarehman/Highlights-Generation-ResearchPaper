 WRKY genes comprises one among a large clan of transcription factor genes in the plant kingdom playing a fundamental role in the vegetative and reproductive growth development and stress responses of a plant . In spite of several studies on cucumber

@highlight Total of 62 putative WRKY genes were identified in cucumber genome and classified in to three major groups Group I IIa IIe and III .
@highlight Physicochemical properties variants of WD in identified WRKY proteins were analyzed and based on chemical nature WRKY genes are serine rich proteins.
@highlight STRING analysis were performed for selected CsWRKY for their protein protein interactions.
@highlight elements of
@highlight genes were analyzed for their expression patterns under different growth development and other environmental conditions.
