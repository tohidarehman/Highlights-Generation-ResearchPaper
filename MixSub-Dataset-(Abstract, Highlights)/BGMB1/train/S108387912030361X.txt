 An increased risk of infections has been described after T cell replete haploidentical cell transplantation . Cytokine release syndrome after haploHCT is a known phenomenon but the impact of CRS severity on the risk of infections remains unexplored . We retrospectively evaluated 78 consecutive adult haploHCT recipients from 2012 to 2018 for the development of CRS and examined the incidence and mortality due to infections in correlation with CRS severity . In our study cohort which was stratified into 3 groups by severity of CRS 80 of the patients developed infections within 180 days of HCT . Significantly higher proportions of patients with CRS grade 2 and grade 3 than patients with CRS grade 0 1 had at least 1 infection in the first 100 days

@highlight The severity of cytokine release syndrome CRS developing after T cell replete haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation is associated with an increased risk of bacterial and viral infections.
@highlight Severe CRS significantly and independently increases the risk of viral infections but mediates the risk of bacterial infections through an effect on neutrophil recovery.
@highlight CRS grade is also a significant predictor for infection density overall bacterial and viral after adjusting for other predictors including time to neutrophil engraftment.
