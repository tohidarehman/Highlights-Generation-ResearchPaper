 Greener process synthesis for drug production focuses on the replacement of chemical processes with biological processes . However optimization of these processes remains challenging due to lack of experimental data particularly for long term passaging and suitable parameter estimation techniques . In this context we propose a mixed passaging scheme containing the co culture of
