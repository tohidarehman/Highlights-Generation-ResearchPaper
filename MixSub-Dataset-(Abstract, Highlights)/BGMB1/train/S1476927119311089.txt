 As the mechanism of interaction between nicotinic receptors with nicotine analogs is not yet fully understood information at molecular level obtained from computational calculations is needed . In this sense this work is a computational study of eight nicotine analogs all with pyrrolidine ring modifications over a nicotine based backbone optimized with B3LYP D3 aug cc pVDZ . A molecular characterization was performed focusing on geometrical parameters such as pseudo rotation angles atomic charges HOMO and LUMO orbitals reactivity indexes and intermolecular interactions . Three analogs A2 pyridine A3 pyridine and A8 4 5 dihydroisoxazole were filtered suggesting putative neuroprotective activity taking into account different reactivity values such as their lowest hardness 2.37eV 2.43eV and 2.56eV compared to the highest hardness value found 2.71eV for A5 4 1 methylpyrrolidine 2 il pyridine similar to the value of nicotine . Additionally molecular docking of all 8 nicotine analogs with the

@highlight Geometrical and structural characterization of a new set of eight nicotine analogs is provided.
@highlight Geometrical conformational analysis over nicotine analogs proved to be a mandatory method for new neuroprotective drug discovery.
@highlight Two nicotine analogs A3 and A8 are proposed as potential PD neuroprotective agents.
