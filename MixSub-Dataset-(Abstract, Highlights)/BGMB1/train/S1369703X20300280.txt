 As foodborne pathogen contamination has become a threat to human health worldwide early detection of pathogen is significant . Traditional electrochemical immunosensors for pathogen detection involve electrode modification or samples adsorption on the electrode which affect the detection sensitivity and electrode reproducibility thereby limiting their further application in POCT . We established a homogeneous magnetic bead based electrochemical impedance system using interdigitated gold electrodes as sensing elements for high sensitivity detection of
