 The present study is focused on a series of newly synthesized 1 aryl 3 ethyl 3 methylsuccinimide derivatives as potential anticonvulsants . The retention behavior of eleven succinimide derivatives was determined by using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography and reversed phase high performance thin layer chromatography . The estimated retention behavior was correlated with partition log

@highlight A set of newly synthesized succinimides was analyzed by RP HPLC and RP HPTLC.
@highlight Chromatographic lipophilicity ChL of the studied derivatives was determined.
@highlight Correlations between their ChL and pharmacokinetic parameters were defined.
@highlight Their ability to pass the blood brain barrier and other ADMET features were estimated.
@highlight Some of the analyzed succinimide derivatives have high potential to become anticonvulsant candidates.
