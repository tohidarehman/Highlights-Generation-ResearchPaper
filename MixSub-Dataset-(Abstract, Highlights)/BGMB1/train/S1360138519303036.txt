 There is growing interest in the application of alternative stable state theory to explain major vegetation patterns of the world . Here we introduce the theory as applied to the puzzle of nonforested biomes growing in climates that are warm and wet enough to support forests . Long thought to be the product of deforestation diverse lines of evidence indicate that many open ecosystems are ancient . They have also been characterized as early successional even where they persist for millennia . ABS is an alternative framework to that of climate determinism and succession for exploring forest nonforest mosaics . This framework explains not only tropical forestsavanna landscapes but also other landscape mosaics across the globe .

@highlight There are many ancient open vegetation formations worldwide that maintain a high diversity of shade intolerant species where the climate is suitable for forests.
@highlight Fire and herbivores are ancient consumers of plant biomass that maintain open ecosystems and shape shade intolerant species.
@highlight Therefore open ecosystems are not necessarily either produced by deforestation or early successional but have been maintained by consumers as ABSs to forests.
@highlight ABSs are not only found in tropical environments but also in temperate and Mediterranean conditions.
