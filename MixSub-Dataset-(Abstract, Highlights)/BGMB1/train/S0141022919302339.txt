 has been engineered to produce xylitol but the production faces bottlenecks in terms of production yield and cell viability . In this study recombinant

@highlight The best support for cell immobilization is untreated MWCNT.
@highlight The best cultural conditions using One Factor at One Time OFAT approach were SOB medium 30C pH 7 0.005mM IPTG
@highlight The immobilized cells reduced cell lysis by up to 73 and improved plasmid stability up to 17 compared to the free cells.
@highlight Optimization of xylitol production by immobilized cells was 21 higher than free cells.
@highlight The maximum xylitol production 7.36g L by immobilized cells was achieved during the third cycle.
