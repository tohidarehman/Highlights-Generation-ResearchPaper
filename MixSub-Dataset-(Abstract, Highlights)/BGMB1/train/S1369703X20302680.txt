 The extraction of energy from wastewater organic matter by microbial electrolysis cells is a promising idea . However different challenges have to be overcome before this technology can be used in a practical application . One of the most important is the development of reactor configurations that can be able to produce higher external current and thereby a larger amount of energy carriers without significant deterioration of cell performance . Thus a comprehensive 3D model developed in this work aims to investigate distributions of current potential and concentrations inside a MEC reactor and their effect on overpotential distribution over the surface of electrodes to evaluate the reactor performance . The model is applied to simulate a flow reactor designed with 147.6m
