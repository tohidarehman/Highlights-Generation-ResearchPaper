 Delayed reconstitution of the immune system is a long recognized complication after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation . Specifically loss of T cell diversity has been thought to contribute to infectious complications graft versus host disease and disease relapse . We performed serial high resolution next generation sequencing of T cell receptor in 99 related or unrelated donor allogeneic HCT recipients during the first 3 months after HCT using the immunoSEQ Assay . We measured T cell fraction clonality and Daley Smith richness from recipient samples at multiple time points . In agreement with previous studies we found that although absolute T cell numbers recover relatively quickly after HCT T cell repertoire diversity remains diminished . Restricted diversity was associated with conditioning intensity use of antithymocyte globulin and donor type . Increased number of expanded clones compared to donor T cell clones at day 30 was associated with the incidence of acute GVHD 1.11

@highlight After allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation T cell repertoire diversity lags behind quantitative T cell recovery.
@highlight An increase in the number of expanded clones at day 30 is associated with an increased risk of acute graft versus host disease.
@highlight The use of antithymocyte globulin results in prolonged T cell anomalies including increased clonality 1 Peilou s evenness and decreased Daley Smith richness despite a nearly equivalent T cell fraction.
