 Acute graft versus host disease is a major complication following hematopoietic cell transplantations . We have shown that HCT recipients in whom either the donor or patient had inherited chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus 6 have a higher incidence of developing more severe aGVHD . Previous studies established that increased proinflammatory cytokines are associated with increased risk for aGVHD and nonrelapse mortality post HCT . We hypothesized that HCT recipients with donor or recipient iciHHV 6 iciHHV 6

@highlight Hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT recipients in whom the donor or recipient had inherited chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus 6 iciHHV 6
@highlight  have higher plasma C reactive protein and TNFRp55 cytokine concentrations.
@highlight IciHHV 6
@highlight HCT recipients had earlier onset graft versus host disease by a median of 7 days.
@highlight There were no differences in cytokine levels among healthy donors with or without iciHHV 6.
