 To increase the efficiency of enzyme cocktails in deconstructing cellulose and hemicelluloses present in the plant cell wall a combination of enzymes with complementary activities is required . Xylan is the main hemicellulose component of energy crops and for its complete hydrolysis a system consisting of several enzymes acting cooperatively including endoxylanases xylosidases and

@highlight Optimizing the enzyme cocktail reduces the enzyme loading for optimal hydrolysis efficiency.
@highlight Increased enzyme loadings do not necessarily increase hydrolysis efficiency.
@highlight Scanning electron microscopy showed morphological changes in bagasse after hydrolysis.
@highlight The sequential addition of hemicellulases before cellulases improved hydrolysis efficiency.
