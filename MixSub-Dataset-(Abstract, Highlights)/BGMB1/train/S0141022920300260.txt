 Phytate is the major storage form of phosphorus in plants . It is present in cereals and raw materials of vegetable origin used in animal and human diets . However non ruminant animals have little phytase activity in their guts and therefore can not digest phytate . As a result almost all dietary phytate is discharged into the environment causing phosphorus pollution . Phytate is also considered as an antinutrient for its ability to form insoluble and stable complexes with metal ions thus reducing dietary absorption of essential minerals . It is a dire need to develop sustainable approaches for environmentally friendly utilization for this valuable and abundant natural resource . To this end we engineered
