 Autologous stem cell transplant is the standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma . The clinical significance of peripheral blood T lymphocyte immunologic changes associated with ASCT is poorly understood . Here we evaluated T cell transcriptional messenger RNA profiles and immunophenotypes to correlate immunologic senescence exhaustion and anergy with clinical endpoints in a cohort of patients with MM undergoing ASCT . ASCT induced global transcriptional T cell changes and altered molecular levels of markers of T cell subtypes T cell activation and exhaustion . These included reduced CD4 CD8 ratio skewing toward the Th1 subset reduced expression of costimulatory receptors CD27 and CD28 heightened T cell activation and increased expression of immune modulatory molecules LAG3 and PD1 . Multicolor flow cytometry experiments confirmed altered circulating CD4 and CD8 subsets and skewing toward differentiated effector cells . Moreover ASCT promoted an exhausted immunophenotype in CD3

@highlight Autologous stem cell transplant ASCT induces global transcriptional T cell changes and altered molecular levels of markers of T cell subtypes T cell activation and exhaustion in patients with multiple myeloma.
@highlight High LAG3 transcript expression in T cells detectable as early as 3 months post transplant is associated with inferior clinical outcomes in patients with myeloma.
@highlight ASCT affected soluble levels of molecules with immunomodulatory function by increasing plasma HVEM and TIM3.
@highlight ASCT promotes an exhausted immunophenotype in CD4
@highlight cells and a senescent anergic immunophenotype in CD8
@highlight subsets.
@highlight Future work targeting immune defects in multiple myeloma is warranted to augment or restore T cell responses using the next generation of immune checkpoint inhibitors.
