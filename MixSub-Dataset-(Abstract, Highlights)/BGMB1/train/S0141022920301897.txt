 Novel nano composites were prepared by coating epoxy resin based cationic polymer in nano thickness via in situ curing on the nano wall of macroporous SiO

@highlight Novel nano composites were prepared for immobilization of phospholipase D PLD .
@highlight The storage stability and reusability of PLD were greatly improved through ion exchange.
@highlight Application of amphiphilic supports in biphasic enzymatic reactions.
