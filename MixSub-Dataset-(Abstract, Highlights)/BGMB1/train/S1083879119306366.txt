 The optimal intensity of conditioning regimen may be dependent on not only age and comorbidities but also disease characteristics and risk of relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation . We therefore analyzed the transplant outcomes of 840 adult patients with cytogenetically poor risk acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission who received first allogeneic HCT with either myeloablative conditioning or reduced intensity conditioning between 2006 and 2017.The median age at HCT was 50.5 years . The multivariate analysis showed that patients receiving MAC had a significantly higher overall survival and lower leukemia related mortality than those receiving RIC

@highlight In comparison with reduced intensity conditioning myeloablative conditioning MAC reduced leukemia related mortality and improved overall survival for patients with cytogenetically poor risk acute myeloid leukemia undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT during first complete remission.
@highlight In the subgroup analysis these results applied to patients aged 16 to 59 years with HCT comorbidity index scores 3 and with cytogenetic remission.
@highlight Among MAC regimens there was a trend for worse survival and nonrelapse mortality with the busulfan fludarabine based regimen compared with the total body irradiation based regimen.
