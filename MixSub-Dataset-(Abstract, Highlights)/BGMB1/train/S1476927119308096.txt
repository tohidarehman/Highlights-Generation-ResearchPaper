 MicroRNAs have been proved to play an indispensable role in many fundamental biological processes and the dysregulation of miRNAs is closely correlated with human complex diseases . Many studies have focused on the prediction of potential miRNA disease associations . Considering the insufficient number of known miRNA disease associations and the poor performance of many existing prediction methods a novel model combining gradient boosting decision tree with logistic regression is proposed to prioritize miRNA candidates for diseases . To balance positive and negative samples GBDT LR firstly adopted k means clustering to screen negative samples from unknown miRNA disease associations . Then the gradient boosting decision tree model which has an intrinsic advantage in finding many distinguishing features and feature combinations is applied to extract features . Finally the new features extracted by the GBDT model are input into a logistic regression model for predicting the final miRNA disease association score . The experimental results show that the average AUC of GBDT LR in 5 fold cross validation can achieve 0.9274 . Besides in the case studies 90 94 and 88 of the top 50 miRNAs potentially associated with colon cancer gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer were confirmed by databases respectively . Compared with the other three state of the art methods GBDT LR can achieve the best prediction performance . The source code and dataset of GBDT LR are freely available at

@highlight A combinatorial model that combines gradient boosting decision tree with logistic regression GBDT LR was proposed.
@highlight Gradient boosting decision tree model has the natural advantage to discover new distinguishing features and feature combinations throughout iterative process.
@highlight GBDT LR obtained AUC of 0.9274 and AUPR of 0.9014 in 5 fold cross validation.
