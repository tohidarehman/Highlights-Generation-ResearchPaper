 Cytomegalovirus reactivation and natural killer cell reconstitution are well recognized immunologic events occurring after allogeneic stem cell transplantation . We aimed to study the outcome of CMV reactivation and NK cell reconstitution in patients with hematologic malignancies after allo SCT . We retrospectively studied 246 adult patients who underwent allo SCT for hematologic malignancies at the Kanagawa Cancer Center . CMVR was defined as initiation of preemptive CMV therapy after pp65 antigenemia surveillance . All patients lymphocyte subsets were monitored by flow cytometry at 180 365 and 730 days post transplant . The median follow up period was 3.2 years . CMVR occurred in 141 patients at a median of 45 days . In patients without CMVR versus those with CMVR 5 year overall survival nonrelapse mortality and cumulative incidence of relapse were 79 versus 55

@highlight Post transplant cytomegalovirus CMV reactivation is associated with nonrelapse mortality and overall survival.
@highlight A natural killer NK cell subset significantly contributed to a lower cumulative incidence of relapse.
@highlight NK cell reconstitution improved post transplant outcomes especially in patients with CMV reactivation.
