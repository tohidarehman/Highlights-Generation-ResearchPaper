 Total body irradiation cyclophosphamide is a standard of care conditioning regimen in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia . This study sought to identify whether the addition of thiotepa to TBI CY improves HSCT outcomes for pediatric patients with ALL . A retrospective analysis was performed on 347 pediatric ALL patients who underwent HSCT between 1995 and 2015 with 242 receiving TBI CY TT and 105 patients receiving TBI CY . There were no statistical differences in age donor source or complete remission status between the 2 groups . Comparison of the TBI CY TT versus TBI CY groups demonstrated no difference in transplant related mortality at 1 5 or 10 years . There was lower relapse in the TBI CY TT group at 1 5 10 and 15 years

@highlight Thiotepa is safe to use with a total body irradiation TBI cyclophosphamide backbone in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia with no increase in transplant related mortality.
@highlight Addition of thiotepa to TBI cyclophosphamide did not significantly impact relapse or disease free survival in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia hematopoietic stem cell transplant ALL HSCT .
@highlight Addition of thiotepa to TBI cyclophosphamide did not impact long term overall survival in pediatric ALL HSCT.
