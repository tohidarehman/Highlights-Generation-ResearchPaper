 The development of cost effective bioreactors and scalable methods for the high quantities of bacteriophage production meets the global demand for phage therapy . This study demonstrates the potential application of a novel PES STiO

@highlight A PES STiO
@highlight nanocomposite membrane NCM was fabricated.
@highlight phage production in the membrane supported reactor was performed.
@highlight NCM retains the phage and enhances the rate of phage production in the reactor.
@highlight NCM can performs without loss of bacteria and phage and prevents the biofouling.
@highlight The phage production increased with increasing the cycles compared to the reported rectors.
