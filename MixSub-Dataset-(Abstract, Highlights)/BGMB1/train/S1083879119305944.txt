 The high cost of healthcare in the United States has not been consistently associated with improved health outcomes or quality of care necessitating a focus on value based care . We identified busulfan dosing frequency during allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation conditioning as a potential target for optimization . To improve patient convenience and to decrease the cost of busulfan based conditioning regimens our institution changed busulfan dose frequency from every 6 hours to once daily . We compared costs and patient outcomes between these 2 dosing schedules . In June 2017 our institution transitioned from q6h to q24h busulfan dosing . We compared patients who received busulfan cyclophosphamide conditioning regimens for allogeneic HCT in the year before the dosing change and those who did so in the year after the dosing change . The primary outcomes were differences in cost day 90 mortality and day 90 relapse . Between June 1 2016 and June 1 2018 104 patients received BU CY before allogeneic HCT . Fifty nine patients received q6h busulfan and 45 received q24h busulfan . There were fewer men in the q24h busulfan cohort compared with the q6h busulfan cohort 42 versus 64

@highlight Every 24 hour q24h dosing of i.v. busulfan reduced drug waste compared with every 6 hour q6h dosing.
@highlight Reduced busulfan drug waste led to a cost savings of nearly 20 000 USD per patient.
@highlight Clinical outcomes were equivocal or improved with q24h dosing compared with q6h dosing.
