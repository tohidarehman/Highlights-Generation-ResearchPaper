 Antithymocyte globulin is used to reduce the incidence and severity of graft versus host disease with hematopoietic cell transplantation yet optimum dosing has yet to be determined . We have previously demonstrated that 2.5 mg kg ATG in conditioning can reduce the incidence of GVHD in unrelated donor transplants . Recent literature has suggested that ATG dosing based on absolute lymphocyte count could lead to more optimum exposure of the drug . We sought to determine if ALC at the time of transplant could impact clinical outcomes . We conducted a retrospective single center study analyzing all consecutive patients at The Ottawa Hospital who received a matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant with ATG between 2009 and 2014 . Patients received rabbit ATG at 0.5 mg kg on day 2 and 2.0 mg kg on day 1 . Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine if any patient or transplant related factors including weight ALC and total ATG dose given impacted GVHD relapse or mortality . In total 111 patients met inclusion with a median age of 50 years . The most common diagnoses were acute myelogenous leukemia Myelodysplasia myeloproliferative neoplasms and lymphoma . The median weight at time of conditioning was 80.3 kg . The median ALC on the first day of ATG administration was 0.110

@highlight Weight based dosing of antithymocyte globulin ATG at 2.5 mg kg as part of graft versus host disease GVHD prophylaxis leads to similar GVHD outcomes as lymphocyte count based ATG dosing.
@highlight Absolute lymphocyte count in this single center retrospective analysis was not associated with GVHD relapse or survival outcomes.
@highlight Prospective comparisons of low weight based versus lymphocyte count based ATG dosing are still warranted.
