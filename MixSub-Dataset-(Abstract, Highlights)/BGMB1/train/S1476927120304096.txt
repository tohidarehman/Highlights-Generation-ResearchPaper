 Mycotic keratitis is a fungal infection of corneal epithelium . It is more common in tropical and subtropical countries and is one of the leading causes of blindness . Many of the antifungal drugs have been less effective in treating this condition and certain drugs which are efficient and yet limited in use due to its extreme side effects . Hence in this study an attempt is made to identify potential and least toxic antifungal inhibitors that targets thiamine thiazole synthase a novel target for suppressing

@highlight Mycotic keratitis is a vision threatening disease that are resistant to most of the available antifungal drugs.
