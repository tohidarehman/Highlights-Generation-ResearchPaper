 Inorganic nitrogen and Cr often co exist in wastewater and have been a major threat to ecological equilibrium and public health . In this work we successfully isolated

@highlight LX exhibited efficient ability to remove inorganic nitrogen.
@highlight Simultaneous ammonia and Cr VI removal was achieved by strain LX.
@highlight More than 80 of ammonia could be removed at 100mgL
@highlight NH
@highlight  N with the addition of 30mgL
@highlight Cr VI .
@highlight A possible pathway of ammonia removal for strain LX was proposed.
@highlight Immobilized strain LX could degrade ammonia and reduce Cr VI to Cr well in SBR.
