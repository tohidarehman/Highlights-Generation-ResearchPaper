 This study of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia age 60 years analyzed the association between patients performance indicesHematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index Karnofsky Performance Score and European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation risk scorebefore undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and quality of life quantified using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Bone Marrow Transplant Scale in the first year after allo HSCT . Over a period of 7 years 48 evaluable patients underwent reduced intensity conditioning allo HSCT . The median patient age was 65 years with 2 year and 5 year overall survival of 65.8 and 52.3 respectively . A significant improvement across all QoL scores was observed over the 12 months post HSCT . An HCT CI of 0 was associated with improved general QoL score at 6 months compared with patients with an HCT CI of 1 to 2

@highlight Quality of life QoL scores improve up to 12 months post transplantation in patients age 60 years.
@highlight A Karnofsky Performance Status score of 100 at pretransplantation was correlated with improved QoL at 6 months post transplantation.
@highlight A lower comorbidity score was associated with improved quality of life post transplantation.
