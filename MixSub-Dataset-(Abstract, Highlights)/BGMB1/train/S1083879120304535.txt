 Infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after hematopoietic cell transplantation . Gut microbiota composition and metabolites provide colonization resistance against dominance of potential pathogens and GM dysbiosis following HCT can be deleterious to immune reconstitution . Little is known about the composition diversity and evolution of GM communities in HCT patients and their association with subsequent febrile neutropenia and infection . Identification of markers before HCT that predict subsequent infection could be useful in developing individualized antimicrobial strategies . Fecal samples were collected prospectively from 33 HCT recipients at serial time points baseline post conditioning regimen neutropenia onset FN onset and hematologic recovery . GM was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing . FN and major infections ie bloodstream infection typhlitis invasive fungal infection pneumonia and

@highlight Significant changes in gut microbiota GM diversity were detected over time from baseline to hematopoietic recovery during hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT .
@highlight GM functional profiles differed between patients who developed febrile neutropenia and those who did not.
@highlight We identified a baseline protective GM profile that shows promise in predicting the development of major infection after HCT.
