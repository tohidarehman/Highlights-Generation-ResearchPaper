 The natural hormone 17 estradiol is a frequently detected endocrine disrupter and its transformation into oestrone and carcinogenic catechol oestrogen quinones via degradation is a problem that must be considered when choosing wastewater bioremediation agents . In this study the performance of immobilised functional microalgae with respect to E2 removal and degradation was investigated under repeated loadings of domestic wastewater . The wastewater treatment using the immobilised microalgae resulted in a significant enhancement of nitrogen phosphorus and E2 removal efficiencies which were in the ranges 4086 2672 and 8599 respectively . The E2 removal pathway was inferred and metabolisation via hydroxylation O methylation glycosylation dehydrogenation and dicarboxylation owing to the immobilised algae cells was theorised . Additionally no other forms of natural oestrogens including estrone or quinone metabolites were detected in the metabolites . Therefore immobilised functional microalgae at concentrations above 200 beads mL are recommended as an effective and safe approach to restoring E2 contaminated wastewater .

@highlight Immobilised microalgae reduced 17 estradiol E2 by 85 99 from raw wastewater.
@highlight The presence of algae could help to maintain alginate bead stability.
@highlight The resources in wastewater are reutilised in this method via generated biomass.
@highlight E2 glycosylation and pyrogallol estrogen o methylation were found by this algae.
