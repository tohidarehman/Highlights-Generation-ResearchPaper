 Gemtuzumab ozogamicin therapy before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation has been historically associated with an increased risk of hepatic veno occlusive disease sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in patients with acute myeloid leukemia . The current analysis examined VOD SOS risk and outcomes in a cohort of patients who in recent years were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research . Adults with AML who had GO exposure before myeloablative alloHCT were matched 1 4 by age and disease status at transplant to recipients without GO exposure . One hundred thirty seven patients with GO exposure and 548 matched control subjects who underwent alloHCT between 2008 and 2011 were included in this analysis . With a median 8 year follow up of survivors the 5 year overall survival probability was similar in the 2 cohorts 38 and 38 in the GO exposed versus control groups

@highlight VOD SOS incidence at 100 days post HCT was 4 versus 3 in GO exposed adults versus control subjects.
@highlight Five year overall survival probability was 38 in both groups.
@highlight GO exposure before HCT was not associated with an increased risk of VOD SOS or death.
