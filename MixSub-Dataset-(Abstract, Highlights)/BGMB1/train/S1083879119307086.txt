 Although thymus independent donor derived T cell expansion may determine the occurrence of graft versus host disease and relapse after transplantation the characteristics and dynamics of the expansion process remain unclear . To address this issue we monitored T cell receptor repertoire at day 0 day 28 and day 61 after transplantation in 30 patients with hematologic malignancies by next generation sequencing . The clonality index showed an increasing clonality over time

@highlight Homeostatic peripheral expansion predominates in the first month after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
@highlight Antigen driven expansion in the second month leads to a graft versus tumor GvT effect.
@highlight TCRI200bc 1.0 indicates a potent GvT effect and freedom from relapse within a year.
@highlight The GvT associated clones share some V and J segments among nonrelapse patients.
