 The enzyme 1 4 dihydroxy 2 naphthoic acid prenyltransferase is a critical player in determining the eciency of the menaquinone synthesis pathway and is an attractive target for the development of novel chemotherapeutics against pathogenic Gram positive bacteria . However there has been no report on structural properties or active region of MenA . To solve this challenge we predicted the three dimensiona structure and critical amino acid sites of MenA by bioinformatics analysis . Six amino acid sites were chosen by alligning the amino acid sequence of MenA from

@highlight Four Asp sites are vital for 1 4 dihydroxy 2 naphthoic acid prenyltransferase MenA .
@highlight Two sites Q67th N74th positively affect MenA activity and menaquinone titer.
@highlight Mutant which Q67th was changed to R67th in MenA results a 5 fold increase in Y
@highlight Hydrophobic interaction was beneficial for promoting MenA activity.
