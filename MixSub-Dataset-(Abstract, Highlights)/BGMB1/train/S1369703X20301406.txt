 Biological mechanisms for Cr removing induced by ZnAl LDHs coated on maifanite substrate were explored in constructed rapid infiltration systems . Characteristics of maifanite ZnAl LDHs and natural maifanite by scanning electron microscope and X ray fluorescence spectrometer confirmed the feasibility of the LDHs coating way . The purification experiments showed that the CRIS with maifanite ZnAl LDHs substrate displayed higher Cr removal performance induced by microorganism than that with natural maifanite . High throughput sequencing results of microorganism immobilized on the two substrates revealed that

@highlight Maifanite ZnAl LDHs induced low richness but high evenness of microbial community.
@highlight Enzymatic activities were enhanced by ZnAl LDHs and contributed to Cr VI removal.
@highlight and
@highlight were discovered to be promoted by ZnAl LDHs.
