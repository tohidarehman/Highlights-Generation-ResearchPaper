 The indication for allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with lower risk myelodysplastic syndrome is controversial . Here we report 60 patients with a low risk or intermediate risk classification according to the revised International Prognostic Scoring System who underwent allogeneic SCT with a reduced intensity conditioning or myeloablative conditioning regimen from an HLA identical sibling a matched unrelated donor or a mismatched unrelated donor . The rates of grade II IV and grade III IV acute graft versus host disease were 32 and 7 respectively resulting in a transplantation related mortality of 17 at 3 years . The cumulative incidence of relapse at 5 years was only 7 resulting in a 5 year disease free survival of 72 and overall survival of 79 . Transplantation from a fully matched donor resulted in significantly improved OS at 5 years . Allogeneic SCT in lower risk MDS from an HLA matched donor resulted in excellent OS with a low risk of relapse .

@highlight Allogeneic stem cell transplantation SCT in patients with lower risk myelodysplastic syndrome MDS resulted in very good outcomes.
@highlight Transplantation from a matched donor was a significant factor in survival.
@highlight The risk of relapse risk is 10 in patients with lower risk MDS after allogeneic SCT.
