 Chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy a new immunotherapy for relapsed and refractory hematologic malignancies can be accompanied by adverse events including coagulation disorders . Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of coagulation parameters in 100 patients with R R hematologic malignancies after receiving CAR T cell therapy to illuminate the profiles of coagulation disorders and to facilitate the management of coagulation disorders . A high incidence of coagulation disorders was observed including elevated D dimer increased fibrinogen degradation product decreased fibrinogen prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and prolonged prothrombin time . Coagulation disorders occurred mainly during day 6 to day 20 after CAR T cell infusion . The changes in coagulation parameters were associated with high tumor burden in acute lymphoblastic leukemia more lines of prior therapies lower baseline platelet count and especially cytokine release syndrome . Disseminated intravascular coagulation was found in 7 patients with grade 3 CRS and indicated a poor prognosis . Our study suggests that coagulation disorders are manageable in most patients after CAR T cell therapy . Coexistence of DIC and severe CRS is closely related to nonrelapsed deaths during the acute toxicity phase and effective and timely treatment is the key to reduce nonrelapse mortality for patients with DIC and severe CRS .
