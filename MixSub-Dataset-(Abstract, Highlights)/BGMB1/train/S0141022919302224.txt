 Xylanases of the GH30 family are grouped to subfamilies GH30 7 and GH30 8 . The GH30 8 members are of bacterial origin and well characterized while the GH30 7 members are from fungal sources and their properties are quite diverse . Here a heterologous expression and characterization of the GH30 7 xylanase

@highlight A putative
@highlight GH30 7 xylanase gene was cloned and expressed.
@highlight Xyn30A is active on different xylans and linear xylooligosaccharides.
@highlight Xyn30A releases xylobiose from the non reducing end of the substrates.
@highlight Xylobiohydrolase activity makes
@highlight Xyn30A a promising tool for xylobiose production.
