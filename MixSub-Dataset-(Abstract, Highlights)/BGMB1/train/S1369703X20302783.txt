 Maltooligosyltrehalose synthase is a key enzyme in the preparation of trehalose . Increasing interest in trehalose requires further improvement in the catalytic performance of MTSase in order to increase trehalose yield but so far the reports about modification of MTSase revealed that the trahalose yield was increased only by 1 . In this study the mutant S44P of MTSase from

@highlight The high throughput screening method for catalytic efficiency of MTSase was built up.
@highlight The mutate exhibited a significantly increased trehalose yield and improved thermostability.
@highlight The first crystal structures of the mutate and wild type enzyme was solved.
@highlight The structures elucidated the changed properties.
