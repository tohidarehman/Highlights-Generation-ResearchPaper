 Mycobacteria is important microbial cell factory in the steroid industry and there is an urgent need to develop synthetic biology toolkit to regulate the expression level of genes in mycobacterial strains . In this study we first evaluated the adaptation of seven promoters in

@highlight Stronger promoters obtained by connecting promoters to increase sigma factor recognition region.
@highlight The A U rich RBS sequences improve gene expression in mycobacteria.
@highlight The synthetic biology toolkit can ease the metabolic bottleneck of
