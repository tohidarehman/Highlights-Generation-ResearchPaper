 The azo dye Congo red is heavily used in textile industries and is actively present in the wastewater run offs . Its structural complexity and physical characteristics make it resistant to the physicochemical treatments employed by the industry . Over time application of the enzyme laccase has proved to be quite useful due to its ability to oxidize and eventually decolorize the dye . Moreover the use of ABTS as the electron mediator also helps in enhancing the oxidizing capability of the enzyme with congo red . The present study involves establishing the role of the individual components i.e . laccase ABTS and the dye in the LMS electrochemically . Congo red doesnt have any form of electrochemical activity by itself but the enzyme brings about a substantial change by increasing the rate of reduction . The effect of ABTS though same is concentration dependent . For LMS laccase helps in bringing about the rate of reduction much faster in the presence of the mediator initiating the decolorization of the dye .

@highlight Congo Red does not have an electrochemical activity of its own.
@highlight Laccase increases the rate of reduction of the dye.
@highlight The effect of ABTS as the mediator with congo red is concentration dependent.
@highlight In LMS the reducing capability of the components gets enhanced.
