 Crossovers that drive genetic exchange between homologous chromosomes are strongly biased toward subtelomeric regions in plant species . Manipulating the rate and positions of COs to increase the genetic variation accessible to breeders is a longstanding goal . Use of genome editing reagents that induce double stranded breaks or modify the epigenome at desired sites of recombination and manipulation of CO factors are increasingly applicable approaches for achieving this goal . These strategies for controlled recombination have potential to reduce the time and expense associated with traditional breeding reveal currently inaccessible genetic diversity and increase control over the inheritance of preferred haplotypes . Considerable challenges to address include translating knowledge from models to crop species and determining the best stages of the breeding cycle at which to control recombination .

@highlight The genetic diversity accessible to plant breeders has traditionally been limited by chromosomal COs but recent advances in targeted DNA cleavage and epigenetic modification are increasing access.
@highlight Overcoming the low frequency and uneven distribution of COs in plants can reveal allelic diversity and may increase control over the inheritance of preferred haplotypes.
@highlight The frequency and location of COs can be altered with manipulation of pro and anti CO factors site directed nucleases or epigenetic modifiers we refer to such alteration as controlled recombination.
@highlight Epigenetic modifiers can induce COs near centromeres which are otherwise very low frequency CO regions.
@highlight Controlled recombination may enable breeders and geneticists to unlock otherwise inaccessible genetic diversity.
