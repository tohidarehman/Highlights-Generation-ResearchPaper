 A matched pair analysis of transplant related outcomes was carried out in 116 of 255 consecutive patients who received transplants from an HLA identical sibling or haploidentical related donor . The 2 patient series were matched with 9 variables period of transplant patient and donor age sex diagnosis disease phase conditioning regimen donor recipient sex and cytomegalovirus status combinations . As graft versus host disease prophylaxis all patients received the standard cyclosporine and methotrexate association with the addition of anti thymocyte globulins mycophenolate mofetil and basiliximab in haploidentical unmanipulated bone marrow recipients . Anti infectious management transfusion policy and supportive care were identical for all patients . By comparing the 2 patient series no statistically significant difference was observed for the cumulative incidence of advanced acute and extensive chronic GVHD transplant related mortality and relapse . With a median follow up of 3.5 years the 5 year disease free survival was 37 6 and 36 6 for HLA identical sibling and haploidentical recipients respectively . The results of transplant from HLA identical siblings and haploidentical donors are comparable . Regardless of the HLA matching other factors known to affect the transplant outcomes such as donor recipient age sex and CMV status combinations might drive the search for the best donor .

@highlight Comparable outcomes between HLA identical sibling and haploidentical transplants.
@highlight Similar incidence of advanced graft versus host disease with prophylaxis not including post transplant cyclophosphamide CTX .
@highlight Combined donor recipient characteristics more important than HLA matching.
