 High dose chemotherapy and autologous blood stem cell transplantation represent the standard of care in multiple myeloma for transplantation eligible patients . Up to 3 HD CHT ABSCT treatments may be administered during the course of disease including during late onset relapse . Transplantation centers routinely collect more than 1 peripheral blood stem cell graft however subsequent HD CHT ABSCT treatments are often not performed for various reasons . Currently little is known about the actual utilization rate of stored PBSCs . The collection storage and disposal of PBSC products was analyzed in a large cohort of patients with MM over a 12 year period with a minimum follow up of 6 years . The final dataset analysis was performed in March 2019 which was set as the reference date . Based on institution specific charges the costs for PBSC collection processing and storage were estimated .

@highlight Up to 3 high dose chemotherapy and autologous blood stem cell transplantation treatments may be administered in patients with multiple myeloma MM .
@highlight Therefore several peripheral blood stem cell PBSC grafts are collected in MM patients.
@highlight Considerable discrepancies between PBSC collection and utilization were identified.
@highlight This was associated with significant efforts and costs.
@highlight Guidelines for the reevaluation of stored PBSC grafts are warranted.
