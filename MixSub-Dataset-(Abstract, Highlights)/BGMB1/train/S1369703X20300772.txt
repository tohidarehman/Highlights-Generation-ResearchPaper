 Tanshinones are compounds of diterpenoid which are used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases however there is an urgent need to improve their production using biotechnological methods . In the present study

@highlight The total tanshinone content increased by a maximum of 2.7 fold in
@highlight hairy roots by overexpressing
@highlight Treatment with elicitors further increased the total tanshinone production in the
@highlight  overexpressing lines.
@highlight The tanshinone accumulation correlated positively with the transcriptional level of biosynthetic genes.
