 Although hematopoietic cell transplantation from an HLA matched unrelated donor is potentially curative for hematologic malignancies survival is lower for African Americans compared with Caucasians . Because only approximately 20 of African Americans will have an HLA matched unrelated donor many of these patients undergo HLA haploidentical relative or umbilical cord blood transplantation . In this study we analyzed outcomes after HLA haploidentical related donor and umbilical cord blood transplantations in African American patients with hematologic malignancy between 2008 and 2016 . The predominant disease was acute myelogenous leukemia for recipients of both types of donor grafts . The incidences of grade II IV and III IV acute graft versus host disease were higher after umbilical cord blood transplantation compared with HLA haploidentical relative transplantation 56 and 29 respectively versus 33 and 11 respectively

@highlight The use of HLA haploidentical and umbilical cord blood transplants expands the access to transplantation is regardless of patient race or ethnicity.
@highlight The risk of grade II IV and III IV acute graft versus host disease is increased after umbilical cord blood transplantation.
@highlight The risk of transplantation related mortality is increased with umbilical cord blood transplantation.
