 Dihydroxyacetone phosphate dependent aldolases demonstrate important values in the production of rare ketoses due to their unique stereoselectivities . As a specific example we developed an efficient

@highlight Cascade synthesis of rare ketoses by whole cells from glycerol was developed.
@highlight The new designed biotransformation approach avoided the tedious purification of enzymes and cofactors such as ATP.
@highlight D sorbose D psicose and L fructose were efficiently produced in this system based on DHAP dependent aldolase RhaD.
