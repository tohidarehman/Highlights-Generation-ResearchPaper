 Root systems determine the water and nutrients for photosynthesis and harvested products underpinning agricultural productivity . We highlight 11 programs that integrated root traits into germplasm for breeding relying on phenotyping . Progress was successful but slow . Todays phenotyping technologies will speed up root trait improvement . They combine multiple new alleles in germplasm for target environments in parallel . Roots and shoots are detected simultaneously and nondestructively seed to seed measures are automated and field and laboratory technologies are increasingly linked . Available simulation models can aid all phenotyping decisions . This century will see a shift from single root traits to rhizosphere selections that can be managed dynamically on farms and a shift to phenotype based improvement to accommodate the dynamic complexity of whole crop systems .

@highlight Root and rhizosphere traits have been selected and incorporated into germplasm since the 1970s proving the value of roots and phenotyping in prebreeding programs.
@highlight Past examples show how todays noninvasive phenotyping technologies that measure roots shoots and seeds can be strategically combined to speed up germplasm enhancement.
@highlight Models are available to test and incorporate root phenotypes at different stages of selection programs.
@highlight The rootsoil rhizosphere can be phenotyped noninvasively in soils revealing new combinatorial traits relevant to the reality of farming systems and to select for crop improvement.
