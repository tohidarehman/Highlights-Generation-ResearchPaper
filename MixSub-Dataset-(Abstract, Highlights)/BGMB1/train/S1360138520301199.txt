 Small RNAs mainly including miRNAs and siRNAs are ubiquitous in eukaryotes . sRNAs mostly negatively regulate gene expression via transcriptional gene silencing through DNA methylation mRNA cleavage or translation inhibition . The mechanisms of sRNA biogenesis and function in diverse biological processes as well as the interactions between sRNAs and environmental factors like biotic stress have been deeply explored . Phytohormones are central in the plants response to stress and multiple recent studies highlight an emerging role for sRNAs in the direct response to or the regulation of plant hormonal pathways . In this review we discuss recent progress on the unraveling of crossregulation between sRNAs and nine plant hormones .

@highlight An increasing number of studies identified a large variety of sRNAs responding to diverse phytohormones and in depth validation revealed molecular mechanisms underneath this.
@highlight Conversely multiple sRNAs and central proteins in sRNAs pathways can regulate biosynthesis or signaling of nine phytohormones.
@highlight Some sRNA modules interconnect with more than one hormonal pathway thereby providing new bridges in plant hormonal crosstalk.
@highlight In response to environmental stimuli phytohormones enable plant adaptation and part of this reaction could be attributed to sRNAs and their targets.
