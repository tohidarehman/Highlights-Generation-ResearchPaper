 Hepatocellular carcinoma is the major histological form of primary liver cancer . It has usually reached the disease state once the patient is diagnosed since there are no specific symptoms in the early stages of HCC . This fact increases the difficulty of curing HCC . Recently quantities of evidence have shown that many mathematical methods can be used to detect critical states or tipping points of complex diseases . However it is difficult to apply the DNB theory to the clinic since multiple samples are generally unavailable for individual patient . This paper constructs a novel method based on landscape dynamic network biomarkers which aims to detect early warning signals from cirrhosis state to very advanced HCC state in individual patient . The selected dataset contains multiple samples for each HCC state . A score that indicates the disease characteristics is calculated for each sample by RNA seq data and several scores constitute a distribution in the same state . Quantifying the statistical characteristics of these distributions and determining that low grade dysplastic and high grade dysplastic are the critical states of HCC . These results can provide scientific advice for early warning indicators and optimal treatment time for HCC .

@highlight Our algorithm improves the original landscpe DNB method with strong clinical applicability.
@highlight We identify the critical states of HCC based on the characteristics of the distribution of the sample population.
@highlight In our study low grade dysplastic and high grade dysplastic were identified as critical states of HCC.
