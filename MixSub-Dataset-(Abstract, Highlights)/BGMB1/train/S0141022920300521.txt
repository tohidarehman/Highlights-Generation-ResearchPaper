 Living cells are constantly exposed to reactive oxygen species causing them to rely on a constant supply of exogenous antioxidants . Quercetin is one of the potent exogenous antioxidants utilized in various antioxidant formulations . However the potential application of Q is largely limited because of its poor water solubility . In this study we employed titanium dioxide TiO

@highlight QTiO
@highlight nano antioxidant keeps stable of quercetin molecules in the cells and serve as an efficient antioxidant.
@highlight Pure quercetin molecules are cytotoxic and induce apoptosis via caspases 3 activation.
@highlight Cellular penetration of quercetin increases by incorporation with PEGylated TiO

@highlight The QTiO
@highlight nano antioxidants show strong antioxidative activity by upregulating Nrf2 signalling.
