 High dose melphalan conditioning before autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation is standard of care for patients with transplantation eligible multiple myeloma . The traditional lyophilized Mel formulation has inadequate solubility and stability after reconstitution leading to the use of propylene glycol as a solubilizing agent . A newer PG free Mel preparation uses beta cyclodextrin captisol as a solubilizing agent and was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a conditioning agent based on a single phase IIb study showing bioequivalence . We compared the outcomes of consecutive patients with myeloma undergoing autoHCT using the 2 formulations of Mel for conditioning as our center switched from using the older formulation to the newer one . Of 294 autoHCT recipients 162 received PG Mel conditioning and 132 received PGF Mel conditioning . The PGF Mel group was older and had a lower average Karnofsky Performance Status score . PGF Mel was associated with faster neutrophil recovery median 12 days versus 13 days

@highlight Propylene glycol PG free melphalan PGF Mel Evomela is safe and has similar toxicity profile as PG Mel Alkeran when used as a conditioning regimen for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation autoHCT for myeloma patients.
@highlight PGF Mel conditioning was associated with a modest improvement in neutrophil recovery median 12 days versus 13 days
