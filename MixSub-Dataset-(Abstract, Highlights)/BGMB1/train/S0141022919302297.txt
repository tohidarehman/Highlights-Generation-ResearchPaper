 2 5 Bisfuran is a versatile building block in the synthesis of polymers fuels and macrocycle polyethers . In this work alcohol dehydrogenases were identified from

@highlight Recombinant yeast strains harboring ADHs were constructed for HMF reduction.
@highlight BHMF was furnished in a 94 yield with the substrate loading up to 250mM.
@highlight The space time yield up to 3.4g L h was obtained in a fed batch process.
@highlight Inexpensive corncob hydrolysate was a promising alternative to glucose as co substrate.
