 Recombinant human acid alpha glucosidase from Chinese hamster ovary cells is the only approved treatment for patients with Pompe disease . In this study rhGAAs were produced in transgenic rice cell suspension cultures under eight different conditions untreated 5M of 2 fluoro

@highlight Plant core fucosylated glycans may elicit an immune response in humans.
@highlight Rice cell derived rhGAAs were produced under eight different culture conditions.
@highlight  glycans of eight rhGAAs were analyzed using UPLC and LC ESI HCD MS MS.
@highlight 15
@highlight  glycans were characterized as core de core and non core fucosylated glycans.
@highlight The lowest core fucosylated condition of rhGAA was 2 FF combined with PF 68.
