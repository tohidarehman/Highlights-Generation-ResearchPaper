 Although autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation is standard therapy for patients with lymphoma and multiple myeloma few studies have addressed late effects and quality of life in long term survivors after AHCT . Using long term follow up annual questionnaires with self reported outcomes we surveyed 665 patients who were at 5 years after AHCT for the diagnosis of lymphoma or MM . Three hundred and eighty nine patients completed the questionnaire at a median of 11 years after AHCT . The median patient age was 63 years in the 268 patients with lymphoma and 69 years in the 121 patients with multiple myeloma . The most commonly reported medical conditions were sexual dysfunction history of shingles cataracts osteoporosis or osteopenia joint replacement and skin cancer . Current medication use was more frequent in the patients with MM for infection prevention treatment 19 for MM versus 5 lymphoma

@highlight Patient undergoing autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation AHCT for lymphoma reported better health and quality of life QoL compared with those undergoing AHCT for multiple myeloma.
@highlight At a median of 11 years after AHCT we identified important late effects and QoL deficits that are potentially amenable to intervention.
