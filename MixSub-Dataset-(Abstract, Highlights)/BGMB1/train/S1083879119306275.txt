 To prospectively validate the incidence manifestations and outcomes of graft versus host disease by National Institutes of Health criteria we recruited 406 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients at 16 transplant centers in Japan from May 2012 to June 2014 . The 2 year cumulative incidence of late acute and chronic GVHD was 3.2 and 35.4 with a median onset of 3.6 and 4.7 months after transplant respectively . The global severity at onset was mild in 30.3 moderate in 43.5 and severe in 26.2 . Eighty two patients were followed up for 2 years with 79.3 still manifesting GVHD symptoms and 80.6 of the patients received systemic immunosuppressive treatment with a 2 year cumulative incidence of IST termination of 33.1 . Severe patients showed a significantly lower rate of IST termination than those with mild and moderate severities . The 2 year incidence of nonrelapse mortality and relapse was not significantly different according to the severity at onset versus moderate versus severe relapse mild versus moderate versus severe . As a result 2 year overall survival and GVHD specific survival were equivalent according to the severity at onset . Our study helped identify the characteristics of late acute and chronic GVHD in Japanese patients . Further investigation is needed to identify an optimal endpoint for survival prediction .

@highlight The incidences of late acute and chronic graft versus host disease GVHD were lower in Japanese than in whites.
@highlight Organ manifestations and risk factors were similar to previous reports.
@highlight Global severity was not associated with overall survival nonrelapse mortality or GVHD specific survival.
@highlight Severe patients showed a significantly lower rate of treatment termination.
