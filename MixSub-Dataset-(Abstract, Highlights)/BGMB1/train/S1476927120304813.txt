 The global emergency caused by COVID 19 makes the discovery of drugs capable of inhibiting SARS CoV 2 a priority to reduce the mortality and morbidity of this disease . Repurposing approved drugs can provide therapeutic alternatives that promise rapid and ample coverage because they have a documented safety record as well as infrastructure for large scale production . The main protease of SARS CoV 2 is an excellent therapeutic target because it is critical for viral replication however Mpro has a highly flexible active site that must be considered when performing computer assisted drug discovery . In this work potential inhibitors of the main protease of SARS Cov 2 were identified through a docking assisted virtual screening procedure . A total of 4384 drugs all approved for human use were screened against three conformers of Mpro . The ligands were further studied through molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy analysis . A total of nine currently approved molecules are proposed as potential inhibitors of SARS CoV 2 . These molecules can be further tested to speed the development of therapeutics against COVID 19 .

@highlight The main protease of SARS CoV 2 has a highly flexible active site.
@highlight Drug repurposing is a treatment opportunity in the current COVID 19 pandemic.
@highlight Nine drugs merit testing as inhibitors of the SARS CoV 2 main protease.
