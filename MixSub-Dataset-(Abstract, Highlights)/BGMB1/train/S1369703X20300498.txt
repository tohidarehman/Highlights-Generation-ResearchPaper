 Recently bacterial quorum quenching has been proven as a novel approach for biofouling mitigation in membrane bioreactors . The information about microbial community is vital for the development of QQ strategies . Also the change of microbial community may affect the biofouling propensity of sludge . In this study the effects of exogenous QQ on microbial community dynamics in MBRs were investigated along with biofouling propensity of activated sludge . QQ MBR dosed with exogenous QQ bacteria exhibited a better anti biofouling whereas the wastewater treatment performance was almost no difference compared with control MBR . As for the microbial community exogenous QQ had an impact on both the bacterial diversities and community composition especially for the quorum sensing and QQ bacteria in situ . The addition of exogenous QQ could reduce the QQ ability of sludge itself in the short term and enhance its biofouling propensity . These findings provided new insights for the development of QQ strategies .

@highlight Microbial community dynamics are analyzed under the condition of exogenous QQ.
@highlight The change of sludges biofouling propensity is investigated when adding exogenous QQ.
@highlight Exogenous QQ can reduce the species diversities of MBRs especially in the short term.
@highlight Exogenous QQ can enhance biofouling propensity of sludge itself in the short term.
@highlight The enhancing of biofouling propensity of sludge depends on the dynamics of situ QS and QQ bacteria.
