 As a kind of pyrimidine nucleoside cytidine has been widely recognized as an important precursor for the production of some antiviral and antitumor drugs . In this study the systematic construction of metabolically engineered

@highlight Cytidine titer was stepwise increased under the coordination of four modularized metabolic engineering strategies.
@highlight The metabolic module from UMP toward cytidine was investigated to enhance cytidine formation.
@highlight The major rate limiting steps and competing pathways of cytidine biosynthesis were identified and fine tuned.
@highlight A fed batch fermentation was performed in a 5 L reactor to further increase cytidine titer.
