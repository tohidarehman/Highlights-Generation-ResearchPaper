 Diabody 31 a bispecific therapeutic antibody is a heterodimer comprised of two types of chimeric single chain variable fragments that has been identified as a clone with high cytotoxicity against cancer cells . Diabody 31 is inactive as a homodimer and monomer yet active as a heterodimer in solution . Herein we examined the association between two kinds of diabodies LH and HL type based on the behavior of four kinds of their constituent chimera scFvs by size analysis . More than half of the LH diabody fraction including two types of chimeric scFV that were equally expressed and nearly all HL diabody fraction components including one chimeric HL L scFv were in inactive form and changed components dynamically as time passed . The association of these diabodies corresponded to that of the scFv chimera indicating that analysis of these chimeras could predict diabody quality . Furthermore addition of the deficient HL R chimera scFv comprised of an unbalanced chimeric scFv ratio to the HL diabody fraction increased cancer cell cytotoxicity with maximal effects obtained upon repeating the process five times . These findings provide insights into the efficient construction of a functional diabody by noting the characteristics of associated diabodies and the molar ratio of expressed chimera scFvs .
