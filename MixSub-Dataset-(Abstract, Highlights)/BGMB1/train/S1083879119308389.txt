 Prolonged thrombocytopenia after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a strong risk factor for transplantation related morbidity and mortality and no standard treatment guideline exists . Thrombopoietin receptor agonists eltrombopag and romiplostim increases the platelet production and are being increasingly used in various conditions with thrombocytopenia . In this review we present an overview of these TPO RAs and review their efficacy and safety in prolonged post HSCT thrombocytopenia . Through a systematic literature search we identified 25 reports describing their use for this indication . Thirteen reports described the use of eltrombopag in 78 patients with prolonged isolated thrombocytopenia and 43 patients with secondary failure of platelet recovery . A consistent and durable response with a rise in platelet counts 5010

@highlight Prolonged thrombocytopenia after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCT is a strong risk factor for transplantation related morbidity and mortality.
@highlight No common consensus exists for the uniform classification and management of prolonged thrombocytopenia after HSCT. The available literature inconsistently describes post HSCT thrombocytopenia as either prolonged isolated thrombocytopenia PIT or secondary failure of platelet recovery SFPR .
@highlight Thrombopoietin receptor agonists eltrombopag and romiplostim are being increasingly to treat patients with prolonged post HSCT thrombocytopenia.
@highlight Our extensive literature review suggests that patients with prolonged post HSCT thrombocytopenia may respond to both eltrombopag overall response rate ORR 70 and romiplostim ORR 82 with no evidence of serious adverse effects.
@highlight However the overall strength of evidence is weak in view of retrospective nature of the studies lack of control groups heterogeneity of data and potential for publication bias.
