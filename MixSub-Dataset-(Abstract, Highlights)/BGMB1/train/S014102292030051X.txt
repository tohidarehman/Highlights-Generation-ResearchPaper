 Recent trends in biosensing research have motivated scientists and research professionals to investigate the development of miniaturized bioanalytical devices to make them portable label free and smaller in size . The performance of the cantilever based devices which is one of the very important domains of sensitive field level detection has improved significantly with the development of new micro nanofabrication technologies and surface functionalization techniques . The cantilevers have scaled down to Nano from micro level and have become exceptionally sensitive and also have some anomalous associated properties due to the scale . In this review we have discussed about fundamental principles of cantilever operation detection methods and previous present and future approaches of study through cantilever based sensing platform . Other than that we have also discussed the past major bio sensing efforts through micro nano cantilevers and about recent progress in the field .
