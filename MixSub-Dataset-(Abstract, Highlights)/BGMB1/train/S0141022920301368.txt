 Pipecolic acid a non proteinogenic amino acid is a metabolite in lysine metabolism and a key chiral precursor in local anesthesia and macrolide antibiotics . To replace the environmentally unfriendly chemical production or preparation procedure of pipecolic acid many biological synthetic routes have been studied for a long time . Among them synthesis by lysine cyclodeaminase encoded by

@highlight L PA is a key chiral precursor for local anesthesia and macrolide antibiotics.
@highlight Until now the titer of biobased pipecolic acid production is relatively low.
@highlight Introduction of LCD and systematic optimization improved the L PA production.
@highlight Controlling the copy number of
@highlight gene was the most critical factor.
@highlight The highest titer 93.5 g L with 72.4 conversion was achieved.
