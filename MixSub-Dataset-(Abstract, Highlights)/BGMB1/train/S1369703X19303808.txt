 The removal of atmospheric methane by methanotrophs is a potential strategy for mitigating global warming . However due to the low mass transfer of methane to methanotrophic cells the conventional bioprocesses require active gas supply with high energy consumption . This study aimed to evaluate methane degradation performance in microbial gas phase reactions using effectively immobilized

@highlight Freeze thaw treatment facilitated the immobilization of methanotrophic cells.
@highlight Methane degradation is higher in microbial gas phase reactions even without agitation.
@highlight Gel entrapment systems impaired methane degradation in the gas phase reaction.
@highlight Absence of an aqueous diffusion barrier improved methane degradation efficiency.
