 In this cross sectional study we retrospectively evaluated the files of 227 patients with myelofibrosis who underwent transplantation between 1994 and 2015 for relapse later than 5 years after allogeneic stem cell transplantation . A total of 94 patients who were alive and in remission at 5 years were identified with follow up of at least 5 years after SCT . Thirteen patients experienced late molecular or hematologic relapse at a median of 7.1 years while 81 patients did not experience relapse . Relapse patients received either donor lymphocyte infusion and or second transplantation . Of those 72.7 achieved again full donor cell chimerism and molecular remission and after a median follow up of 45 months the 3 year overall survival rates for patients with or without relapse were 90.9 77 to 100 and 98.8 respectively

@highlight Late relapse after 5 years occurs in about 14 of myelofibrosis patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation allo SCT .
@highlight For detection chimerism and minimal residual disease monitoring should be performed even beyond 5 years after allo SCT.
@highlight Most relapses can be successfully salvaged by donor lymphocyte infusion and or second allo SCT.
