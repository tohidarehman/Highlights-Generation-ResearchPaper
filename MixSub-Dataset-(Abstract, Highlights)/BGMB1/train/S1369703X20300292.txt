 Cadaverine also known as 1 5 diaminopentane is a biogenic amine particularly used for the synthesis of nylon . Cadaverine can be efficiently synthesized through decarboxylation of lysine in microorganisms . However the respective metabolic pathways in

@highlight Polyamine metabolic genes knockout strain was used for cadaverine production.
@highlight Lysine utilization efficiency is improved in the polyamine metabolic genes knockout strain.
@highlight Deletion strains showed higher tolerance to lysine and cadaverine.
@highlight Cultivation in fermenters can delay cell death and increase cadaverine production.
@highlight Glucose feeding strategy can overcome growth inhibition caused by lysine.
