 Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are plant root symbionts that continuously carry thousands of nuclei in their spores and hyphae . This unique cellular biology raises fundamental questions regarding their nuclear dynamics . This review aims to address these by synthesizing current knowledge of nuclear content and behavior in these ubiquitous soil fungi . Overall we find that that nuclear counts as well as the nuclei shape and organization vary drastically both within and among species in this group . By comparing these features with those of other fungi we highlight unique aspects of the AMF nuclear biology that require further attention . The potential implications of the observed nuclear variability for the biology and evolution of these widespread plant symbionts are discussed .

@highlight Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi AMF can carry thousands of nuclei in their cells at all times.
@highlight The number shape and frequency of these nuclei vary substantially among and within species.
@highlight Some AMF strains referred to as AMF dikaryons carry two distinct nuclear genotypes within their cells.
@highlight The frequency of two coexisting genotypes may vary across AMF dikaryons raising questions about its significance for mycorrhizal symbiosis.
