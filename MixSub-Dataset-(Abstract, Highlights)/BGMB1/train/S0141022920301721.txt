 Phytases are important industrial enzymes widely used as feed additives to hydrolyze phytate and release inorganic phosphate . In this study a phytase gene

@highlight A thermostable phytase PhyBL from
@highlight WHU was identified and characterized.
@highlight A variant G197C A358C with enhanced thermostability and proteolytic resistance was obtained by disulfide bond engineering.
@highlight The stabilization mechanism in the G197C A358C variant was revealed by molecular dynamics analyses.
@highlight The variant G197C A358C released more inorganic phosphorous from feedstuff than the WT at high temperatures.
