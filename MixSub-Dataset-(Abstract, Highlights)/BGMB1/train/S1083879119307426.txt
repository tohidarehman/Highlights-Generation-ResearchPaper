 Torque teno virus is a nonenveloped single stranded circular DNA virus of the family of Anelloviridae . The first contact with TTV usually occurs in early childhood followed by persistent infection in bone marrow and lymphocytes . Increased levels of TTV DNA are found in the serum in various states of immune deficiency . The objective of this study was to assess if monitoring of TTV viremia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a predictive marker for immune related clinical complications . In a retrospective study 2054 whole blood samples from 123 patients were tested for viral loads of TTV DNA by real time PCR within 345 days after allo HSCT . We enrolled all patients who underwent allo HSCT between September 2015 and April 2018 . Clinical and laboratory data were collected and statistically analyzed . Patients with an underlying lymphatic malignancy had significantly higher torque teno viral loads compared with patients with an underlying malignant myeloid disease

@highlight A multifactorial influence determines the level and kinetics of torque teno TT viral load.
@highlight Numerous new influencing factors were identified.
@highlight Significant differences were only visible after day 50 after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
@highlight Clinically relevant events showed no significant impact on TT viral load.
@highlight An early prognostic statement regarding the further clinical outcome is limited.
