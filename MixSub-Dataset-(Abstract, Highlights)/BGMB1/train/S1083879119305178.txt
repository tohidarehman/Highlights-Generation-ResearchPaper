 CD19 targeted chimeric antigen receptor modified T cell therapy has shown excellent antitumor activity in patients with relapsed refractory B cell malignancies with very encouraging response rates and outcomes . However the late effects following this therapy remain unknown . Here we report late adverse eventsdefined as starting or persisting beyond 90 days after CAR T cell infusionin patients who survived at least 1 year after therapy . The median duration of follow up was 28.1 months . At last follow up 73 of patients were still alive and 24 were in ongoing complete remission . The most common late adverse event was hypogammaglobulinemia replacement observed in 67 of the patients with available data . Infection density was .55 infection 100 days at risk . The majority of the infections were treated in the outpatient setting and 5 necessitated admission to the intensive care unit . Subsequent malignancies occurred in 15 of patients including 5 with myelodysplastic syndrome . Among patients with ongoing CR and with no MDS 16 experienced prolonged cytopenia requiring transfusions or growth factor support . Graft versus host disease occurred in 3 of 15 patients who had undergone previous allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation . Most of the late events observed in this cohort were not severe and many could be related to previous or subsequent therapies suggesting a safe long term profile of CD19 targeted CAR T cell immunotherapy .

@highlight Hypogammaglobulinemia was the most common late event.
@highlight Most infections were mild and treated in the outpatient setting.
@highlight Subsequent malignancies occurred in 15 of patients.
@highlight 16 of patients with ongoing complete remission and no myelodysplastic syndrome MDS experienced prolonged cytopenias.
@highlight Graft versus host disease occurred in 20 of patients who underwent previous allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
