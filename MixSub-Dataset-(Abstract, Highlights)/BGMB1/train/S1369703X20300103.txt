 Changes in microbial communities are observed during the long term operation of activated sludge systems employing an excess sludge reduction technology . Short term changes are also significant to confirm if key microbes are damaged but they have not been investigated due to the absence of an appropriate method . We report a methodology to identify prokaryotic and eukaryotic species damaged almost instantaneously by a high pressure jet device a cost effective sludge reduction technology . 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and microscopic inspection were implemented to identify damaged microorganisms . A sludge injection ratio

@highlight A sludge reduction method to damage and identify prokaryotes was proposed.
@highlight A high pressure jet device HPJD was applied for sludge reduction.
@highlight Eluted DNA from damaged bacteria was sequenced for taxonomic identification.
@highlight Nitrifying bacteria were not damaged by HPJD treatment.
@highlight Protozoa were severely damaged by HPJD treatment.
