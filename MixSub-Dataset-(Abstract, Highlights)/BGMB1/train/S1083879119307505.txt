 There have been sporadic reports of the development of delayed disease recurrence after bone marrow transplantation for severe aplastic anemia despite sustained majority or full donor chimerism . This is termed donor type aplasia . We describe the management and outcome of 11 pediatric patients from 8 institutions in Europe the United States and the Middle East who developed DTA at a mean of 35 months post transplant . These patients were initially transplanted at a mean age of 10.0 years 9 from matched sibling donors and 2 from matched unrelated donors . Attempts to treat DTA with varying combinations of additional immunosuppression failed . Ten patients have received a conditioned second transplant 9 from the same donor and 1 from a new matched unrelated donor . Aplasia has resolved in the remaining patient in response to ongoing eltrombopag therapy . All patients were alive at a mean of 92 months after a second transplant 6 are in complete remission but 4 suffered from second recurrent DTA at 16 to 129 months after retransplant and required further transplant therapy .

@highlight DTA is recurrent pancytopenia despite sustained majority donor chimerism after BMT for SAA.
@highlight Treatment with immunosuppressive therapy or stem cell boosts has not been effective.
@highlight Most patients required retransplantation from the same or an alternative donor.
@highlight Sibling retransplantation has sometimes been followed by further relapse after many years.
@highlight Eltrombopag may be of benefit in some patients.
