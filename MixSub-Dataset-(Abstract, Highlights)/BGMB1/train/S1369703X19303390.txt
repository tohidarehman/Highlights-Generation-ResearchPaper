 In this study the combined effect of dissolved oxygen and COD N on nitrogen removal as well as the corresponding mechanisms were investigated in aerated constructed wetlands . At each investigated COD N level the ammonium removal efficiency increased as DO concentration increased . However the highest total N removal efficiency occurred at different DO concentration at each COD N level . The results of functional gene analysis and cyclic N profile studies indicated that DO supply and COD N influence the N removal performance which is not only exert a direct effect on nitrification denitrification process but also change N removal pathway in intermittent aerated CWs . At a relatively high influent COD N of 20 the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification via nitrite was almost the exclusive N removal pathway at all investigated DO concentration . With the decrease of COD N from 20 to 2 at DO of 1.8 3.5 and 6.0mg L SND efficiency all decreased however its decreasing rate was much higher at relatively high DO level of 6.0mg L than that at DO levels of 1.8 and 3.5mg L. In comparison a simultaneously partial nitrification anammox and denitrification was established at DO of 0.8mg L along with reducing influent COD N .

@highlight DO and COD N had a combined effect on nitrogen removal pathway in aerated CWs.
@highlight SND was dominant N removal routine in a broad range of DO and COD N condition.
@highlight SNAD was dominant N removal pathway at low DO along with low COD N levels.
@highlight Optimal DO for TN removal should be adjusted according to influent COD N.
