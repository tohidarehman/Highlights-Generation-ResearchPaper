 In this work a novel and simple aptasensor based on the light addressable potentiometric sensor for Alpha fetoprotein detection was proposed . Due to the light addressable capability and potentiometric stability of LAPS the concentration of AFP can be determined by monitoring the potential shifts of LAPS which was caused by specific reaction between AFP aptamer and AFP . The AFP aptamer and gold nanoparticles were modified on the surface of LAPS chip to fabricate the biological sensing element of LAPS system . The AFP aptamer was used as molecules probe to recognize and capture AFP . Au NPs deposited on the LAPS surface could enlarge the surface area for the AFP aptamer immobilization and provide more sites for AFP aptamer to bind effectively with the target AFP and form more aptamer antigen complex . Under optimal conditions the potential shifts of the LAPS detection system were proportional to the AFP concentration in a wide linear range from 0.1100 g mL . The regression equation is Y 2.5892X 103.42778 with a correlation coefficient of 0.9959 and a detection limit of 92.0

@highlight A simple AFP aptasensor based on LAPS was developed successfully.
@highlight AFP aptasensor showed good linearity from 0.1100g mL with LOD of 92.0ng mL.
@highlight The aptasensor showed good specificity acceptable stability and simple operability.
@highlight Spiked human serum samples were evaluated with AFP recovery rate of 95.92 125.54 .
