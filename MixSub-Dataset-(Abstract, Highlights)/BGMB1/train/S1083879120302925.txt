 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is increasingly being applied globally . Cases in which healthy HSCT donors are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus are relatively common in areas where HBV is endemic . Recipients of stem cells from such hepatitis B surface antigen positive donors are at risk of viral infection and thus may develop HBV related hepatitis . Given the lack of standardized approach to minimizing the risk of such infections from HBsAg

@highlight We developed a strategy comprising antiviral treatment for detectable hepatitis B virus HBV DNA hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg positive donors passive immunity in HBsAg
@highlight recipients and prophylactic antiviral treatment of HBsAg
@highlight recipients to deal with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation allo HSCT accepting stem cells from HBsAg

@highlight Groups of recipients accepting cells from HBsAg
@highlight and HBsAg
@highlight donors showed a similar incidence of HBV related hepatitis.
@highlight The strategy may increase the treatment options for patients in need of allo HSCT in HBV endemic areas by expanding the donor pool to including HBsAg
@highlight individuals.
