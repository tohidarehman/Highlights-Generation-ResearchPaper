 To date there are no data focusing on outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with myelodysplastic myeloproliferative neoplasms unclassifiable . This study aimed to evaluate outcomes and prognostic factors in patients with MDS MPN U after allo HSCT using Japanese nationwide registry data . The primary endpoint was 3 year overall survival secondary endpoints included the cumulative incidence of relapse and nonrelapse mortality . We evaluated the prognostic factors for 3 year OS by univariate analysis using the log rank test . In our cohort of 86 patients with MDS MPN U we found a 3 year OS of 48.5 cumulative incidence of relapse of 23.7 and NRM of 26.3 . The 3 year OS was significantly worse in patients age 50 years compared with those age 50 years 38.1 versus 65.0

@highlight This study provides the first data on outcomes of allogeneic stem cell transplantation allo HSCT in patients with myelodysplastic myeloproliferative neoplasms unclassifiable MDS MPN U .
@highlight The 3 year overall survival OS was 48.5 in MDS MPN U patients undergoing allo HSCT.
@highlight Age and disease status were significantly associated with OS of MDS MPN U patients.
