 Microfibrous viscose rayon scaffolds functionalized with poly L lysine and laminin were used to culture pheochromocytoma cells in recirculation bioreactors under bulk laminar flow conditions . To determine the effects of continuous forced convective flow on cell viability growth and neurogenesis the cultures were exposed to fluid induced shear stresses of magnitude 2.710

@highlight PC12 cells were cultured in microfibrous scaffolds in bioreactors with continuous laminar fluid flow.
@highlight Cells were subjected to hydrodynamic shear stresses between 2.710
@highlight and 4.610
@highlight Pa without damage.
@highlight The integrity of protein functionalized scaffold fibers was maintained under flow.
@highlight Cell growth and neural differentiation were enhanced by fluid flow relative to static conditions.
@highlight Neural differentiation was greater in scaffold cultures than in surface monolayers.
