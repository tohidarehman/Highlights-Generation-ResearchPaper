 Vanillin is a value added compound used in wide range of areas including food beverage fragrance and pharmaceutical . It can be produced by reduction of vanillic acid a by product in lignin degradation processes or a competing component in the metabolic pathways in biological vanillin production . The reduction process is energetically disadvantageous due to the high activation energy in the reaction coordinates but can be overcome by an enzymatic strategy using carboxylic acid reductases . In this study fourteen CARs heterologously expressed in

@highlight Screening of highly active carboxylic acid reductases for vanillin synthesis.
@highlight The enzyme exhibited superior activity than of the previously reported ones.
@highlight Reaction conditions were examined to enhance the yield and purity of vanillin.
@highlight Structural basis for the high activity was analyzed in terms of enzyme active site.
