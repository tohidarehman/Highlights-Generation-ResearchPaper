 Severe aplastic anemia is most frequently immune mediated however rare inherited bone marrow failure syndromes such as Fanconi anemia may be causal and can present as aplastic anemia . FA is primarily an autosomal recessive disorder caused by the presence of 2 pathogenic variants in a single FA BRCA DNA repair pathway gene . Patients with SAA often undergo genetic testing during clinical evaluation that may identify single deleterious alleles in FA pathway genes . We quantified the rate of germline single deleterious alleles in 22 FA genes using both a general population database and in a cohort of patients with SAA undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation . The variants were classified as deleterious using in silico tools and database resources . We found similar rates of single deleterious alleles in FA genes in both groups . The presence of a single deleterious variant in a gene for FA in SAA HCT recipients did not affect the overall survival after HCT hazard ratio 0.85 95 CI 0.37 to 1.95

@highlight There is a similar rate of single deleterious Fanconi anemia FA gene variants in patients with severe aplastic anemia SAA and the general population.
@highlight In patients with SAA a single FA variant does not affect overall survival after hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT .
@highlight There is no increased risk of cancer in patients with SAA and a single FA gene variant after HCT.
