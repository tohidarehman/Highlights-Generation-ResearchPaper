 Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is associated with poor survival in older adults and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant with reduced intensity conditioning has been an increasingly used strategy in this population . At City of Hope we conducted a retrospective analysis of 72 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT with fludarabine and melphalan as the conditioning regimen between 2005 and 2018 from either a matched sibling or fully matched unrelated donor while in complete remission . Tacrolimus and sirolimus were used as graft versus host disease prophylaxis . Overall survival and progression free survival at 4 years post HCT were 58 and 44 respectively . The cumulative incidences of relapse progression and nonrelapse mortality at 4 years were 34 and 22 respectively . Patients with Philadelphia chromosomepositive ALL had a significantly lower cumulative incidence of relapse progression 20 versus 48 for patients with Ph negative status
