 Vacuoles are the largest membrane bounded organelles and have essential roles in plant growth and development but several important questions on the biogenesis and dynamics of lytic vacuoles remain . Here we summarize and discuss recent research and models of vacuole formation and propose with testable hypotheses that besides inherited vacuoles plant cells can also synthesize LVs

@highlight Recent studies have uncovered that plant vacuoles can be inherited from the mother cell as well as synthesized
@highlight Recent studies have suggested that vacuole biogenesis is a cell type specific process in plants and multiple models and mechanisms for vacuole biogenesis have been proposed.
@highlight Various populations and or groups of LVs are derived from different organelles and transport routes with unique functions in plant life.
@highlight Plant vacuoles constantly undergo dynamic morphological and quantitative changes in response to various growth and environmental signals.
@highlight The formation of the central vacuole is required for the maintenance of cell expansion.
@highlight Multiple approaches with advantages and limitations have been used to study vacuole formation and dynamics in plants.
