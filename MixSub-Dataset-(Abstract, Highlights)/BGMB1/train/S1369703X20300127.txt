 CdSe quantum dots are semiconductor materials and possess unique optical and electronic properties therefore being increasingly used in many fields . Biosynthesis of CdSe QDs has several advantages over the chemical synthesis route . In this study the CdSe QDs were biosynthesized using a yeast

@highlight CdSe quantum dots was synthesized by
@highlight PA 1 with small size and a narrow size distribution.
@highlight The concentration of Cd determine CdSe biosynthesis that is a detoxification strategy of Cd in
@highlight PA 1.
@highlight Bio synthesized CdSe quantum dots showed photocatalytic activity toward MG degradation under ultraviolet and visible light.
