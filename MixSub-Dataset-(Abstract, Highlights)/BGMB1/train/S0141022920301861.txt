 Earthworms are known as a source of a traditional medicine and bioactive components have been reported . We have reported that a fraction with molecular mass under 3kDa from the water extract of

@highlight A fraction U3EE of 3kDa or less from water extracts of earthworms inhibits amylase.
@highlight The inhibitors were identified as guanine Gua guanosine Guo and inosine Ino .
@highlight Gua and Guo were non competitive inhibitors and Ino was a mixed type one.
@highlight values of Gua Guo and Ino were 0.28 1.64 and 5.8mM respectively.
@highlight U3EE could be useful for pharmaceuticals and functional foods to suppress diabetes.
