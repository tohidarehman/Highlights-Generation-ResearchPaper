 This work aims to investigate optimization while running a Recycled Membrane Biofilm Reactor as a sustainable biological treatment for microcystins removal . For this purpose coupons from an end of life seawater reverse osmosis membrane module were extracted and conditioned . The MC degrading biofilm formation on this recycled membrane surface was carried out in a simulator cell on the laboratory scale to study the influence of air supply in this step . Firstly the main results obtained in this work are related to the biofilm formation . Confocal laser scanning microscope demonstrated that air supply provide a higher biomass maximum thickness and lower roughness coefficient . Secondly the air supply also stimulated the MC removal by shortening the lag phase and increasing the MC degradation rate . Finally the developed biofilm with air supply also was able to efficiently remove MC from two different types of polluted water surface natural water and synthetic reclaimed water . These results support the R MBfR technology for treating MC polluted water that could be used for different application especially in nutrient rich water . Therefore this study addresses the lack of sustainable technologies for water treatment while opening an alternative in sustainable solid waste management under a circular economy approach .

@highlight Biomass thickness and homogeneity of the biofilm were enhanced by air supply.
@highlight A stable biofilm with EPS production was achieved on the recycled membrane.
@highlight The air supply diminished the lag phase and increased the MC removal by the biofilm.
@highlight MC was more rapidly eliminated in nutrient rich water.
