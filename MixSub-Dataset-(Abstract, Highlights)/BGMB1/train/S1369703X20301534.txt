 Effective bioprocess development using Chinese hamster ovary cells as hosts is hampered by the limited understanding of cellular metabolism under process conditions in bioreactors . Systematic tools such as genome scale models have been developed but their value has not been satisfactorily demonstrated and exploited for process development . In this study we proposed a method using a genome scale model to analyze existing process studies for bioprocess optimization . First we used existing industrial CHO cell culture experiments to systematically gain metabolic insights for bioprocess development . Two fed batch cultures using the same cell line and process resulted in different titers by supplementing two different types of feed media . A genome scale model was applied to calculate fluxomics from extracellular metabolomics and then the metabolic differences were further analyzed through pathway analysis between these two cell culture conditions . Transcriptomics data from RNA Seq were employed at this point for comparison and found to be consistent in pathway analysis with the flux analysis results . At the second stage we developed a modeling based approach for media optimization to increase antibody production based on the understanding from the first stage . The new design was tested
