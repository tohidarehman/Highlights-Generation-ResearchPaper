 Membrane aerated biofilm reactors are energy efficient wastewater treatment technologies that utilize gas permeable membranes for aeration and biofilm attachment . In this study a rotating flat sheet MABR was developed as a novel experimental facility to control the local flow velocities by considering the distance from the rotational center in addition to the rotational speed . The MABRs were acclimated under different flow velocities to examine their impacts on the overall performance and the microbial community . The COD removal rates increased with the flow velocity when the latter was less than approximately 1 cm s and then plateaued 3035 gm

@highlight A novel rotating MABR for examining the effect of the flow velocity was developed.
@highlight The COD removal was almost constant at 0.77 cm s of the aclimated flow velocities.
@highlight Lower flow velocities 1 cm s can be a dominant limiting factor for the removal.
@highlight The biofilm was classified into aerobic compact and anaerobic ragged layers.
@highlight The flow conditions mainly affected the ratio of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
