 Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant may improve long term multiple myeloma control through the graft versus myeloma effect . The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network 0102 trial was a biologic assignment trial comparing tandem autologous transplant versus autologous followed by reduced intensity allogeneic transplant in patients with newly diagnosed MM with standard risk or high risk n 85

@highlight Long term follow up of auto auto versus auto allo in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients confirms significant and durable reduction in risk of relapse with the auto allo approach.
@highlight Auto allo transplant is associated with better 6 year PFS for high risk patients.
@highlight Patients who relapsed after auto allo had longer postrelapse survival than patients who relapsed after auto auto transplant.
