 Under high irradiance light becomes dangerous for photosynthetic organisms and they must protect themselves . Cyanobacteria have developed a simple mechanism involving a photoactive soluble carotenoid protein the orange carotenoid protein which increases thermal dissipation of excess energy by interacting with the cyanobacterial antenna the phycobilisome . Here we summarize our knowledge of the OCP related photoprotective mechanism including the remarkable progress that has been achieved in recent years on OCP photoactivation and interaction with phycobilisomes as well as with the fluorescence recovery protein which is necessary to end photoprotection . A recently discovered unique mechanism of carotenoid transfer between soluble proteins related to OCP is also described .

@highlight The orange carotenoid protein OCP is a blue light photoactive protein involved in cyanobacterial photoprotection. OCP binds one keto carotenoid which spans both C and N terminal OCP domains CTD and NTD .
@highlight Upon photoactivation the carotenoid is translocated to the NTD and the color of the protein changes to red. Then the domains are separated and OCP becomes active. The red OCP binds to the phycobilisome inducing thermal dissipation of excess energy.
@highlight Paralogs of the OCP domains namely CTDH CTD like and HCP NTD like are also carotenoid proteins. The principal role of CTDH is to transport the carotenoid from the membrane to HCP and perhaps to OCP. HCPs are excellent singlet oxygen quenchers. Only one subfamily is able to interact with the phycobilisome.
@highlight A unique mechanism of carotenoid transfer between soluble proteins has been discovered and characterized.
