 Central venous catheters are extensively used in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation . In these patients CVC are placed routinely either via the internal jugular vein or the subclavian vein . Purpose of this study was to systematically analyze complications of CVC at different insertion sites in HCT recipients . In this retrospective analysis all consecutive patients who received a CVC due to allogeneic HCT at our institution between January 2011 and June 2013 were included . Three lumen standard nontunneled CVCs were placed via either the IJV or the SCV . Study endpoints were time to local inflammation at the insertion site time to fever time to a combined endpoint of inflammation and fever central line associated bloodstream infection duration of catheterization catheter lumen obstruction deep vein thrombosis pneumothorax and catheter related death . The median duration of catheterization per CVC was almost identical for the IJV and SCV sites 18 days versus 17 days

@highlight Rates of central line associated bloodstream infections are the same in internal jugular vein IJV and subclavian vein SCV central venous catheters CVCs after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT .
@highlight The strongest risk factor for local inflammation or fever is 6 neutropenic CVC days.
@highlight The time to local inflammation is longer with CVCs placed in the IJV.
@highlight CVC placement in the SCV is not superior to placement in the IJV in allogeneic HCT.
@highlight A clear recommendation for a preferred CVC insertion site is not supported in allogeneic HCT.
