 fludarabine with intravenous busulfan at doses of 3.2 mg kg or 6.4 mg kg . Hepatic veno occlusive disease sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is a serious complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation that is felt to be triggered at least in part by damage to the liver sinusoidal endothelium from cytotoxic conditioning regimens . Accordingly the incidence of VOD SOS after reduced intensity conditioning HCT is low compared with myeloablative transplantation and the natural history risk factors and outcomes of VOD SOS after RIC have not been well characterized . We retrospectively reviewed 1583 consecutive patients receiving RIC HCT at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute between 2007 and 2017 and ascertained 26 cases of VOD SOS . The median day of VOD SOS onset was 26 days and the cumulative incidence at day 50 was 1.6 1.1 to 2.4 . Day 100 nonrelapse mortality rate was 23 in the VOD SOS cohort compared with 6.4 in patients without VOD SOS

@highlight Veno occlusive disease sinusoidal obstruction syndrome VOD SOS is rare after reduced intensity conditioning RIC transplantation with a cumulative incidence of 1.6 in our large modern cohort.
@highlight VOD SOS continues to be associated with a high nonrelapse mortality NRM in our cohort day 100 NRM was 23 in patients with VOD SOS compared with 6.4 in patients without VOD SOS.
@highlight VOD SOS in RIC patients often does not meet classical Baltimore Seattle criteria and has a later onset a lower peak bilirubin and better survival than VOD SOS in patients with myeloablative conditioning.
@highlight VOD SOS after RIC is strongly associated with higher dose busulfan 6.4 versus 3.2 mg kg in the RIC regimen and use of sirolimus in the graft versus host disease prophylaxis regimen.
