 At present tertiary structure discovery growth rate is lagging far behind discovery of primary structure . The prediction of protein structural class using Machine Learning techniques can help reduce this gap . The Structural Classification of Protein Extended is latest and largest dataset available at present . The protein sequences with less than 40 identity to each other are used for predicting and SCOPe classes . The sensitive features are extracted from primary and secondary structure representations of Proteins . Features are extracted experimentally from secondary structure with respect to its frequency pitch and spatial arrangements . Primary structure based features contain species information for a protein sequence . The species parameters are further validated with uniref100 dataset using TaxId . As it is known protein tertiary structure is manifestation of function . Functional differences are observed in species . Hence the species are expected to have strong correlations with structural class which is discovered in current work . It enhances prediction accuracy by 7 10 . The subset of SCOPe 2.07 is trained using 65 dimensional feature vector using Random Forest classifier . The test result for the rest of the set gives consistent accuracy of better than 95 . The accuracy achieved on benchmark datasets ASTRAL 1.73 25PDB and FC699 is better than 86 91 and 97 respectively which is best reported to our knowledge .
