 Azithromycin exposure during the early phase of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation has been associated with an increased incidence of hematologic relapse . We assessed the impact of azithromycin exposure on the occurrence of relapse or new subsequent neoplasm in patients with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after HCT who are commonly treated with azithromycin alone or in combination with other agents . In a retrospective study of patients with BOS from 2 large allograft centers the effect of azithromycin exposure on the risk of relapse or SN was estimated from a Cox model with a time dependent variable for treatment initiation . The Cox model was adjusted on time fixed covariates measured at cohort entry selected for their potential prognostic value . Similar models were used to assess the exposure effect on the cause specific hazard of relapse SN and death free of those events . Sensitivity analyses were performed using propensity score matching . Among 316 patients 227 were exposed to azithromycin after BOS diagnosis . The corresponding adjusted hazard ratio in patients exposed to azithromycin versus unexposed was 1.51 0.90 to 2.55 for relapse or SN 0.82 for relapse and 2.00 for SN . Patients exposed to azithromycin had a significantly lower cause specific hazard of death free of neoplasm and relapse . In conclusion exposure to azithromycin after BOS after HCT was associated with an increased risk of SN but not relapse .

@highlight Azithromycin is associated with increased second cancers in bronchiolitis obliterans.
@highlight Azithromycin is not associated with increased relapse in bronchiolitis obliterans.
@highlight There is a decreased cause specific hazard of death free of malignancy with azithromycin exposure.
