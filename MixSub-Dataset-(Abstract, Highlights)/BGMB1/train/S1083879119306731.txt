 Killer immunoglobulin like receptor and KIR ligand interactions play an important role in natural killer cell mediated graft versus leukemia effect following hematopoietic cell transplantation . However there is considerable heterogeneity in the KIR gene and KIRL content in individuals making it difficult to estimate the full clinical impact of NK cell reconstitution following HCT . Here we present a novel adaptive mathematical model designed to quantify these interactions to better assess the influence of NK cell mediated alloreactivity on transplant outcomes . Ninety eight HLA matched unrelated donor HCT recipients were studied retrospectively . The KIR KIRL interactions were quantified using a system of matrix equations . Unit values were ascribed to each KIR KIRL interaction and the directionality of interactions was denoted by either a positive or negative symbol these interactions were then summed . The absolute values of both the missing KIRL and inhibitory KIR KIRL interactions were significantly associated with overall survival and relapse . These score components were initially used to develop a weighted score and subsequently a simplified nonweighted KIR KIRL interaction score . Increased w KIR score and IM KIR score were predictive of all cause mortality and relapse .37

@highlight An adaptive mathematical model has been developed to quantify killer immunoglobulin like receptor KIR KIR ligand KIRL interactions.
@highlight The magnitude of inhibitory and missing KIR KIRL interactions predicts overall survival and relapse risk following HLA matched unrelated donor URD hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT .
@highlight Cumulative known KIR KIRL interactions predict clinical outcomes after URD HCT.
@highlight High inhibitory KIR KIRL interaction scores correlates with robust natural killer cell recovery after URD HCT.
