 Elastin like polypeptides are stimulusresponsive protein based biopolymers that exhibit phase transition behavior . By joining them to synthetic phytochelatin ECELP fusion proteins with temperature sensitivity and metal binding functionality were generated to remove heavy metal ions biologically . Three different EC domains EC

@highlight The cadmium binding affinity of EC ELP fusion protein was examined by comparing the turbidity profiles to three other heavy metal ions.
@highlight The amount of Cd
@highlight adsorbed to the ECELP fusion proteins and the resulting T
@highlight changes were explored according to the number of EC repeating units.
@highlight We observed whether our ECELP fusion proteins could be reused after removing the adsorbed cadmium ions.
