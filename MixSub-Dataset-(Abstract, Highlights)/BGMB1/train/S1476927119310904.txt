 Preterm birth defined as a delivery before 37 weeks gestation continues to affect 815 of all pregnancies and is associated with significant neonatal morbidity and mortality . Effective prediction of timing of delivery among women identified to be at significant risk for preterm birth would allow proper implementation of prophylactic therapeutic interventions . This paper aims first to develop a model that acts as a decision support system for pregnant women at high risk of delivering prematurely before having cervical cerclage . The model will predict whether the pregnancy will continue beyond 26 weeks gestation and the potential value of adding the cerclage in prolonging the pregnancy . The second aim is to develop a model that predicts the timing of spontaneous delivery in this high risk cohort after cerclage . The model will help treating physicians to define the chronology of management in relation to the risk of preterm birth reducing the neonatal complications associated with it . Data from 274 pregnancies managed with cervical cerclage were included . 29 of the procedures involved multiple pregnancies . To build the first model a data balancing technique called SMOTE was applied to overcome the problem of highly imbalanced class distribution in the dataset . After that four classification models namely Decision Tree Random Forest K Nearest Neighbors
