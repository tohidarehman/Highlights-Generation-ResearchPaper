 a homofermentative lactic acid bacterium is widely applied in fermentation industry . In this study a reductive TCA pathway was constructed in

@highlight was engineered with a rTCA pathway for the synthesis of malate.
@highlight The rTCA pathway was established by overexpressing
@highlight and
@highlight in
@highlight Competitive metabolic pathways were disrupted to improve the biosynthesis of malate.
@highlight Promoter engineering improved the titer of malate from 3.13g L to 5.75g L.
@highlight Fed batch fermentation further improved the titer of malate to 14.1g L in
