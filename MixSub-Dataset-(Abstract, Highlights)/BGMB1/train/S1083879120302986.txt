 Accumulating evidence points toward a protective role of intestinal microbiota diversity in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation . The purpose of this systematic review and meta analysis is to determine the effect of antibiotic mediated disruption of microbiota on main allo HCT outcomes treatment related mortality overall survival . Following literature search 2 reviewers screened eligible studies and assessed risk of bias . Meta analysis was performed using Review Manager Software . Among 443 screened references 18 were eligible for meta analysis . In studies with genomic markers grade II to IV acute GVHD was significantly reduced in patients not receiving gut decontamination 1.56 95 confidence interval 1.20 to 2.04 . In subgroup analysis prophylaxis with systemic antibiotics conferred an increased risk of acute GVHD . When we incorporated RoB we found a positive correlation of intestinal GVHD with GD . Patients with higher microbiota diversity presented increased OS 1.58 95 CI 1.19 to 2.09 and lower TRM . Our findings confirm that GD and prophylaxis with systemic antibiotics increase acute and intestinal GVHD . Importantly our meta analysis was the first to show a significant effect of microbiota diversity on TRM and OS .

@highlight This is the first meta analysis on impact of antibiotic related microbiota disruption on allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation outcomes.
@highlight Grade II to IV acute and intestinal graft versus host disease GVHD was reduced in patients not receiving gut decontamination.
@highlight Prophylaxis with systemic antibiotics conferred an increased risk of acute GVHD.
@highlight Higher microbiota diversity was related to higher overall survival and lower treatment related mortality.
@highlight Further trials using standardized microbiota scores will improve certainty in our estimates.
