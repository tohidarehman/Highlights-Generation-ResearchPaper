 Species dependent mechanisms of morphological development affect filamentous fungi cultivations . In order to influence fungal morphology microparticle enhanced cultivations were used towards four species exhibiting various mechanisms of morphology formation a spore agglomerative

@highlight Morphological study of four fungal species in stirred tank bioreactors.
