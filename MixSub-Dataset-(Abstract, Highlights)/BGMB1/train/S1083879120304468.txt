 Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited hemoglobinopathy . Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the sole curative therapy for SCD but few patients will have a matched sibling donor . Patients with SCD are mostly of African origin and thus are less likely to find a matched unrelated donor in international registries . Using HaploStats we estimated HLA haplotypes for 185 patients with SCD centers and classified the ethnic origin of haplotypes . Then we assessed the probability of finding an HLA matched unrelated adult donor considering loci A B and DRB1 in international registries . Most haplotypes were African but Brazilians showed a greater ethnic admixture than EBMT patients . Nevertheless the chance of finding at least one 6 6 potential allelic donor was 47 for both groups . Most potential allelic donors were from the US National Marrow Donor Program registry and from the Brazilian REDOME donor registry . Although the probability of finding a donor is higher than previously reported strategies are needed to improve ethnic diversity in registries . Moreover predicting the likelihood of having an MUD might influence SCD management .

@highlight Patients with sickle cell disease SCD belong to ethnic groups underrepresented in donor registries.
@highlight We assessed chances of finding a matched unrelated donor by geographical origin.
@highlight Brazilian patients showed a greater genetic admixture than European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation patients.
@highlight However chances of having a potential allelic matched unrelated donor were equal in the 2 groups 47 .
@highlight Further strategies to improve donor representativity are warranted in the SCD setting.
