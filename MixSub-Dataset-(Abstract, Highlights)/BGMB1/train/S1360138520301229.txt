 Cannabis has been used as a medicine for millennia . Crude extracts of cannabis inflorescence contain numerous phytomolecules including phytocannabinoids terpenes and flavonoids . Combinations of phytomolecules have been recently established as superior to the use of single molecules in medical treatment owing to the entourage effect . Two types of entourage effects are defined intra entourage resulting from interactions among phytocannabinoids or terpenes and inter entourage attributed to interactions between phytocannabinoids and terpenes . It is suggested that the phytomolecule assemblages found in cannabis chemovars today derive from selective breeding during ancient cultivation . We propose that the current cannabis chemotaxonomy should be redefined according to chemical content and medicinal activity . In parallel combinations of phytomolecules that exhibit entourage activity should be explored further for future drug development .

@highlight Cannabis has been used for millennia by humanity for social ritual and medical purposes. Humans bred and selected for cannabis strains based on their needs.
@highlight Today patients are treated by cannabis strains without a clear definition of activity or known chemical content.
@highlight strain taxonomy is based on the content of two phytocannabinoids only 
@highlight  tetrahydrocannabinolic acid THCA and cannabidiolic acid CBDA .
@highlight produces hundreds of phytomolecules including phytocannabinoids terpenes and flavonoids.
@highlight Some cannabis phytomolecules interact causing enhanced biological activity. Defining this phenomenon known as the entourage effect is one of the leading challenges in the field of research.
