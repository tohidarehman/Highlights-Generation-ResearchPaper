 Pectin lyase was immobilized on glutaraldehyde supports at low ionic strength at pH 5 6.5 or 8 and later incubated at pH 8 for 48h . The activity recovery of the biocatalysts versus pectin was quite low under 10 for all of the immobilized biocatalyst at 20C . However a high stabilization was found when the enzyme was immobilized at pH 5 . This biocatalyst increased the activity versus pectin in an almost exponential way when temperature increased until reach the maximum temperature used in the study conditions where the free enzyme was almost inactive . The immobilized biocatalyst was also active even at pH 9 where the free enzyme was fully inactive . This biocatalyst could be reused for pectin hydrolysis 5 times for 72h reaction cycles at 40C maintaining more than 90 of the initial activity .

@highlight Immobilization of pectin lyase on glutaraldehyde activated supports may be performed at different pH values.
@highlight Optimal PL stability was found when the enzyme was immobilized at pH 5.
@highlight Immobilized preparation increased the activity even until 90C the free enzyme is almost inactive.
@highlight Optimal preparation is active even at pH 9 the free enzyme is fully inactive.
@highlight The biocatalyst can be reused several 72h cycles at 40C.
