 The disulfide bridge is a very important part of the peptide chain and plays an important role in stabilizing the protein structure and maintaining its active function . One hundred and fourteen potential disulfide bridges were determined by Disulfide by Design and 4 disulfide bridges were constructed for the purpose of obtaining new enzyme species with high thermotolerance . High thermotolerance is achieved by increasing the number of hydrogen bonds between amino acids . The optimum temperatures of mutant L838C V887C and A948C A1013C were improved by 10C compared to that of the original enzyme which was beneficial to reduce the viscosity of the reaction system . Some of the mutations resulted in the alteration of catalytic specificity and the products D739C F932C and A948C A1013C catalyzed synthesis of dextran containing a new glycosidic linkage and glycosidic linkage . This study may provide information valuable for increasing the reaction temperature of recombinant dextransucrase . The molecular docking study presents a plausible explanation for reaction specificity alteration and optimum temperature improvement for the mutants .
