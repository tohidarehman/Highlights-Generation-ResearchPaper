 As an important renewable resource lignin has been found difficult to utilize due to its intrinsic heterogeneity . To meet the increasing demand for lignin valorization in this study we develop novel pathways for coumarins biosynthesis from lignin . Feruloyl CoA 6 hydroxylase and 4 coumarate CoA ligase are expressed in budding yeast to produce scopoletin from ferulic acid which is one of the three main monomers of lignin . Further more the fusion expression of these two genes enhances the concentration of scopoletin and the fusion expression with the linker

@highlight Yeast was engineered to produce scopoletin from lignin hydrolysate.
@highlight Fraxetin was synthesized from scopoletin and ferulic acid.
@highlight F6H1 showed substance specificity in hydroxylation.
@highlight Fusion expression of key enzymes improved scopoletin production.
