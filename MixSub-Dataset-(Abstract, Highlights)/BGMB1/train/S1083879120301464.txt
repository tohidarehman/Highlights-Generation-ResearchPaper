 Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation has the capacity to cure numerous malignant and nonmalignant disorders . A dreaded complication is graft failure as it puts patients at high risk of infection and disease relapse . There are few contemporary data on the risks outcomes and economic burden of GF in pediatric patients . In this study we address this gap by focusing on 14 years of transplant at our single center for which data are compared in 2 time periods 2005 to 2010 and 2011 to 2018 . In the 290 patients studied the median age was 9.33 years and 50.3 had malignant versus nonmalignant disease . Cell source included bone marrow cord blood unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cells and CD34 selected PBSCs . Twenty one percent of patients had reduced intensity conditioning and 54.8 of transplants were fully HLA matched . Most patients received serotherapy with rabbit anti thymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab . The incidence of neutropenic and non neutropenic GF was 6.6 and 3.8 respectively . Multivariate analysis demonstrated alemtuzumab 6.256

@highlight Graft failure was associated with alemtuzumab reduced intensity conditioning and unrelated donor grafts.
@highlight Intermediate scheduling of alemtuzumab had the highest incidence of graft failure.
@highlight Costs and outcomes of graft failure have improved over time but remain a significant burden.
