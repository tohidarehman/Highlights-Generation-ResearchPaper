 Expansion of the human population demands a significant increase in cereal production . The main component of cereal grains is endosperm a body of starchy endosperm cells surrounded by aleurone cells with transfer cells at the base and embryo surrounding cells adjacent to the embryo . The data reviewed here emphasize the modular nature of endosperm by first suggesting that sucrose promotes development of the fertilized triploid endosperm cell . Next that the basal syncytial endosperm responds to glucose by turning on TC development . The default endosperm cell fate is SE and ESR differentiation is likely activated by signaling from the embryo . Cells on the exterior surface of the endosperm are specified as AL cells .

@highlight The initial state of the grass endosperm may have been a body of starchy endosperm SE cells the three other cell types aleurone AL transfer cells TC and embryo surrounding cells ESR evolving at later stages.
@highlight TC and possibly also ESR are initiated by signals from outside of the endosperm.
@highlight Apart from the external initiation of TC and ESR the developmental control of endosperm is largely endosperm autonomous.
@highlight SE and AL differentiation proceeds similarly

@highlight on medium with high sucrose but not on low sucrose.
@highlight Transcriptome analysis has identified most if not all genes expressed in the endosperm of the major cereal species.
