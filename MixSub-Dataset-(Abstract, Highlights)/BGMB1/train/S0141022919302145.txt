 Soybean is a most promising sustainable protein source for feed and food to help meet the protein demand of the rapidly rising global population . To enrich soy protein the environment friendly enzymatic processing requires multiple carbohydrases including cellulase xylanase pectinase galactosidase and sucrase . Besides enriched protein the processing adds value by generating monosaccharides that are ready feedstock for biofuel bioproducts .

@highlight Improved carbohydrase production by
@highlight for cheap soy meal processing.
@highlight Arrhenius law activation energy for growth determined as 28.7kcal mol.
@highlight Fastest doubling time 2.1h at 30C but higher enzyme yield at 25C.
@highlight pH 2.6 limited pectinase synthesis rapid pectinase degradation at pH 5.5 C limitation.
@highlight  Galactosidase production relied on inducers from hydrolysis by pectinase.
