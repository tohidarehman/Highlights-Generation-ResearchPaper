 The potential of Forward Osmosis technology to up concentrate succinic acid lactic acid and ethanol from fermentation broths was investigated . The aforementioned molecules were obtained from two residual resources

@highlight Succinic acid lactic acid and ethanol were produced from residual resources.
@highlight Forward osmosis was examined to up concentrate fermentation products.
@highlight Succinic acid concentration factor of 5.0 was achieved.
@highlight Best results were obtained with NaCl 5.0M as draw solution.
@highlight Water removals of up to 85 were attained.
