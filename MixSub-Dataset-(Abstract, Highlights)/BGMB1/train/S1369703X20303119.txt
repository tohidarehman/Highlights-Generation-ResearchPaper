 Virus like particles are hollow nanoparticles composed of recombinant viral surface proteins without a virus genome . In the present study we investigated the production of influenza VLPs using recombinant insect cells . DNA fragments encoding influenza A virus hemagglutinin and matrix protein 1 were cloned with the

@highlight Influenza A virus like particles VLPs were produced using recombinant insect cells.
@highlight VLPs were produced using insect cells as host cells without using a baculovirus.
@highlight A secretory form of VLPs consists of hemagglutinin and matrix protein 1.
@highlight The VLP productivity is comparable to that of the baculovirusinsect cell system.
