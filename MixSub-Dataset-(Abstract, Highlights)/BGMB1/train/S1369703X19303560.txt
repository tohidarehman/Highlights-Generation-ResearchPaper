 When feeding enzymes are consumed by livestock and poultry the stomach is the first organ to come in contact with feeding enzymes . They will face major hazards acidolysis and enzymatic hydrolysis . Therefore it is very important to improve the tolerance of feed enzymes to the gastric juice such as pepsin . However the hydrolysis of amino acids by pepsin is not specific so improving the resistance of enzymes to pepsin is a great challenge . In this paper we have selected cellulase E4 isolated from

@highlight Inhibition of the transition state formation can improve the pepsin resistance of cellusase E4.
@highlight Select proper mutable sites based on the hydrolysis preference of pepsin and rational design.
@highlight The pepsin resistance of mutants were improved without affecting the enzymology.
@highlight The universality of methods are fit to improve the tolerance of other protein.
