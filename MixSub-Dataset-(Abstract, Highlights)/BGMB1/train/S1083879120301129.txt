 Disease relapse is the most common cause of therapy failure in patients with non Hodgkin lymphoma undergoing reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation . It is not known whether or not increasing total body irradiation dose from 2 to 4 Gy in a RIC platform can provide improved disease control without increasing nonrelapse mortality . Using the Center for International Blood Marrow Transplant Research database we evaluated the outcomes of patients with NHL receiving RIC allo HCT with either fludarabine 2 Gy TBI versus Flu 4 Gy TBI . In the CIBMTR registry 413 adult patients with NHL underwent a first allo HCT using either a matched related or unrelated donor between 2008 and 2017 using a RIC regimen with either Flu 2 Gy TBI or Flu 4 Gy TBI . The primary endpoint was overall survival . Secondary endpoints included acute and chronic graft versus host disease NRM relapse progression and progression free survival . At baseline the Flu 2 Gy TBI cohort had significantly fewer patients with Karnofsky performance status 90 and significantly more patients had a higher HCT comorbidity index . On multivariate analysis the 2 conditioning cohorts were not significantly different in terms of risk of grade 3 to 4 aGVHD or cGVHD . Compared to Flu 2 Gy TBI the Flu 4 Gy TBI conditioning was associated with a significantly higher risk of NRM 1.79 95 confidence interval 1.11 to 2.89

@highlight Augmentation of total body irradiation TBI dose from 2 to 4 Gy for patients with non Hodgkin lymphoma undergoing reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is associated with higher nonrelapse mortality and inferior overall survival.
@highlight Higher dose of TBI does not result in improved disease control.
