 The internet can be a valuable tool in delivering survivorship care to hematopoietic cell transplantation cancer survivors . We describe the reach of INSPIRE an Internet and social media based randomized controlled trial to address healthcare and psychosocial needs of HCT survivors . All survivors 2 10 years after HCT for hematologic malignancy or myelodysplasia from 6 transplantation centers in the US were approached by mail and follow up calls . Eligible participants had access to the Internet an email address and did not have active disease in the past 2 years . We used logistic regression to determine characteristics of eligible survivors who were more or less likely to enroll . Of 2578 eligible HCT survivors 1065 enrolled in the study . The mean age of enrollees was 56.3 12.6 years 52 were male and 94 were white . Survivors less likely to enroll included those who were male age 40 years and who received an autologous transplant all
