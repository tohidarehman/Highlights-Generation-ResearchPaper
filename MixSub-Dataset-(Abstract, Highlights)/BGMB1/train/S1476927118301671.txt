 The genetic information encoded in structural genes is decoded by an intracellular process called gene expression . This mechanism is regulated by epigenetic processes such as histone acetylation . Histone acetylation which happens in nucleosomes exposes DNA to transcription factors . Therefore the correlation between histone acetylation and gene expression has been assessed as a fundamental issue in many previous studies . In the proposed research we investigate which marks of histone acetylation are informative and which ones are redundant in the vicinity of SP1 transcription factor binding sites in human CD4 T cell . To achieve this we use information theory methods . Subsequently we apply a multilayer perceptron neural network to show that the selected histone acetylation marks by information theory methods are sufficiently informative . Finally we use the neural network to predict binding sites of 17 other transcription factors on chromosomes 1 and 2 . The results suggest that information conveyed by the selected histone acetylation marks are equivalent to that of all 18 marks associated with SP1 transcription factor binding sites on chromosome 1 . Furthermore almost 91.75 of SP1 binding sites of chromosome 2 are predicted by the selected histone acetylation marks while all 18 marks predict 90.56 correctly . Moreover the selected histone acetylation marks are efficient at predicting 17 other types of transcription factor binding sites .
