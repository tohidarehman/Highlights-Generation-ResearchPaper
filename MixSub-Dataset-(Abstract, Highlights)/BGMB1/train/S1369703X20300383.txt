 Cultivating microalgae with wastewater offers a dual beneficial strategy for the removal of nutrients coupled with the accumulation of valuable bioproducts . However the dynamic mass flow in heterotrophic algal growth is far less known than autotrophic mode . This study particularly provided a new insight into this process by modelling heterotrophic

@highlight Heterotrophic microalgae culture in wastewater was modelled for global optimization.
@highlight The kinetic model correlates extra intra cellular C N and P for the first time.
@highlight Monod and Luedeking Piret expressions form the basis of the proposed model.
@highlight Carbohydrate and lipid are main algal storage components produced in wastewater.
@highlight Simulation R
@highlight 0.9 and half saturation constants consist with literature.
