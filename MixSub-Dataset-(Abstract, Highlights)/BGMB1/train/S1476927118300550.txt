 Hepatitis C Virus infection is a major public health concern across the globe . At present direct acting antivirals are the treatment of choice . However the long term effect of this therapy has yet to be ascertained . Previously fluoroquinolones have been reported to inhibit HCV replication by targeting NS3 protein . Therefore it is logical to hypothesize that the natural analogs of fluoroquinolones will exhibit NS3 inhibitory activity with substantially lesser side effects . In this study we tested the application of a recently devised integrated In our analysis we were able to shortlist 18 active natural analogs out of 10 399 that shared physicochemical properties with the template drugs . These analogs showed comparable binding efficacy with fluoroquinolones in targeting 32 amino acids in the HCV NS3 active site that are crucial for NS3 activity . Our approach had around 80 sensitivity and 70 specificity in identifying physicochemically similar analogs of fluoroquinolones . Our current data suggest that our approach can be efficiently applied to identify putative HCV drug inhibitors that can be taken for

@highlight Hepatitis C Virus HCV infection is a major public health concern across the globe.
