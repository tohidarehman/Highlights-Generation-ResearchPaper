 To review the updated trends of national practice and outcomes in transplantation to treat myelofibrosis we retrospectively evaluated 142 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for primary or secondary MF at an Australian New Zealand transplantation center between 2006 and 2017 . The median duration of follow up was 51.8 months . The median age at allo HSCT was 56 years . Fifty two percent of the patients had HLA identical sibling donors and 45 had matched unrelated donors . Conditioning regimens were predominantly reduced intensity . Before transplantation 16 of the patients had undergone splenectomy or splenic irradiation and 38 received JAK inhibitor therapy .

@highlight We report updated trends in allogeneic stem cell transplantation for myelofibrosis in Australasia.
@highlight We identify pretransplantation factors influencing post transplantation outcomes.
@highlight There has been limited uptake of molecular genomic technology in Australasia.
@highlight Long term outcomes of patients reported in the previous ABMTRR study are examined.
