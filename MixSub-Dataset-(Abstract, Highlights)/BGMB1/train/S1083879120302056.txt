 Hematopoietic cell transplantation is physically and psychologically challenging potentially exposing patients to quality of life impairments . Adolescent and young adults are a vulnerable cohort facing multiple hurdles due to dynamic changes in several aspects of their lives . The AYA population may be particularly prone to QoL issues during HCT . We hypothesized that due to the unique psychosocial challenges faced by AYAs they would have an inferior quality of life . We studied QoL differences between AYA and older adult allogeneic HCT recipients before and after HCT . Additionally we determined if pre HCT QoL for AYA transplant recipients changed over time . QoL data were collected prospectively before and after transplant on 431 recipients aged 15 to 60 years from June 2003 through December 2017 using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Bone Marrow Transplantation questionnaire . Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to assess differences among age groups . Pearson correlation

@highlight Adolescent and young adults AYAs had comparable quality of life QoL compared to older adults during the hematopoietic cell transplantation period.
@highlight AYAs have improved QoL over time during transplant since 2003.
@highlight Improvements in AYA QoL are driven by a domain that mainly addressed psychosocial concerns.
