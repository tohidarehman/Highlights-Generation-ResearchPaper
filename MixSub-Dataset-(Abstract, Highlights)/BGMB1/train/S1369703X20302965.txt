 Chinese hamster ovary cells are commonly used in the biopharmaceutical industry for production of biotherapeutics and process improvements that increase their productivity can save time and reduce costs . We describe a novel method to enhance cellular productivity through adding nitric oxide . NO increased specific productivity by 142 resulting in higher antibody titers by an average of 17 compared to the conventional process . Product quality analysis showed comparable profiles between the NO treated and control cell cultures with NO causing a minor reduction of fucose content . NO sparging enhanced productivity by altering cell growth profiles inducing an oxidative stress response and delaying apoptosis .

@highlight This paper used nitric oxide to increase specific productivity in a CHO process.
@highlight Nitric oxide improved late day specific productivity by 142 compared with control.
@highlight Nitric oxide increased titers by 17 compared with control.
@highlight Comparable product qualities were observed whether nitric oxide was added or not.
@highlight The mechanism was through induction of CHO cells oxidative stress response.
