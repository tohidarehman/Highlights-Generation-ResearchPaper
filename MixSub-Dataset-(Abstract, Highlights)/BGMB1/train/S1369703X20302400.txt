 Polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous membrane was prepared by electrospinning technique and was directly converted to polyamine membrane by 50 and 100 ethylenediamine and hexamethylenediamine respectively . The aminated PAN nanofiber membrane equipped with protein liquid chromatography were used to evaluate the dynamic binding capacity for C phycocyanin and allophycocyanin from disrupted

@highlight The order of dynamic binding efficiency for CPC and APC is P EDA P CN P HDA.
@highlight The contaminating proteins can be removed during the adsorption and wash procedures.
@highlight A highly effective capture of APC CPC can be achieved in membrane chromatography.
@highlight APC and CPC nanofiber membranes can act as an antibacterial antioxidant membranes.
