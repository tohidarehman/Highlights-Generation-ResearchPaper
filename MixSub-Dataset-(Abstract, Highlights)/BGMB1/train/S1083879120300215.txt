 Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is the only curative treatment modality for primary myelofibrosis and related myeloproliferative neoplasms . Older age at diagnosis and age related comorbidities make most patients ineligible for allo HCT given concerns for nonrelapse mortality .Here we report the outcomes of 37 consecutive recipients of allo HCT for MF performed at a single center between 2009 and 2018 with a standardized institutional protocol . Most patients received ruxolitinib before HCT and those with splenomegaly 22 cm received pretransplantation splenic irradiation . The median age at HCT was 60 years and 68 of the cohort carried a

@highlight Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT is the only curative treatment modality for myelofibrosis MF . However the presence of comorbidities advanced age and increased risk of graft failure after allogeneic HCT decrease the probability of long term survival.
@highlight Pretransplantation JAK inhibitor therapy use of fludarabine busulfan based conditioning and splenic management are keys to improved transplantation outcomes in patients with MF.
@highlight Graft rejection is a recognized post transplantation complication monitoring donor chimerism and liberal use of immune suppression JAK inhibitors and donor leukocyte infusion can be preventative.
@highlight Post transplantation ruxolitinib can improve survival outcomes by managing graft versus host disease especially in steroid refractory cases.
