 Accurate prognostic tools are crucial to assess the risk benefit ratio of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in patients with myelofibrosis . We aimed to evaluate the performance of the Myelofibrosis Transplant Scoring System and identify risk factors for survival in a multicenter series of 197 patients with MF undergoing allo HCT . After a median follow up of 3.1 years 47 of patients had died and the estimated 5 year survival rate was 51 . Projected 5 year risk of nonrelapse mortality and relapse incidence was 30 and 20 respectively . Factors independently associated with increased mortality were a hematopoietic cell transplantation specific comorbidity index 3 and receiving a graft from an HLA mismatched unrelated donor or cord blood whereas post transplant cyclophosphamide was associated with improved survival . Donor type was the only parameter included in the MTSS model with independent prognostic value for survival . According to the MTSS 3 year survival was 62 66 37 and 17 for low intermediate high and very high risk groups respectively . By pooling together the low and intermediate risk groups as well as the high and very high risk groups we pinpointed 2 categories standard risk and high risk . Three year survival was 62 in standard risk and 25 in high risk categories

@highlight The Myelofibrosis Transplant Scoring System MTSS model failed to clearly delineate 4 risk groups in our series.
@highlight The MTSS can still be useful to identify a high risk category with poor outcome.
@highlight Comorbidities donor type and post transplant cyclophosphamide PT Cy predict survival after hematopoietic cell transplantation.
@highlight PT Cy was able to negate the adverse effect of HLA mismatching in our series.
