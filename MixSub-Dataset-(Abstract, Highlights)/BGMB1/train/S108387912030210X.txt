 The effects of cytomegalovirus reactivation on cord blood transplant are unclear . We assessed the effect of CMV reactivation in adult single unit CBT without in vivo T cell depletion . Of 3147 eligible cases 2052 were acute myeloid leukemia 643 acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 452 myelodysplastic syndrome . CMV reactivation up to 100 days after CBT was associated with better overall survival compared with no reactivation cases whereas nonrelapse mortality was increased in ALL and standard disease risk 17.1 versus 10.6

@highlight Effect of cytomegalovirus CMV reactivation on cord blood transplant CBT was studied.
@highlight CMV reactivation is associated with improved overall survival OS in AML and MDS.
@highlight CMV reactivation is associated with improved OS in high disease risk cases.
@highlight CMV reactivation reduced the risk of relapse in MDS and high disease risk cases.
@highlight CMV reactivation adversely affected nonrelapse mortality in standard risk cases.
