 High mobility group proteins are the major architectural proteins . Among HMG proteins High Mobility Group A is characterized by AT hook motifs which have an affinity for AT rich DNA . In this study we characterized the plant HMGAs from the Poaceae family using

@highlight Three major evolutionary clades of Poaceae HMGAs were identified.
@highlight Poaceae HMGAs from all the clades except clade 2 HMGAs were identified to lack the high affinity type I DNA binding domain.
@highlight No. of AT hook ATH motif in Poaceae ranges from 3 to 5.
@highlight The C terminal tail following the last ATH in Poaceae HMGAs is significantly smaller compared to that of mammalian HMGAs.
@highlight The length of the C terminal tail following the last ATH is smallest and highly conserved in clade 2 HMGAs.
