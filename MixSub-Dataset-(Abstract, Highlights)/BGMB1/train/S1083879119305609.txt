 We analyzed the outcomes of 26 consecutive patients with acquired severe aplastic anemia undergoing peripheral blood stem cell transplantation with partial ex vivo T cell depletion with a targeted T cell dose from HLA identical sibling donors . The median patient age was 37 years . Four patients with uncontrolled pneumonia at the time of transplantation died on days 1 2 21 and 26 . All evaluable patients engrafted with a median time to neutrophil recovery of 11 days and a median time to platelet recovery of 19 days . Two patients had transient grade I acute graft versus host disease with skin involvement but no patients developed grade II IV acute GVHD . Two patients had mild skin chronic GVHD and 1 patient had moderate chronic GVHD with ocular involvement . No relapse was observed after a median follow up of 114 months . The overall cumulative incidence of TRM at 10 years was 19 whereas it was 5 for those with a Karnofsky Performance Status score 60 at the time of transplantation . Disease free survival overall survival and GVHD and relapse free survival at 10 years were 81 81 and 80 respectively for all patients and 95 95 and 90 respectively for patients with a KPS score 60 at transplantation . Our data indicate that PBSCT with partial ex vivo T cell depleted targeted cell dose grafts from an HLA identical sibling donor is a feasible safe and effective approach to reduce GVHD and cure patients with SAA .

@highlight PBSCT from HLA identical siblings using partial T cell depletion for patients with SAA is safe and associated with a low incidence of acute GVHD and chronic GVHD.
@highlight The procedure is effective with high engraftment low TRM and high cure rates.
