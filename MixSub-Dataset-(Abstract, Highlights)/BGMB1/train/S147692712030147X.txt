 P ATPase are a large protein family of integral membrane playing an important role in plant growth development and stress . P ATPase genes family have been identified and characterized in several model plants such as cotton grapes tobacco rice rubber plant and Arabidopsis . However still lack of comprehensive study of P ATPase genes in Chinese pear

@highlight Identified and characterized P ATPase genes in pear and divided into 4 subfamilies according to phylogenetic analysis.
@highlight We analyzed the gene structure chromosomal location and microsynteny analysis in pear.
@highlight Transcriptome data showed that P ATPase gene might play an important role in lignin biosynthesis during fruit development.
@highlight The real time qRT PCR analysis showed that all P ATPase genes were differentially expressed in different tissues.
@highlight Expression profiles of P ATPase genes were detected under the exogenous hormonal treatment.
