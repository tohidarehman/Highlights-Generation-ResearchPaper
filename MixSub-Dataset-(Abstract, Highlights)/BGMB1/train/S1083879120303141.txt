 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality resulting in increased healthcare utilization . To date no multicenter comparative cost analyses have specifically evaluated alloHCT in children with acute leukemia . In this retrospective cohort study we examined the relationship between survival and HCU while investigating the hypothesis that matched sibling donor alloHCT has significantly lower inpatient HCU with unrelated donor alloHCT and that among URDs umbilical cord blood alloHCT will have higher initial utilization but lower long term utilization . Clinical and transplantation outcomes data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research were merged with inpatient cost data from the Pediatric Health Information System database using a probabilistic merge methodology . The merged dataset comprised US patients age 1 to 21 years who underwent alloHCT for acute leukemia between 2004 and 2011 with comprehensive CIBMTR data at a PHIS hospital . AlloHCT was analyzed by donor type with specific analysis of utilization and costs using PHIS claims data . The primary outcomes of overall survival leukemia free survival and inpatient costs were evaluated using Kaplan Meier curves and Cox and Poisson models . A total of 632 patients were identified in both the CIBMTR and PHIS data . The 5 year LFS was 60 for MSD alloHCT 47 for well matched matched unrelated donor bone marrow alloHCT 48 for mismatched unrelated donor alloHCT and 45 for UCB alloHCT

@highlight Matched sibling donor transplants have a survival and cost advantage over unrelated donor transplants.
@highlight Matched unrelated donor and unrelated cord blood transplants have similar survival outcomes.
@highlight Among unrelated donor transplants matched unrelated donor transplants have a cost advantage.
