 Carbon dots with tunable photoluminescence in a large range are produced by a microwave assisted polyol method . The emission of CDs in aqueous can be adjusted by simply changing the precursors concentrations . The CDs with tunable photoluminescence have been further functionalized to develop a homogeneous glucose biosensor by incorporating with enzyme conjugated graphene oxide . The fluorescence of CDs can be quenched through covalently interacting with the graphene oxide . The restored fluorescence is observed in the presence of glucose . The performance of the homogeneous sensing system has been evaluated by testing glucose levels in a range from 0.2 mM to 10 mM . Two linear relationships of the restored fluorescence intensity as a function of the concentration of glucose are obtained i.e . 2 mM to 10 mM and 0.2 mM to 1 mM respectively . In addition streptozotocin induced diabetic rats are utilized to evaluate the performance of the designed sensor for testing diabetic rats plasma glucose . The results demonstrate that the homogeneous carbon based biosensor can measure glucose in the blood and in other conditions .
