 Pulmonary complications are fatal adverse events after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation . On the other hand smoking is a well known risk factor for various pulmonary diseases and also increases the incidence of pulmonary complications and overall mortality in allo HCT recipients . In this study we retrospectively assessed the impact of smoking intensity on survival outcomes . This study included consecutive allo HCT recipients at our center between June 2007 and May 2019 whose smoking profiles were available they were divided into high and low pack years groups . In univariate analyses nonrelapse mortality and overall survival were significantly inferior in the high pack years group 1 year NRM 26.6 versus 13.9

@highlight High pack years were associated with inferior survival especially in males.
@highlight High pack years were related to a high incidence of death due to pulmonary events.
@highlight Total body irradiation dose did not affect survival in the high pack years recipients.
@highlight Current and ex smokers showed equivalent survival outcomes.
