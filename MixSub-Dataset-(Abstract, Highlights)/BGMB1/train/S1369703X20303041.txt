 L asparaginase is an important bacterial enzyme used as a biopharmaceutical to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Side effects of LASNase therapy have been counteracted by polyethylene glycol modification of L ASNase however immunogenicity of PEG has been observed in patients . Here we explore L ASNase glycosylation as a biological alternative to the PEGylation industrial process . In our results a recombinant Erwinase expressed in the Glycoswitch

@highlight Erwinase was expressed in
@highlight as a glycosylated active enzyme.
@highlight Erwinase was secreted and glycosylated in one monomeric and two oligomeric forms.
@highlight Glycosylated Erwinase is able to form a stable and active monomer.
@highlight The glycosylated Erwinase is less recognized by anti ASNase antibodies.
