 This study investigated the effects of microalgae and light on nitrifying bacteria . The oxygen production rates of microalgae were measured at various cell concentrations and it was observed that 5002000mg L of microalgal concentration supplied sufficient oxygen for bacterial nitrification without forced aeration . The effects of light on nitrification were investigated by determining the ammonia oxidation rate and nitrate production rate of enriched nitrifiers in the absence of microalgae with forced aeration and it was observed that those rates were significantly lowered in the presence of light . However the inhibitory effects of light on AOR and NPR were partially reduced in the co culture owing to the self shading effect . AOR and NPR of co cultures with

@highlight The activity of enriched nitrifiers was significantly inhibited by light.
@highlight High concentrations of microalgae slowed oxygen production due to self shading effect.
@highlight The inhibitory effect of light on nitrifiers was alleviated in the co culture.
@highlight Reactive oxygen species affected nitrification negatively.
@highlight Electricity consumption of coculture was lower than that of aerated bacteria culture.
