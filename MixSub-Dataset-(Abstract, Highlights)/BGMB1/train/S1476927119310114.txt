 Accumulating studies have indicated that long non coding RNAs play crucial roles in large amount of biological processes . Predicting lncRNA disease associations can help biologist to understand the molecular mechanism of human disease and benefit for disease diagnosis treatment and prevention . In this paper we introduce a computational framework based on graph autoencoder matrix completion to identify lncRNA disease associations . In our method the graph convolutional network is utilized to encode local graph structure and features of nodes for learning latent factor vectors of lncRNA and disease . Further the inner product of lncRNA factor vector and disease factor vector is used as decoder to reconstruct the lncRNA disease association matrix . In addition the cost sensitive neural network is utilized to deal with the imbalance between positive and negative samples . The experimental results show GAMLDA outperforms other state of the art methods in prediction performance which is evaluated by AUC value AUPR value PPV and F1 score . Moreover the case study shows our method is the effectively tool for potential lncRNA disease prediction .
