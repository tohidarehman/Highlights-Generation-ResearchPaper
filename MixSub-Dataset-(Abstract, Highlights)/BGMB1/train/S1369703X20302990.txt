 Fermentation aiming at oil production has emerged as an outstanding technique but an undesirable emulsion can be formed preventing oil separation . There is still little knowledge about the mechanisms triggering the formation of such emulsions . Although this phenomenon is partly attributed to the cells presence other essential compounds can contribute to the stability of emulsions due to their surface properties . Thus this study aimed at investigating the mechanisms of emulsions stabilization by

@highlight Energy density and antifoams features are major factors affecting emulsion stability.
@highlight Yeast cells and antifoaming agents promoted formation of undesirable cream phase.
@highlight Antifoams can interfere on physical properties of yeast cells.
@highlight Emulsifier activity of antifoams depend on their physicochemical properties.
@highlight The set of methodologies can be used as a tool to choose broth composition.
