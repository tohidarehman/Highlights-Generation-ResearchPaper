 Production of sufficient numbers of multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells is a great challenge that the industry must address to meet the increasing demand for clinical size product batches . This can be understood as an opportunity to exploit existing bioprocessing technologies already tested successfully in the production of vaccines and biologicals . Herein we analyse the transition from traditional manual cell expansion 2D methodologies to scalable and automated platforms with the capacity to yield billions of cells per batch in a robust reproducible and cost effective manner in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices . This review gives special relevance to the key features of multiple manufacturing platforms particularly those using microcarriers to support cell expansion and single use bioreactors .

@highlight The expansion of cell based therapies needs for scalable and robust manufacturing.
@highlight Scale up procedures should yield high cell numbers and meet defined specifications.
@highlight Monitored single use bioreactors are convenient platforms for hMSC production.
@highlight Key culture conditions to support successful expansion of hMSC are revised.
@highlight Materials reagents and regulatory compliance are key to ensure reproducibility.
