 Chimeras with improved properties can be designed by synergistically incorporating multiple proteins into one peptide chain . Such design enhances hydrolysis efficiency and lowers enzyme production costs for numerous applications particularly in the fields of lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysis plant based industries food additives waste treatment and biofuels . In this minireview we summarize a brief common approach to construct recombinant enzymes especially in the
