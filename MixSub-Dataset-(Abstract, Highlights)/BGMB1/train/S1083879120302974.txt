 Male gonadal dysfunction is a frequent late effect after pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation but detailed insight into patterns of male gonadal function at long term is limited by retrospective studies without semen sample data . In this study we investigated the risk of azoospermia and testosterone deficiency the diagnostic value of markers of spermatogenesis and paternity at long term follow up after pediatric allogeneic HSCT . All male HSCT survivors age 18 years transplanted in Denmark or Finland between 1980 and 2010 were invited to participate in this cross sectional study . Examinations included a semen sample measurements of reproductive hormones and testicular volume and screening for chronic graft versus host disease . Cumulative treatment doses were calculated . Of 181 eligible patients 98 participated at a median 18 years after undergoing HSCT . Sperm was found in 30 patients azoospermia in 42 and azoospermia during testosterone substitution in 24 . A higher cumulative testicular irradiation dose was associated with increased risk of azoospermia and testosterone substitution per 1 Gy 1.27 95 confidence interval 1.14 to 1.46

@highlight Azoospermia and testosterone deficiency were frequent after pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
@highlight The cumulative testicular irradiation dose was the main risk factor.
@highlight Testis irradiation of 12 Gy led to azoospermia and irradiation of 16 Gy led to testosterone substitution.
@highlight Prepubertal stage at transplantation increased the risk of testosterone deficiency.
@highlight Inhibin B was an accurate surrogate marker of azoospermia in adulthood.
