 This study was carried out at both laboratory and pilot scale to investigate whether the presence of phosphorus affects the nitrification process during aerobic digestion of aquaculture aquaponic solid waste . Results from the laboratory scale aerobic digestions indicated that nitrification did not occur throughout the entire bioprocessing period in aerobic bioreactors containing phosphorus . The mineralization process in laboratory scale aerobic bioreactors which did not contain phosphorus on the other hand followed the typical non inhibited nitrogen mineralization

@highlight Phosphorus affects the bioconversion of organic solid waste into liquid fertilizer.
@highlight Phosphorus delays the onset of nitrification of aquaculture aquaponic solid waste.
@highlight Phosphorus should be avoided in bioprocessing of aquaculture aquaponic solid waste.
