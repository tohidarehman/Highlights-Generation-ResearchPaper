 New interventions are needed in advanced chronic graft versus host disease . In a phase II single arm multicenter trial we examined the efficacy of ixazomib in patients with chronic GVHD who had progressed after at least 1 previous line of systemic immunosuppressive therapy . Ixazomib was given as a 4 mg oral dose weekly on days 1 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle for up to 6 total cycles . The primary endpoint was 6 month treatment failure a composite endpoint including death relapse and requirement for an additional line of systemic IS therapy . A total of 50 subjects were enrolled at 6 institutions . The median time from the onset of chronic GVHD to enrollment was 2.8 years . The degree of chronic GVHD at enrollment was National Institutes of Health defined moderate or severe predominantly classic with 52 of patients having involvement of 4 or more organs . The patients were heavily pretreated with 39 receiving 3 or more previous lines of systemic therapy for chronic GVHD . Of the 50 patients treated 26 completed 6 months of planned therapy . The 6 month treatment failure rate was significantly lower than the historical benchmark 28 versus 44

@highlight Oral ixazomib therapy was associated with decreased treatment failure compared with a historical benchmark in a national phase II trial.
@highlight The 2014 National Institutes of Health response criteria defined overall response rate was 40 at 6 months in a cohort with advanced chronic graft versus host disease.
