 In this study the changes in the enzymatic activity and bacterial communities inhabiting the earthworm gut were investigated to determine the correlation between feeding conditions and tetracycline degradation . Two TC concentrations were fed to earthworms using either the sequential swallowing or repeated swallowing technique . The repeated swallowing feeding technique was found to have a better effect on the degradation rate of TC . The peroxidase and catalase activities in earthworms fed using the sequential swallowing technique were higher than those in earthworms fed using the repeated swallowing technique . When the sequential swallowing technique was used the TC degradation rate was found to be negatively correlated with the abundance of

@highlight This work set two ways of swallowing sequential swallowing and repeated swallowing.
@highlight The digestion of earthworms enhanced the degradation rate of TC in municipal sludge.
@highlight The bacterial community in earthworm intestine changed under different feeding ways.
