 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a valid option in patients with refractory lymphomas . HLA haploidentical stem cell transplantation expanded the accessibility to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation . The aims of study were to retrospectively assess the toxicity and efficacy of haplo SCT using nonmyeloablative conditioning in patients with advanced lymphoma . In total 147 patients with advanced lymphoma at 2 partner institutions were included . Patients received a uniform nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen and graft versus host disease prophylaxis . The primary endpoints were progression free survival overall survival GVHD nonrelapse mortality and GVHD relapse free survival . Median follow up was 39 months . The median age was 46 years . Sixty five percent of patients were in complete remission at transplantation . Cumulative incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD was 30 23 to 38 . Two year cumulative incidence of all grades of chronic GVHD was 13 . Two year cumulative incidence of disease relapse was 19 with a higher incidence in patients not being in CR at allo HCT CR versus not CR 12 versus 33

@highlight Nonmyeloablative haploidentical stem cell transplantation for advanced lymphomas is highly feasible with low incidence of nonrelapse mortality.
@highlight It provides a strong graft versus lymphoma effect for both Hodgkin and non Hodgkin lymphoma with low incidence of relapse when performed in partial or complete remission.
