 Like communities of people communities of cells must continuously communicate to thrive . Polypeptide signaling molecules that act as mobile ligands are widely used by eukaryotic organisms to transmit information between cells to coordinate developmental processes and responses to environmental cues . In plants the

@highlight The advent of genome editing has accelerated analysis of the arabidopsis
@highlight peptide gene family revealing novel functions for multiple family members.
@highlight New components of the CLAVATA3 CLV3 shoot stem cell signaling pathway have been identified that include the CIK subfamily of receptor kinases several MAP kinases and the HAM family of transcription factors.
@highlight CLE peptides regulate root biological processes such as protophloem development root hair formation and response to nutrient availability.
@highlight CLE signaling in vascular tissues requires the integration of auxin and cytokinin responses as well as a feed forward loop comprising several transcription factors.
@highlight CLE peptides limit cell division activity during stomata formation and promote stomatal closure in an abscisic acid responsive manner.
