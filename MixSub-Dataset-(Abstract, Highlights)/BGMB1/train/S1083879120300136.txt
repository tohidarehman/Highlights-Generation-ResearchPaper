 Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is recommended in high risk patients with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia . For patients without an HLA identical donor haploidentical HCT is becoming the leading source of stem cell donation . However data are scarce on predictive factors for outcome in that setting . We identified 122 adults with T ALL who underwent haplo HCT with post transplantation cyclophosphamide between 2010 and 2017 . The median duration of follow up of living patients was 23 months . The 2 year incidences of relapse and nonrelapse mortality were 45 and 21 respectively . The 2 year leukemia free survival overall survival and graft versus host disease relapse free survival were 34 42 and 27 respectively . The 2 year LFS and OS were highly influenced by disease status at transplantation being 49 and 55 respectively for patients in first complete remission 34 and 50 respectively for those in second CR and 8 and 12 respectively for patients with active disease . On multivariate analysis only disease status was found to affect LFS and OS . Transplantation in CR2 negatively affected LFS whereas active disease at the time of haplo HCT negatively affected LFS and OS . In conclusion haplo HCT with ptCy produced encouraging results in this challenging disease particularly when performed in patients in CR . Despite the limitation of the small sample size our results were not affected by the type of conditioning calling into question the need for total body irradiation based myeloablative conditioning in that setting .

@highlight Outcomes of 122 haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantations with post transplantation cyclophosphamide for T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia are reported.
@highlight Survival was mostly affected by disease status being significantly better in first complete remission
@highlight Outcomes were not affected by conditioning calling into question the need for total body irradiation.
