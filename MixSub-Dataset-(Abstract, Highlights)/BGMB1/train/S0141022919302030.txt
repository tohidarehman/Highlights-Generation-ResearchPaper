 Beta glucosidase is widely used in animal feed industries . However degradation caused by digestive enzymes in the intestine hampers its application . Improving the resistance of feed enzymes against proteases is crucial in livestock farming . To improve the resistance of beta glucosidase against pepsin and trypsin a rational molecular design based on the inhibition of bound state formation and secondary design was developed . The strategy includes prediction of the interaction surface of the pepsin BGL1 complex structure prediction of key amino acids affecting the formation of the complex optimization of pepsin resistant mutants by structural evaluation secondary molecular design based on pepsin resistant mutants and optimization of pepsin and trypsin resistant mutants . Two BGL1 protein mutants BGL1

@highlight We put forward a rational strategy to improve the pepsin and trypsin resistance of beta glucosidase from
@highlight The strategy is based on inhibition of pepsin trypsin beta glucosidase bound state conformations and secondary design.
@highlight Results showed that the pepsin and trypsin resistance of BGL1 mutants were improved.
@highlight This method has important reference significance for improving the stability of other feed enzymes.
