 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients are vulnerable to invasive pneumococcal disease with reported IPD rates ranging from 3.81 to 22.5 1000 HSCT . This IPD risk could relate to immunodeficiency low vaccination uptake and poor immunogenicity of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine . Literature comparing the clinical effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and PPV after HSCT is limited . In this retrospective analysis of HSCT recipients at our center from 2004 to 2015 we evaluated vaccination uptake and compared IPD rates in patients receiving PPV and PCV . IPD was determined from microbiological results for all HSCT recipients from January 2004 to June 30 2019 . Eight hundred patients had a total of 842 HSCT events including autologous HSCT and allogeneic HSCT . More than 90 of the HSCT recipients were enrolled and 93 of surviving HSCT recipients completed the vaccination protocol . Fifteen IPD episodes occurred in 13 patients between 2004 and June 30 2019 . Thirteen episodes occurred in the pre 2010 group even though 9 of 13 serotyped isolates were covered by PPV . Two episodes occurred in the post 2010 group neither serotype was covered by PCV . Thus with PCV introduction IPD rate was significantly reduced from 38.5 1000 unique HSCTs pre 2010 to 4.0 1000 unique HSCTs post 2010

@highlight Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCT recipients have high rates of invasive pneumococcal disease IPD .
@highlight Patients with multiple myeloma are at particularly higher risk of IPD following HSCT.
@highlight Compared with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine pneumococcal conjugate vaccine significantly reduced IPD in HSCT recipients.
@highlight A nurse led vaccination program produced high vaccination completion rates.
