 Major Histocompatibility Complex is a cell surface glycoprotein that binds to foreign antigens and presents them to T lymphocyte cells on the surface of Antigen Presenting Cells for appropriate immune recognition . Recently studies focusing on peptide based vaccine design have allowed a better understanding of peptide immunogenicity mechanisms which is defined as the ability of a peptide to stimulate CTL mediated immune response . Peptide immunogenicity is also known to be related to the stability of peptide loaded MHC complex . In this study ENCoM server was used for structure based estimation of the impact of single point mutations on pMHC complex stabilities . For this purpose two human MHC molecules from the HLA B 27 group in complex with four different peptides and three HLA B 44 molecules in complex with two different peptides were analyzed . We found that the stability of pMHC complexes is dependent on both peptide sequence and MHC allele . Furthermore we demonstrate that allele specific peptide binding preferences can be accurately revealed using structure based computational methods predicting the effect of mutations on protein stability .

@highlight Normal Mode Analysis can be used to estimate the relative importance of mutations of residues.
@highlight Stability of pMHC complexes is found to depend on both sequence of the bound peptide and type of the MHC allele.
@highlight It is shown that pMHC complex stability can be varied by substituting peptide residues.
