Caregivers mentioned both negative and positive psychological impacts of HCT but the number of negative impacts was greater 164 versus 34 instances . The most frequently mentioned negative psychological impacts were anxiety worry fear feeling overloaded overwhelmed and uncertainty . Other emergent categories were roles responsibilities such as parenting work and treatment related tasks and coping strategies . The latter included both adaptive and maladaptive strategies . Despite the preponderance of negatively toned thoughts and feelings signs of adjustment emerged with mentions of positive psychological states such as optimism and gratitude and adaptive coping strategies such as active coping use of emotional support and self care . Interventions intended to facilitate adaptation to the HCT experience should involve strategies to help caregivers manage symptoms of distress and promote adaptive coping .
