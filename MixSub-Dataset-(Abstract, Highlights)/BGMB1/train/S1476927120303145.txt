 Qiang Huo Sheng Shi decoction a classic traditional Chinese herbal formula which has been reported to be effective in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis . However the concurrent targeting mechanism of how the aforementioned formula is valid in the two distinct diseases OA and RA which represents the homotherapy for heteropathy principle in traditional Chinese medicine have not yet been clarified . In the present study network pharmacology was adopted to analyze the potential molecular mechanism and therapeutic effective components of QHSSD on both OA and RA . A total of 153 active ingredients in QHSSD were identified 142 of which associated with 59 potential targets for the two diseases were identified . By constructing the protein protein interaction network and the compound target disease network 72 compounds and 10 proteins were obtained as the hub targets of QHSSD against OA and RA . The hub genes of ESR1 PTGS2 PPARG IL1B TNF MMP2 IL6 CYP3A4 MAPK8 and ALB were mainly involved in osteoclast differentiation the NF

@highlight A new method was established through network pharmacology which combined two disease with one formula to explain the theory of homotherapy for heteropathy in TCM.
@highlight The network was verified by molecular docking and the active components and significant targets of QHSSD were screened.
@highlight This study revealed that the treatment of OA and RA with QHSSD may be related to osteoclast differentiation NF B and TNF signaling pathway.
