 During bioconversion of rice straw into ethanol large amount waste water containing various organic compounds is discharged . The aim of this study was to accomplish bioconversion of phenolic acids in waste water generated during ethanol production from rice straw into value added products and 4 vinylphenol to make the process more ecofriendly and reduce ethanol production costs . While PAs at concentration lower than 0.4g L could be converted into 4 VG and 4 VP higher PAs concentration caused PAs stress in
