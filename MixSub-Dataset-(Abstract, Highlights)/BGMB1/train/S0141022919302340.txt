 Catechins in green tea possess various health benefits . Enzymatic treatment improves physiological activities by inducing bioconversion of catechins . Here we investigated the effect of green tea infusion after tannase treatment which transforms epigallocatechin gallate to gallic acid and epigallocatechin on adipocyte differentiation and mature adipocyte metabolism . The optimal conditions for tannase mediated improvement in GA and EGC yields in GT were investigated using response surface methodology . Yields of GA and EGC were 43 fold and 1.66 fold higher respectively compared to GT without tannase treatment . The optimal reaction conditions for tannase mediated biotransformation were observed on 0.54mgmL

@highlight Green tea infusion GT was bio transformed by tannase.
@highlight Yields of GA and EGC are 43 fold and 1.66 fole higher than GT.
@highlight Tannase mediated GT TAN showed higher anti obesity activity than GT.
@highlight TAN is attractive candidate for preparing GT with enhanced anti oxidant and anti obesity properties.
