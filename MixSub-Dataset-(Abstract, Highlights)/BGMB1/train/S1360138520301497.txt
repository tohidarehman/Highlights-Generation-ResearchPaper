 The development of genomics and epigenomics has allowed rapid advances in our understanding of plant biology . However conventional bulk analysis dilutes cell specific information by providing only average information thereby limiting the resolution of genomic and functional genomic studies . Recent advances in single cell sequencing technology concerning genomics and epigenomics open new avenues to dissect cell heterogeneity in multiple biological processes . Recent applications of these approaches to plants have provided exciting insights into diverse biological questions . We highlight the methodologies underlying the current techniques of single cell genomics and epigenomics before covering their recent applications potential significance and future perspectives in plant biology .

@highlight The rapidly developing fields of single cell genomics and epigenomics provide powerful approaches to dissect cell heterogeneity in plants.
@highlight The sensitivity and specificity of detecting single nucleotide variations and copy number variations via single cell whole genome amplification technologies have been continuously improving over the past decades. Recent applications highlight their feasibility and utility in plant single cell genomics.
@highlight Recent technical advances in single cell epigenomics have enabled comprehensive and accurate profiling of diverse epigenomic features. The cell specific epigenome facilitates the dissection of molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes in plants.
@highlight Overcoming current technical issues and integrating multiomic single cell sequencing data in plants will provide far greater understanding of plant functional genomics.
