 A paucity of randomized phase III clinical trials in primary central nervous system lymphoma has resulted in no uniform consensus on the optimal strategy for consolidation and conditioning regimens for autologous stem cell transplant . The past 2 decades have witnessed a preference for thiotepa based conditioning regimens due to superior central nervous system penetration . We retrospectively evaluated outcomes of patients with PCNSL who underwent ASCT at Mayo Clinic Rochester over the past 2 decades and the impact of TT based conditioning regimens . Fifty six patients underwent transplant for PCNSL with 25 and 31 patients receiving BEAM and carmustine TT based conditioning respectively . All patients received high dose methotrexate based induction therapy . While the BCNU TT group had higher risk disease features such as high International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group prognostic score elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein and older patient population there was no significant difference at 2 years post transplant in progression free survival versus BCNU TT 65.5

@highlight Primary central nervous system CNS lymphoma is a rare entity with limited randomized clinical trials.
@highlight No consensus exists on the optimal consolidation strategy and conditioning regimen in primary CNS lymphoma.
@highlight Our 20 year experience at the Mayo Clinic Rochester provides additional insights.
@highlight Disease response before transplant dictates outcome a novel finding.
