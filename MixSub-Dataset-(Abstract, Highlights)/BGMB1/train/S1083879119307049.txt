 Methotrexate in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor has been commonly used for prophylaxis of graft versus host disease following umbilical cord blood transplantation in Japan . However the appropriate prophylactic MTX dosage in UCBT has not been established to date . To determine the preferential GVHD prophylaxis in UCBT this study retrospectively investigated the administration of short term MTX for 2 days versus 3 days . Of 103 adult patients submitted to UCBT enrolled in the study 73 received tacrolimus with 2 days of MTX given at 10mg m

@highlight In this comparative analysis of 2 day and 3 day methotrexate MTX administration in umbilical cord blood transplantation UCBT 
@highlight the very short term vs MTX tacrolimus TAC group had earlier neutrophil engraftment compared with the short term MTX TAC group.
@highlight In a high risk population vsMTX TAC was associated with lower relapse incidence.
