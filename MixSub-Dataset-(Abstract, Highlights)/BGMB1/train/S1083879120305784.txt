 Delirium is common among adults undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation although the clinical and neuroimaging correlates of post HCT delirium have not been adequately delineated . We therefore examined the frequency of delirium and neuroimaging correlates of post transplant delirium in a retrospective cohort of 115 adults undergoing neuroimaging after allogeneic HCT . Delirium was established using previously validated methods for retrospective identification of chart assessed postprocedural delirium . Chart reviews were independently conducted by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in HCT psychiatry and psychology on consecutive allogeneic HCT patients who underwent neuroimaging assessments and transplantation at a single center between January 2009 and December 2016 . Neuroimaging markers of white matter damage and brain volume loss were also recorded . In total 115 patients were included ranging in age from 20 to 74 years age 49 . Fifty three patients developed post HCT delirium . In an adjusted model delirium incidence was associated with older age 1.92 per decade

@highlight Delirium is common following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
@highlight In this select sample greater age treatment regimen intensity and greater white matter burden were all associated with greater delirium incidence.
