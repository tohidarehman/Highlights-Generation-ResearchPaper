 Severe aplastic anemia is a life threatening disease that can be cured with allogeneic cell transplantation . Haploidentical donor transplantation with post transplantation cyclophosphamide is an option for patients lacking an HLA matched donor . We analyzed 87 patients who underwent haplo PTCy between 2010 and 2019 . The median patient age was 14 years most were heavily transfused and all received previous immunosuppression . Almost two thirds received standard fludarabine cyclophosphamide 29 total body irradiation 200 cGy conditioning and the remaining patients received an augmented conditioning Flu Cy29 TBI 300 400 Flu Cy50 TBI 200 or Flu Cy50 TBI 400 . All patients received PTCy based graft versus host disease prophylaxis . Most grafts were bone marrow . The median duration of follow up was 2 years and 2 months . The median time to neutrophil recovery was 17 days . Primary graft failure occurred in 15 of the patients and secondary or poor graft function occurred in 5 . The incidences of grade II IV acute GVHD was 14 and that of chronic GVHD was 9 . Two year overall survival and event free survival were 79 and 70 respectively . EFS was higher for patients who received augmented Flu Cy TBI .28

@highlight Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from haploidentical donors for relapsed refractory severe aplastic anemia is feasible.
@highlight Primary graft failure was 15 2 year event free survival EFS was 70 and 2 year overall survival was 79 .
@highlight An augmented cyclophosphamide fludarabine total body irradiation regimen is associated with improved EFS.
@highlight A CD34 cell dose 3.210E6 kg is associated with improved EFS.
