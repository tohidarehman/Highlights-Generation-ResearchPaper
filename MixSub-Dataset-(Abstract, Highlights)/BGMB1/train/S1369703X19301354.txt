 Two lab scale sequencing batch biofilm reactors with no salt and 10.0g L salt were operated to explore the simultaneous COD nitrogen phosphorus removal behavior and the microbial diversity as well as tridimensional key functional microbial groups responses to varying C N P ratios from 125 8.3 1 to 33.3 8.3 1 . The simultaneous nitrification and denitrification process and denitrifying phosphorus removal process were observed in this SBBR system . The N SBBR showed better adaptation to low C N P compared with the performance in S SBBR removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus in N SBBR showed 15 and 30 enhancement . The sludge samples from N SBBR collected at the C N P ratio of 70.0 7.0 1 had the highest bacterial richness and diversity . The abundance of bacterial in suspended sludge exterior biofilm and interior biofilm were different the interior biofilm tends to favour the growth of denitrifying phosphorus bacteria

@highlight Simultaneous nutrients removal in SBBRs were evaluated at varying C N P ratios.
@highlight Lower C N P inhibited S SBBR more severely in terms of TP removal.
@highlight Both the microbial diversity and richness were effected by C N P ratios.
@highlight Microorganism in suspended sludge and biofilm showed different characteristics.
@highlight PAOs and DNPAOs enriched at the C N P of 33.3 8.3 1.
