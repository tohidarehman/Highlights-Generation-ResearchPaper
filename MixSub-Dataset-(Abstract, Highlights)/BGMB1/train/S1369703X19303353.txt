 Microalgal biorefineries have recently emerged as a potentially economically viable option for the co production of value added products and fuels such as biodiesel and biobutanol . Whilst microalgal biodiesel has been studied extensively microalgal biobutanol has received less attention due to the low product yields of the biochemical process from which biobutanol is obtained the Acetone Butanol Ethanol fermentation . In this work we evaluate the potential of a microalgae based biorefinery by i quantifying biobutanol production via ABE fermentation of microalgae using a medium optimised via surface response analysis methodology ii quantifying biodiesel production via transesterification of microalgae . Using SRA optimised medium butanol fermentation yields of 10.31 g g

@highlight We present a biorefinery approach for dual biofuel production from microalgae.
@highlight Biobutanol production was achieved with both raw and hydrolysed biomass.
@highlight Biodiesel extraction was enhanced by increased cell disruption treatments.
@highlight ABE process was optimized by supplementing butyric acid to the fermentation medium.
