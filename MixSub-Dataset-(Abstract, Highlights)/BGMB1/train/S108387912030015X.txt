 Serious viral infections due to delayed immune reconstitution are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Thus many transplant centers prospectively track cellular immune recovery by evaluating absolute cell numbers and the phenotypic profile of reconstituting T cell subsets to identify individuals who are at highest risk of infection . Conventional assessments however fail to measure either the antigen specificity or functional capacity of reconstituting cellsboth factors that correlate with endogenous antiviral protection . In this pilot study we sought to address this limitation by prospectively investigating the tempo of endogenous immune reconstitution in a cohort of 23 pediatric HSCT patients using both quantitative and qualitative measures which we correlated with either the presence or absence of infections associated with cytomegalovirus adenovirus Epstein Barr virus BK virus human herpes virus 6 respiratory syncytial virus parainfluenza influenza and human metapneumovirus . We present data spanning 12 months post transplant demonstrating the influence of conditioning on immune recovery and highlighting the differential impact of active viral replication on the quantity and quality of reconstituting cells . Judicious use of standard and novel monitoring strategies can help guide the clinical care and personalized management of allogenic HSCT recipients with infections .

@highlight A combination of phenotypic and functional immune assays enables risk stratification of patients with viral infections after transplant.
@highlight Functional immune monitoring can help identify patients in need of additional antiviral intervention.
