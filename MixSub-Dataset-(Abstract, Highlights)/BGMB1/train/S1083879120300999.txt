 Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a potentially fatal disorder of immune regulation . Management includes chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . T cell depleted haploidentical HSCT could be an option for those patients who do not have HLA matching family donor . The objective of this study was to report on the outcome of TCD haploidentical HSCT in patients with FHLH who underwent transplantation at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital . This is a retrospective report on 12 patients with FHLH who received TCD haploidentical HSCT at SQUH between August 2010 and December 2018 . Epidemiologic characteristics and details on the transplantation procedures and complications were collected from patients electronic records . Twelve patients with FHLH received TCD haploidentical HSCT after a myeloablative conditioning regimen composed of treosulfan thiotepa fludarabine anti thymocyte globulin and rituximab . The mean age at transplantation was 11.67 8 months . All patients had

@highlight Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is curable only by stem cell transplantation.
@highlight For patients with no matching donors haploidentical transplantation was offered.
@highlight A disease free survival was 58.3 at around 3 years after transplantation.
@highlight A low incidence of graft versus host disease was encountered while infectious complications were common.
@highlight Cytomegalovirus antigenemia was the most frequent infectious complication.
