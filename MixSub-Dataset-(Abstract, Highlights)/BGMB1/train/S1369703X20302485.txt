 Fungi bioproducts have recently become commercially important to the food and pharmaceutical industry . However different structural forms exhibited by filamentous fungi throughout their life cycles are often a bottleneck for productivity in many industrial processes . In this work the relationship among mycelium accumulation morphology and colorant production was evaluated . Experiments were performed in an incubator shaker and in a stirred tank bioreactor . First a series of nitrogen sources and pure vitamins were investigated as additives to the monosodium glutamate glucose medium in order to improve

@highlight MSG and environmental pH played an important role in external stresses affecting cell growth and colorants formation.
@highlight Fungi morphology was correlated to the influence of pH at membrane charge level.
@highlight There were no direct relationships among mycelium accumulation with morphology and colorant production.
@highlight Pellets formation favored suitable oxygenation of the culture broth leading to the best metabolism of the carbon source.
