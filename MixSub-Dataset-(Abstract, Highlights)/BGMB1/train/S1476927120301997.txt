 Canonical transient receptor potential 5 which belongs to the subfamily of transient receptor potential channels is a non selective cation channel mainly expressed in the central nervous system and shows more restricted expression in the periphery . TRPC5 plays a crucial role in human physiology and pathology for instance anxiety depression epilepsy pain memory and chronic kidney disease . However due to lack of the effective and selective inhibitors its physiological and pathological mechanism remains so far unknown . It is therefore pivotal to identify potential TRPC5 inhibitors . We have applied ligand based virtual screening and structure based virtual screening methods . The pharmacophore models of TRPC5 antagonists generated by using the HypoGen and HipHop algorithms were used as a query model for the screening of potential inhibitors against the Specs database . The resultant hits from LBVS were further screened by SBVS . SBVS was carried out based on the homology model generation of human TRPC5 binding site identification molecular dynamics optimization and molecular docking studies . In our systematic screening approaches we have identified 7 hits compounds with comparable dock score after Lipinski and Veber rules ADMET PAINS analysis cluster analysis and similarity analysis . In conclusion the current research provides novel backbones for the new generation of TRPC5 inhibitors .

@highlight Ligand based virtual screening LBVS and structure based virtual screening SBVS methods was used to identify potential TRPC5 inhibitors.
@highlight LBVS was based on a combination of HipHop pharmacophore and HypoGen pharmacophore.
@highlight SBVS was based on generating homology model and subsequent molecular docking studies.
@highlight Seven compounds were selected using Lipinski s Rule of Five Veber rules ADME properties and PAINS filter.
