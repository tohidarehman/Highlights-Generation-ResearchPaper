 Glycosylation of flavonoids is one of the most important modifications in flavonoid biosynthesis pathways which contributes to the biochemical activity as well as the solubility of flavonoids . However reports on glycosyltransferases that catalyze specifically the 3 O glycosylation of flavonoids are limited . In the current work three novel flavonoid 3 O glycosyltransferases as well as one UDP rhamnose synthase were identified and functionally characterized using RNA sequencing from

@highlight Three novel glycosyltransferases were identified from Epimedium.
@highlight These enzymes can transfer glucose galactose rhamnose to C 3 position of flavonoids.
@highlight These enzymes could recognize prenylated flavonoids as sugar acceptors.
