 For microalgae flocculation the main drawback is high time consumption caused by low flocs settling velocity thus enhancing the sedimentation performance is an urgent problem in need of a solution . To enhance the settling velocity of microalgae flocs montmorillonite clay was applied to microalgae flocculation in the form of flocculant carrier in this study . With clay the effective density of microalgae flocs was enhanced remarkably . When the dry weight ratio of clay to cationic starch was 2 the effective density of microalgae flocs was 3.15 fold of that without clay . As a result the settling velocity of microalgae flocs was enhanced 2.34 times . Additionally owing to the tear effect of clay and well distribution of cationic starch the mean diameter of generated flocs was slightly reduced and microalgae harvesting efficiency was improved . All these results suggested that the montmorillonite clay promises to be an ideal candidate for microalgae flocculation that can both enhance the microalgae sedimentation and adsorption performance .

@highlight Clay was proposed to enhance sedimentation performance of microalgae flocs.
@highlight Floc effective density and settling velocity were improved 3.15 and 2.34 times.
@highlight Floc diameter was decreased due to the difference in shear and centrifugal forces.
@highlight Adsorption efficiency was also improved owing to the tear effect of clay.
