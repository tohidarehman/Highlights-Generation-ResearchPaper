 Stem cells are crucial in the field of tissue regeneration and developmental biology . Embryonic stem cells which are pluripotent in nature are derived from the inner cell mass of blastocyst . The gene expression profiles of ESCs and Induced pluripotent stem cells were compared to identify the differences . Spermatogonial stem cells are also known as Germ line stem cells present in testis is having the capability of producing the sperm in their whole lifetime . Therefore can be reprogrammed into pluripotent cells called male germline pluripotent cells . It is very difficult to interpret the larger genomic data sets which are available in public databases without high computational facilities . In order to identify the similar groups We studied the co expression clustering of the transcriptome and variation of the transcriptome of the GSCs gPSCs ESCs and other cell types using fuzzy clustering using AutoSOME . The series matrix file with GSE ID GSE11274 was retrieved and subjected to the various normalization methods corresponding rows and columns were clustered using p values ensemble runs and different running modes . Transcriptome analysis using the proposed approach intuitively and consistently characterized the variation in cell cell significantly . Collectively our results suggest that the GSCs and the ESCs displayed differential gene expression profiles and the GSCs possessed the potential to acquire pluripotency based on the high expression of epigenetic factors and transcription factors . These data may provide novel insights into the reprogramming mechanism of GSCs .

@highlight We studied the clustering of gene expression data and co expression modules of different cellular phenotypes.
@highlight Heat maps generated reflects the distinct expression patterns of cells and also intrinsic status of the cells.
@highlight The Transcriptome variation among GSCs ESCs and gPSCs was studied using fuzzy cluster network.
