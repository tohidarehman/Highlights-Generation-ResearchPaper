 Chronic graft versus host disease is a heterogenous syndrome whose symptoms and treatment are often associated with decreases in functional status and quality of life among survivors of transplantation . We explored definitions of cGVHD related disability and factors associated with disability in cGVHD . We analyzed 371 patients with cGVHD requiring a new systemic therapy with enrollment and 18 month assessments through the Chronic GVHD Consortium evaluating disability as a composite endpoint including any 1 of 5 impairments previously defined by Fatobene et al . We also evaluated disability defined as an 8 point decline in a human activity profile score or a 20 decline in Karnofsky Performance Status from enrollment to 18 months . At enrollment 47 of patients had at least 1 of the 5 Flowers disability features with 50 of this group acquiring additional impairments at 18 months . Of the 197 patients with no Flowers disability at enrollment 50 progressed with disability features at 18 months . We found that any progressive Flowers impairment was associated with a decline in HAP KPS as well as with increased National Institutes of Health severity scores at 18 months . Enrollment mouth scores and patient reported eye and skin scores were significantly associated with progressive impairment at 18 months . Progressive disability at 18 months did not predict subsequent nonrelapse mortality . Additional studies to define chronic GVHD related disability and risk factors are needed to develop this important patient centered outcome .

@highlight Disability as defined by progressive chronic graft versus host disease GVHD impairments are associated with decline in human activity profile scores and performance status at 18 months.
@highlight Worse oral scores and patient reported eye and skin scores are significantly associated with progressive chronic GVHD impairment at 18 months.
