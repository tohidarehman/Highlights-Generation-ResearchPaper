 Metastasis is the main cause of breast cancer lethality especially in early stages led to improvements in therapeutic procedures . Lately by improvements in our perception of biological processes and immune system new classes of vaccines are emerged that grant us the opportunity of designing resolute constructs against desired antigens . In the current study we used a variety of immunoinformatics tools to design a novel cancer vaccine against Preferentially Expressed Antigen of Melanoma which counts as a cancer testis antigen for various human cancers including BC . The PRAME up regulation leads to strengthen BC stem cells maintenance drug resistance cell survival adaptation and apoptosis evading in cancerous cells . The PRAME co expressed genes were mined and validated through BC RNA sequencing of TCGA data . The immunodominant T cell predicted epitopes were fused and engineered to form the vaccine . The safety allergenicity and immunogenic capabilities of the vaccine were confirmed by promising immunoinformatics tools . The vaccines structure was verified to be hydrophilic in most areas through Kyte and Doolittle hydrophobicity plotting . The interactions between the designed vaccine and immune receptors of TLR4 and IL1R were confirmed by protein protein docking after modeling its tertiary structure . Finally codon optimization and In conclusion concerning
