 Potassium regulates a plethora of metabolic and developmental response in plants and upon exposure to biotic and abiotic stresses a substantial K

@highlight GORK channels possess the binding motifs and domains that may enable them to operate as ligand gated channels.
@highlight Activity of GORK channels may be modulated by cyclic nucleotides gamma aminobutyric acid G proteins protein phosphatases inositol and ATP.
@highlight As all aforesaid molecules are known to operate upstream of plant signaling pathways mediating their adaptation to abiotic stresses GORK channel may therefore operate as a master switch of the cell metabolism inhibiting energy consuming anabolic reactions and saving energy for adaptation and repair.
@highlight This function of the GORK channel may give species a competitive advantage under energy limiting conditions imposed by environmental stresses and explain a reported increase in GORK transcript levels under abiotic stress conditions.
