 Post translational modifications are considered important molecular interactions in protein science . One of these modifications is sumoylation whose computational detection has recently become a challenge . In this paper we propose a new computational predictor which makes use of the sine and cosine of backbone torsion angles and the accessible surface area for predicting sumoylation sites . The aforementioned features were computed for all the proteins in our benchmark dataset and a training matrix consisting of sumoylation and non sumoylation sites was ultimately created . This training matrix was balanced by undersampling the majority class using the NearMiss method . Finally an AdaBoost classifier was used for discriminating between sumoylation and non sumoylation sites . Our predictor was called C iSumo because of its effective use of circular functions . C iSumo was compared with another predictor which was outperformed in statistical metrics such as sensitivity accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient .
