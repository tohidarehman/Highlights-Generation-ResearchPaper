 Bioproducts production using monomeric sugars derived from lignocellulosic biomass presents several challenges such as to require a physicochemical pretreatment to improve its conversion yields . Hydrothermal lignocellulose pretreatment has several advantages and results in solid and liquid streams . The former is called hemicellulosic hydrolysate which contains inhibitory phenolic compounds and sugar degradation products that hinder microbial fermentation products from pentose sugars . Here we developed and applied a novel enzyme process to detoxify HH . Initially the design of experiments with different redox activities enzymes was carried out . The enzyme mixture containing the peroxidase together with superoxide dismutase are the most effective to detoxify HH derived from sugarcane bagasse . Butanol fermentation by the bacteria
