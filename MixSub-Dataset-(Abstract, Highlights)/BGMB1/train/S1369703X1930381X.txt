 A lipase gene was identified and isolated from a fosmid metagenomics library constructed from forest topsoil samples . Error prone PCR and saturation mutagenesis were used to generate seven lipase variants S69P R194Q S69G S69P S69E S69P T99S N190S R194Q R194S and R194A by testing five different fatty acids of

@highlight Present study report engineering of a metagenome derived lipase gene.
@highlight Positions R194 and S69 are identified as hot spot residues for improved activity.
@highlight Reactivity of lipases can be engineered at positions away from the active site.
@highlight Combining directed evolution with saturation mutagenesis is an effective approach.
