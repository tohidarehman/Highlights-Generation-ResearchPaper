 Antibiotic induced gut dysbiosis has been associated with poor outcomes after intensive therapy . We evaluated the effect of levofloxacin the most commonly used prophylactic antibacterial antibiotic during intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation on the gut microbiota in 2 cohorts of patients 1 cohort comprising 20 patients with acute leukemia receiving intensive chemotherapy and the other cohort comprising 20 allo HCT recipients . 16S rRNA gene sequencing of thrice weekly collected stool samples permitted a comparison between intervals with no antibacterial antibiotic exposure and those with only LEVO exposure . In mixed effects modeling the only variables influenced by LEVO were the relative abundances of
