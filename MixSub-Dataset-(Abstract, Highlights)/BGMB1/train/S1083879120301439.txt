 High dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation have provided effective treatment for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma for more than 3 decades however which patients will benefit from tandem ASCT compared with single ASCT remains unclear . Here we retrospectively analyzed 978 trial and nontrial patients who underwent single or tandem ASCT in Heidelberg or other German Speaking Myeloma Multicenter Group centers . Our results show that response improvement after first ASCT is a significant prognostic factor for progression free survival benefit from tandem versus single ASCT multivariable analysis
