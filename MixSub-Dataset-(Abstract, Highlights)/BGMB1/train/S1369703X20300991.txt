 In previous study we conducted removal of oil droplets in o w emulsion by flotation involving addition of methylated milk casein as a flocculant in a batch system and proposed a simple kinetic model to evaluate the removal rate constant

@highlight Variation in dosage of MeCS significantly affected flotation rate and efficiency
@highlight Flotation efficiency is proportional to clarification efficiency by flocculation
@highlight Flotation kinetic model agreed well with experimental data
@highlight Flotation rate could be evaluated by the removal rate constant of the proposed model
