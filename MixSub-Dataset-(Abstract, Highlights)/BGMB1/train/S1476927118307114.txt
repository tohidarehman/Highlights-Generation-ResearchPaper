 ATP dependent ParE enzyme is as an attractive target for the development of antibacterial agents . Atom based 3D QSAR model AADHR.187 was developed based on the thirty eight

@highlight A highly predictive five point 3D QSAR model AADHR.187 was developed.
@highlight Model was validated by the external data set and enrichment study.
@highlight We identified five potential hits against
@highlight ParE by
@highlight pharmacophore based HTVS.
@highlight 30 ns MD simulation was performed to validate the docking pose.
@highlight Three new molecules have been proposed having high binding affinity for
@highlight ParE enzyme.
