 The cyclotides are the largest known family of cyclic proteins which are found in several plant families including Violaceae . They are circular bioactive peptides consisting of 28 37 amino acids which possess a cyclic cystine knot motif and could be useful in biotechnology and drug design as scaffolds for peptide based drugs . This study describes our finding of a potentially novel gene transcript from the petals of the Iranian

@highlight A potentially novel gene product suggested here which may encode a cyclotide like precursor with a conserved ER signal sequence a cysteine rich sequence forming 2 zin. finger motifs and a cyclotide like region containing two highly conserved C residues.
@highlight studies have provided interesting homologies between the suggested cyclotide like precursor and several other unidentified sequences.
@highlight Three dimensional prediction of cyclotide like precursor demonstrates unusual structure without CCK motif.
@highlight This report may challenge the current viewpoints about the evolution of cyclotides.
