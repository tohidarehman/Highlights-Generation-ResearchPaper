 Hypoxia inducible factor 1 is the oxygen sensitive subunit of HIF1 transcription factor . Its variations is associated with several diseases including different type of cancer cardiovascular diseases and liver and kidney failure . Despite all the investigations carried out on the single nucleotide polymorphisms of

@highlight gene sequence changes can influence its expression and probably be associated with different kinds of diseases such as many types of cancers.
@highlight There are many uncharacterized nonsynonymous SNPs in
@highlight gene that may have a potentially damaging effect on the protein function.
@highlight Computational analysis and in silico tools are considered as a beneficial alternative to screen deleterious SNPs from enormous neutral ones.
