 Microorganism selection is critical to deglycosylation in soybean fermentation for producing beneficial phytochemicals . This study investigated isoflavone bioconversion in soybean extract inoculated with

@highlight Enzymetically different lactobacilli were evaluated to isoflavone bioconversion.
@highlight Daidzein glucosides were most affective in bioconversion pattern between
@highlight Malonyl genistin was most degradable isoflavone glucosides by
@highlight Accumulation patterns of glycitein were reversely presented from those of daidzein and genistein.
