 Up to 40 of boys with adrenoleukodystrophy develop a severe central nervous system demyelinating form characterized by white matter changes and gadolinium enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging . Hematopoietic cell transplant is the only proven means to attenuate cALD progression . The elimination of active neuroinflammation is indicated radiographically by the resolution of gadolinium enhancement and correlates to speed of donor neutrophil recovery . We analyzed 66 boys with cALD undergoing HCT for biomarkers correlating with early Gd signal resolution . We found that log Gd volume cm

@highlight Blood brain barrier disruption in cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy cALD is indicated by gadolinium enhancement.
@highlight Gadolinium can be quantified on pre hematopoietic cell transplant HCT magnetic resonance imaging.
@highlight Gadolinium volume pre HCT correlates to timing of gadolinium resolution after HCT.
@highlight Early gadolinium resolution after HCT is associated with less neurologic progression 1 year post HCT.
