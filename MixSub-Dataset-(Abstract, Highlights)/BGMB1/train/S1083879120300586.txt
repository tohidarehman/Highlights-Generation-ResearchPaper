 Permanent impairment of vital organs is one of the transplantation related health problems affecting the quality of life and morbidity even in patients who do not develop graft versus host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation but no data are available on PI of multiple organs . This retrospective study aimed to estimate a novel composite endpoint of PI free relapse free survival in 164 allo HCT recipients . We defined PI as 26 to 30 impairment of the whole person in 6 vital organs using the whole person impairment rating . Conventional GVHD free relapse free survival and PIRFS at 5 years were 33.8 26.5 to 41.3 and 40.6 respectively . In the whole cohort PIRFS was higher than GRFS at any time after allo HCT . However PIRFS was lower than GRFS after day 397 post transplantation in patients who underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation . In UCBT recipients 5 year GRFS and PIRFS were 47.6 and 39.2 respectively . The cumulative incidence of PI after 5 years was 20.9 in patients surviving for 6 months without relapse . The multivariate analysis revealed that high disease risk 1.91 95 CI 1.26 to 2.88

@highlight We estimated permanent impairment of 6 vital organs in allogeneic transplantation.
@highlight The 5 year permanent impairment free relapse free survival PIRFS was 40.6 .
@highlight PIRFS is an endpoint to assess long term transplantation success from a novel perspective.
