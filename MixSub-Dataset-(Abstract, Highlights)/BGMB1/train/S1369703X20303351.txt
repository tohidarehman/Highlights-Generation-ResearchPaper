 mediated 15 hydroxylation of D ethylgonendione is a key step for industrial production of gestodene . However the process efficiency is limited due to the poor solubility of the steroid in aqueous water system . Deep eutectic solvents are promising solvents applied widely in biocatalysis . Here we systematically investigated the biotransformation performance of

@highlight DESs could improve the biotransformation efficiency of 15 hydroxylation of D ethylgonendione.
@highlight DESs with different HBD exhibited different effects on the biotransformation.
@highlight Synthetic effects of DESs on steroid hydroxylation was also observed.
@highlight  ChCl Gly is the most potential in steroid hydroxylation mediated by
