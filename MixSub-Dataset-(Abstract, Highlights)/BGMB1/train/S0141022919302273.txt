 The successful enzymatic synthesis of various ganglioside related oligosaccharides requires many available glycan processing enzymes . However the number of available glycan processing enzymes remains limited . In this study the full length CgtA43456

@highlight The codon optimized CgtA43456 was produced in C41 DE3 co expressed with GroEL ES.
@highlight The codon optimized CgtB11168 was produced in C41 DE3 .
@highlight The enzymes were obtained with 7578 purity using immobilized metal affinity chromatography.
@highlight The specific activities of CgtA43456 and CgtB11168 were 21 and 16 mU mg respectively.
