 Aldo keto reductases are nicotinamide dependent enzymes that catalyze the transformation of aldehydes and ketones into alcohols . They are spread across all phyla and those from microbial origin have proved to be highly robust and versatile biocatalysts . In this work we have discovered and characterized a microbial AKR from the yeast

@highlight AKR3B4 is a new aldo keto reductase from yeast
@highlight AKR3B4 transforms aldehydes into alcohols and do not catalyze the reverse reaction.
@highlight Aromatic aldehydes 3 furaldehyde and xylose are accepted as substrates.
@highlight AKR3B4 has very good stability at medium temperatures in a broad range of pH and in organic solvents.
@highlight AKR3B4 has potential to be used as biocatalyst in chemoenzymatic processes.
