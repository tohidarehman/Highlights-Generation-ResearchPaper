 We have previously studied the effect of nitrate addition on the souring caused by sulfate reducing bacteria . It revealed that the nitrate addition could suppress the growth of SRB and stimulate the growth of nitrate reducing bacteria . It is not quite clear however whether NRB could lead to souring in oil fields and Microbiologically Influenced Corrosion . In this study we isolated NRB and investigated the effect of isolated NRB on souring and MIC . Based on 16S ribosomal RNA identification isolated NRB belongs to the genus

@highlight YB03 preferred toluene m p xylene and VFAs as carbon source.
@highlight The addition of nitrate could not control souring caused by
@highlight YB03.
@highlight YB03 was found to be a corrosive nitrate reducer against steel.
