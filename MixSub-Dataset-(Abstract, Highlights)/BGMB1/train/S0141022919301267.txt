 Conjugated linolenic acid has important health effects and their phospholipids forms are advantageous vehicles of this bioactive agent . Acidolysis of soybean phosphatidylcholine with conjugated linolenic acid catalyzed by Lecitase Ultra immobilized on Duolite A658 was studied . This reaction is typically limited by hydrolysis producing 6090 of lyso and glycero PC and yielding low the process efficiency . Drying the amphiphilic PC material was found the key factor for maximal diacylglycerol phosphatidylcholines production and different drying approaches were studied to maximize the formation of PC rich in CLA in a solvent free process .
