 Acute graft versus host disease contributes to poor outcomes following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation . Data are limited regarding the economic burden of acute GVHD particularly steroid refractory or high risk disease . This retrospective analysis of the Premier Healthcare Database reports inpatient healthcare resource utilization costs and mortality during initial hospitalization for allogeneic HCT and through 100 days post HCT among patients who developed acute GVHD including a subgroup with SR HR disease compared with patients without GVHD . The analysis included adults discharged for first HCT between January 1 2011 and June 30 2016 . During the initial hospitalization for HCT patients with acute GVHD and SR HR acute GVHD had significantly longer median lengths of stay and higher median total costs versus patients with no GVHD n 1529

@highlight Inpatient healthcare resource utilization HCRU and costs for acute versus no graft versus host disease GVHD up to 100 days post hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT were assessed.
@highlight Acute GVHD was associated with greater inpatient HCRU and total costs compared with no GVHD.
@highlight Inpatient HCRU and costs were especially high with steroid refractory acute GVHD.
@highlight Acute GVHD was associated with high 100 day post HCT inpatient mortality.
