 Recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from unrelated donors and mismatched related donors typically have a higher incidence of acute and chronic graft versus host disease compared with matched related donors . Anti T cell globulins are often used to reduce GVHD in these recipients . We report the outcomes of 211 adult peripheral blood stem cell transplant recipients with myeloid malignancies who received a standardized transplant protocol in which ATG was administered to recipients of URD and MMRD but not MRD transplant . For all patients incidence of acute GVHD grades 2 to 4 was 21.4 and chronic GVHD was 35.0 . Two year overall survival was 63.2 relapse free survival was 55.3 and GVHD free relapse free survival was 30.7 . There were no differences between recipients of MRDs and other donors in relapse nonrelapse mortality and overall and relapse free survival . However compared with MRD recipients from URDs and MMRDs had reduced moderate to severe chronic GVHD 10.4 versus 30.1

@highlight A standardized protocol was implemented for peripheral blood stem cell allogeneic transplants for myeloid malignancies.
@highlight Unrelated and mismatched donor recipients were given Thymoglobuline while matched related donors did not receive Thymoglobuline.
@highlight Recipients from unrelated and mismatched donors had less chronic graft versus host disease GVHD requiring systemic therapy.
@highlight As a result unrelated and mismatched donor transplants had superior GVHD free relapse free survival.
