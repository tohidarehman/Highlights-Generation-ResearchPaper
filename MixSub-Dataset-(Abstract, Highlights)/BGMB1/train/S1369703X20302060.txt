 Nowadays an increasing amount of studies indicate the numerous applications of bacteriophages . However so far there is limited availability of simple efficient and sensitive methods for evaluation and comparison of the phages lytic activity against its host . The aim of this paper is the examination of a new methodological approach for the comparative evaluation of bacteriophages lytic activity against bacterial host . For this purpose two model bacteria gram positive

@highlight Chosen bacteriophages three kayviruses for
@highlight and three wildtypes T4 like for
@highlight  were cultivated.
@highlight Phages lytic activity was measured experimentally for different MOI.
@highlight A new mathematical method to evaluate phages lytic activity was proposed.
@highlight Obtained data showed that the new method allows evaluating phages lytic activity very precisely.
