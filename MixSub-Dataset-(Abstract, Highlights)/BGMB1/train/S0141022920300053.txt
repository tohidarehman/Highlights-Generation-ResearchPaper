 A textile based reaction system for new peroxidase reactions in non native media was implemented . The epoxidation of cyclohexene by the commercial peroxidase MaxiBright was realized with the textile immobilized enzyme in an adapted liquid liquid two phase reactor . A commercially available polyester felt was used as low price carrier and functionalized with polyvinyl amine . The covalent immobilization with glutardialdehyde lead to an enzyme loading of 0.10 g

@highlight Immobilization of a peroxidase on textiles boosts its solvent stability.
@highlight The textile biocatalyst can be applied for enzymatic epoxidation.
@highlight A textile reactor design allows to increase product yields.
