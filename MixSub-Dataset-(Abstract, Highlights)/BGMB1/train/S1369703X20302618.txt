 5GB1 has been identified as a promising biocatalyst for industrial methane conversion to produce value added products . However despite recent advancements in understanding the metabolism of 5GB1 existing knowledge on the differences between oxygen limited and methane limited phenotypes is still limited . In this work both batch and continuous experiments were carried out to systematically examine the strains oxygen limited and methane limited phenotypes . Total carbon balances were performed to ensure the obtained measurements of CH

@highlight partial pressure determines the cell growth rate for batch growth.
@highlight Cell growth rate has to be controlled to achieve different phenotypes.
@highlight For continuous culture cells prior growth condition affects current physiology.
@highlight Carbon limited growth condition produces more organic compounds.
@highlight The current GEM lacks key metabolic routes to explain different phenotypes.
