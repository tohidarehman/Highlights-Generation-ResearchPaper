 Large series of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia after ex vivo T cell depleted allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have not been reported previously . We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 266 patients with AML who received CD34 selected TCD allo HSCTs while in first or second complete remission at a single institution . The conditioning regimens were all myeloablative and no additional graft versus host disease prophylaxis was given . The cumulative incidences of grade II IV and grade III IV acute GVHD at 180 days were 14 10 to 18 and 3 respectively . The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 3 years was 3 . The 3 year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was 21 and that of relapse was 21 . Overall survival and disease free survival at 1 3 and 5 years were 75 61 and 56 and 68 57 and 53 respectively . There were no significant differences in OS DFS and relapse rates for patients who underwent transplantation in CR1 and those who did so in CR2 . However patients with high risk cytogenetics at diagnosis had significantly poorer outcomes . The OS and DFS rates compare favorably with those for unmodified allo HSCT but with considerably lower rates of GVHD .

@highlight Ex vivo T cell depleted TCD hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCT in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia AML in first or second complete remission CR1 CR2 is associated with comparable overall survival and disease free survival to unmodified HSCT.
@highlight Transplantation outcomes are similar in patients with AML CR1 CR2 following TCD HSCT.
@highlight The risk of relapse after ex vivo TCD HSCT is no higher than after unmodified HSCT.
@highlight Ex vivo TCD HSCT is associated with a significantly lower rate of graft versus host disease compared with unmodified HSCT.
