 Treatment for relapse of chronic myeloid leukemia following hematopoietic cell transplantation includes tyrosine kinase inhibitors with or without donor lymphocyte infusions but the most effective treatment strategy is unknown . This study was performed through the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database . We retrospectively reviewed all patients reported to the CIBMTR registry from 2002 to 2014 who underwent HCT for CML and were alive 30 days postrelapse . A total of 215 HCT recipients relapsed and were analyzed in the following groups TKI alone TKI with DLI and DLI without TKI . In multivariate analysis disease status prior to HCT had a significant effect on overall survival . Patients who received a DLI alone compared with a TKI with a DLI had inferior survival hazard ratio 2.28 95 confidence interval 1.23 to 4.24

@highlight In the setting of chronic myeloid leukemia CML relapse after hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIs are an effective treatment strategy.
@highlight Donor lymphocyte infusions DLIs added to TKIs do not appear to add benefit.
@highlight DLIs alone when compared with TKIs alone have inferior survival in patients with CML relapsing after HCT.
