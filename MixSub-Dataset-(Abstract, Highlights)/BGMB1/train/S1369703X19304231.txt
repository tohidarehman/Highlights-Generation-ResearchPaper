 In this work was presented a strategy to produce to concentrate and to apply a cocktail containing cell wall degrading enzymes . The novelties and the differences of this study from the others lie in the fact of defining the entire production process of a second generation biopesticide and in addition an enzyme cocktail will be produced and not a single enzyme as usually studied . Enzymes were produced by solid state fermentation using

@highlight High production of cell wall degrading enzymes.
@highlight Membrane technology was efficient for enzyme enzymes concentration.
@highlight Concentrated enzymes presented insecticidal activity.
