 Myo inositol is widely used in drug food and animal feed industries . In this study the myo inositol biosynthetic pathway was established in

@highlight A biosynthetic pathway of myo inositol was constructed in
@highlight The initial glucose concentration had an obvious effect on the inositol production.
@highlight Higher glucose concentration did not favor the plasmid stability.
@highlight The production profile of myo inositol was investigated in a 1L shake flask.
