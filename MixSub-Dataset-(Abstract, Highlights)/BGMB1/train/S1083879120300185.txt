 A multicenter retrospective study was performed to evaluate the prognostic factors in 104 patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation between 2005 and 2015 . The median age was 38 and the median blast fraction in peripheral blood and bone marrow was 1 and 52 respectively . With a median follow up of 47 months overall survival nonrelapse mortality and relapse mortality at 1 year were 25 44 and 31 respectively . Multivariate analysis demonstrated independent predictors for poor OS including nuclear cell count in the bone marrow 1010

@highlight Prognostic factors for relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT recipients were evaluated.
@highlight Higher nuclear cell count in bone marrow is one of the independent predictors for poor survival.
@highlight The scoring may be useful in identifying patients who will receive the least benefit from HCT.
