 Long term therapy related reproductive health side effects impact the quality of life of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation survivors . In this study we evaluated the prevalence of gonadal dysfunction pre and post HSCT analyzed factors associated with GD and explored rates of fertility assessment and fertility preservation in a resource limited setting . FA and outcomes of patients age 45 years undergoing HSCT between June 2000 and May 2018 were collected retrospectively . We included 213 patients with a median age of 26 years . Pre HSCT FA was performed in 71.8 with a GD rate of 17 . The rate of GD was not different between the sexes females 19.5 versus males 16.1

@highlight Quality of life in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCT survivors is impaired by reproductive outcomes.
@highlight Fertility assessment and preservation must be prioritized at time of diagnosis.
@highlight In both pre and post HSCT settings women are at higher risk of developing gonadal dysfunction.
@highlight Low and middle income countries face additional reproductive challenges.
@highlight Strategies favoring fertility assessment and preservation are of utmost importance.
