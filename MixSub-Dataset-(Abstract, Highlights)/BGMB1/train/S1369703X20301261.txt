 In this study an analysis of the hydrodynamic effects on the hexadecane uptake strategies of a bacterial consortium in an airlift bioreactor was performed using mathematical modelling . The model was developed by considering the capacity of the consortium to consume HXD either directly through direct interfacial contact or through uptake of emulsified forms . The model was fitted to experimental data 0.822 R

@highlight The kinetic model considers DC and EF as the two principal strategies in HXD uptake.
@highlight increases led to high oxygen and HXD uptake both predicted by the model.
@highlight The major microbial strategy was DC with an HXD uptake among 90.897.66 .
@highlight The model show that hydrophobicity and bacterial shape are critical for HXD uptake.
