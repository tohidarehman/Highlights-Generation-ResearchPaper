 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been used to treat many malignant and nonmalignant hematologic conditions however the use of HSCT in patients who refuse blood transfusions has rarely been described in the literature and no data have been published concerning haploidentical HSCT without the use of blood products . The aim of this study is to describe the experience of a Brazilian group in performing 21 HSCTs without the use of blood components in the first 100 days after transplantation which is the period corresponding to the greatest risk of toxicity for this procedure . We developed 21 HSCTs without transfusion support in 19 patients admitted to 2 Brazilian transplantation centers . The patients were subjected to stem cell mobilization and different conditioning regimens . No mortality related to the procedure occurred among the transplant recipients . The global survival rate after 100 days which is the period related to the immediate toxicity of HSCT was 94.7 and the median duration of follow up was 980 days with an overall survival rate of 68.4 . Thus refusal of blood transfusion is not an absolute contraindication for HSCT . This therapy is feasible in specific situations when the patient clearly expresses a desire to avoid blood transfusions and when favorable clinical conditions are achievable with strict specialized medical monitoring .

@highlight Bloodless bone marrow transplantations were performed without treatment related mortality.
@highlight There are no previously published data on haploidentical transplantation without blood products.
@highlight Transplantation without transfusion can be used in other conditions without hemotherapy support.
