 Pectinase is one of the most widely used enzymes in different fields of food industry for different purposes such as clarification of fruit juice extraction of vegetable oil and saccharification of agricultural substrates . The aim of this study is to produce recombinant pectinase and evaluate the effect of codon optimization and promoter selection on production .

@highlight Recombinant pectinase was successfully expressed in
@highlight and characterized.
@highlight The highest production level was achieved with the cPGL using the
@highlight promoter.
@highlight The optimum working conditions of the enzyme was determined as 50C and pH 5.0.
@highlight The enzyme maintained its activity to a great extent in tested organic solvents.
@highlight The properties of the enzyme showed its potential for juice clarification processes.
