 In this retrospective analysis we evaluated the impact of age on the outcome of patients with multiple myeloma who received an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at our institution . A total of 1128 patients were divided into the older and the younger groups . Compared with the younger cohort older patients had a higher International Staging System stage versus 215 ISS III 52 versus 211

@highlight This retrospective analysis compares the outcome of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma NDMM aged 70 versus 70 years n 1128 .
@highlight Age cutoff at 70 years is higher than in most other retrospective studies that performed a similar analysis.
@highlight There is an association between age at transplantation with progression free survival and overall survival of patients with NDMM who underwent autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
