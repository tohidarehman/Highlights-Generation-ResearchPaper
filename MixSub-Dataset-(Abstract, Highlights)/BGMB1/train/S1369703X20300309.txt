 Bioreactor design is a challenging endeavour that aims to provide the most ideal environment in which cells can grow and biological reactions can occur . The emergence of regenerative medicine and stem cell therapies has led to the need for more diverse environmental requirements in the bioreactor design space .

@highlight Additive manufacturing can be used to enhance bioreactor design and functionality.
@highlight CFD was employed to evaluate the flow dynamics generated by 3D printed components.
@highlight Precision design of flow distributor induced swirling fluidization of particles.
@highlight A prototype bioreactor was developed and assessed for cell seeding and expansion.
