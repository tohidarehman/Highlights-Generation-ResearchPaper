 Angiotensin II type 1 receptor activating autoantibodies have gained attention in solid organ transplant as non HLA antibodies associated with rejection vasculopathy and graft dysfunction . These antibodies have also been reported in the context of pre eclampsia scleroderma and isolated hypertension . Here we present 3 post hematopoietic stem cell transplant cases with patients demonstrating elevated levels of AT1R AAs detected within the first year post HSCT . All patients had hypertension and 2 patients exhibited profound diarrhea and hypokalemia . The hypertension in all cases was refractory to multiple classes of antihypertensives . Upon autoantibody identification an angiotensin receptor blocker losartan was promptly initiated and all patients showed blood pressure improvement . The 2 patients with electrolyte disturbances had rapid normalization of these levels and resolution of the diarrhea . These cases demonstrate a previously unreported association of elevated AT1R AA levels in post HSCT patients with a rapid response to angiotensin receptor blockade initiation .

@highlight Patients are at risk of developing angiotensin II type 1 receptor activating autoantibodies AT1R AAs in the post hematopoietic stem cell transplant period.
@highlight AT1R AAs can drive hypertension refractory to non angiotensin receptor blockade ARB therapies.
@highlight AT1R AAs may play a role in intestinal graft versus host disease pathology.
@highlight Prompt ARB initiation may mitigate AT1R AA related pathology.
