 Lipase immobilized nanomaterials with high activity and stable reusability would have a great impact in different fields . However developing such materials has proven to be challenging . Herein polymer coated magnetic nanoparticles displaying long alkyl chains either octyl or hexadecyl have been prepared and used for immobilization of

@highlight Polyacrylamide pAcDED coated magnetic nanoparticles MNPs functionalized with alkyl chains C8 and C16 were developed.
@highlight Lipase loading was approximately 50 greater onto hydrophilic pAcDED coated MNPs than alkyl chain modified MNPs.
@highlight MNPs displaying long alkyl chains C16 promote lipase binding in open conformation.
@highlight Lipase loaded MNPs pAcDED C16 shows hyperactivation and thermostability higher than free lipase.
@highlight The MNPs pAcDED C16 biocatalyst recovered by magnetic separation maintains unaltered activity for 4 consecutive cycles.
