 Solving the protein folding problem is one of the grand challenges still open in computational biophysics . Globular proteins are believed to evolve from initial configurations through folding pathways connecting several thermodynamically accessible states in a free energy landscape until reaching its minimum inhabited by the stable native structures . Despite its huge computational burden molecular dynamics is the leading approach in the PFP studies by preserving the Newtonian temporal evolution in the canonical ensemble . Non trivial improvements are provided by highly parallel implementations of MD in cost effective GPUs concomitant to multiscale descriptions of proteins by coarse grained minimalist models . In this vein we present the PathMolD AB framework a comprehensive software package for massively parallel MD simulations using the canonical ensemble structural analysis and visualization of the folding pathways using the minimalist AB model . It has also a tool to compare the results with proteins re scaled from the PDB . We simulate and analyze as case studies the folding of four proteins 13FIBO 2GB1 1PLC and 5ANZ with 13 55 99 and 223 amino acids respectively . The datasets generated from simulations correspond to the MD evolution of 3500 folding pathways encompassing
