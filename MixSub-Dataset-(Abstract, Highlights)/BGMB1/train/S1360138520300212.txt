 Salicylic acid is a key plant hormone required for establishing resistance to many pathogens . SA biosynthesis involves two main metabolic pathways with multiple steps the isochorismate and the phenylalanine ammonia lyase pathways . Transcriptional regulations of SA biosynthesis are important for fine tuning SA level in plants . We highlight here recent discoveries on SA biosynthesis and transcriptional regulations of SA biosynthesis . In addition SA perception by NPR proteins is important to fulfil its function as a defense hormone . We highlight recent work to give a full picture of how NPR proteins support the role of SA in plant immunity . We also discuss challenges and potential opportunities for future research and application related to the functions of SA in plants .

@highlight Salicylic acid SA serves as a key hormone in plant innate immunity including resistance in both local and systemic tissue upon biotic attacks hypersensitive responses and cell death.
@highlight Key components involved in the complete metabolic steps of SA biosynthesis through the isochorismate pathway and their detailed functions have been identified.
@highlight Recent breakthroughs have revealed new mechanisms by which the endogenous SA level controls the transcriptional reprogramming via the perception of NPR proteins and their protein turnovers.
@highlight Both positive and negative transcriptional regulations of SA biosynthesis are required for fine tuning the levels of SA for optimal defense without causing unnecessary fitness cost.
