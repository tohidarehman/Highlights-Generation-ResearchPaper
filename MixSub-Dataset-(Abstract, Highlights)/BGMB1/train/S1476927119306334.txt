 Members of the let 7 family of miRNAs are well known with their tumor suppressor properties as they are expressed at low levels in several types of human malignancies . Among them let 7b and let 7c have gained special attention due their broad significance . Although the role of let 7b and let 7c have been widely reported in various types of cancers their functional importance and role in oncogenic signaling of breast cancer is poorly investigated . Therefore in the present study prognostic and diagnostic significance of let 7b and let 7c in breast cancer and the effects these miRNAs on genes involved in cancer progression were determined by using several bioinformatics analysis and validated in vitro mimic assays respectively . Using data of TCGA OncomiR and dbDEMC 2.0 overall expression analysis of let 7b and let 7c was performed . The effect of let 7b and let 7c on genes involved in cancer progression was investigated by mimic transfection assays . We found that both let 7b and let 7c were significantly altered in breast cancer and associated with the clinicopathological findings of patients . Additionally both let 7b and let 7c significantly altered oncogenic signaling in breast cancer cells . Consequently both miRNAs might have fundamental roles in breast cancer progression and can be considered as potential targets for breast cancer therapy and diagnosis .
