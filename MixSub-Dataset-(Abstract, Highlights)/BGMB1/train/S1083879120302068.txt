 The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence risk factors and outcomes of primary prolonged isolated thrombocytopenia after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant . We retrospectively analyzed patients who received haplo HSCT for various hematologic malignancies at Peking University Institute of Hematology between January 2015 and December 2016 . Of the 918 patients 93 developed primary PT . We designed a propensity score method based study . For each primary PT patient control subjects were selected using a propensity scorematching method . A total of 372 recipients were enrolled in the study 93 in the PT group and 279 in the control group . Multivariate analysis showed that age older than 25 years

@highlight This study represents the first specific report on the incidence risk factors and outcomes of primary PT after haplo HSCT.
@highlight The incidence of primary PT after haplo HSCT was 10.1 .
@highlight Primary PT was associated with poorer survival and higher TRM along with older age grades II to IV acute GVHD and EBV infection after haplo HSCT.
