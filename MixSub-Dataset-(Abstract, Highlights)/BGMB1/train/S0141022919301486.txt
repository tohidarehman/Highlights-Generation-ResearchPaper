 Enzymatic reactions refer to organic reactions catalyzed by enzymes . This review aims to enrich the documentation relative to enzymatic reactions occurring during the anaerobic degradation of residual organic substances with emphasis on the structures of organic compounds and reaction mechanisms . This allows to understand the displacement of electrons between electron rich and electron poor entities to form new bonds in products . The detailed mechanisms of enzymatic reactions relative to the production of biomethane have not yet been reviewed in the scientific literature . Hence this review is novel and timely since it discusses the chemical behavior or reactivity of different functional groups thereby allowing to better understand the enzymatic catalysis in the transformations of residual proteins carbohydrates and lipids into biomethane and fertilizers . Such understanding allows to improve the overall biomethanation efficiency in industrial applications .
