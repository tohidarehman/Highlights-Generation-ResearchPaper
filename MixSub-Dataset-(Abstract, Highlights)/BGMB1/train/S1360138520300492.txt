 Plants possess an effective immune system to combat most microbial attackers . The activation of immune responses to biotrophic pathogens requires the hormone salicylic acid . Accumulation of SA triggers a plethora of immune responses . A tradeoff of strong immune responses is the active suppression of plant growth and development . The tradeoff also works the opposite way where active growth and developmental processes suppress SA production and immune responses . Here we review research on the role of SA in the growthimmunity tradeoff and examples of how the tradeoff can be bypassed . This knowledge will be instrumental in resistance breeding of crops with optimal growth and effective immunity .

@highlight The phytohormone salicylic acid SA stimulates plant immune responses to a broad range of plant pathogens.
@highlight SA induced immune responses contribute to the growthimmunity tradeoff immune responses actively suppress growth and development and also the other way around growth and developmental processes can suppress immunity.
@highlight Immune signaling and growth related processes directly affect SA biosynthesis and metabolism to allow for a robust but transient immune response after which growth and developmental processes are reactivated
@highlight The growthimmunity tradeoff can be uncoupled by modifying signaling pathways downstream of SA.
@highlight Bypassing the antagonism of SA on growth is a desirable trait for resistance breeding in crops as this bypass can allow for sustainable resistance without yield losses.
