 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation survivors are burdened by a high prevalence and early onset of chronic diseases . Healthy dietary patterns have been associated with lower risks of chronic health conditions in the general population . HCT survivors are susceptible to multiple complications that may result in chronic illness . Unfortunately no study to date has comprehensively documented the adherence of HCT survivors to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans which are designed specifically to provide guidance for making healthy food choices . The primary aim of this study was to evaluate diet quality and nutrient intake adequacy of HCT survivors . A secondary aim was to assess these survivors willingness to take part in a future dietary intervention . The dietary intake of adults who had undergone autologous or allogeneic HCT for a hematologic disease and were at least 1 year post transplantation was assessed using the Block 2014 food frequency questionnaire and diet quality was estimated using the Healthy Eating Index 2015 . Nutrient intake adequacies of the group were estimated by the estimated average requirement cutpoint method . Survivors HEI 2015 scores averaged 61.6 1.1 . Adherence to a good quality diet was reported by only 10 of survivors . Intakes of vitamins A C and D as well as magnesium and calcium suggested inadequacy . Fiber intake at 8.9 g per 1000 kcal day fell below the recommended adequate intake . Change in taste was associated with lower quality of diet

@highlight Long term survivors of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HCT reported less than optimal adherence to the 2015 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and had numerous short fall nutrient intakes.
@highlight The majority of survivors reported willingness to receive nutritional advice and participate in a nutrition program or dietary intervention.
@highlight These findings reinforce the need to incorporate nutrition assessment and awareness into HCT survivor care.
