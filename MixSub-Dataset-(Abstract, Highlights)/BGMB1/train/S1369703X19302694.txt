 Limiting nitrogen and excess carbon sources induce accumulation of the bioplastic Poly as inclusion bodies in microbes . Here we designed a co culture

@highlight Poly 3 hydroxybutyrate synthesis was increased using co culture strategy.
@highlight Aeration and agitation optimization studies showed improved kLa.
@highlight Metabolic heat released and yield coefficients were calculated.
@highlight Synergy seen in co culture gave higher PHB yield compared to monocultures.
