 Strawberry is a fruit crop species of major horticultural importance for which fruit quality and the control of flowering runnering and the trade off between the two are main breeding targets . The octoploid cultivated strawberry has a limited genetic basis . This raises the question of how to identify important gene targets and successfully exploit them for strawberry improvement . In this Opinion article we propose to apply to woodland strawberry a wild diploid species displaying wide diversity the strategies successfully employed in recent years for the identification of genetic variations underlying fruit quality and fruit yield traits in solanaceous crops . Next we propose to use gene editing technologies to translate the findings to cultivated strawberry .

@highlight Cultivated octoploid strawberry whose production increases continuously displays limited genetic variability which impedes its improvement. Woodland strawberry one of its wild diploid ancestors exhibits wide phenotypic diversity. Tomato and potato are major crops of the Solanaceae family.
@highlight Fruit yield and quality are major breeding targets in strawberry and tomato. Stolon production is a trait important for both strawberry vegetative propagation and potato tuber production that has recently received much attention.
@highlight In tomato the exploitation of genetic diversity combined with multiomics and or gene editing strategies recently led to considerable improvement of fruit yield and quality.
