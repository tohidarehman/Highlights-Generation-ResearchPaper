 Aminobutyrate is an important bioactive compound synthesized through decarboxylation of L glutamate by the glutamate decarboxylase . Biosynthesis of GABA by lactic acid bacteria has particularly attracted attention as LAB are generally recognized as safe organisms . In this work based on identification of biosynthetic gene cluster for GABA in

@highlight The GAD system in
@highlight subsp.
@highlight CV56 has been identified.
@highlight Recombinant GadB has been biochemically characterized.
@highlight Genetic engineering has been employed to increase the expression of GAD system genes in
@highlight NZ9000.
@highlight Enhanced production of GABA by using a two stage pH control strategy.
