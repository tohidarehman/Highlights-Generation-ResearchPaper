 A valuable monomer in the synthesis of various polyesters is 5 hydroxymethyl 2 furan carboxylic acid . In this work the synthesis of HMFCA using crude HMF obtained from fructose is described . To obtain crude HMF fructose dehydration was performed by thermal treatment with Nb

@highlight Crude HMF was transformed to HMFCA by
@highlight The HMFCA concentration of 790.2mg L was obtained using the fed batch strategy.
@highlight Pyridine nucleotide disulfide oxidoreductase gene is related with HMFCA production.
