 Cytomegalovirus DNAemia occurs frequently in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients . There is limited information about the incidence features and clinical impact of CMV DNAemia blips in this setting . In this retrospective study 225 consecutive adult patients undergoing any modality of allo HSCT at our center between May 2012 and July 2019 were included . Plasma CMV DNA load was monitored using a highly sensitive real time PCR assay . In all 187 of 225 patients had CMV DNAemia through day 365 after allo HSCT . Eighty three of the 187 patients had 1 or more blips . Blips occurred as a first episode of CMV DNAemia as opposed to prolonged CMV DNAemia in 47 patients in 20 of these patients blips represented the only documented episode throughout the study period and in 27 patients blips preceded a prolonged CMV DNAemia episode . In the remaining 36 patients blips developed as recurrences . Blips presenting as initial episodes occurred more frequently

@highlight Cytomegalovirus CMV DNAemia blips occur frequently in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.
@highlight CMV DNAemia recurrences develop frequently following blips.
@highlight Initial CMV DNA load does not reliably predict the course of CMV DNAemia episodes.
@highlight Receipt of an allograft from a CMV seropositive donor was associated with the occurrence of blips.
