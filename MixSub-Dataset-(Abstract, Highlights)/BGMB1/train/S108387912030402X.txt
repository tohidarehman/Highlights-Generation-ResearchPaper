 The timing of immunosuppressive therapy used in combination with post transplantation cyclophosphamide in haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant is not standardized . We evaluated the schedules of immunosuppression therapy after haplo HSCT in 509 patients with acute leukemia receiving PTCY on days 3 and 4 along with tacrolimus with cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil from day 5 or CSA MMF from day 0 or 1 with PTCY on days 3 and 5 . Compared with the other 2 groups patients in group 3 were younger median age 46 years

@highlight There is no standard schedule for post transplantation cyclophosphamide PTCY and associated immunosuppressors in recipients of haploidentical transplantation.
@highlight Early introduction of cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil with PTCY on days 3 and 5 results in better refined graft versus host disease free relapse free survival and leukemia free survival.
