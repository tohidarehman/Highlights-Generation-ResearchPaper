 Porous cellulose beads are widely used in the adsorption field in which enhancing the structure stability and enlarging the specific surface area are the ways to improve the adsorption efficiency . Here a preliminary chemical cross linking strategy is explored to construct the tough and highly porous cellulose beads as high efficient adsorbent . Especially the customized cellulose solution is preliminarily mixed with a cross linking agent for emulsification and followed by cellulose regeneration . The entrapped cross linking agent creates the inner covalent linkages between the neighboring long cellulose chains which accounts for strong mechanical strength of cellulose framework . Meanwhile the entrapped covalent bonds disrupt the normal growth of cellulose crystalline and lead to more amorphousness which conduces to high specific surface area . Finally the proposed cellulose beads after being modified by DEAE were evaluated for protein adsorption . As a result the obtained porous cellulose beads exhibits high adsorption capacities BSA 204.58mgg
