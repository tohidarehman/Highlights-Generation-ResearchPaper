 Engineering active sites in inert scaffolds to catalyze chemical transformations with unnatural substrates is still a great challenge for enzyme catalysis . In this research a p nitrobenzyl esterase from

@highlight Scaffolds for the hydrolysis of ceftizoxime were selected from the protein structural database.
@highlight New enzymes were redesigned for the hydrolysis of ceftizoxime.
@highlight The catalytic efficiencies of the new enzymes were promoted by the computational enzyme design method.
@highlight The kinetically controlled synthesis of ceftizoxime was developed in a fully aqueous medium.
