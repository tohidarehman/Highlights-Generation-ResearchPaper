 Saccharification of cellulosic biomass for the fermentation of transportation fuels faces several challenges . Cellulose is highly stable and even with enzymatic assistance decomposition of cellulose is slow . Additionally the enzymes are expensive and sensitive to thermal and mechanical inactivation . In this work we studied the effects of moderate electric field treatments on the effectiveness of enzymatic saccharification . MEF treatments were applied to determine their effects on enzyme activity . We considered the effects of field strength frequency application regime and temperature . It was found that the enzyme responded to alterations in the frequency of the waveform with 50 to 60Hz maximizing the effects of the field although the effects of field strength and application regime were more significant . It was found that the electric field could have a positive negative or negligible effect depending on the field strength . Most notably when MEF treatments were applied over a range of temperatures it was found that MEF treatment significantly improved enzyme activity at lower temperatures leading to the observation that MEF treatment imitates a temperature increase . Calculations simulating the electrophoretic motion of the enzymes verified that the magnitude of motion associated with the MEF treatments was qualitatively similar to the change in molecular motion associated with temperature increases .

@highlight Moderate Electric Fields MEF enhance hydrolysis of cellulose by cellulase at below optimal temperatures
@highlight The enhancement is greatest at lower temperatures
@highlight At or above optimal temperatures enzyme inactivation occurs with MEF
@highlight Under MEF electrophoretic motion appears to cause enzymes to behave as if at a slightly higher temperature than their surroundings.
