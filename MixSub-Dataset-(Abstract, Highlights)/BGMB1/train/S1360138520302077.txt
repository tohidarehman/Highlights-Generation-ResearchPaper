 Plastoquinone 9 is an essential component of photosynthesis that carries electrons in the linear and alternative electron transport chains and is also a redox sensor that regulates state transitions and gene expression . However a large fraction of the PQ pool is located outside the thylakoid membranes in the plastoglobules and the chloroplast envelopes reflecting a wider range of functions beyond electron transport . This review describes new functions of PQ in photoprotection as a potent antioxidant and in chloroplast metabolism as a cofactor in the biosynthesis of chloroplast metabolites . It also focuses on the essential need for tight environmental control of PQ biosynthesis and for active exchange of this compound between the thylakoid membranes and the plastoglobules . Through its multiple functions PQ connects photosynthesis with metabolism light acclimation and stress tolerance .

@highlight Plastoquinone PQ 9 is an electron carrier that plays an essential role in photosynthesis where it is involved in linear and alternative electron flows. However the functions of PQ go far beyond photosynthesis.
@highlight PQ 9 is a multilocation compound that is partitioned in the chloroplast between thylakoids plastoglobules and envelopes. Its distribution is modulated dynamically by various regulatory enzymes as a function of the environmental conditions.
@highlight The redox state of the PQ pool plays a crucial role in various functional and metabolic processes such as light acclimation biosynthesis of metabolites and gene expression.
@highlight PQ is a potent antioxidant that scavenges reactive oxygen species and mitigates lipid peroxidation
@highlight  supplementing the photoprotection provided by carotene in photosystem II and tocopherols in the thylakoid lipid phase.
