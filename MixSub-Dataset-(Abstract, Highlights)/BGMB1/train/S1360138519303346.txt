 Strigolactones are a class of plant hormones involved in several biological processes that are of great agricultural concern . While initiating plantfungal symbiosis SLs also trigger germination of parasitic plants that pose a major threat to farming . In vascular plants SLs control shoot branching which is linked to crop yield . SL research has been a fascinating field that has produced a variety of different signaling models reflecting a complex picture of hormone perception . Here we review recent developments in the SL field and the crystal structures that gave rise to various models of receptor activation . We also highlight the increasing number of discovered SL molecules reflecting the existence of cross kingdom SL communication .

@highlight SLs are a class of plant hormones that are involved in agriculturally important processes such as shoot branching arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis and germination of parasitic plants.
@highlight An increasing number of different SLs have been identified.
@highlight Structural biology has been a treasure trove for SL research but has also been a source of confusion.
@highlight Recent studies show that different species have independently developed similar features to regulate the architecture of their SL receptors.
@highlight New findings suggest that the intact SL molecule is part of a catalytically arrested D14 D3 MAX2 interaction but that a histidine butenolide complex stabilizes the complex with the transcriptional repressor.
