 The aim of this study was to establish a phenomenological model capable of describing the mass transfer and kinetic effects of the

@highlight Phenomenological model for the
@highlight transesterification of microalgal biomass
@highlight The model predicts the mass transfer of the transesterification reaction
@highlight The model fits the experimental data and adequately describes the reaction kinetics
@highlight The Volume Elements Method was used in the model development
