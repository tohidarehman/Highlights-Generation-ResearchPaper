 Hematopoietic cell transplantation is a well established treatment to control and or cure many malignant and nonmalignant diseases involving the hematopoietic system and some solid tumors . We report information about HCT procedures performed in the United States in 2018 and analyze trends and outcomes of HCT as reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research . Overall compared with 2017 the number of allogeneic HCTs performed in the United States increased by 1 and the number of autologous HCTs decreased by 5 . Key findings are fewer autologous HCTs performed for non Hodgkin lymphoma and increasing numbers of haploidentical HCTs nearly all of which use post transplantation cyclophosphamide for graft versus host disease prophylaxis . There is a continuing increase in HCT in adults age 70 years particularly for acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes . Survival rates by disease disease stage donor type and age are presented . This report prepared annually by the CIBMTR provides a snapshot of current transplant activity in the United States .
