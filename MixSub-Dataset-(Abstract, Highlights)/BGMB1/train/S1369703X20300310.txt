 L Asparaginase is a key component in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia but several clinical disadvantages such as immunogenicity and rapid clearance are still present . We evaluated the possibility to synthesize a new L ASNase from

@highlight WT L ASNase expressed in yeast was successfully glycosylated secreted and purified.
@highlight The yeast strain was able to glycosylate all glycosylation sites of WT L ASNase.
@highlight Mutations at L ASNase glycosylation sites influenced its biological properties.
@highlight Mutated L ASNase showed a significant increase in biological activity relative to WT.
@highlight Glycosylation increases L ASNase stability and masks immunogenic epitopes.
