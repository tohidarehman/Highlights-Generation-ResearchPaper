 Programmed cell death is a genetically regulated process for the selective demise of unwanted and damaged cells . Although our understanding of plant PCD pathways has advanced significantly doubts remain on the extent of conservation of animal apoptosis in plants . At least at the primary sequence level plants do not encode the regulators of animal apoptosis . Structural analyses have enabled the identification of the B cell lymphoma 2 associated athanogene family of co chaperones in plants . This discovery suggests that some aspects of animal PCD are conserved in plants while the varied subcellular localization of plant BAGs indicates that they may have evolved distinct functions . Here we review plant BAG proteins with an emphasis on their roles in the regulation of plant PCD .

@highlight Plants do not encode homologs of the core regulators of animal apoptosis.
@highlight The plant Bcl 2 associated athanogene BAG family is conserved at the structural level is localized in a variety of subcellular locations and may have diverged unique functions not observed for animal BAGs.
@highlight Arabidopsis BAG proteins have been implicated in multiple plant PCD pathways.
@highlight The presence of the calmodulin binding domain in three family members AtBAG57 is unique to plants and may suggest potential roles for BAGs in calcium signaling as part of plant PCD pathway regulation.
