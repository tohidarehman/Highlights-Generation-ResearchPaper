 Tamoxifen is a prodrug and cytochrome P450 2C9 has a significant role in the formation of a therapeutically more potent metabolite than tamoxifen . Since CYP2C9 exhibits genetic polymorphism it may contribute to different phenotypic drug response . Moreover it may be misleading if the possibility of heterogeneous clinical observations of pharmacogenetic investigations is ignored . Above all clinical investigation of all the polymorphic variants is beyond the scope of a pharmacogenetic study . Therefore in order to understand the genotype phenotype association it is aimed to study the interatomic interactions of amino acid substitutions in CYP2C9 variants in the presence of tamoxifen . Computational structural biology approach was adopted to study the effect of amino acid substitutions of polymorphic variants of CYP2C9 R144C I359L D360E R150H R335W and L90P on the flexibility of the enzyme in the presence of tamoxifen . The mutations were selected based on previously determined associations on genotype and clinical outcome of drugs .

@highlight CYP2C9 is involved in the metabolism of tamoxifen evident in the described study.
@highlight Docking study concludes the formation of 4 hydroxytamoxifen by CYP2C9.
@highlight MD simulations of CYP2C9 amino acid substitutions 2 3 5 8 11 and 13 bound with tamoxifen exhibit structural changes.
@highlight Modulations were apparent in the substrate specificity determining region and the substrate access egress channels.
@highlight Structural changes in CYP2C9 2 3 5 8 11 and 13 are involved in the variable enzyme activity of tamoxifen.
