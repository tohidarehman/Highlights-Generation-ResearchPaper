 2 Phenylethanol is an important flavour and fragrance compound with a rose like odor which is widely used in cosmetics and food industries . Natural 2 PE is costly and can not meet the market demand due to the relative low content of 2 PE in the plants . Thus there is an increasing interest in the search for alternative routes for 2 PE production . Here we demonstrate the engineering of

@highlight Improving the downstream pathway from phenylpyruvate to 2 PE could increase the biosynthesis of 2 PE in
@highlight Increasing the downstream pathway from phenylpyruvate to 2 PE could improve 2 PE production.
@highlight Increasing simultaneously the upstream pathway and the downstream pathway could further improve 2 PE production.
