 Anatomical subsites always harbor specific biological features in carcinogenesis . The divergent prognosis of proximal gastric cancer and distal gastric cancer has been reported . The current study aimed to comprehensively interpret anatomic subsite specic genomic profiles which may improve the effectiveness of personalized management . Survival and genomic data from the online Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases were queried for prognostic and genetic analysis respectively . Propensity score matching analysis was performed to balance patient epidemiological factors . Differentially expressed genes were analyzed using the DESeq algorithm . Functional enrichment was performed by the clusterProfiler package . The protein protein interaction network of DEGs was predicted by the online STRING database . A total of 3 955 patient pairs were assembled by PSM in SEER data with even background characteristics . Prognostic analysis indicated worse overall survival of PGC than DGC . Genetic analysis of TCGA database identified 280 DEGs 90 of which were upregulated in the DGC group and the remaining 190 were upregulated in the PGC group . Functional enrichment analysis indicated that kallikrein serine protease activity ion channel Na The current study first demonstrated that PGC exerts poorer survival outcome than DGC based on the SEER database . Further bioinformatic investigation depicts the specific genetic features for PGC and DGC which may generate differences in tumor malignancy . Our findings provide promising genetic targets for future specific and individualized gastric cancer therapy .

@highlight PGC exerts poorer survival outcome than DGC based on the SEER database.
@highlight Specific genetic features for PGC and DGC was depicted.
@highlight Serine protease and ion channel activity conttribute to PGC poor prognosis.
@highlight Alcohol retinol and lipoprotein metabolism are the features for DGC malignancy.
