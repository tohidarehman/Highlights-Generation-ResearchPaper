 Plants regulate the synthesis of specialized compounds through the actions of individual transcription factors or sets of TFs . One such compound artemisinin from

@highlight It is increasingly recognized that different TFs act conjointly to regulate the production of plant metabolites. However their dual functionality in regulating distinct pathways of synthesis has not been well studied.
@highlight The identification of
@highlight regulatory elements within the promoter regions of genes encoding different pathway enzymes enables the identification of TF families that regulate their expression.
@highlight Parallel regulation of the enzyme coding genes for distinct pathways can simplify overexpression strategies.
@highlight This provides an excellent starting point to unravel how individual TFs act in a coordinated manner to simultaneously regulate different pathways of specialized metabolism.
