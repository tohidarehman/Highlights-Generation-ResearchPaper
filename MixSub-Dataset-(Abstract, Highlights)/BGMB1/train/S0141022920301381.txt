 Rapid expansion of global market of lactic acid has prompted research towards cheaper and more eco friendly strategies for its production . Nowadays LA is produced mainly through fermentation of simple sugars or starchy biomass and its price is relatively high . Lignocellulose could be an advantageous alternative feedstock for LA production owing to its high abundance and low cost . However the most effective natural producers of LA can not directly ferment lignocellulose . So far metabolic engineering aimed at developing microorganisms combining efficient LA production and cellulose hydrolysis has been generally based on introducing designer cellulase systems in natural LA producers . In the present study the approach consisted in improving LA production in the natural cellulolytic bacterium
