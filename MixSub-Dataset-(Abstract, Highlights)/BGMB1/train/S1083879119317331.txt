 HLA haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation using post transplantation cyclophosphamide is becoming the standard of care for patients without an HLA matched related or unrelated donor . PT Cy haplo can give more patients the opportunity to undergo allo HCT because most patients have multiple available HLA haploidentical related donor candidates . The optimal donor selection algorithm in the PT Cy haplo setting has not yet been established however . To contribute to the establishment of a donor selection formula based on disease status and killer cell immunoglobulin like receptor genotype we retrospectively analyzed 91 patients who underwent PT Cy haplo at our institution . In both patients and donors HLA allele genotyping was performed for HLA A B C and DRB1 and 16 KIR genes were genotyped . Patients in complete remission who underwent PT Cy haplo from a
