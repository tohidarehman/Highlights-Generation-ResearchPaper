 Ruxolitinib a selective Janus kinase 1 2 inhibitor has recently been proposed for steroid refractory chronic graft versus host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation particularly in severe skin cGVHD . Lung function impairment is common in severe skin cGVHD through concomitant bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome or restrictive lung disease from skin sclerosis . To date no treatment has shown a benefit on lung function in this context . We retrospectively assessed the effect of ruxolitinib on lung function in a cohort of 70 patients diagnosed with sclerotic type skin cGVHD between March 2015 and April 2018 . Among these patients 36 received ruxolitinib . To handle confounding by indication bias exposure groups were matched on the propensity score to receive ruxolitinib incorporating age myeloablative conditioning total body irradiation BOS forced expiratory volume in 1 second FEV

@highlight Ruxolitinib had no effect on respiratory function in patients with severe skin chronic graft versus host disease.
@highlight Forced expiratory value over 1 second FEV
@highlight  decreased significantly over time independent of exposure to ruxolitinib.
@highlight FEV
@highlight trajectory was similar in exposed and unexposed patients.
