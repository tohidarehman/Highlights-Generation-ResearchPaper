 Galactokinases which catalyze the phosphorylation of galactose and possible other monosaccharides can provide an activated sugar donor to synthesize sugar containing molecules . In this study a novel galactokinase from human gut symbiont

@highlight The galactokinase from human gut symbiont
@highlight ATCC BAA 835 GalKAmu was expressed and characterized.
@highlight GalKAmu showed broad substrate specificity towards natural and unnatural monosaccharides.
@highlight GalKAmu could phosphorylate
@highlight  Glc 52.5 GlcNAc 15.5 Glc 2 N
@highlight  5 and Xyl 5 .
@highlight This is the first GalK isoform reported that can tolerate
@highlight  ManNAc 58 .
@highlight GalKAmu could utilize
@highlight  glucose in high yield 80 and
@highlight  mannose in low yield 5.0 .
