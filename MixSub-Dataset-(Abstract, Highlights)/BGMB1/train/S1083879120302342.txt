 Systemic glucocorticoids remain the standard treatment for gastrointestinal acute graft versus host disease despite their toxicity and incomplete efficacy . Controlled trials have tested poorly absorbable steroids as adjuncts with systemic glucocorticoids but only small case series have reported treatment with poorly absorbed beclomethasone dipropionate and budesonide alone . Our team has adopted the practice of administering BDP or BDP BUD without systemic glucocorticoids as first line therapy for isolated upper GI aGVHD . We report results in 76 patients treated with BDP alone and in 81 patients treated with BDP BUD with allocation by physician choice . Almost all patients received peripheral blood stem cells from a fully HLA matched related or unrelated donor after myeloablative conditioning for acute leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome non Hodgkin lymphoma or another hematopoietic disorders . After 28 days of treatment with BDP 46 of the patients had a complete response and 10 had a partial response after 200 days 61 patients were alive 34 maintained a CR and 3 maintained a PR whereas 53 required additional immunosuppression . After 28 days of treatment with BDP BUD 67 had a CR and 10 a PR after 200 days 74 patients were alive 46 maintained a CR and 2 maintained a PR whereas 43 required additional IS . Among the entire cohort of 157 patients 66 were treated successfully without systemic glucocorticoids . This study reports the efficacy of poorly absorbable steroids alone for patients with isolated UGI aGVHD . Prospective trials should test for the potential advantages of BDP and BUD use over systemic glucocorticoids .

@highlight Upper gastro intestinal acute GVHD may improve with sole upfront topical steroids.
@highlight Combined beclomethasone and budesonide are safe in upper gastro intestinal GVHD.
@highlight Prospective trials should explore the advantages of topical over systemic steroids.
