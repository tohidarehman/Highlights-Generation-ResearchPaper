 Extracellular Polymeric Substance production in relation to carbohydrate and protein compositions is an important key in wastewater bio treatment and microalgal harvesting . The influence of microalgal cultivation conditions on EPS production is well documented in previous studies but there continues to be a research gap that involves the effect of the initial concentration of microalgae added in media culture . This study aimed at investigating the impact of various initial microalgae concentrations on the behavior of carbohydrate and protein compositions constituting EPS . This study is important as it helps to enhance EPS production that associate with its applications . The total carbohydrate on average obtained was 31.1mgL

@highlight Effect of different initial concentrations of microalgae on the behavior of EPS is examined.
@highlight Compositions of carbohydrates and proteins of EPS were not regulated by microalgae concentration.
@highlight Regulation of nine monosaccharides showed an insignificant fluctuation in EPS mass.
@highlight Glucose and arabinose are two key compounds that derive the regulation of EPS production.
