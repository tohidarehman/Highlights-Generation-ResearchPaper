 Reduced bone mineral density is a well recognized complication of hematopoietic cell transplantation with significant drops in BMD occurring within the first 12 months after HCT . Guidance on identifying and managing this complication is available in several published guidelines . In this study we investigated current practices in the investigation and management of low BMD in centers registered with the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation . A questionnaire about bone health was sent to all registered centers and responses were received from 99 centers in 25 countries currently registered with the EBMT . Our data highlight considerable heterogeneity in practices across European centers in relation to investigations management and use of guidelines . Our data demonstrate the need for better dissemination and implementation of existing guidelines and also for the development of multidisciplinary guidelines with input from all relevant stakeholders .

@highlight Low bone mineral density BMD is frequent after hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT .
@highlight There is inconsistency of practice in relation to guidelines on BMD after HCT.
@highlight There is a lack of familiarity with BMD guidelines among European HCT centers.
