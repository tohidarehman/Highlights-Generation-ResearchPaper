 Vitamin D deficiency is a well described phenomenon in pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant . VD modulates inflammation and deficiency pre HSCT and at day 100 has been associated with graft versus host disease and poorer survival . However a paucity of data has specifically described the association between VD status and immune mediated complications including GVHD and veno occlusive disease . Additionally data to guide recommendations for VD monitoring and supplementation during HSCT are scarce . Our primary objective was to evaluate the association between VD and post HSCT complications . The key secondary aim was to evaluate the routine use and efficacy of VD monitoring and supplementation practices . To our knowledge this is the largest study of its kind in the pediatric population . This retrospective study evaluated VD level before and 1 year after HSCT VD supplementation practices and their association with acute GVHD VOD and survival in pediatric patients who received autologous and allogeneic HSCT for both malignant and nonmalignant diseases from January 2013 to April 2018 . Of 314 HSCTs 43 of patients had VDL measured before HSCT 61 of this cohort had pre HSCT VD insufficiency . Neither pre HSCT nor follow up VDL was associated with the incidence of GVHD or VOD . Supplementation did not result in significantly different post HSCT VDL.VDL was correlated with overall survival every 10 ng mL increase in VDL was associated with a 28 decreased risk of death

@highlight Pediatric patients receiving HSCT have high risk of vitamin D insufficiency 61 .
@highlight Substantial variation exists in vitamin D monitoring and supplementation practices.
@highlight Pre HSCT vitamin D levels were not associated with incidence of GVHD or VOD.
@highlight Higher vitamin D levels were associated with decreased risk for all cause mortality.
