 Glucose oxidase was modified by attaching phenyl groups to either carboxyl or amino side chains on the enzyme . High hydrostatic pressure stabilized the aniline and benzoate modified GOx at 69.180 C compared to atmospheric pressure . At 240 MPa and 80.0 C the first order rate constant of inactivation

@highlight Phenyl modification of glucose oxidase made the enzyme more thermostable.
@highlight High pressure and phenyl modification made glucose oxidase more thermophilic.
@highlight Increased surface hydrophobicity enhanced pressure stabilization of glucose oxidase.
