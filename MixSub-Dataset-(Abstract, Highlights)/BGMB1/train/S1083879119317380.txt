 Although cord blood transplantation extends allograft access patient comorbidities chemoradiation and nephrotoxic medications all contribute to acute kidney injury risk . We analyzed AKI in adult myeloablative CBT recipients who underwent transplantation from 2006 to 2017 for hematologic malignancies using cyclosporine A mycophenolate mofetil immunosuppression . Maximum grades of AKI were calculated using Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definitions . In total 153 patients 114 153 acute leukemia 27 153 African 88 153 cytomegalovirus seropositive median age adjusted hematopoietic cell comorbidity index 3 median pretransplant albumin 4.0 g dL underwent transplantation . The day 100 cumulative incidence of grade 1 3 AKI was 83 77 89 and grade 2 3 AKI incidence was 54 . Mean CSA level preceding AKI onset was high . In multivariate analysis African ancestry addition of haploidentical CD34

@highlight Day 100 grade 2 to 3 acute kidney injury AKI incidence is high after adult cord blood transplantation.
@highlight Grade 1 to 2 AKI can be present with a normal creatinine.
@highlight A higher pretransplant serum albumin protects against AKI.
@highlight Critical illness and nephrotoxic drugs increase AKI risk.
@highlight Early post transplant AKI increases 2 year chronic kidney disease risk.
