 The hydrodynamic environment in bioreactors affects the oxygen transfer rate and the shear conditions during microbial cultivations . Therefore assessment of the effect of the hydrodynamic environment on cellular morphology can contribute to favoring the production of metabolites of interest . The aim of this work was to use image analysis in order to quantify the fragmentation of

@highlight Shear conditions are important since they influence cell morphology and production.
@highlight Kinetic model using pellet fragmentation was proposed to quantify shear conditions.
@highlight  Glucosidase and endoglucanase had linear dependence with the kinetic parameter.
@highlight  Glucosidase production was higher under high shear conditions.
@highlight Endoglucanase production was favored under low shear conditions.
