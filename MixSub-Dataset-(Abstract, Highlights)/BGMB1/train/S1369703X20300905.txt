 Granulation in bioreactors for the treatment of industrial wastewater is a common phenomenon . Anaerobic granular sludge grown on brewery wastewater is known to manifest electrical conductivity a characteristic that previously has been related to direct interspecies electron transfer . To assess if this characteristic is more widespread we determined the electrical conductivity of 28 anaerobic granular sludges grown on a wide variety of industrial wastewaters in full scale reactors . This revealed that it is a highly variable characteristic one sludge had a conductivity of 171 S cm

@highlight Electrical conductivity of anaerobic granules ranged from 0.8 to 171 S cm
@highlight 4 times higher electrical conductivity than the maximum reported was found.
@highlight Granules from ethanol related industries did not consistently show conductivity.
@highlight Microbial community composition alone did not explain electrical conductivity.
@highlight Positive correlation between conductivity and granule Fe and S contents was found.
