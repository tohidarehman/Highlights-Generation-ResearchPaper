 Cytomegalovirus infection and graft versus host disease remain the major causes of nonrelapse mortality in patients following alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Mizoribine showed an anti CMV effect in addition to its immunosuppressive effect in patients with renal transplantation . In this study we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MZR combined with a calcineurin inhibitor as a method of prophylactic immunosuppression in recipients following alternative donor HCT . Eighty patients were enrolled in the study and randomized to the MZR or MMF cohort before transplantation conditioning . Analyses involved a comparison of the outcomes between the 2 cohorts as well as risk analyses of early nonrelapse mortality and severe CMV infection . In contrast to MMF MZR was associated with a lower but statistically nonsignificant median CMV DNA peak load

@highlight A high cytomegalovirus CMV DNA peak load predicts a persistent and refractory disease course.
@highlight Treatment with mizoribine MZR can reduce the severity of CMV infection in the presence of ganciclovir.
@highlight MZR shows good immunosuppressive as well as antiviral effects in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
