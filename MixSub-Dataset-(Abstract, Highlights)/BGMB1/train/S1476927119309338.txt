 The underlying molecular characteristics of osteoarthritis a common age related joint disease remains elusive . Here we aimed to identify potential early diagnostic biomarkers and elucidate underlying mechanisms of OA using weighted gene co expression network analysis . We obtained the gene expression profile dataset GSE55235 GSE55457 and GSE55584 from the Gene Expression Omnibus . WGCNA was used to investigate the changes in co expressed genes between normal and OA synovial membrane samples . Modules that were highly correlated to OA were subjected to functional enrichment analysis using the R clusterProfiler package . Differentially expressed genes between the two samples were screened using the limma package in R. A Venn diagram was constructed to intersect the genes in significant modules and DEGs . RT PCR was used to further verify the hub gene expression levels between normal and OA samples . The preserved significant module was found to be highly associated with OA development and progression We identified 13 hub genes correlated to the development and progression of OA which may provide new biomarkers and drug targets for OA .

@highlight WGCNA was employed to identify highly correlated gene modules associated with OA synovial membrane.
@highlight The genes in significant module were enriched in the FoxO signaling pathway and the metabolism of fatty acids and 2 oxocarboxylic acid.
@highlight 13 hub genes correlated to the development and progression of OA were identified.
