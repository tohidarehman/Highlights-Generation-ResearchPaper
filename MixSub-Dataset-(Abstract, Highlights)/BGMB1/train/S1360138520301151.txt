 is one of the most studied plant viral pathogens because it is the most damaging virus for global tomato production . In order to combat this global threat it is important that we understand the biology of TYLCV and devise management approaches . The prime objective of this review is to highlight management strategies for efficiently tackling TYLCV epidemics and global spread . For that purpose we focus on the impact TYLCV has on worldwide agriculture and the role of recent advances for our understanding of TYLCV interaction with its host and vector . Another important focus is the role of recombination and mutations in shaping the evolution of TYLCV genome and geographical distribution .

@highlight  TYLCV causes up to 100 yield loss in tomato.
@highlight Studies have dissected the TYLCV genome and investigated the interaction of genomic components with both plant and vector.
@highlight Recombination during mixed infections and mutations are the driving force for TYLCV evolution.
@highlight Recombinant TYLCV with resistance breaking capabilities have caused serious epidemics.
@highlight Strategies for disease management and imparting durable tolerance using advanced tools have been developed.
