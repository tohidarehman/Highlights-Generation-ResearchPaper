 Castor oil extracted from castor bean has antibacterial property and has been used in various folk remedies . The major structural component of castor oil ricinoleic acid has actual antibacterial activity . Some phenolic compounds derived from plants have antioxidant property . Among them vanillyl alcohol from vanilla bean has strong antioxidant activity . As vanillyl alcohol has low solubility in hydrophobic solvents and castor oil has low solubility in hydrophilic solvents there is practical difficulty in using them . We performed lipase mediated transesterification using vanillyl alcohol and castor oil and synthesized ricinoleic acid vanillyl ester . 2 2 Diphenyl 1 picrylhydrazyl assay and 2 2 azino bis assay revealed that RAVE had a strong antioxidant activity in various organic solvents . RAVE also had antibacterial activity against some food spoilage bacteria . It showed more powerful antibacterial activity for gram positive bacteria than for gram negative bacteria . The critical micelle concentration of RAVE was measured at 7.36M and it partitioned exclusively into emulsion phase in water emulsion system . Zeta potential measurement membrane release test and fluorescent microscopy showed that RAVE inserted itself into the bacterial cell membrane destroyed membrane permeability and induced cell death . As such RAVE is a novel multi functional compound with antioxidant and antibacterial activity so it can be used as a functional material in the food and cosmetic industries .
