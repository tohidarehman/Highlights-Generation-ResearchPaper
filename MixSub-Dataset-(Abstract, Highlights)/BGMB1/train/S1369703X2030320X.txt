 Paper mill sludge a lignocellulosic waste from paper industry is an ecological burden of environmental concern . Present study explored PMS as substrate for prodigiosin production in solid state fermentation and concurrent source of cellulose for Cellulose nanocrystals preparation using

@highlight Paper mill sludge PMS was two way valorized through bacterial biotransformation.
@highlight PMS could be utilized for the improved production of prodigiosin biopigment.
@highlight Delignification of PMS was achieved concurrent to prodigiosin production.
@highlight Residual sludge was used to prepare cellulose nanocrystals with desired properties.
@highlight Both prodigiosin and cellulose nanocrystals were found to be non toxic.
