 The use of whole cell biocatalyst for production of fructo oligosaccharide eliminates the need for costly enzyme recovery and purification . In this study a novel

@highlight A novel
@highlight strain was selected to produce intracellular FOS synthase.
@highlight The strain had a high transfructosylating activity of 4.44U mg dry cells.
@highlight The whole cell biocatalyst had a high U
@highlight  U
@highlight ratio of 18.4.
@highlight A 61 FOS yield was achieved in 3h from 50 w v sucrose with only 5g L cells.
@highlight Pre removal of glucose in molasses by an invertase free yeast improved FOS yield.
