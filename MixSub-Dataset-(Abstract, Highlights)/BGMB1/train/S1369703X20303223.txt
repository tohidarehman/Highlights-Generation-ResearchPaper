 Geranyl diphosphate is a direct precursor in the biosynthesis of monoterpenes . Previous studies focused on the manipulation of metabolic flux to improve GPP supply in yeast . However if the subcellular distribution of GPP with monoterpene synthase is not coordinated the usage of GPP becomes sub optimal . Therefore taking sabinene production in

@highlight Revealed the existence of GPP pools in yeast peroxisomes and mitochondria.
@highlight Engineered subcellular compartmentalization to promote sabinene production.
@highlight Uncovered novel mitochondrial targets enhanced the compartmentalized pathways.
