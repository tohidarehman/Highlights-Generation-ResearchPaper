 The present study was to illustrate the agonistic property of arjungenin and arjunic acid towards farnesoid X receptor protein .The pharmacokinetic properties like molecular interactions absorption distribution metabolism elimination and toxicity of the ligands were checked through

@highlight Structure based pharmacophores screening of arjungenin and arjunic acid were predicted potential FXR agonist.
@highlight ADMET studies of arjungenin and arjunic acid identified as non toxic and has druggable property.
@highlight Molecular docking studies confirmed arjungenin and arjunic acid as a strong and stable binding towards FXR protein.
@highlight studies with 3T3 L1 adipocytes confirm decreased cyp7a1 levels and increased FXR PPAR and SREBP 1c levels.
