 The use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is increasing for a variety of diseases . Ototoxicity from this procedure has not been extensively studied . A retrospective chart review examined 275 patients from this institution who underwent HSCT between January 1 2007 and April 30 2017 . Data extracted included therapy before HSCT and the subsequent course of transplantation . Evaluable patients had complete medical records and interpretable audiograms available . Ototoxicity constituted significant threshold changes from baseline or changes in International Society of Pediatric Oncology Boston Ototoxicity Grading Scale grade comparing audiogram results just before HSCT with those following the transplantation procedure . A total of 147 patients were evaluable . Ototoxicity was observed in 10.2 of the patients . Higher SIOP grade before HSCT was significantly associated with a higher risk of post transplantation ototoxicity

@highlight This is the largest series of pediatric HSCT recipients evaluated for ototoxicity reported to date.
@highlight Ototoxicity was observed in 10 of the patients examined.
@highlight No type of transplantation was free of ototoxicity.
@highlight Patients with evidence of hearing loss before the transplantation procedure were at greatest risk.
