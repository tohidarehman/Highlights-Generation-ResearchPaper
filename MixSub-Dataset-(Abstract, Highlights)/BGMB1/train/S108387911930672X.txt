 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only potentially curative option for myelodysplastic syndromes but is severely limited by nonrelapse mortality especially in this mostly older population . Comorbidity assessment is crucial to predict NRM and often assessed with the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Specific Comorbidity Index . Moreover the impact of age on NRM still remains a matter of debate . In recent years the age at which transplants are made has been progressively increasing and patients with comorbidities have become more common . Extricating the respective roles of age and comorbidities in toxic mortality is all the more important . This study by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry included 1245 adult patients who underwent a first allogeneic stem cell transplantation for MDSs between 2003 and 2014 . Overall 4 year NRM and overall survival were 32 and 47 respectively . When considered as continuous predictors HCT CI score and age were associated with an increased hazard ratio for NRM . In multivariate analysis age band HR 1.13 95 CI 1.02 to 1.25

@highlight Allotransplant for myelodysplastic syndrome is limited by high nonrelapse mortality.
@highlight Comorbidities assessed by the original Sorror score impact mortality negatively.
@highlight Chronological age also continues to play an independent prognostic role on mortality.
@highlight Both age and comorbidities should be integrated in the allotransplant decision process.
