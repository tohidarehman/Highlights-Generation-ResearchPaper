 Despite considerable foaming problems oleic acid is still the most commonly used substrate for the biochemical production of 9 octadecenedioic acid . In this paper the suitability of alternative substrates such as oleyl alcohol methyl ethyl and butyl oleate was investigated . First the toxicity of the alternative substrates to the fermenting yeast

@highlight needs a long adaptation phase at high ethanol concentrations.
@highlight is severely intoxicated at low butanol concentrations.
@highlight Two feasible oleic acid alternatives were found for octadecenedioic acid production.
@highlight Butyl esters are rejected as substrates for microbial dicarboxylic acid production.
