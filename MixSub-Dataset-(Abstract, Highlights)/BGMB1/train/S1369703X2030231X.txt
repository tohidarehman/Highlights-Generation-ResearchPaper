 Microbial synthesis of high value biochemicals like biosurfactants using renewable substrates has attracted an intensive interest in the past decade . In this work the bioproduction of sophorolipids was achieved by fermentation of different vegetable oils with the strain of

@highlight Novel hydrophobic cryogels prepared
@highlight cryo polymerization of reactive emulsion.
@highlight Cryogel porosities of 8796 and Youngs elasticity modulus changed with solvents.
@highlight Hydrophobic cryogels are useful as oil carriers in biosynthesis of sophorolipids.
@highlight Productivity of sophorolipids improved 14.5 72.1 for different vegetable oils.
