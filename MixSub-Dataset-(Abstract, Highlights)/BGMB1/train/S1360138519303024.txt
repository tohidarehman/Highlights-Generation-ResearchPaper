 Fatty acid amide hydrolase is an enzyme that belongs to the amidase signature superfamily and is widely distributed in multicellular eukaryotes . FAAH hydrolyzes lipid signaling molecules namely

@highlight Fatty acid amide hydrolase FAAH is the signal terminating enzyme of the
@highlight  acylethanolamine signaling pathway with an established role in seedling development.
@highlight The crystal structure of
@highlight FAAH was recently solved revealing for the first time the structural features of FAAH from plants and explaining the enzymes promiscuity toward
@highlight  acyl amide substrates.
@highlight A second group of FAAH enzymes in angiosperms has been identified with conserved substitutions in the substrate binding pocket altering the size shape and physicochemical properties for substrate recognition.
