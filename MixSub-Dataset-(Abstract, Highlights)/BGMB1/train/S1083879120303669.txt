 The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Myeloma Intergroup has organized an annual workshop focused on minimal residual disease testing and immune profiling in multiple myeloma since 2016 . In 2019 the workshop took place as an American Society of Hematology Friday Scientific Workshop titled Immune Profiling and Minimal Residual Disease Testing in Multiple Myeloma . This workshop focused on 4 main topics the molecular and immunologic evolution of plasma cell disorders development of new laboratory and imaging based MRD assessment approaches chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy research and statistical and regulatory issues associated with novel clinical endpoints . In this report we provide a summary of the workshop and discuss future directions .

@highlight A comprehensive summary of the 2019 BMT CTN Myeloma Intergroup Minimal Residual Disease MRD and Immune Profiling IP workshop is provided.
@highlight MRD is a prognostic biomarker and should be incorporated into trial designs.
@highlight IP provides insight into disease biology and response to treatment.
