 Shifting the life cycle of grain crops from annual to perennial would usher in a new era of agriculture that is more environmentally friendly resilient to climate change and capable of soil carbon sequestration . Despite decades of work transforming the annual grain crop wheat

@highlight Current grain crops are annuals that must be sown every year giving their root systems little time to develop during the growing season.
@highlight A perennial grain crop with a long lived extensive root system would improve soil quality store carbon belowground and utilize water and minerals more efficiently.
@highlight Domestication genes of the annual grass wheat are highly conserved in the perennial intermediate wheatgrass 
@highlight  providing an opportunity for accelerated domestication of a perennial grain using a mutagenesis approach.
