 The study was to evaluate the capacity of IFAS technology to enhance the acrylamide biodegradation in the biological wastewater treatment systems at high concentrations of 200 300 400 and 800mg AM L. Two sequencing batch reactor systems operating as the IFAS and conventional activated sludge were operated at the solids retention time of 9.0 days and hydraulic retention time of 24h at the operating temperature of about 28C . The experimental results revealed that the mixed culture bacteria in the IFAS system biodegraded acrylamide at the removal efficiencies of 64.9 82.4 99.5 and 86.3 while the AS system removed 36.4 75.1 71.8 and 55.9 at the acrylamide concentrations of 200 300 400 and 800mg AM L respectively . As acrylamide concentrations increased in the wastewater the sludge productions decreased due to the acrylamide toxicity but the biodegradation rates increased resulting from less complexity of mixed substrates . Ammonia was stripped out due to relative high temperature and pH therefore the ammonia inhibition effects on the acrylamide biodegradation were not found . Due to the media clogging the diffusion of substrates was limited therefore biodegradation rates in the IFAS system were remarkably less than the AS system . It can be concluded that the IFAS was superior to the AS system because of additional fixed film biomass .

@highlight IFAS was superior to conventional activated sludge system to biodegrade acrylamide
@highlight Acrylamide biodegradation rates increased with the decrease of substrate complexity
@highlight Acrylamide toxicity decreased sludge production in the wastewater treatment system
@highlight Clogging of media in IFAS with calcium carbonate was firstly reported
