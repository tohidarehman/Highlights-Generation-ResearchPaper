 BiCNU etoposide Ara C melphalan and Campath conditioning was developed to reduce the high transplant related mortality in patients with lymphoma while delivering intensive antilymphoma immunotherapy as well as to some extent a platform for allogeneic stem cell engraftment . Significant numbers of patients appeared to have persistent recipient derived hematopoiesis and therefore we retrospectively analyzed patients with lymphoma undergoing BEAM Campath conditioned allogeneic stem cell transplantation at our center to characterize the patterns of chimerism and patient outcomes . Chimerism was analyzed with short tandem repeat PCR . Mixed donor recipient chimerism was defined as 5 to 94.9 donor . Fifty two patients with a median age of 45 years were identified with histologic diagnoses of Hodgkin lymphoma diffuse large B cell lymphoma low grade non Hodgkin lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma and T cell lymphoma . Pretransplant 93 achieved complete response or partial response with a median of 3 prior therapies . Donors were Matched sibling donors matched unrelated donors miss matched unrelated donors and syngeneic . Acute graft versus host disease developed in 52 and chronic GVHD in 12 . MDRC of T cells developed in 62 and 29 developed MDRC of myeloid cells at a median onset of 100 days . Donor lymphocyte infusion was given to 17 patients with a median starting dose of 110

@highlight BEAM Campath allografts for lymphoma achieve long term disease free survival.
@highlight One third of patients developed myeloid mixed donor recipient chimerism.
@highlight T cell mixed chimerism occurred in 62 and was associated with reduced nonrelapse mortality.
@highlight Neither T cell or myeloid mixed chimerism is associated with increased relapse.
@highlight Half converted from mixed to full donor chimerism after donor lymphocyte infusion.
