 Chitin was obtained by economic fermentative and chemical extractions from crab shell to compare the structural differences . In the fermentation soybean curd residue

@highlight Biologically and chemically extracted chitin from crab shell were compared.
@highlight and its protein extract were used in a culture medium of
@highlight Amino acids and minerals in the fermentation affected the properties of chitin.
@highlight At same DA different crystallinity and thermal enthalpy were caused by H bonding.
