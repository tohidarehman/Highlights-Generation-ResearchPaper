 Aromatic amino acid deaminases are key enzymes mediating carbon flux from primary to secondary metabolism in plants . Recent studies have uncovered a tyrosine ammonia lyase that contributes to the typical characteristics of grass cell walls and contributes to about 50 of the total lignin synthesized by the plant . Grasses are currently preferred bioenergy feedstocks and lignin is the most important limiting factor in the conversion of plant biomass to liquid biofuels as well as being an abundant renewable carbon source that can be industrially exploited . Further research on the structure evolution regulation and biological function of functionally distinct ammonia lyases has multiple implications for improving the economics of the agri food and biofuel industries .

@highlight It has been generally accepted that all plants synthesize lignin from the aromatic amino acid L phenylalanine. Recent studies indicate that true grasses Poaceae are able to make up to nearly half of their lignin from L tyrosine via the enzyme L tyrosine ammonia lyase.
@highlight Understanding the interface between tyrosine and phenylpropanoid metabolism is of particular interest because grasses include the major food crops of the world e.g. corn wheat rice as well as ideal bioenergy feedstocks e.g. switchgrass
