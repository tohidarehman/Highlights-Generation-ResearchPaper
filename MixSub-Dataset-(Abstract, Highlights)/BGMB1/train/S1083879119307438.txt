 Follow up is integral for hematopoietic cell transplantation care to ensure surveillance and intervention for complications . We characterized the incidence of and predictors for being lost to follow up . Two year survivors of first allogeneic HCT or autologous HCT for malignant nonmalignant disorders between 2002 and 2013 reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research were selected . The cumulative incidence of being lost to follow up was calculated . Marginal Cox models were fit to evaluate predictors . The 10 year cumulative incidence of being lost to follow up was 13 12 to 14 in adult allogeneic HCT survivors 15 in adult autologous HCT survivors 25 in pediatric allogeneic HCT survivors and 24 in pediatric autologous HCT survivors . Factors associated with being lost to follow up include younger age nonmalignant disease public no insurance residence farther from the tranplantation center and being unmarried in adult allogeneic HCT survivors older age and testicular germ cell tumor in adult autologous HCT survivors older age public no insurance and nonmalignant disease in pediatric allogeneic HCT survivors and older age in pediatric autologous HCT survivors . Follow up focusing on minimizing attrition in high risk groups is needed to ensure surveillance for late effects .

@highlight The proportion of HCT survivors lost to follow up is concerning.
@highlight Subgroups of HCT survivors remain at higher risk of being lost to follow up.
@highlight Follow up efforts focusing on minimizing attrition in high risk groups is needed.
