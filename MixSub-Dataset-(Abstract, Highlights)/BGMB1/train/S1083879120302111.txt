 Patients with refractory or relapsed B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and highly aggressive B cell non Hodgkin lymphoma have a very dismal prognosis and limited treatment options . The advent of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy constitutes a milestone in current cell and gene therapies covering the unmet need of treatment of high risk patients and bringing immunotherapies one step closer toward cancer therapeutics including hematologic malignancies . CAR T cells targeting CD19 antigen have shown startling remission rates in heavily pretreated B ALL and B NHL patients in whom CAR T cell therapy may sometimes be their last resort treatment . However a high proportion of these patients evade immune surveillance by CAR T cells losing their initial deep responses which leads to disease recurrence as either CD19 positive or CD19 negative relapse . As a result many investigators have questioned the need for consolidative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after CAR T cell therapy once a patient has achieved remission . There remains much controversy regarding whether CAR T cells should be a bridge therapy to allo HCT or a definitive treatment owing to the paucity of strong evidence based data . In this context here we review the existing data regarding the necessity safety and outcomes of allo HCT performed after autologous anti CD19 CAR T cell therapy in B ALL and B NHL patients .

@highlight High initial remission rates are achieved post chimeric antigen receptor CAR T cell therapy in patients with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia B ALL and patients with B cell non Hodgkin lymphoma B NHL .
@highlight A significant proportion of patients will eventually relapse or progress.
@highlight Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation allo HCT should be considered in transplantation nave B ALL patients while in remission.
@highlight allo HCT should be considered preferably in the progression relapse setting for patients with B NHL.
