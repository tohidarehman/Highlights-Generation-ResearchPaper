This is a one arm pilot study design that adapted and tested an individual PP intervention used in cardiac disease to a phone delivered group based program for HSCT survivors who were .4 to 39 years post transplantation . All participants received an 8 session weekly PP intervention . We assessed feasibility by the enrollment and intervention completion rates . We examined acceptability on a 10 point Likert scale of ease and utility . Unstructured qualitative interviews were used to obtain participant feedback on the intervention for future application in a larger trial . Self reported assessments on psychological functional and quality of life outcomes were administered at baseline and at follow up . Of 64 eligible participants 29 enrolled in the study . For the main aim of intervention feasibility and acceptability participants completed 96 of all PP sessions and rated the ease and utility of sessions highly . Of the self reported assessments obtained the PP intervention resulted in improvements in the resilience scale mean difference 2.4 5.4
