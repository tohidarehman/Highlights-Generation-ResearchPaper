 Understanding and modeling of the metabolic pathway of a cell by probing the fraction of extracellular metabolites is gaining much interest in biological reactions . This communication deals with metabolic footprinting technique to understand the effect of static and shake culture conditions on the production of lovastatin by

@highlight Metabolic pathway for the biosynthesis of lovastatin was constructed using metabolic footprinting technique.
@highlight Culture conditions had profound influence on the production of lovastatin as observed through the variation in internal metabolic fluxes.
@highlight Ethanol and glycerol were produced along with lovastatin by
@highlight They were probably utilized back to increase the production of lovastatin in shake culture.
@highlight The dynamic macroscopic models developed were validated using experimental data.
