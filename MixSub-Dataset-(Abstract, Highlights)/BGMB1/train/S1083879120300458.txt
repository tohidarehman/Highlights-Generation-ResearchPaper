 Incidence and outcome of infections after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with post transplant cyclophosphamide as graft versus host disease prophylaxis are largely unknown . Study aims were to estimate the incidence of pre engraftment bloodstream infections and viral infections adenovirus human herpes virus 6 and BK polyomavirus hemorrhagic cystitis their predictive factors and infection related mortality after HSCT with PT Cy . We analyzed 235 patients 62 21 and 17 received haploidentical matched unrelated donor and matched related donor respectively . Overall 72 patients had 77 PE BSI episodes at a median time of 13 days after HSCT cumulative incidence function at 28 days was 32 without differences among donor types

@highlight This cohort analysis evaluates the incidence risk factors and mortality of pre engraftment bloodstream infections BSIs and double strand DNA viral infections VIs after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCT with post transplant cyclophosphamide PT Cy platform among different donor sources.
@highlight Allogeneic HSCT with PT Cy showed a 32 incidence of pre engraftment BSIs and donor type did not affect their occurrence.
@highlight VIs are common in the early phase but immune reconstitution after PT Cy transplant is broad and fast allowing to handle them.
