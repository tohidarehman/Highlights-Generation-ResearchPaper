 Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia who undergo killer immunoglobulin like receptor mismatched haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have improved survival . Children s Oncology Group AAML05P1 is a prospective phase 2 trial of unrelated donor HSCT in which KIR typing of donors was available to the treating physician at donor selection aiming to determine feasibility of prospective selection of KIR mismatched donors and effect on outcomes . Patients age 30 years with high risk AML at presentation or relapsed AML were eligible the study accrued 90 evaluable patients . After enrollment as many as 5 potential URD samples were KIR typed in a central laboratory and results reported to the treating physician who made the final donor selection . Cases were categorized as KIR matched or KIR mismatched using different published strategies . Overall survival disease free survival and relapse did not differ significantly by KIR mismatch status . Acute graft versus host disease was significantly lower in recipients of KIR mismatched stem cells 35 versus 60

@highlight KIR mismatching did not improve disease free survival in children transplanted with unrelated donor stem cells for AML using in vivo T cell depletion with ATG
@highlight KIR mismatching did alter the kinetics of NK cell receptor acquisition on donor cells after stem cell transplantation in children.
