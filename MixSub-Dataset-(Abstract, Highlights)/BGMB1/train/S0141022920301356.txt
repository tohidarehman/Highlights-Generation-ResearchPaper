 Topramezone is a new 4 hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitor herbicide that is widely used on corn to control annual grass weeds and broadleaf weeds . Due to its broad spectrum weed control capacity improved activity excellent crop selectivity low mammalian toxicity and high environmental safety topramezone is considered an ideal target herbicide for transgenic engineering of herbicide tolerance . In this study a topramezone resistant strain

@highlight HPPD genes possessing potential applications in engineering of HR crops were cloned.
@highlight HPPD displayed high catalytic efficiency and high resistance to topramezone.
@highlight Pressure acclimation enabled mutants to tolerate high concentrations of topramezone.
