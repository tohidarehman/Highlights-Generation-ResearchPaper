 Continuous mashing provides advantages compared to conventional batch wise mashing in terms of space time yield . The majority of fermentable sugars are generated during the so called

@highlight FS content prediction during continuous mashing is crucial for industrial use.
@highlight FS formation kinetics from batch experiments are combined with the RTD of a CSTR.
@highlight A novel semi empirical model allows for the determination of FS formation kinetics.
@highlight FS prediction during continuous mash production was achieved with high precision.
