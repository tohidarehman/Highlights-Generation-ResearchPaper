 Development in two dimensional drug delivery materials have quickly translated into biological and pharmacological fields . In this present work pristine graphene and hexagonal boron nitride sheets are explored as a drug carrier for cytarabine and clofarabine anti cancer drugs using density functional theory . The obtained geometrical energetic and electronic properties revealed that the PG sheet is more reactive and it adsorbs CYT and CLF anti cancer drugs better than the h BN sheet . The adsorption energies of CYT and CLF on PG sheet is 24.293 and 23.308kcal mol respectively this is due to the delocalized electrons present in the PG sheet . The flow of electron direction between anti cancer drugs and 2D sheet are calculated by N E

@highlight The PG and h BN sheets are used as a drug carriers.
@highlight The PG sheet has more interaction energy with CYT and CLF drug than h BN sheet.
@highlight Adsorption energies of CYT and CLF on PG are 24.29kcal mol 23.31kcal mol.
@highlight Results shows PG sheet has therapeutic potential as a drug delivery vehicle.
