 The textile dyeing and printing industry has led to extensive environmental pollution and severely threatens ecosystems . Immobilized laccase is an effective biocatalyst for the biotreatment of dye effluents but is usually restricted by its aerobic requirements . Thus it is desirable to design an efficient reactor that will increase the applicability of IL on an industrial scale . Decolourization efficiency of Reactive Blue 19 selected as a model textile dye was compared between a horizontal rotating reactor and a traditional vertical mixing reactor . The HRR was equipped with strips of bacterial nanocellulose immobilized laccase and the VMR contained wafers of BNC immobilized laccase . The maximum decolourization efficiency of HRR was achieved at the optimized temperature of 55C pH of 4.0 and agitation speed of 20 rpm . Advantages of HRR over VMR include a broader range of enzymatic reacting temperatures greater contact and reacting interfacial area and higher oxygen availability . After reacting RB 19 at optimized conditions for 5 h the decolourization ratios of the VMR and HRR were respectively 45.7 and 88.2 . The HRR provided greater reusability of immobilized enzyme and higher detoxification removal of chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon indicating great potential in promoted decolourization of dyeing effluents .

@highlight An HRR reactor was designed to satisfy the oxygen demand of catalysis of dye by BNC immobilized laccase.
@highlight Decolourization efficiency of Reactive Blue 19 dye with laccase was compared in reactors HRR and VMR.
@highlight HRR provides immobilized laccase better thermostability higher oxygen availability and larger contact reacting area.
@highlight HRR showed approximately two fold higher decolourization efficiency than VWR and greater removal capability of COD and TOC.
