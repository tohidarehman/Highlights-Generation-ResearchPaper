 Cytomegalovirus results in significant morbidity and mortality following hematopoietic cell transplantation . Establishing the cost and clinical impact is imperative to the selection of appropriate CMV preventative strategies . This is a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing their first allogeneic HCT between January 1 2009 and December 31 2013 . Detailed clinical and institutional cost data were obtained from the start of conditioning through 1 year post transplantation . Baseline characteristics resource utilization costs and outcomes were compared between patients with and without clinically significant CMV infection . One hundred seventy out of 388 patients developed csCMVi within 1 year after HCT . Within the first year post HCT patients with csCMVi had a significantly longer transplantation related length of stay mean 91.7 days versus 78.3 days
