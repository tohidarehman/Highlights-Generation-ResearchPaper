 The carbon release behaviour of polylactic acid starch blends and the correlation between solid phase denitrification performance and solid carbon decomposition were investigated by both batch experiments and numerical simulations . The results showed that the mass ratio of PLA to starch is a key parameter in determining the total organic carbon release rate of the blends . Hydrolysis of the blends contributed more markedly to the fraction of TOC released during denitrification compared with physicochemical leaching . The maximum denitrification rate of the blend supported SPD system was 0.008kg N m
