 Ergosterol like cholesterol has many beneficial physiological activities and because it has no adverse clinical problem with cholesterol it is a substance that can be used as a biomaterial in the food and cosmetics industry . However ergosterol has low oil solubility and is easily crystallized which is problematic for its direct use in the industry . This problem can be solved by combining fatty acids with ergosterol . In this study ergosterol derivatives with unsaturated fatty acids were synthesized from ergosterol and various plant oils . Specifically ergosterol oleate ergosterol linoleate and ergosterol linolenate were synthesized using

@highlight Ergosterol oleate linoleate and linolenate were synthesized from rapeseed sunflower seed and linseed oils by lipase.
@highlight K80 lipase effectively synthesized unsaturated FAEEs due to its high affinity to ergosterol and broad substrate specificity.
@highlight The unsaturated FAEEs contained in the emulsions showed antibacterial activity against dairy and cosmetic spoilage bacteria.
