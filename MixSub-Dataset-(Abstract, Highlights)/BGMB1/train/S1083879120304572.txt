 Previous studies have reported a beneficial effect from cytomegalovirus reactivation after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on immune reconstitution . We determined the CMV antigenemia level associated with increased CMV antigen specific T cells at day 100 and decreased CMV reactivation after day 100 . CMV reactivation and CASTs were measured with CMV antigenemia and CMV specific major histocompatibility complex multimers . The analysis consisted of 775 CAST measurements obtained before and 30 100 and 365 days post alloHCT from 327 consecutive patients treated between 2008 and 2016 . Detectable CASTs correlated with recipient

@highlight Cytomegalovirus CMV reactivation induces CMV antigen specific T cells which may prevent subsequent CMV reactivation.
@highlight Low level CMV antigenemia 5 50 000 polymorphonuclear cells positive for pp65 associates with protective anti CMV immunity after day 100 and may be beneficial. Early therapy of low level CMV antigenemia could be delayed until progression to high level CMV antigenemia.
