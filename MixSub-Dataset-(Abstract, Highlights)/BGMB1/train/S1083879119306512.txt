 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be curative for patients with hematologic malignancies . The ideal conditioning regimen before allo HSCT has not been established . We conducted a Phase II study to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of clofarabine and treosulfan as conditioning regimen before allo HSCT . The primary objective was to evaluate the cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality on day 100 . Forty four patients were enrolled . The median patient age was 47 years and the median duration of follow up was 27 months . The conditioning regimen was based on clofarabine 40 mg m

@highlight This Phase II study evaluated the tolerability and safety of a clofarabine and treosulfan conditioning regimen before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
@highlight We found a low incidence of severe hepatic toxicities such as veno occlusive disease.
@highlight Disease relapse represent a major issue mainly for patients with poor prognostic risk factors.
