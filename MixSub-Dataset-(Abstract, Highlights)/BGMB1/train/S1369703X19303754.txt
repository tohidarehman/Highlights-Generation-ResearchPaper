 Small scale culture of animal cells in suspension is of importance for many applications . At a small scale fed batch is achieved either by manual bolus feeding or the use of liquid handling robots . In this study we report an alternate application of a hydrogel for in situ continuous delivery of a nutrient feed comprising 18 amino acids vitamins antioxidants and trace elements . We show that amino acid release is sustained for at least seven days . Importantly release rates of individual amino acids can be independently modulated by changing their loading . We demonstrate the application of this hydrogel for complete in situ feeding of nutrients to a suspension adapted CHO cell line expressing IgG leading to 2.7 fold and 4 fold improvement in integral viable cell density and volumetric productivity respectively . This is similar to improvements obtained by bolus liquid feeding . Further supplying glucose from the same hydrogel to eliminate manual feeding led to a 1.8 fold increase in IVCD accompanied by a 3 fold increase in volumetric productivity as compared to batch culture . In summary this study provides a proof of concept that hydrogels can enable completely closed in situ feeding for mammalian cell culture requiring no external intervention . Such continuous in situ delivery can potentially enable closed culture systems maintaining nutrients at low levels mimicking physiological concentrations .
