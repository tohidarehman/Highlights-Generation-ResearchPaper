 The outcomes of 7 8 allele matched unrelated bone marrow transplantation and umbilical cord blood transplantation have been improving . We retrospectively analyzed adults with acute leukemia who underwent their first 7 8 UBMT or UCBT in Japan . Between January 2008 and December 2017 a total of 4150 patients were recorded including 488 who underwent 7 8 UBMT and 3662 who underwent UCBT . Only 32 patients with 7 8 UBMT had graft versus host disease high risk HLA mismatched pairs . Overall survival at 3 years was 54 for 7 8 the UBMT group and 46 for the UCBT group a nonsignificant difference in multivariate analysis 1.01 95 confidence interval .88 to 1.17

@highlight Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with 7 8 HLA allele matched unrelated bone marrow 7 8 UBMT and umbilical cord blood UCBT make use of alternative donor sources for patients with acute leukemia who lack HLA identical donors.
@highlight This report provides an updated comparison of 7 8 UBMT and UCBT in a Japanese nationwide cohort.
@highlight Disease risk and conditioning intensity based stratification was used for donor source selection.
@highlight A lower incidence of graft versus host disease was seen in UCBT recipients.
@highlight There was a survival advantage in 7 8 UBMT recipients with standard risk disease who received a myeloablative conditioning regimen.
