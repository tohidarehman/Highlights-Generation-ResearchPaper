 Mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 is an emerging target for the treatment of cancer . AG 221 is the first mIDH2 inhibitor approved by the FDA for acute myeloid leukemia treatment but its acquired resistance has recently been observed necessitating the development of new inhibitor . In this study a multi step virtual screening protocol was employed for the analysis of a large database of compounds to identify potential mIDH2 inhibitors . To this end we firstly utilized molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations to elucidate the key factors affecting ligand binding and drug resistance . Based on these findings the receptor ligand interaction based pharmacophore model and hierarchical docking based virtual screening were sequentially carried out to assess 212 736 compounds from the Specs database . The resulting hits were finally ranked by PAINS filter and ADME prediction and the top compounds were obtained . Among them six molecules were identified as mIDH2 putative inhibitors with high selectivity by interacting with the capping residue Asp312 . Furthermore subsequent docking and MD experiments demonstrated that compound

@highlight A multi step virtual screening protocol was performed to discover novel mutant IDH2 inhibitors.
@highlight A receptor ligand interaction based pharmacophore IBP model was created to conduct the preliminary screening.
@highlight The hits with high selectivity against wild type IDH2 were obtained according to the docking result.
@highlight Induced fit docking and MD simulations was used to screen the inhibitors against AG 221 resistant mutants.
