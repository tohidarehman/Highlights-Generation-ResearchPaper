 The use of potentially inappropriate medications using Beers criteria and its impact on older allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients is not known . Here the use of any PIMs and their therapeutic classes in reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic HCT recipients were compared between older and younger patients during their initial HCT admission defined as the number of days that a patient received 1 or more PIMs between day 14 and day 28 . Poisson regression was used to determine rate ratios in the 2 groups . In the 65 years group we evaluated the impact of PIMs on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 4 toxicities within 100 days and on overall mortality within 1 year post HCT . The rate of any PIM use was similar in the older and younger groups .90 to 1.06

@highlight The rate of potentially inappropriate medication PIM use was similar in older and younger recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT .
@highlight Females high risk Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index and umbilical cord blood recipients had higher use of PIMs.
@highlight In recipients age 65 years PIM use was associated with higher toxicity and mortality.
