 Chinese hamster ovary cells are mainly used mammalian host to produce therapeutic recombinant glycoproteins which are close to the human like glycosylation of glycoproteins . However cytidine monophosphate N acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase in CHO cells can produce N glycolylneuraminic acids which elicits the immune response in the human body . Therefore it is vital to silence the expression of CMAH in CHO cells using gene editing technology . CRISPR Cas9 based gene editing system was performed to knock out the expression of CMAH in CHO cells . Plasmids containing Cas9 single guide RNA and reporter sequences of CMAH gene were constructed and transformed into HEK293 T cells to screen the sgRNA with high cleavage efficiency . Then the plasmids were co transfected into the CHO cells . Eight CHO monoclonal cells were obtained by flow cytometry sorting and expanded . Base deletion mutations were identified by PCR and Sanger sequencing . qRT PCR and MTT assay were confirmed the CMAH gene mutation in the CHO cells . Moreover the recombinant human erythropoietin protein was also expressed in the mutant CHO cells and the N Glycosylation of rEPO showed that G0F G1F GN increased and G0F GN G0 Man5 were decreased . CRISPR Cas9 system is a very convenient system for editing CMAH gene in CHO cells . The mutant CHO cells can be used as host to express the recombinant glycoprotein .
