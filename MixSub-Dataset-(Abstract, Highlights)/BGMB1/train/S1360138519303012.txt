 The discovery of visible fluorescence in the plant pigments betalains revealed the existence of fluorescent patterns in flowers of plants of the order Caryophyllales where betalains substitute anthocyanins . The serendipitous initial discovery led to a systemized characterization of the role of different substructures on the photophysical phenomenon . Strong fluorescence is general to all members of the family of betaxanthins linked to the structural property that the betalamic acid moiety is connected to an amine group . This property has led to bioinspired tailor made probes and to the development of novel biotechnological applications in screening techniques or microscopy labeling . Here we comprehensively review the photophysics photochemistry and photobiology of betalain fluorescence and describe all current applications .

@highlight The discovery of betalains fluorescence property opened up new fields in the research and applications of the pigments.
@highlight Similarities in fluorescence characteristics point to betalamic acid as the active compound.
@highlight Fluorescence allows visualization and staining of biomolecules cells tissues and parasites.
@highlight Novel microscopy biosensing and high throughput techniques have been developed based on the fluorescence of natural or tailor made betalains.
