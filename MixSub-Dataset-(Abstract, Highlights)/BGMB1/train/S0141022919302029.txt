 Enzyme catalyzed cofactor regeneration is a significant approach to avoid large quantities consumption of oxidized cofactor which is vital in a variety of bioconversion reactions . NADH FMN oxidoreductase is an ideal regenerating enzyme because innocuous molecular oxygen is required as an oxidant . But the by product H

@highlight A novel water forming flavin oxidoreductase was first expressed and characterized.
@highlight A rate limiting Thr29 was identified and confirmed to be employed to improve its activity.
@highlight The distance between FMN and NADH was shortened by introducing a small side chain containing residue into position 29.
