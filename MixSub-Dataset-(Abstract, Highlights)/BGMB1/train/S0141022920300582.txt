 Microbial fuel cells have been extensively studied as toxicity sensors . MFCs have potential as toxicity sensors because when their anodes are exposed to toxic substances or the concentration of the target is changed the voltage generated by certain microorganisms with active electrical activity attached to the anode changes . However the underlying reasons behind this phenomenon have not been deeply explored . Therefore the activity of anodic microorganisms during voltage drops in MFCs under formaldehyde stress was studied . The composition of the microbial community structure with similar active voltage drops under different concentrations of FA was investigated . The results showed that under exposure to high concentrations of FA the voltage changes in MFCs could be divided into five stages . With prolonged exposure to FA the ratio of live dead bacteria decreased from 4.78 to 0.65 . This result indicated that voltage drops may be caused by FA causing cell membrane rupture . Analysis of the microbial community structure under treatments including inoculation and three concentrations of FA revealed that

@highlight The toxic damage induced by exposure of bacteria in MFCs to formaldehyde caused a voltage drop.
@highlight and
@highlight showed strong resistance to formaldehyde while
@highlight and
@highlight showed opposite responses.
@highlight Exposure to formaldehyde at 63.45mg L for 200min had a greater impact on microbial communities than exposure to formaldehyde at 169.2mg L for 50min.
