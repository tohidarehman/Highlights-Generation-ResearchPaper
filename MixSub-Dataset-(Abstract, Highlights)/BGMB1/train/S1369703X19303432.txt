 This research aimed at comparing the single stage and two stage co digestion of end of life dairy products with a mixture of agro industrial wastes . The two systems were operated in parallel and operational parameters including hydraulic retention time and organic loading rate were tested for their effect on bio hydrogen and bio methane production . During acidogenic fermentation of EoL DPs HRT of 3 days led to process instability due to lactate accumulation whereas HRT of 6 days resulted in maximum hydrogen yield of 0.676mol H

@highlight End of life dairy products EoL DP can be efficiently co digested with agro waste.
@highlight The two stage system yielded 30 higher energy productivity than the single stage.
@highlight EoL DP fermentation in 3 days HRT resulted in lactate accumulation and process failure.
@highlight The co digestion systems were stable despite the high ammonia concentrations.
