 Bone marrow is a rich source of hematopoietic stem cells mesenchymal stem cells and other important stem progenitor cells . It is the traditional source of cells used in hematopoietic cell transplantation which is a proven curative treatment for many blood and immune diseases . BM derived cells have also been shown to have other diverse clinical uses and are increasingly being used in orthopedic medicine regenerative medicine and gene therapy applications . Traditional methods for harvesting BM are crude tedious time consuming and expensive requiring multiple bone punctures under general anesthesia with serial small volume aspirates often diluted with peripheral blood . The MarrowMiner is a novel device designed for rapid and minimally invasive BM harvest . Here we show the safety and efficacy of the MM in both preclinical and clinical settings . In a large animal porcine model the MM enabled effective BM collection with similar total nucleated cell collection and increased colony formation compared with standard methods . The MM was subsequently evaluated in a clinical study showing effective and complication free anterior and posterior BM collection of 20 patients under only local anesthesia or light sedation . Increased total nucleated and mononucleated cell collection was achieved with the MM compared with standard methods in the same patients . Importantly stem cell content was high with trends toward increased HSC MSC and endothelial progenitor cells with similar T cell content . Given the MM is a novel device approved by the US Food and Drug Administration enabling safe effective and minimally invasive harvest of BM we anticipate rapid adoption for various applications .
