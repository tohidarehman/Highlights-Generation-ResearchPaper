 Protocatechuic acid and hydroquinone are two important phenolic molecules with recognized biological activities and industrial values . In the present study we constructed a series of

@highlight biosynthesis of protocatechuic acid and hydroquinone was achieved using
@highlight co cultures.
@highlight Biosensor assisted cell selection was integrated with co culture engineering to enhance the biosynthesis.
@highlight Metabolically engineered co cultures produced more protocatechuic acid and hydroquinone than the mono culture controls.
