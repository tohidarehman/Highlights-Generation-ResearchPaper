 Immobilized enzymes are widely used in the industries for various biochemical reactions in order to gain the benefits of higher stability and reusability . Emerging trends of nanotechnology in immobilization have extended their major applications as carriers for the enzymes . Nanomaterials exhibit different unique properties like high surface area to volume ratio high reactivity catalytic activity rigidity solubility semi conductivity and size dependent optical properties . But it is a great challenge for the nanomaterials to exhibit these unique properties completely in the reaction system due to the diffusion limitations . This review focusses on the involvement of diffusion and diffusion limitations in various catalytic reactions methods to evaluate diffusion limitations and different strategies to overcome . This review can be a different perspective towards the biochemical reactions and can provide information to carry out the enzyme substrate reaction processes using nanomaterials as carriers overcoming diffusion limitations .
