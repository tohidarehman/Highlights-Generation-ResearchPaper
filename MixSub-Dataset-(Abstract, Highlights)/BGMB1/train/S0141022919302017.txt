 is an ascomycete fungus with an enriched content of specific carbohydrate active enzyme families involved in plant biomass degradation which makes this strain a promising industrial cell factory for enzyme production . The development of tools that allow genetic manipulation is crucial for further strain improvement and the functional characterization of its genes . In this context the CRISPR Cas9 system represents an excellent option for genome editing due to its high efficiency and versatility . To establish CRISPR Cas9 genome editing in
