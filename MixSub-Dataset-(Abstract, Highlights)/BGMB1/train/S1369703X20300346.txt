 Astaxanthin exhibiting strong antioxidant activity is widely used as food and animal feed additives as well as in cosmetics pharmaceutical and nutraceuticals industries . Microbial production of astaxanthin has received increasing concerns in recent years . A combined strategy consisting of physical mutagenesis by atmospheric and room temperature plasma and adaptive evolution driven by H

@highlight A combined strategy consisting of mutagenesis and adaptive evolution was proposed.
