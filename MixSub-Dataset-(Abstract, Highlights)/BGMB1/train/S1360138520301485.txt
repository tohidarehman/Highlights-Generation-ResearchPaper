 It is generally accepted that plants locally influence the composition and activity of their rhizosphere microbiome and that rhizosphere community assembly further involves a hierarchy of constraints with varying strengths across spatial and temporal scales . However our knowledge of rhizosphere microbiomes is largely based on single location and time point studies . Consequently it remains difficult to predict patterns at large landscape scales and we lack a clear understanding of how the rhizosphere microbiome forms and is maintained by drivers beyond the influence of the plant . By synthesizing recent literature and collating data on rhizosphere microbiomes we point out the opportunities and challenges offered by advances in molecular biology bioinformatics and data availability . Specifically we highlight the use of exact sequence variants coupled with existing and newly generated data to decipher the rules of rhizosphere community assembly across large spatial and taxonomic scales .

@highlight The processes shaping rhizosphere microbial communities are currently unclear because of both a lack of knowledge about biogeographical patterns and the disconnection between plant and microbial scales.
@highlight Sequence databases have now collected a sufficient amount of data covering a range of biomes and plant taxa to allow synthesis across studies. Recently new bioinformatic methods have been developed that allow us to overcome former spatial and taxonomic limitations.
@highlight Understanding the processes that shape rhizosphere microbial communities will provide important insights into plant ecology and evolutionary biology and can enable us to manage microbial and plant ecosystem services.
