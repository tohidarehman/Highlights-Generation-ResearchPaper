 After autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation in the first complete remission patients with acute myeloid leukemia may relapse and undergo allogeneic HCT in the second complete remission . The aim of this study was to analyze the outcome of allogeneic HCT performed in CR2 comparing patients with prior consolidation by autologous HCT versus patients with chemotherapy consolidation . Included were 2619 adults with allogeneic HCT in CR2 from 2000 to 2017 with or without prior autologous HCT . Patient groups were not entirely comparable patients with prior autologous HCT were younger had less often a favorable cytogenetic profile had more commonly donors other than matched siblings and more often received reduced intensity conditioning . In multivariate analysis nonrelapse mortality risks in patients with prior autologous HCT were 1.34 1.07 to 1.67
