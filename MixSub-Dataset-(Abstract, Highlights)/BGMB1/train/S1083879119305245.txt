 Philadelphia chromosomelike acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a relatively new entity characterized by high cytokine receptor and tyrosine kinase signaling resulting in multiple downstream pathway stimulation . The standard diagnostic method gene expression profiling is not widely available . Efforts are ongoing to establish easy and clinically applicable diagnostic pathways to facilitate the accurate identification of these patients and thus enable a better understanding of the prognosis and outcomes with different treatment approaches . The rates of complete remission in ALL patients are consistently above 90 with the different induction protocols however maintaining remission depends on the risk group of the patient and consolidation therapy . Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant is particularly beneficial when the risk of relapse is very high and the expected complications with transplant are low . Data on the outcomes of allo HCT for Ph like ALL are scarce . In this article we review the published literature on outcomes of Ph like ALL patients treated using different therapeutic approaches and make recommendations about transplant consideration for these patients .
