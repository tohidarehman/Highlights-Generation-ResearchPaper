 Rootsoil interactions in the rhizosphere are central to resource acquisition and crop production in agricultural systems . However apart from studies in idealized experimental systems rhizosphere processes in real agricultural soils

@highlight Rootsoil interactions involving rhizosphere sensing root architecture and function as well as root induced rhizosphere processes are crucial for soil health sustainable food security and resource use efficiency.
@highlight Heterogeneity is an important feature of the rhizosphere and this poses a challenge to a thorough understanding of rootsoil processes.
@highlight Uneven distribution of soil particles and resources shapes root activities and the consequent root induced modification of the rhizosphere.
@highlight Understanding and integrating root biology with soil processes in the context of the heterogeneous physical structure and resource distribution in soil will help close the application gap between rhizosphere research and agricultural practice thereby contributing to sustainable crop production.
