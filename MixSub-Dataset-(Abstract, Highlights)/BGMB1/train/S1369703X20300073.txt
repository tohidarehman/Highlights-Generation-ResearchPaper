 genus is an important biological control agent . Most industrial conidia production processes are based on the use of plastic bags or containers containing 1kg of substrate . Static bioreactors such as packed columns trays and plastic bags are used for different scale conidia production . However the effect of aeration mechanism on conidia production and quality has not been evaluated . Therefore the productivity and quality of conidia produced in three types of bioreactors were evaluated

@highlight Conidia production increased threefold in aerated packed column bioreactor.
@highlight Conidia productivity in columns were twice as high than those in trays and bags.
@highlight Maximum conidia production was attained when the CO
@highlight production rate decreased 50 .
@highlight Infectivity of conidia was independent of the aeration mechanisms tested.
