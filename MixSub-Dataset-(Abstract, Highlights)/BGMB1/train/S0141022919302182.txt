 Isofloridoside is the main photosynthetic product in red algae . Here given the importance of isofloridoside a potentially effective method to produce isofloridoside from galactose and glycerol using whole cell biocatalysts harboring galactosidase was developed . Galactosidase encoding genes from

@highlight First a potentially effective method for producing isofloridoside by galactosidase catalyzed reverse hydrolysis of galactose and glycerol is developed.
@highlight Second a novel galactosidase AHGLA from
@highlight was achived to synthesize isofloridoside from galactose and glycerol.
@highlight Third In the optimum biotransformation conditions the final isofloridoside concentration reached 0.45M galactose conversion 23 .
