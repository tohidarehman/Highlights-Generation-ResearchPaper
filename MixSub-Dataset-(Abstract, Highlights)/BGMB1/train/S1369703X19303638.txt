 During the past two decades cell culture has played an important role in many biochemical and biomedical fields . However finding an alternative to animal serum is an important area in cell culture methods and related biotechnology industries . In a previous study we demonstrated that the platelet rich plasma from specific pathogen free pigs was a rich source of cytokines and growth factors and might serve as a replacement for animal serum . The selection of an activator is a crucial step in PRP activation and affects the availability of bioactive molecules . The present study is the first to demonstrate the ability of ectoine to activate PRP and to investigate the effects of ectoine activated PRP on cell proliferation and biological function . The amounts of bioactive molecules including TGF PDGF AB EGF VEGF KGF and IGF secreted from PRP activated by ectoine were measured . In addition two types of primary cells and three types of cell lines were cultured with various concentrations of ectoine activated PRP under animal serum free conditions . Then the effects of ectoine activated PRP on cell growth kinetics extracellular matrix secretion and melanin synthesis were also determined . Finally our results demonstrated that ectoine is a novel and effective PRP activator and that ectoine activated PRP can serve as an excellent replacement for animal serum in cell culture and related applications .

@highlight This study was the first to demonstrate that ectoine is an effective PRP activator.
