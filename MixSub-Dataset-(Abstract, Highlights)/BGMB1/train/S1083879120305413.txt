 Recent progress in genetic analysis technology has helped researchers understand the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia . Considering this progress AML karyotype is still one of the most significant prognostic factors that provides risk adapted treatment approaches . Karyotype changes during treatment have been observed at times but their prognostic impact is sparse especially on allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Here we retrospectively investigated the effect of chromosomal changes between diagnosis and pretransplantation on the prognosis of allo SCT by analyzing the outcomes of 212 consecutive patients who underwent allo SCT for the first time at Toranomon Hospital Tokyo Japan between 2008 and 2018 . Cytogenetic abnormalities at diagnosis and pretransplantation were categorized based on the 2017 European Leukemia Net risk stratification . Genetic abnormalities such as

@highlight Effect of acute myeloid leukemia karyotype on the outcomes of allogeneic stem cell transplantation was tested.
