 This study aims to improve the efficiency of 4 androstene 317 dione production from high concentrated phytosterols through a combined strategy of metabolic pathway regulation and two step bioprocess . Firstly we overexpressed cholesterol oxidase and steroid C27 monooxygenase to strengthen the metabolic flux to AD and then enhanced the expression of 17 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to reduce the by product 20 hydroxy methylpregna 4 ene 3 one . As a result the AD production was enhanced from 2.4 to 4.5g L with an increase of 88.6 . Afterward a two step bioprocess cell culture at 30C and bioconversion with resting cells at 37C was adopted to avoid the cell growth inhibition and decrease the steroid nucleus degradation . Finally 25.8g L AD was produced from 50g L phytosterols which is significantly higher than that from the fermentation bioprocess and is the highest reported AD production . Therefore this work hopes to pave the way for the commercial production of AD through

@highlight The sterol catabolic pathway was regulated to enhance AD production.
@highlight A two step bioprocess was adopted to avoid the cell growth inhibition and decrease the steroid nucleus degradation.
@highlight A combined strategy was developed successfully for improved AD production.
@highlight The titer of 25.8g L AD and the molar yield of 78.1 was achieved.
