 Structure based molecular designs play a critical role in the context of next generation drug development . Besides their fundamental scientific aspects the findings established in this approach have significant implications in the expansions of target based therapies and vaccines . Interleukin 18 also known as interferon gamma inducing factor is a pro inflammatory cytokine . The IL 18 binds first to the IL 18 receptor and forms a lower affinity complex . Upon binding with IL 18 a hetero trimeric complex with higher affinity is formed that initiates the signal transduction process . The present study including structural and molecular dynamics simulations takes a close look at the structural stabilities of IL 18 and IL 18 receptor bound ligand structures as functions of time . The results help to identify the conformational changes of the ligand due to receptor binding as well as the structural orders of the apo and holo IL 18 protein complexes .
