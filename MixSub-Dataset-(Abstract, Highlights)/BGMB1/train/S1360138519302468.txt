 Plant oxylipins are produced under a wide range of stress conditions and although they are well known to activate stress related signalling pathways the nonsignalling roles of POs are poorly understood . We describe oxylipins as direct biocidal agents and propose that structurefunction relationships play here a pivotal role . Based on their chemical configuration POs such as reactive oxygen and electrophile species activate defence related gene expression . We also propose that their ability to interact with pathogen membranes is important but still misunderstood and that they are involved in cross kingdom communication . Taken as a whole the current literature suggests that POs have a high potential as biocontrol agents . However the mechanisms underlying these multifaceted compounds remain largely unknown .

@highlight Many studies have shown that specific oxylipin signatures are shaped during a biotic stresses.
@highlight It is generally accepted that divinyl keto and hydroxy fatty acids and fatty acid hydroperoxides exhibit strong direct antimicrobial activities whereas the roles of jasmonic acid and some volatile aldehydes seem to be related to signalling activities only.
@highlight Oxylipins chemical structures are related to their biological activities.
@highlight Current studies show that the lipid composition of the plasma membrane has important roles in the interaction of plant oxylipins with plant cells.
@highlight It is becoming clear that many organisms use the oxylipin pathways as a common process for interkingdom communication
