 Glutaric acid is a C5 dicarboxylic acid that can be used as a building block for bioplastics . Although high concentrations of glutaric acid can be produced by fermentation or bioconversion a large amount of ketoglutaric acid is necessary to accept the amine group from 5 aminovaleric acid . To decrease the demand for KG we introduced

@highlight Whole cell bioconversion of glutaric acid was achieved with cofactor regeneration.
@highlight  Ketoglutaric acid was regenerated approximately 3 times.
@highlight Catalase was effective to reduce level of hydrogen peroxide.
@highlight 468mM glutaric acid was produced from 800mM 5 aminovaleric acid.
@highlight This is the first application of ketoglutaric acid for glutaric acid production system.
