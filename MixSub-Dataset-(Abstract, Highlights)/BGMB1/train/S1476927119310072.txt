@highlight Seasonal and pandemic influenza infections are serious threats to public health.
@highlight Computational research serves as a time saving alternative to the experimental research that yields promising compounds and targets.
@highlight A network pharmacology based strategy was used to predict potential compounds and target genes from Fritillaria thunbergii FT against influenza.
@highlight Compound target C T Compound Disease Target C D protein protein interaction PPI and Compound Disease Target Pathway C D P networks were constructed to analyze FTs effect against influenza.
@highlight Network analyses predicted two compounds beta sitosterol and pelargonidin derived from FT that may be potent candidates for influenza treatment.
