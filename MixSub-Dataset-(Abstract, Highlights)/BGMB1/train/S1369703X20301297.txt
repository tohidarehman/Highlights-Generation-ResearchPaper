 Data about the effects of mycelium on local air dispersion in stirred tanks are very limited . Available information has been focused in laboratory scale bioreactors and under constant stirring speed conditions . However aeration and the biomass cause indirect changes in the actual power consumption . Therefore studies keeping constant the gassed power input per unit volume P

@highlight Local BSD and d
@highlight were analyzed with retrofitted P
@highlight  V in a three phases system.
@highlight The presence of mycelial biomass change the BSD from bimodal to unimodal shape.
@highlight Air dispersion patterns were different in the three positions analyzed.
@highlight The bottom impeller showed a peculiar behavior suggesting that it was flooded.
