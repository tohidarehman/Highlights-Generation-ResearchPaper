 Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation is a standard initial treatment for multiple myeloma . Consensus guidelines recommend collecting sufficient hematopoietic progenitor cells for 2 autoHCTs in all eligible patients . Despite a lack of published data on the utilization of HPCs stored for future use it is common practice across transplantation programs to collect enough HPCs for 2 autoHCTs in MM patients . In this single center retrospective study we analyzed the utilization of HPCs collected and stored at the time of first autoHCT in patients with MM along with the cost implications of HPC collection targets sufficient for 2 transplantations . In a cohort of 400 patients after a median follow up of 50.4 months 197 patients had relapsed and 36 had received HPC infusion as salvage autoHCT and or HPC boost . In this cohort a median CD34

@highlight In the majority of patients with multiple myeloma hematopoietic progenitor cells HPCs collected at the time of first autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation autoHCT are not used for a future salvage autoHCT or stem cell boost.
@highlight The evidence supporting continued collection HPCs for later use in patients age 70 years is weak.
@highlight A small proportion of the cost incurred during upfront HPC collection before first autoHCT and intended for later use is actually utilized for salvage autoHCT and or stem cell boost.
