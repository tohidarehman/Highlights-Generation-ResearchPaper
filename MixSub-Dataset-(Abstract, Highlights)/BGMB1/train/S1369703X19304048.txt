 To scale up a filling process in a cell manufacturing system the impact of the processing time on the final product quality should be evaluated . It is known that the suspended cells in a cryopreservation solution are subjected to various types of stress factors which eventually results in apoptotic or necrotic death . In this study the aim was to investigate a critical factor of cell decay in human induced pluripotent stem cells suspended in a cryopreservation solution and to propose a methodology to maintain the viability of cells for a longer filling process time . Based on experimental results it was determined that the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species induces apoptosis of cells suspended in a cryopreservation solution . In addition treatment with an antioxidant or a low temperature condition was effective in suppressing the induction of apoptosis and subsequent cell death . In particular the treatment at low temperature was able to maintain the attachment efficiency of suspended cells at a higher level compared to the treatment with antioxidants . The appropriate control of redox balance in cells suspended in a cryopreservation solution could improve the viability of cells in the filling process and lead to the successful lot size expansion of cell manufacturing systems .
