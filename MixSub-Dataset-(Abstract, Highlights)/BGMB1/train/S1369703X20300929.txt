 Hydrocarbon substrates can be upgraded to high value products through biological oxidation processes whereby an oxygen moiety is inserted into the hydrocarbon backbone by microbes in a suitable bioreactor system such as a bubble column reactor . However there is a need to understand the behaviour of the Sauter bubble diameter D

@highlight Gas hold up and bubble diameter measured under different operational conditions.
@highlight Superficial gas velocity linearly increased the gas hold up and bubble diameter.
@highlight Hydrocarbons had an insignificant impact on gas hold up and bubble diameter.
@highlight Yeast loadings increased the bubble diameter which therefore gas hold up decreased.
