 Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is the treatment of choice for acute myelogenous leukemia not responding to induction therapy . It is a therapeutic choice for the blast phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia in patients failing to respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors . Lipid core nanoparticles concentrate severalfold more in blast cells than in corresponding normal cells . Incorporation of anticancer drugs to LDE formulations increases the pharmacologic action and decreases the toxicity . We tested a drug targeting system LDE etoposide plus total body irradiation in 13 patients with AML not responding to the induction therapy and in 2 patients with CML BP refractory to second generation TKIs . The mean patient age was 46.7 years . The LDE etoposide dose was escalated at 20 30 40 50 and 60 mg kg . No patients developed grade 4 or 5 toxicity however mucositis grade 3 occurred in 6 patients 3 patients experienced diarrhea and 1 patient had an elevated total bilirubin level . No deaths were related to conditioning . All patients were successfully engrafted . The median times to neutrophil and platelet engraftment were 20 5 days and 16 4 days respectively . Five patients had acute graft versus host disease including 4 grade I and 1 with grade II and 8 patients had moderate to severe chronic GVHD

@highlight A drug targeting vehicle was used for the first time in hematopoietic cell transplantation conditioning.
@highlight Etoposide into nanoparticles plus total body irradiation showed low toxicity and safety.
@highlight All patients had engrafted and no deaths occurred related to the conditioning regimen.
@highlight Myeloablation engraftment and low toxicity were unrelated to drug dose levels.
