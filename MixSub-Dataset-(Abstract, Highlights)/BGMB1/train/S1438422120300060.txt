 The occurrence of antibiotic resistance bacteria has become a major threat to public health . We have recently discovered a transcriptional activator that belongs to MarR family EstR and an esterase B with a newly proposed de arenethiolase activity from

@highlight EstR regulates expression of esterase B EstB in
@highlight sp. SM42.
@highlight EstR activates
@highlight in response to cefoperazone.
@highlight EstB at periplasm activates cefoperazone to be more active.
@highlight Efficiency of EstB is enhanced by immobilization to inner and outer membranes.
