 Angiotensinogen is a key component of renin angiotensin aldosterone system which plays central role in blood pressure homeostasis . Association of AGT polymorphisms have been investigated in different ethnic populations in variety of cardiovascular and non cardiovascular conditions . In this study 354 non synonymous SNPs of AGT were evaluated to predict damaging and structurally important variants . Majority of the deleterious nsSNPs occurred in the evolutionary conserved regions . Several of these nsSNPs were found to affect post translational modifications like methylation glycosylation phosphorylation ubiquitination etc . Structural evaluations predicted 19 variants as destabilizing and some of them were also predicted to destabilize the renin AGT interaction . Therefore the present computational investigation predicted pathogenic and functionally important variants of human

@highlight Highly damaging and pathogenic nsSNPs in human angiotensinogen gene are predicted.
@highlight Majority of deleterious nsSNPs in human angiotensinogen are evolutionary conserved.
@highlight Several nsSNPs are found to affect thermodynamic stability and post translational modifications of angiotensinogen.
@highlight Various nsSNPs are found to destabilize the renin angiotensinogen interaction.
@highlight Angiotensinogen deregulation is observed to impact survival in patients with gastric and breast cancer.
