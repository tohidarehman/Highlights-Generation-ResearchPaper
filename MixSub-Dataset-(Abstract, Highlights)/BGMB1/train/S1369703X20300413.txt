 As a natural biomaterial lignin is mainly obtained from waste in the pulping and papermaking industry and is becoming an alternative to petroleum based chemicals . Lignin based nanoparticles provide new possibilities for value added utilization . In this work a novel pH responsive drug loaded polymeric nanoparticle platform based on aminated lignin histidine conjugate and 10 hydroxycamptothecin AL His HCPT NP is prepared by self assembly . Based on the acidic microenvironment of tumor cells the AL His HCPT NPs are successfully imparted the pH responsiveness by histidine a pH responsive small molecule to achieve triggered drug release . After 19h of simulated release in vitro the drug release amount of the nanoparticles was 39.1 at pH 7.2 63.1 at pH 5.5 and 72.5 at pH 4.5 indicating the pH responsiveness . Meanwhile the NPs have relatively small particle size which is key to anti tumor nano carriers . It is characterized by great biocompatibility good drug loading performance and effective cellular uptake . In 4T1 tumor bearing mice model the group treated with NPs shows excellent anti tumor effect and reduced side effects . These results indicate that AL His HCPT NPs have great application prospects in drug delivery .

@highlight The AL His NPs were prepared by self assemble using aminated lignin and histidine.
@highlight The NPs exhibited pH responsiveness to triggered the release of anti tumor drugs.
@highlight The NPs are relatively uniform and smaller in size for lignin based nanoparticles.
