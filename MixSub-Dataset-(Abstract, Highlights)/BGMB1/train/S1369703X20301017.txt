 An unstructuredunsegregated temperature dependent kinetic model was developed and validated to describe ethanol fermentation in a mixture of xylose and glucose for the nonconventional yeast

@highlight A kinetic model describing fermentation from mixed C5 and C6 sugars was proposed.
@highlight The kinetic model was composed by 13 equations and 16 kinetic parameters.
@highlight A differential evolution algorithm was applied for parameter estimation.
@highlight Four parameters were estimated as a function of temperature as Arrhenius equations.
@highlight Through model simulation the highest ethanol productivity is attained between 30 and 32C.
