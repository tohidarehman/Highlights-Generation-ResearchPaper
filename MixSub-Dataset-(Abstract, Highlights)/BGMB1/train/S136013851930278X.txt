 Retrograde signals are signals that originate in organelles to regulate nuclear gene expression . In plant cells retrograde signaling from both chloroplasts and mitochondria is essential for plant development and growth . Over the past few years substantial progress has been made in unraveling the linkages between chloroplast retrograde signaling and nuclear RNA metabolism processes or plastidial RNA editing . These findings add to the complexity of the regulation of organelle to nucleus communication . Chloroplast development and function rely on the coordinated regulation of chloroplast and nuclear gene expression especially under stress conditions . A better understanding of retrograde signaling and RNA metabolism as well as their connection is essential for breeding stress tolerant plants to cope with the dynamic and rapidly changing environment .

@highlight Chloroplast development and function rely on the coordinated regulation of chloroplast and nuclear gene expression.
@highlight RNA metabolism including RNA editing alternative splicing and RNA turnover is an important regulatory process for plant development and function.
@highlight During development or stress situations organelles such as chloroplasts and mitochondria generate signals that regulate the expression of nuclear genes a process called retrograde signaling.
@highlight Retrograde signaling generated by the chloroplast PQ pool redox state regulates the alternative splicing of nuclear genes.
@highlight GUN1 an integrator of multiple chloroplast retrograde signaling pathways regulates RNA editing efficiency in damaged chloroplasts. Abnormal RNA editing may play a role in chloroplast to nucleus retrograde signaling.
@highlight Signals from tocopherols metabolism in chloroplasts regulate nuclear microRNA biogenesis.
