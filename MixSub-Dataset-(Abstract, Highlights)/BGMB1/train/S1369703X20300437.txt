 In this work the feasibility of ethanol production from waste pizza by enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation was investigated . The effects of enzyme volumes and WP mass ratios on the performance of enzymatic hydrolysis and ethanol fermentation were also examined . It was observed that the lowest enzyme volume could completely hydrolyze WP with mass ratio of 50g L. The reducing sugar increased obviously with increasing of WP mass ratio from 50g L to 160g L when the enzyme volume of 0.02mL L was applied . The WP hydrolysate was utilized as substrate for bio ethanol production with the highest cumulative ethanol production of 27.58g L and ethanol yield of 0.292g g WP respectively . To our knowledge this is the first study to report ethanol production from WP by enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation .
