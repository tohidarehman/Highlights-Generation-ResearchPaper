 Large amounts of straw produced each year are currently wasted . A potential use of this resource in permeable reactive barriers for the denitrification of polluted groundwater has not previously been reported . In this study a field PRB filled with straw based materials was installed to reduce nitrogen transport in the Huaihe River Basin . In initial laboratory scale experiments wheat straw corn straw corncobs and woodchip substrates were investigated through elemental analysis leaching experiments and their functional gene abundance . The carbon and nitrogen contents of the substrates were 39.6248.17 and 0.641.07 . Corn straw 15.12mgg

@highlight NO
@highlight N removal of 60 from groundwater was achieved with a straw based PRB.
@highlight Biodenitrification occurred with waste straw material.
@highlight No secondary pollution as measured by chromaticity and nitrogen was observed.
@highlight Agricultural straw is a suitable alternative to woodchip as a PRB filler.
