 Veno occlusive disease sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is a potentially life threatening complication of hematopoietic cell transplantation . Early diagnosis and subsequently earlier intervention have been shown to be beneficial to clinical outcomes . Diagnostic criteria from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation include recommendations on the use of imaging for diagnosis . This review discusses evidence on the use of imaging in the management of VOD SOS and how imaging biomarkers can contribute to earlier diagnosis treatment .

@highlight Early detection and prompt treatment of veno occlusive disease sinusoidal obstruction syndrome VOD SOS are critical to optimal management.
@highlight Recent criteria have suggested a role for imaging in diagnosing VOD SOS.
@highlight Evidence supports the use of ultrasound to confirm diagnosis and monitor treatment.
@highlight Ultrasound elastography is promising in early VOD SOS diagnosis response evaluation.
@highlight Clinical studies validating use of imaging in management of VOD SOS are needed.
