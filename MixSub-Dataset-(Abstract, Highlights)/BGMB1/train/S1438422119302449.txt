 Bacterial outer membrane vesicles play a vital role in the mechanism of hostpathogen communication while emerging evidence suggests that OMVs regulate host immune responses through differentially packaged small noncoding RNAs to target host mRNA function . Therefore we identified differentially packaged sncRNAs in

@highlight Differentially sncRNAs were packaged in
@highlight OMVs.
@highlight sR 2509025 and sR 989262 reduced LPS or OMV induced IL 8 secretion in AGS cells.
@highlight OMVs sncRNAs play a novel role in the hostpathogen interaction of that
@highlight evades the host immune response.
