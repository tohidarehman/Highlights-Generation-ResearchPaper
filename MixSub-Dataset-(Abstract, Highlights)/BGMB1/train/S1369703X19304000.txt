 In this study anaerobic membrane bioreactor was applied for the treatment of a model slurry of high strength organic solid waste . Continuous monitoring of reactor performances by chemical analyses and fine scale tracing of the AnMBR sludge microbiome by high throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing were conducted during the long term operation with increased organic loading rates up to 5.26 kgCOD m

@highlight Long term acclimatization of AnMBR sludge to treat organic solid waste was performed.
@highlight SRT control to optimize MLSS in AnMBR improved reactor performances.
@highlight High resolution dynamics of the AnMBR sludge microbiome were revealed.
@highlight Constitution of methanogens was changed with the OLR increase and SRT control.
@highlight Syntrophic methanogenesis was responsible for AnMBR treatment of organic solid waste.
