 The specific description risk factors and outcomes of chronic graft versus host disease in pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies after T cell replete myeloablative haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with antithymocyte globulin granulocyte colony stimulating factor have not been previously well described . We retrospectively analyzed the incidence risk factors and outcomes of cGVHD documented according to the 2014 National Institutes of Health consensus criteria in 292 consecutive pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies after TCR myeloablative haplo HSCT with ATG G CSF between January 2015 and December 2017 . A total of 170 patients experienced cGVHD . The 3 year cumulative incidence of total cGVHD and mild moderate and severe cGVHD was 57.9 27.5 18.8 and 11.9 respectively . Multivariate analysis showed that acute GVHD grade II IV hazard ratio 1.578

@highlight This study represents the first report on the incidence risk factors and outcomes of chronic graft versus host disease cGVHD applying the 2014 National Institutes of Health consensus criteria in pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies after unmanipulated T cell replete myeloablative haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation haplo HSCT with antithymocyte globulin granulocyte colony stimulating factor.
@highlight The incidence of severe cGVHD in pediatric haplo HSCT was acceptable.
@highlight Previous aGVHD grade II IV was a risk factor for the occurrence of cGVHD.
@highlight Only mild or moderate cGVHD was associated with a lower risk of relapse translating into improved disease free survival and overall survival in pediatric haplo HSCT.
