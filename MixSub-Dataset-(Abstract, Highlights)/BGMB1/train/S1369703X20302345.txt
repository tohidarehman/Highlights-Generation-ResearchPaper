 The orange peel waste is essentially an important residue in many countries representing more a problem than one opportunity . Most of this residue processing is related to low added value products and it includes the generation of other residues . Among new alternatives to valorize this residue during last years a high added value product is the mucic acid . This work addresses the pre feasibility analysis of the mucic acid production using galacturonic acid from pectin using Orange Peel Waste as feedstock through the biorefinery concept . The proposed biorefinery comprises the pectin extraction using citric acid mucic acid production from the liquid fraction of the pectin hydrolysis and biogas production using the remaining solid . The experiments for pectin extraction and biogas production were carried out to determine the yields to be used in the process simulation . The material and energy balances of the biorefinery were obtained through the Aspen Plus V9.0 tool . These results were used in the energy economic and environmental evaluation . A preliminary environmental evaluation for the process was done with Waste Reduction Algorithm software . The experimental pectin hydrolysis and biogas production yields were 0.15 0.77 g g of OPW and 0.256 Nm

@highlight Orange peel waste yields 20.14 kg tonne of mucic acid.
@highlight Biogas and mucic acid production costs are reduced by 36 increasing the OPW flow.
@highlight Mucic acid production demands 42 of the capital investment of the OPW biorefinery.
