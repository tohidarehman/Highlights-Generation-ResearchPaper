 In many application fields microbial lipases have to coexist with hydrogen peroxide in the same reaction system and it is necessary to construct hydrogen peroxide tolerant lipase mutant variants . Mass changes between native amino acids and the oxidized amino acids by hydrogen peroxide were determined using mass spectrometry in early research . Based on the known 3D structure information and mass spectrometric analysis data an extremely small library of

@highlight Accurately predict oxidized amino acid residues of lipase LipA in hydrogen peroxide.
@highlight An extremely small but smart library contained only twenty six lipase LipA mutants.
