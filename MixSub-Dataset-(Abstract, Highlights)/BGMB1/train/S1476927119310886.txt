 One of the hallmarks of Parkinsons disease a long term neurodegenerative syndrome is the accumulation of alpha synuclein fibrils . Despite numerous studies and efforts inhibition of syn protein aggregation is still a challenge . To overcome this issue we propose an

@highlight The first report to identify drugs for repositioning against alpha synuclein aggregation inhibition.
@highlight 3D ligand based pharmacophore model for alpha synuclein inhibition developed.
@highlight Key pharmacophore features consist of three HBD two HBA and two AR.
@highlight New compounds identified as potential alpha synuclein inhibitors.
