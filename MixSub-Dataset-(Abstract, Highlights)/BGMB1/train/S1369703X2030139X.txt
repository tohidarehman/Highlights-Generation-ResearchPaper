 In this study we presented an integrated systems biology approach to elucidate the key characteristics of cellular metabolism in Chinese hamster ovary cells producing monoclonal antibodies . The cellular metabolism in high and low producers under batch conditions was interrogated dynamically both within and among cells . First transcriptomics analysis was used to study the time course change in the metabolic pathway within cells that was correlated with mAb productivity increase . Second differentially regulated pathways between high and low producers were sought at each growth phase . Several up regulated pathways were identified in the high producer at the late growth phase including citrate cycle oxidative phosphorylation and pentose phosphate pathway . These activities were further analyzed by intracellular flux distributions estimated through a genome scale CHO model . Our results revealed that these key pathways are identified to be characteristics of high mAb production not only for the high producing cell line but also a dynamic phenomenon in mAb producing cell cultures . This study showed that the approach of integrating transcriptomics and flux analysis leads to a better understanding of cellular metabolism related to mAb productivity . In turn this allows for the identification of metabolic bottlenecks and potential engineering targets for cell line development and process optimization .
