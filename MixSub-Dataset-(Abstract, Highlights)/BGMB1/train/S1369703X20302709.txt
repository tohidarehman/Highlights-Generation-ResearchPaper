 A comparison between a mixed aerobic anoxic horizontal fixed bed reactor and an aerobic horizontal fixed bed reactor coupled with an anoxic vertical fixed bed reactor was made in order to evaluate the nitrogen removal behavior when nitrification and sulfide driven autotrophic denitrification occurred in a single unit or spatially separated . Both systems achieved Total N removal efficiencies higher than 89 . Moreover for both reactors the effluent pH was affected for bicarbonate alkalinities lower than 250mg CaCO

@highlight Total N removal higher than 89 was achieved for both reactors.
@highlight Biomass discharges enhanced nitrogen removal efficiencies.
@highlight Insights regards O
@highlight impacts on S
@highlight production at N S ratios 0.55 were addressed.
