 IMUFRJ 50682 is a Brazilian wild type strain with potential application in bioconversion processes which can be improved through synthetic biology . In this study we focused on a combinatorial dual cleavage CRISPR Cas9 mediated for construction of irreversible auxotrophic mutants IMUFRJ 50682 which genomic information is not available thought paired sgRNAs targeting upstream and downstream sites of

@highlight A novel Brazilian
@highlight auxotrophic strain was constructed.
@highlight A dual cleavage CRISPR Cas9 strategy was efficient for excision of whole

@highlight Auxotrophic mutants IMUFRJ 50682 displayed an 80 100 cloning rate.
@highlight This new chassis was explored to carotene biosynthesis.
