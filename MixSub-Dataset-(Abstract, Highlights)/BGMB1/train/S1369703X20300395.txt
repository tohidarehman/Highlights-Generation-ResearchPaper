 Medium chain alkanediols are extensively used as monomers in the polymer and chemical industries with most alkanediol production dependent on chemical processes . Here a new bioprocess cytochrome P450 monooxygenase dependent whole cell biotransformation was investigated for use in dodecane oxidation .

@highlight Whole cell biotransformation of 1 dodecanol into 1 12 dodecanediol by CYP153A33 and Nfa22290.
@highlight Whole cell biotransformation of 1 dodecanol with FadL outer membrane transporter.
@highlight Heme precursor feeding for heme synthesis and CYP activity.
@highlight Multi step cascade oxidation of dodecane to 1 12 dodecanediol by CYP.
