 Sodium acetate has been most commonly used as the external carbon source to achieve successful performance of full scale enhanced biological phosphorus removal processes but its microbial mechanism for the improvement of phosphorus removal performance was still unclear . DNA based stable isotope probing is able to discriminate the metabolic activity of different microbes for specific substrates thus it was applied to explore the different effects of sodium acetate on the community structure of

@highlight HAc supplementation notably improved
@highlight and
@highlight abundance.
@highlight 42 hs SIP incubation is enough for the
@highlight C DNA generation by Accumulibacter.
@highlight Clade IID exhibited the highest proportion in all clades regardless of HAc addition.
@highlight Accumulibacter had higher HAc assimilating activity than Competibacter.
@highlight Clade IIF presented the highest acetate assimilating activity in all clades.
