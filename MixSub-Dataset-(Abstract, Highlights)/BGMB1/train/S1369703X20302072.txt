 Splitting anaerobic digestion processes into two reactors may be biologically advantageous but their separation in two stages significantly increases energetic costs . Therefore the aim of this work was to study the energetic feasibility of a two stage system producing hydrogen and methane by anaerobically co digesting whey and glycerin in a sequencing batch reactor . The highest methane productivity 185.9 molCH
