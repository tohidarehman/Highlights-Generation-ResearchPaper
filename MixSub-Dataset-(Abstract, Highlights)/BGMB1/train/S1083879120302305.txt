 Adult T cell leukemia lymphoma is a mature T cell malignancy associated with human T cell leukemia virus type I a retrovirus that is endemic in southwestern Japan . Because of population migration cases of ATL are expected to increase in nonendemic areas . Here to clarify the outcomes of patients with ATL in the nonendemic metropolitan area of Osaka we retrospectively analyzed data from the population based Osaka Cancer Registry from 2010 to 2015 . This analysis included 91 patients age 70 years who received chemotherapy for ATL . With a median follow up of 988 days in surviving patients the probability of 2 year overall survival was 21.9 14.1 to 30.9 and the median OS was 9.8 months . The probability of 2 year OS was 22.2 in the nontransplant group and 21.4 in the transplant group without a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups . Allogeneic transplantation was not a favorable prognostic factor in patients with ATL in propensity score adjusted analysis

@highlight The clinical outcomes in transplantation recipients and nonrecipients were poor in a nonendemic metropolitan area of Osaka Japan.
@highlight Patients who received mogamulizumab before undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation had an unacceptably high nonrelapse mortality rate.
@highlight More clinical studies are needed to improve the clinical outcomes in nonendemic areas.
