 Fluid overload grade 2 has recently been recognized as an important toxicity associated with a high rate of nonrelapse mortality in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation . The causes for FO remain unclear . We hypothesized that endothelial damage possibly due to treatments received prior to AHCT may be associated with this toxicity and sought to determine whether the Endothelial Activation and Stress Index creatinine platelets 10

@highlight High Endothelial Activation and Stress Index EASIX score at time of admission predicts the occurrence of grade 2 fluid overload toxicity in recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
@highlight For haploidentical transplants independently of EASIX score older patients with lower weight had an increased risk of grade 2 fluid overload toxicity.
@highlight For HLA matched transplants independently of EASIX score diabetics had an increased risk of grade 2 fluid overload toxicity.
