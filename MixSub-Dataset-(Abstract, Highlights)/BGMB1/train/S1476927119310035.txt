 Identifying significant protein groups is of great importance for further understanding protein functions . This paper introduces a novel three phase heuristic method for identifying such groups in weighted PPI networks . In the first phase a variable neighborhood search algorithm is applied on a weighted PPI network in order to support protein complexes by adding a minimum number of new PPIs . In the second phase proteins from different complexes are merged into larger protein groups . In the third phase these groups are expanded by a number of 2 level neighbor proteins favoring proteins that have higher average gene co expression with the base group proteins . Experimental results show that the proposed VNS algorithm outperforms the existing approach described in literature and the above mentioned three phase method identifies protein groups with very high statistical significance .

@highlight A novel variable neighborhood search heuristic approach for supporting known complexes in weighted PPI networks by integrating data from different sources PPI networks protein complexes and gene co expression.
@highlight The proposed approach efficiently searches the overall searching space and is a successful method for solving both artificial and large real PPI networks.
@highlight The proposed three phase method revealed meaningful protein groups with high enrichment scores which previously were not interconnected in PPI networks.
@highlight Grouping the proteins in PPI networks in the described way may help to understand their intrinsic structures and functions.
