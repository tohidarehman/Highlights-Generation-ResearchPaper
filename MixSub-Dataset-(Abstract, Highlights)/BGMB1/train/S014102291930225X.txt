 could accumulate large amounts of triacylglycerol and astaxanthin under various environmental stresses . To gain insights into the multiple defensive systems for carbon metabolism against nitrogen starvation transcriptome analysis was performed . It was found that the genes related to carbon fixation glycolysis fatty acid and carotenoid biosynthesis pathways were up regulated remarkably . Glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate biosynthesis was accelerated with the enhanced C3 and C4 pathway . Meanwhile the pyruvate kinase and pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 component genes were significantly increased 12.9 fold and 13.9 fold respectively resulting more pyruvate and acetyl CoA generation which were beneficial to carotenoids and fatty acid biosynthesis . Methylerythritol 4 phosphate pathway mediated carotenoid precursor isopentenyl diphosphate synthesis as the all eight related genes were up regulated . The carbon flux toward astaxanthin biosynthesis with the increased astaxanthin pathway genes . The redistribution of carbon was also promoted for TAG accumulation . In addition the up regulation of diacylglycerol acyltransferase and phospholipid diacylglycerol acyltransferase genes indicated that both acyl CoA dependent and independent pathway regulated TAG accumulation . Therefore this work reveals the multiple defensive mechanism for carbon metabolism in response to nitrogen starvation which extended our understanding on the carotenoids TAG and other important metabolites synthesis .
