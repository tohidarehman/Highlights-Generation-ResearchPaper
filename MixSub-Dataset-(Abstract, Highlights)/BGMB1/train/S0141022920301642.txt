 Secretion is a common bottleneck in the production of industrial proteins . Although overexpression of the unfolded protein response regulator Hac1p has been widely used to enhance protein secretion its effects on the physiology of host cells were often overlooked which would attenuate and even neutralize its beneficial effects on overall protein production .

@highlight A set of Hac1p homologues from different origins were used to improve GOX production in
@highlight PpHac1p and ScHac1p effectively increase GOX secretion in multi copy and high copy strains.
@highlight Reduced cell growth or and stability of GOX gene were observed for Hac1p over expressed recombinant strains.
@highlight A record high GOX production level 2125.3 U mL was achieved with
@highlight to date.
