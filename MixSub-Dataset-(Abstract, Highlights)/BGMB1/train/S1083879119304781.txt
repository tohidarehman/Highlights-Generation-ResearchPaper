 Development of autoimmune cytopenia after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is a serious complication requiring urgent intensification of immunosuppressive therapy . The pathophysiology and predictors of AIC are not completely understood . In this retrospective cohort analysis of 380 pediatric patients we evaluated the incidence outcomes and related various variables including immune reconstitution markers to AIC . Three hundred eighty patients were included of which 30 patients developed AIC in 1 2 or 3 cell lineages at a median of 133 days after HCT . Using multivariate analysis we found that chemo naivety before HCT acute graft versus host disease grades II to IV and serotherapy were associated with the development of AIC . Development of AIC was preceded by increased levels of IgM IgA and IgG . Immune profiles of total absolute lymphocytes were very similar between AIC patients and control subjects . However CD3

@highlight Chemo naivety before HCT and serotherapy are predictors for developing AIC.
@highlight aGVHD grades II to IV is a predictor for developing AIC.
@highlight IgM IgG and IgA levels increase before development of AIC.
@highlight AIC is a rare but severe complication after HCT.
@highlight Recognizing AIC is challenging and treatment should begin as quickly as possible.
