 The present study describes the antibacterial activity of several new derivatives of tacrine or cyclopentaquinoline bound to either 6 hydrazinenicotinic acid or 4 fluorobenzoic acid through an aliphatic chain against methicillin resistant staphylococcal strains . All derivatives showed antibacterial activity against all tested methicillin resistant staphylococci . Of these compounds 6 18 23 and 24 exhibited the highest activity ranging from 4.87 to 19.5g mL MBC depending on the bacterial strain . These values were not much greater than that for vancomycin the reference standard for the treatment of methicillin resistant
