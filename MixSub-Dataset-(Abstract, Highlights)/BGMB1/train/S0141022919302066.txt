 Transglutaminases are a class of transferases widely used in the food and biotechnology industries . In this work we describe the production of recombinant

@highlight Cloning and expression of recombinant
@highlight TGase in
@highlight Protein was obtained in its soluble and active form.
@highlight A bicistronic plasmid was constructed to avoid host cells toxicity.
@highlight TGase gene was fused to the inhibitory
@highlight prodomain.
@highlight We cloned the 3C protease gene into the same plasmid to avoid
@highlight prodomain removal.
