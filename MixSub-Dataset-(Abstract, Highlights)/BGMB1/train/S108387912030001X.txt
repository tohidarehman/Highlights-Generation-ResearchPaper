 Extracorporeal photopheresis is an established treatment strategy in steroid refractory graft versus host disease . This study s main objective was to analyze the clinical response and impact of ECP therapy in steroid dose reduction . A retrospective observational series of 113 patients from 7 transplantation centers was analyzed . Sixty five patients had acute GVHD and 48 had chronic GVHD . All ECP procedures were performed with the off line system . The median number of procedures until achievement of initial response was 3 for both patients with aGVHD and those with cGVHD . ECP was the second line therapy in 48 of the aGVHD cases and in 50 of the cGVHD cases . 71 of the cases of aGVHD were grade III IV and 69 of the cases of cGVHD were severe . The overall response rate on day 28 was 53 rate 45 in the patients with aGVHD and 67 in those with cGVHD . Skin was the most frequently involved organ with a response rate of 58 in the patients with aGVHD and 69 in those with cGVHD . At the end of ECP treatment 60 of patients treated for aGVHD who responded were able to stop steroid therapy with a median dose reduction of 100 . Significant differences in overall survival were observed for patients responding to ECP with aGVHD 4.3

@highlight Photopheresis is an effective treatment for refractory graft versus host disease GVHD .
@highlight Overall response to treatment is the most important variable for survival.
@highlight Gastrointestinal GVHD carries a worse prognosis and response.
@highlight Steroid dose reduction is associated with improved survival in chronic GVHD.
