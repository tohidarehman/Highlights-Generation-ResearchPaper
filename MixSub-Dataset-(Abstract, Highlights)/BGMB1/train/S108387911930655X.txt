 It remains unclear whether the HLA haplotype of unrelated cord blood should be matched to that of the patient in single UCB transplantation . Thus using data from a Japanese registry we analyzed the effect of haplotype matching on outcomes . Patients with hematologic diseases aged 16 years or older who had undergone their first transplant were included . The effects of haplotype matching and high frequency HLA haplotype on outcomes were analyzed . Median patient age was 55 years . The cumulative incidences of neutrophil engraftment among groups with 0 1 and 2 HLA haplotype matches were 79 82 and 88 respectively

@highlight It is better to match the HLA haplotype to improve neutrophil and platelet engraftment in single UCBT.
@highlight Two haplotype matches should be avoided if the relapse risk is high.
@highlight The haplotype itself may have an effect on the risk of acute GVHD and relapse after UCBT.
