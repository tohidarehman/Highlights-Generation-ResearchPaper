 Secondary failure of platelet recovery can occur after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and 20 of cases are related to acute graft versus host disease . The underlying mechanisms of this association are unclear however . The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential mechanisms of SFPR secondary to aGVHD which may provide a new therapeutic strategy for these patients . A total of 468 patients with malignant hematologic disease who underwent alloHSCT were included . Sixty six patients developed SFPR after alloHSCT and in 45 of these 66 patients SFPR was secondary to grade II IV aGVHD . Compared with patients with good graft function patients with SFPR had poor overall survival 20.72 versus 88.01

@highlight Patients with secondary failure of platelet recovery SFPR have poor overall survival and grade II IV acute graft versus host disease aGVHD is an independent risk factor for SFPR.
@highlight Donor derived megakaryopoiesis is suppressed in patients with SFPR aGVHD.
@highlight The immune microenvironment compromises the proliferation and differentiation potential of hematopoietic primitive cells contributing to SFPR secondary to aGVHD.
