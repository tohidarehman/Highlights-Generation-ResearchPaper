 Ribose is an important pharmaceutical intermediate that is used in the synthesis of numerous antiviral and anticancer drugs . However it is a non natural and expensive rare sugar . Recently the enzymatic synthesis of

@highlight  Arabinose isomerase and
@highlight  lyxose isomerase were co expressed in
@highlight BL21 DE3 .
@highlight The co expressed system exhibited optimal activity at 70C pH 6.0.
@highlight  Ribose was produced using recombinant
@highlight cells through a one pot process.
@highlight 20.9g L of
@highlight  ribose was produced from 100g L of
