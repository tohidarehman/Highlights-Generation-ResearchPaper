 In this study we presented a new approach for immobilizing JBU by producing urease cross linked enzyme lyophilisates . Through the use of bovine serum albumin lyophilisation cross linking with dextran polyaldehyde and optimizing cross linker pH the urease CLELs produced show an increase in relative catalytic activity that is 1.47 times higher than that of free urease while remaining stable up to temperatures of 85C . Urease CLEL activity increases in direct proportion with the increasing BSA content due to the offered additional lysine groups which are potential cross linking points providing better immobilization and retention of JBU while lyophilisation also enables stabilization by eliminating solvating water molecules and intra molecular reactions that may block the cross linking residues . Two most commonly used cross linkers that are reacting with the available Lys groups

@highlight Cross linked urease lyophilisates 1.47 times more reactive than free urease.
@highlight Bulkier cross linking agent in more alkaline buffer contribute to higher reactivity.
@highlight Co aggregant BSA increased concentration of surface lysine groups.
