 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative treatment for juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia but few large studies of HSCT for JMML exist . Using data from the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation registry we analyzed the outcomes of 129 children with JMML who underwent HSCT between 2000 and 2011 . The 5 year overall survival rate and cumulative incidence of relapse were 64 and 34 respectively . A regimen of busulfan fludarabine melphalan was the most commonly used and provided the best outcomes the 5 year OS rate reached 73 and the cumulative incidences of relapse and transplantation related mortality were 26 and 9 respectively . In contrast the use of the irradiation based myeloablative regimen was the most significant risk factor for OS 2.92

@highlight Hematopoietic cell transplantation is the only curative therapy for juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.
@highlight Busulfan fludarabine melphalan seems to offer the best chance of long term survival.
@highlight Chronic graft versus host disease correlates with improved survival by reducing relapse.
@highlight Treatment strategies enhancing graft versus leukemia effects may further improve outcome.
