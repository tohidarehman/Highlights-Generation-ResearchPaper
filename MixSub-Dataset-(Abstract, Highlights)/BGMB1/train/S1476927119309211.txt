 The resistances of matrix protein 2 protein inhibitors and neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza virus have attracted much attention and there is an urgent need for new drug . The antiviral drugs that selectively act on RNA polymerase are less prone to resistance and possess fewer side effects on the patient . Therefore there is increased interest in screening compounds that can inhibit influenza virus RNA polymerase . Three natural compounds were found by using molecular docking based virtual screening which could bind tightly within the polymerase acidic protein polymerase basic protein 1 subunit of influenza virus polymerase . Firstly their drug likeness properties were evaluated which showed that the hepatotoxicity values of all the three compounds indicating they had less or no hepatotoxicity and did not have the plasma protein biding ability the three compounds needed to be modified in some aspects like bulky molecular size . The stability of the complexes of PA hits was validated through molecular dynamics simulation revealing compound

@highlight Structure based virtual screening was performed to discover influenza virus polymerase inhibitors.
@highlight Three natural compounds were identified to potentially block the interaction of PA PB1 subunit of influenza virus polymerase.
@highlight The three compounds showed less or no hepatotoxicity nor plasma protein biding PPB ability.
@highlight The stability of the complexes of PA hits was validated through molecular dynamics MD simulation.
@highlight Four key residues of PA subunit participating in the interactions were revealed.
