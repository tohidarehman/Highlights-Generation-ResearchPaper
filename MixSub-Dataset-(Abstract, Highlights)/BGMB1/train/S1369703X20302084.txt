 D tagatose is a natural yet rare hexose that can be used as a functional sweetener owing to its hypoglycemic and anticaries properties . A four step enzymatic cascade reaction was performed to synthesize

@highlight  Glucan phosphorylase and phosphoglucomutase were co immobilized on Duolite A568.
@highlight A catalytic cascade system was constructed to synthesize glucose 6 phosphate.
@highlight The co immobilized GP PGM was prepared by an effective crosslinker PEGDGE.
@highlight The thermal stability of co immobilized GP PGM were significantly enhanced.
@highlight Co immobilization improved storage stability after storage at 4C for 60 days.
