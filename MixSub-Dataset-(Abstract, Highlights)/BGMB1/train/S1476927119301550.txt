 Elementary flux mode analysis is a well studied method in constraint based modeling of metabolic networks . In EFM analysis a network is decomposed into minimal functional pathways based on the assumption of balanced metabolic fluxes . In this paper a system architecture is proposed that approximately models the functionality of metabolic networks . The AND OR graph model is used to represent the metabolic network and each processing element in the system emulates the functionality of a metabolite . The system is implemented on a graphics processing unit as the hardware platform using CUDA environment . The proposed architecture takes advantage of the inherent parallelism in the network structure in terms of both pathway and metabolite traversal . The function of each element is defined such that it can find flux balanced pathways . Pathways in both small and large metabolic networks are applied to the proposed architecture and the results are discussed .
