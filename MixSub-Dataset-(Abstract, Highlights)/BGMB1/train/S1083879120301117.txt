 Acute kidney injury is nearly universally associated with worse outcomes especially among children after hematopoietic stem cell transplant . Our objective was to examine urinary immune biomarkers of AKI after HCT to provide insights into novel mechanisms of kidney injury in this population . Studying patients undergoing allogeneic HCT provides a unique opportunity to examine immune markers of AKI because the risk of AKI is high and the immune system newly develops after transplant . Children and young adults undergoing their first allogeneic HCT and enrolled in a prospective observational cohort study at 2 large children s hospitals had urine collected pre HCT and monthly for the first 4 months after HCT . Urine samples at each monthly time point were assayed for 8 immune related biomarkers . AKI was defined as a 1.5 fold increase in the monthly serum creatinine value which was recorded 1 day from when the research urine sample was obtained as compared with the pre HCT baseline . Generalized estimating equation regression analysis evaluated the association between the monthly repeated measures . A total of 176 patients were included from 2 pediatric centers . Thirty six patients from 1 center were analyzed as a discovery cohort and the remaining 140 patients from the second center were analyzed as a validation cohort . AKI rates were 18 to 35 depending on the monthly time point after HCT . Urine CXCL10 and CXCL9 concentrations were significantly higher among children who developed AKI compared with children who did not

@highlight Urine CXCL10 and CXCL9 are associated with acute kidney injury among children after hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
@highlight Cell line data demonstrate production of CXCL10 and CXCL9 in the kidney.
@highlight These promising biomarkers could guide management strategies for acute kidney injury in this high risk population.
