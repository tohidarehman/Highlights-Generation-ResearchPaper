 Methyl 2 furoate is a high value compound and can be produced via esterification of furoic acid derived from biobased furfural . Herein CAL B and PF

@highlight A novel model was developed to study enzymatic esterification kinetics.
@highlight The relationship between rate constants and various factors was presented.
@highlight Alcohol just inhibited hydrolysis activity rather than esterification activity.
@highlight Binary regression was suitable for the developed model to fit experimental data.
@highlight The activation energy of esterification and hydrolysis reactions was identical.
