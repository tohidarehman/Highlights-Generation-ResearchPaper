 Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase a kind of copper dependent oxidases has been widely used for the efficient enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass . In this study a gene encoding the LPMO from

@highlight A high yield of
@highlight C1LPMO was secreted using its native signal peptide.
@highlight C1LPMO with a purity of more than 95 and purification yield of 46 mg L was obtained.
@highlight The purified enzyme exhibited high stability towards at 4060 C.
@highlight C1LPMO had great potential in the degradation of microcrystalline cellulose.
@highlight Molecular docking simulations explored the interaction of
@highlight C1LPMO and cellohexaose.
