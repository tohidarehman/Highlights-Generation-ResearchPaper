 We assessed differences in presentation and response to therapy in 394 consecutive patients who developed acute or chronic graft versus host disease after receiving their first allogeneic transplantation from a 10 10 HLA allele matched unrelated donor using calcineurin inhibitors or a T cell replete haploidentical donor and post transplantation cyclophosphamide at our center between 2005 and 2017 . The median duration of follow up for survivors was 52.5 months

@highlight Haploidentical transplantation haplo with post transplantation cyclophosphamide PTCY is associated with a lower incidence of chronic graft versus host disease GVHD compared with matched unrelated donor MUD transplantation using calcineurin inhibitor based GVHD prophylaxis.
@highlight Haplo with PTCY has faster onset of chronic GVHD and better response to treatment compared with MUD with calcineurin inhibitors.
@highlight Chronic GVHD after haplo with PTCY has different organ distribution with less involvement of the eyes and joints fascia compared with MUD with calcineurin inhibitors.
