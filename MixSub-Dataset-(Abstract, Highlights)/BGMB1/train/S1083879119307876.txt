 Chronic graft versus host disease adversely affects patient quality of life functional status and survival after allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation . The Lee Symptom Scale is a 30 item scale developed to measure the symptoms of cGVHD . Although the original 30 item scale uses a 1 month recall period we tested the reliability and validity of a 28 item scale with a 7 day recall period a format that is more appropriate for use in clinical trials . Results show the modified 7 day scale is reliable and valid in the modern era and may be used to assess the symptom burden of cGVHD in clinical trials . Using the distribution method a 5 to 6 point difference is considered clinically meaningful .

@highlight The 28 item modified Lee chronic GVHD symptom scale mLSS is valid and reliable.
@highlight The scale takes 2 minutes to complete a 5 to 6 point difference is clinically meaningful.
