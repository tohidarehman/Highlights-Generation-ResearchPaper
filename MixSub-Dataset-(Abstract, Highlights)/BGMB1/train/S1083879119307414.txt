 The impact of allele level HLA mismatch on outcomes of cord blood transplantation has not been well established . We retrospectively analyzed the effects of HLA allele matching at HLA A B C and DRB1 in cord blood transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome . In multivariate analysis overall survival significantly deteriorated in the 4 allele or higher mismatch in pediatric cases and 2.85 for 3 1 8 match and the 5 allele or higher mismatch in adult cases . Incidence of grade to acute graft versus host disease was low in the 8 8 match and 1 allele mismatch in pediatric cases and the 8 8 match in adult cases . On the other hand a higher incidence of relapse was noted in the 8 8 match in adults . The incidence of neutrophil and platelet engraftment decreased in the 3 allele or higher mismatch in adults . In subgroup analysis of graft versus host disease prophylaxis in adult cases a deteriorating effect on OS of HLA 5 allele or higher mismatch was more significant in cases with calcineurin inhibitor with methotrexate than with mycophenolate mofetil . These results suggest that allele level HLA mismatch affects the outcomes of cord blood transplantation . Information on HLA allele matching at HLA A B C and DRB1 may be useful for cord blood unit selection .

@highlight HLA A B C and DRB1 allele mismatch effects were examined in 4050 cases of cord blood transplants.
@highlight Overall survival OS deteriorated in HLA 5 allele and higher mismatch in adult cord blood transplantation CBT .
@highlight OS deteriorated in HLA 4 allele and higher mismatch in pediatric CBT.
@highlight In adult cases 8 8 match mitigated severe acute graft versus host disease GVHD but increased the relapse rate.
@highlight In pediatric cases 8 8 match and 1 allele mismatch mitigated acute GVHD.
