 Seeds were a key evolutionary innovation . These durable structures provide a concerted solution to two challenges on land dispersal and stress . Lipid droplets that act as nutrient storage reservoirs are one of the main cell biological reasons for seed endurance . Although LDs are key structures in spermatophytes and are especially abundant in seeds they are found across plants and algae and increase during stress . Further the proteins that underpin their form and function often have deep homologs . We propose an evolutionary scenario in which the generation of LDs arose as a mechanism to mediate general drought and desiccation resilience and the required protein framework was co opted by spermatophytes for a seed specific program .

@highlight The generation of LDs is a mechanism that arose to mediate general drought and desiccation resilience.
@highlight We provide an evo devo perspective on the deep evolutionary roots of a key trait of seeds the genetic chassis for LD formation.
@highlight We ponder the question of how the evolution of these key components is tied to ancient circuits for stress responses.
@highlight A comparative perspective on the proteins that define LDs across the streptophyte tree of life allows definition of their core set and of the additions that emerged during the course of evolution.
