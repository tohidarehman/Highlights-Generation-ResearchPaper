 Microalgae biorefinery is an alternative sustainable and promising trend to solve the problem of fossil oil depletion and carbon dioxide emission . However considering the innate limitation of cell growth and oil content in microalgae to accelerate metabolic balance by CRISPR Cas9 system is attractive . At first plasmid based from
