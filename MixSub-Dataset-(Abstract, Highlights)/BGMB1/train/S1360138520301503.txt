 Gene expression in individual cells can be surprisingly noisy . In unicellular organisms this noise can be functional for example by allowing a subfraction of the population to prepare for environmental stress . The role of gene expression noise in multicellular organisms has however remained unclear . In this review we discuss how new techniques are revealing an unexpected level of variability in gene expression between and within genetically identical plants . We describe recent progress as well as speculate on the function of transcriptional noise as a mechanism for generating functional phenotypic diversity in plants .

@highlight Gene expression levels can be surprisingly noisy both between individual cells and between individual plants even in the absence of genetic and environmental variation.
@highlight is a promising system to study interindividual gene expression variability since it is an inbreeding species with extremely low heterozygosity.
@highlight Noise in gene expression in plants is widespread as revealed by studies that have begun to systematically quantify it at the between cell and between individual levels. This could be detrimental or by contrast used to drive developmental patterns or create phenotypic diversity without genetic diversity.
@highlight The sources and roles of gene expression noise in plants are still not well understood. New experimental techniques now allow the analysis of plant to plant and cell to cell gene expression noise in plants.
