 Keratinases are promising alternatives over ordinary proteases in several industrial applications due to their unique properties compared with their counterparts in the protease categories . However their large scale industrial application is limited by the low expression and poor fermentation efficiency of keratinase . Here we demonstrate that the expression level of keratinase can be improved by constructing a more efficient enzyme expression system hereby enables the highest production titer as regarding recombinant keratinase production to date . Specially ten promoters were evaluated and the aprE promoter exhibits a significant promotion of keratinase titer from 165 U mL to 2605 U mL in

@highlight A promoter screening system of keratinase expression was constructed.
@highlight Promoter engineering significantly improved the keratinase activity by 16 fold.
@highlight Scale up fermentation resulted in the highest keratinase activity of 16 860 U mL.
@highlight The keratinase showed potential in biodegradation of feather wastes.
