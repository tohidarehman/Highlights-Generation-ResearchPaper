 Peripheral blood stem cells have been increasingly used for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation instead of bone marrow stem cells . Current National Marrow Donor Program policy recommends 5 days of daily filgrastim followed by either 1 or 2 days of apheresis for unrelated donors depending on collection center choice . To date there are no published studies comparing the differences in donor experience between 1 day and 2 days of apheresis . We examined 22 348 adult unrelated donor collections in 184 centers between 2006 and 2016 . Of these 22 348 donors 20 004 had collection on 1 day and the other 2344 had collection over 2 days . Information on why donors underwent apheresis in 1 day or 2 days was not available . Donors who underwent apheresis in 1 day were more likely to be male 67 versus 46

@highlight Donors who undergo collection in 1 day have less apheresis related toxicity and fewer hospitalizations compared with donors with collection over 2 days.
@highlight In donors with collection over 2 days the apheresis yield of mononuclear cells was greater on the second day compared with the first day.
@highlight Although there are statistically significant differences in the incidence of modified toxicity criteria and skeletal pain during apheresis these differences might not be clinically significant.
