 Mesenchymal stem cells isolated from the Whartons jelly of human umbilical cords are of increasing interest for cell therapies but scalable cell production in stirred tank bioreactors still requires further investigations in order to be more efficient and with decreased costs . To handle the problem of cell confluence on microcarriers leading to cell aggregation a new strategy of microcarriers addition was proposed . The bead to bead transfer ability of WJ MSC was indeed used to maintain constant the number of cells per microcarriers . However the resulting increase of bead shocks frequency could also negatively impact cell quantity and quality . Until now no quantitative study describing the impact of bead interactions on WJ MSC death was reported . In this study the influence of microcarriers addition as well as mixing characteristics on cell viability were determined . Obtained results showed that when particle mixing is below the just suspended state condition

@highlight New strategy of controlled addition of microcarriers to improve WJ MSC expansion.
@highlight Cell quality was not impacted by bead to bead transfer ability of WJ MSC.
@highlight Orbital agitation led to a significant increase of cell death.
@highlight Mechanical agitation at Njs was more suitable for WJ MSC expansion.
