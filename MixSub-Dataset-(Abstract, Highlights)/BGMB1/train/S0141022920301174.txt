 Bacterial chitinases has a major role in chitinaceous waste management biological control of pests and phytopathogens . In the present study exochitinase gene

@highlight Chitinase gene showed 96 similarity and 94 of its catalytic domain with 598 amino acids was conserved with GH18 chitinases.
@highlight Revealing numerable substitutions with other Bacilli sp. chitinase gene of Bacillus pumilus was discovered as a novel gene.
@highlight Phenylalanine in the catalytic domain played a vital role in the catalytic process of chitin to mono and oligomers of NAG.
@highlight Hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions were exhibited by phenylalanine with chitin molecules.
