 Mesenchymal Stromal Cells are being targeted for diverse cell therapies applications . The MSC expansion in bioreactor is necessary to achieve the cell number required for clinical applications in accordance with cGMP guidelines . Since the culture conditions may influence the post expansion MSC outcomes in this work human Umbilical Cord Matrix derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells were evaluated during and after expansion using CultiSpher S microcarrier with different bioreactor hydrodynamics the single use Wave Induced Motion Bioreactor with a modified cellbag design proposed by our laboratory and the conventional spinner flask . WIMB cultures showed longer cell culture times and lower cell yields than spinner flask culture positioning the WIMB as a less suitable bioreactor than conventional stirred based systems for high yield MSC expansion bioprocess . Regarding cell biological functions hUCM MSCs harvested from the CultiSpher S WIMB and the CultiSpher S spinner kept determining major MSC molecular and biological characteristics according to immunophenotyping and multilineage differentiation assays . Moreover biological processes were not regulated differently when hUCM MSCs were cultivated in WIMB or spinner flask indicating that post expansion hUCM MSCs characteristics are similar in both bioreactor systems .

@highlight hUCM MSCs post expansion in WIMB and in spinner flask preserved major MSC identity markers.
@highlight hUCM MSCs obtained in both bioreactor systems have similar biological characteristics.
@highlight Conventional stirred based systems may be a more suitable option than WIMB for high yield MSC bioprocess.
