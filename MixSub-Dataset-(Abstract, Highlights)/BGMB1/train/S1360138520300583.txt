 Ubiquitously expressed in plants the plant specific insert of typical plant aspartic proteases has been associated with plant development stress response and defense processes against invading pathogens . Despite sharing high sequence identity structural studies revealed possible different mechanisms of action among species . The PSI induces signaling pathways of defense hormones

@highlight Plant specific inserts PSIs of typical plant aspartic proteases demonstrate different activities despite sharing conserved sequences and structures among plants.
@highlight At acidic pH electrostatic interactions between the PSI and negatively charged membrane lipids initiate PSImembrane interactions such as membrane fusion and disruption.
@highlight PSIs display broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against plant and human pathogens
@highlight and participate in plant defense
@highlight The mechanism of PSI excision during the activation of its parent proenzyme varies among plants.
@highlight PSI glycosylation appears to influence whether vesicle trafficking of proteins involved with plant development and defense is conducted through conventional or nonconventional endoplasmic reticulum to vacuole transport pathways.
