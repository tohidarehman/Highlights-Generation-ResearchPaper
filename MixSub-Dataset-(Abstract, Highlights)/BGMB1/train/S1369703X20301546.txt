 Much attention has been paid recently to developing greener and sustainable technologies in the herbal medicine industry which produces large amounts of waste . This work proposes a clean approach to isolating bioactive food fiber as polyphenolic polysaccharide conjugates by combining ultrafiltration with shortening the process time lowering the energy input improving the water management and reducing the organic solvent consumption while maintaining an acceptable yield and biological activity with higher selectivity for PPCs . A simple procedure using UF has high potential for industrial approaches . Leaves of wild strawberry
