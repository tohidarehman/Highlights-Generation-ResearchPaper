 1 3 xylanase plays an important role in the conversion of algal biomass into renewable chemical commodities and functional xylooligosaccharides . Efficient immobilization of the target enzymes that could integrate the separation purification and immobilization in one step may have great potentials . The cheap and easily obtained pitch was adopted as the raw material to prepare the hyper cross linked polymers with the specific surface areas of 560 m

@highlight The Ni
@highlight  loaded hyper cross linked polymers HCPs prepared by pitch used as carriers.
@highlight The HCPs with porous surface guaranteed the negligible leakage and high reuse rate.
@highlight The carrier integrated 1 3 xylanase separation purification and immobilization in one step.
