 Microbial self healing cement based materials have developed into a novel technology in recent years . It has the promising potential to improve self healing capacity of cracks by microbial induced calcium carbonate precipitation . In this paper low alkali sulpho aluminate cement was used as the carrier to protect spores from the high alkalinity environment inside the cement based materials . The protective effect of SC on spores was studied in the simulated pore solution of cement based materials and then area repair ratio recovery ratio of water permeability repair ratio of anti chloride ion penetration and healing depth were used to evaluate the self healing efficiency of cracks . Moreover the precipitates formed at the crack mouth of specimens were analyzed by XRD and SEM equipped with an EDS . The results showed that sulpho aluminate cement had an excellent protective effect for spores and the addition of microbial self healing agent would slightly affect the early mechanical properties of cement based materials but could improve them in later ages . In addition the cracks of microbial group with a width of 0.25 0.35mm were completely filled by CaCO

@highlight Microbial induced calcium carbonate precipitation MICP to repair cracks.
@highlight Spray dryer was used to transform microbial liquid spores into powdery spores.
@highlight The precipitates formed at the crack mouth of specimens were CaCO3.
@highlight Later age cracks of cement based materials could be well repaired by microorganisms.
@highlight The maximum average healing depth of later age cracks could reach 2895m.
