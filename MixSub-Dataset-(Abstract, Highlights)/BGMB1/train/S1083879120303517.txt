 Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for children with nonmalignant disorders is challenged by potential drug related toxicities and poor engraftment . This retrospective analysis expands on our single pediatric medical center experience with targeted busulfan fludarabine and intravenous alemtuzumab as a low toxicity regimen to achieve sustained donor engraftment . Sixty two patients received this regimen for their first HCT for a nonmalignant disorder between 2004 and 2018 . Donors were matched sibling in 27 8 8 HLA allele matched unrelated in 50 and 7 8 HLA allele mismatched in 23 . Five patients experienced graft failure for a cumulative incidence of 8.4 . In engrafted patients the median donor chimerism in whole blood and CD3 CD14 15 and CD19 subsets at 1 year were 96 90 99 and 99 respectively . Only one patient received donor lymphocyte infusions for poor chimerism . Two patients died following disease progression despite 100 donor chimerism . The 3 year cumulative incidence of treatment related mortality was 10 . Overall survival and event free survival at 3 years were 87 and 80 respectively . The 6 month cumulative incidence of grade II to IV acute graft versus host disease was 7 while the 3 year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 5 . These results suggest that use of targeted busulfan fludarabine and IV alemtuzumab offers a well tolerated option for children with nonmalignant disorders to achieve sustained engraftment with a low incidence of GVHD .

@highlight Pediatric patients with nonmalignant diseases need better conditioning options.
@highlight Targeted busulfan fludarabine and alemtuzumab is an optimal regimen.
@highlight Incidences of graft failure and transplant related mortality are low.
@highlight Acute and chronic graft versus host disease is very rare especially with bone marrow.
@highlight Chimerism is excellent without need for donor lymphocyte infusions.
