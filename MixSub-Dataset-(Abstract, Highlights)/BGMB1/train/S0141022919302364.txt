 Whole cell biocatalysts could be used in wide ranging applications . In this study a new kind of whole cell biocatalyst was successfully constructed by genetically immobilizing soybean seed coat peroxidase on the cell surface of

@highlight Soybean seed coat peroxidase was displayed on the cell surface of
@highlight to generate a whole cell biocatalyst.
@highlight The recombinant enzyme activity was greatly increased after a series of culture optimization.
@highlight This biocatalyst exhibited outstanding enzyme activity and stability without obvious negative effect to the host cells.
