 Post autologous stem cell transplantation maintenance therapy with lenalidomide is standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma . Effective and tolerable drug combinations may further enhance the clinical response post ASCT . Vorinostat a histone deacetylase inhibitor induces antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in patients with MM . We hypothesized that combination maintenance therapy would further prolong the clinical response achieved from transplantation . We previously reported that the combination of lenalidomide and vorinostat as maintenance post ASCT was tolerable in 16 patients with MM . We now present the long term follow up of these patients . Progression free survival and overall survival outcomes were characterized using the Kaplan Meier method . Five patients had high risk disease and the median number of lines of therapy before ASCT was 1 . With a median follow up of 89.8 months from ASCT the median PFS was 64.3 months and OS was not reached . At the time of this report 5 patients remained on the study . The combination of vorinostat and lenalidomide as maintenance post ASCT is tolerable and induces a durable response . A phase III randomized study of lenalidomide versus a combination with vorinostat is warranted .

@highlight The combination of vorinostat and lenalidomide as maintenance post transplantation is tolerable and induces durable response.
@highlight With a median follow up of 89.8 months from autologous stem cell transplantation the median progression free survival was 64.3 months range 21.7 months to not reached NR and overall survival was not reached range 53.0 months to NR .
@highlight The use of lenalidomide plus vorinostat could prove to be a promising maintenance strategy in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
