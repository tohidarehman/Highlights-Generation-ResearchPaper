 With special fragrance and various biological properties linalool has wide applications in food pharmaceuticals and cosmetics industries . Microbial biosynthesis has become a promising approach to linalool production however its efficiency is limited by the limited precursor supply and poor efficiency of linalool synthase . With the goal of enhancing heterologous linalool production in

@highlight Combining protein engineering and metabolic engineering to improve linalool production.
@highlight Enhanced precursor supply by overexpressing the whole MVA pathway and ERG20
@highlight Directed evolution of linalool synthase based on lycopene indicated screening method.
@highlight Highest linalool titer ever reported in
@highlight  53.14mg L .
