 Ecological niches are crucial for species coexistence and diversification but the niche concept has been underutilized in studying the roles of pollinators in plant evolution and reproduction . Pollination niches can be objectively characterized using pollinator traits abundance and distributions as well as network topology . We review evidence that floral traits represent adaptations to pollination niches where tradeoffs in trait deployment reinforce niche specialization . In turn specialized pollination niches potentially increase speciation rates foster species coexistence and constrain species range limits . By linking studies of adaptation with those on speciation and coexistence the pollination niche provides an organizing principle for research on plant reproduction and conceptually unites these studies with fields of biology where the niche perspective is already firmly established .

@highlight Pollination is a crucial niche component for plants. The niche concept can apply to both occupied and currently unoccupied niches.
@highlight Floral traits associated with pollination can be considered to be functional traits that can have similar or even better predictive capacity than functional traits in other areas of ecology.
@highlight Plantpollinator network methods provide opportunities for objective recognition of pollination niches and can form the basis for testing relationships between niches and both floral and pollinator functional traits.
@highlight The basis of specialization of pollination systems may be tradeoffs that favor adaptation to particular niches.
@highlight Evidence suggests that like abiotic niches pollination contributes to species coexistence within communities affects the geographic range of plants and explains the evolution of reproductive isolation as well as differences in diversification rates between lineages.
