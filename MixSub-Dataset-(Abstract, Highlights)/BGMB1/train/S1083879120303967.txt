 The use of cyclophosphamide for bidirectional tolerization of recipient and donor T cells is associated with reduced rates of graft versus host disease and nonrelapse mortality after HLA matched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . However recurrent disease remains the primary barrier to long term survival . We extended our 2 step approach to HLA matched related HSCT using a radiation based myeloablative conditioning regimen combined with a high dose of T cells in an attempt to reduce relapse rates while maintaining the beneficial effects of CY tolerization . After conditioning patients received their grafts in 2 components a fixed dose of 210

@highlight There was high tolerance of radiation based myeloablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide.
@highlight With the use of 3 GVHD prophylaxis agents relapse was a major barrier to survival.
@highlight Doses of T cells not exposed to cyclophosphamide were associated with less relapse.
