 Cell wall lytic enzymes as an important biotechnical tool in drug development agriculture and the food industry have attracted more research attention . In this research the accurate identification of cell wall lytic enzymes is one of the key and fundamental tasks . In this study in order to eliminate the inefficiency of in vitro experiments a support vector machine based cell wall lytic enzyme identification model was constructed using bioinformatics . This machine learning process includes feature extraction feature selection model training and optimization . According to the jackknife cross validation test this model obtained a sensitivity of 0.853 a specificity of 0.977 an MCC of 0.845 and an AUC of 0.915 . These benchmark results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state of the art method and that it has powerful cell wall lytic enzyme identification ability . Furthermore we comprehensively analyzed the selected optimal features and used the proposed model to construct a user friendly web server called the CWLy SVM to identify cell wall lytic enzymes which is available at
