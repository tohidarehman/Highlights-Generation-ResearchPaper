 Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is often diagnosed at a late stage when lung dysfunction is severe and irreversible . Identifying patients early after transplantation may offer improved strategies for early detection that could avert the morbidity and mortality of BOS . This study aimed to determine whether a decline in lung function before and early after allo HCT are associated with a risk of BOS beyond 6 months post transplantation . In a single center cohort of 2941 allo HCT recipients 186 met National Institutes of Health criteria for BOS . Pretransplantation and post transplantation day 80 spirometric parameters were analyzed as continuous variables and included in a multivariable model with other factors including donor source graft source conditioning regimen use of total body irradiation and immunoglobulin levels . Pre transplantation forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75 of maximum FEF
