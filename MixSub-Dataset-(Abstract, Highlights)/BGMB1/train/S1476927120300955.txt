 Proteins are the most essential macromolecules needed for the normal flow of life . Essential proteins play a key role to control other proteins in an interaction network for the growth and understanding of the molecular mechanism of cellular life . Though there are many computational algorithms for essential drug discovery depending on nature of essential proteins but still lots of improvements and optimizations are required . In this work modified Monkey algorithm is proposed for the identification of essential proteins in protein protein interaction network . Nature of a monkey can be distinctly described in three processes like climb watch jump and somersault in different problem spaces . These processes of monkey traversal are plotted in PPIN with objective to find out essential proteins . Performance of MMA is assessed with other existing essential protein prediction methodologies including Eigenvector Centrality Betweenness Centrality Network Centrality and others also . The proposed methodology has achieved higher success rates in comparison to the existing

@highlight We propose MMA that is a combined approach of climb watch jump and somersault sub processes to predict essential proteins of a PPIN.
@highlight ECV and ECC approaches are predicted for directed weighted and undirected network respectively in climb sub process.
@highlight CDS is introduced to obtain highly connected and reliable proteins. Select centralities using classifiers in watch jump sub process.
@highlight NC DC etc. are used to predict mostly connected set of proteins locally and EC predicts other essential proteins throughout the network.
@highlight 3 sigma threshold based essential protein seeds are selected out of given PPIN throughout MMA.
@highlight Unbiased centralities are nominated depending on classifier based benchmark approach in watch jump sub process.
@highlight The proposed methodology has achieved higher success rates in comparison to the existing methods.
