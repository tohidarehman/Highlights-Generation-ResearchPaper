 One of the factors limiting the economic viability of polyhydroxyalkanoates is the low volumetric productivity obtained with second generation feedstocks resulting from their low carbon concentration . In the present study the use of membrane bioreactors was evaluated as a strategy to retain the microbial cells in the reactor and to enable a repeated supply of substrate without increasing the reactor volume . Two immersed MBR systems were studied classical pressure driven MBRs and a novel diffusion based MBR . In the latter the rate of volatile fatty acid diffusion across the membranes was lower than the VFA consumption rate of the culture and thus not suitable to attain high productivities . Possible research directions to increase substrate diffusion are suggested . On the other hand pressure driven configurations led to high values of productivity during a fed batch PHA accumulation using mixed microbial consortia . No flux reduction was observed in a 24h fed batch process which allowed for a reduction of up to 82 of the reactor volume demonstrating the potential of this strategy . Hollow fibers and ceramic filters offered similar results during the fed batch but they presented different limitations and advantages .

@highlight High PHA productivity 0.871.44g L.h was reached with membrane bioreactors MBRs .
@highlight Hollow fibers and ceramic filters showed a stable flow during a 24h fed batch.
@highlight The use of MBRs significantly reduced the working volume up to 82 .
@highlight Ceramic filters presented lower fouling but higher footprint than hollow fibers.
@highlight VFA diffusion was not enough to satisfy the culture needs in a diffusion based MBR.
