 Our previous study reported a novel protein ion exchanger N N dimethylaminopropyl acrylamide grafted Sepharose FF of very high protein adsorption capacity and uptake rate . To gain new insight into the polymer grafting effects on protein adsorption and chromatography 18 DMAPAA grafted anion exchangers of four grafting densities and various chain lengths were prepared and named as FF Br

@highlight Polymer grafted anion exchangers of 4 chain densities were fabricated.
@highlight Adsorption capacity reached over 370mg mL at an ionic capacity of 587mmol L.
@highlight The resin with an ionic capacity of 592mmol L showed maximum protein uptake rate.
@highlight Dynamic capacity of the two resins kept over 150mg mL at flow rate up to 1350cm h.
