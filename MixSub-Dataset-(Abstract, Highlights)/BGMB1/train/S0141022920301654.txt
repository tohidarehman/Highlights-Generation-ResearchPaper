 Fungal 1 3 D glucanases were usually applied in brewing and feedstuff industries however the thermostability limits the most their application . The characterized 1 3 D glucanase from Chinese Nong flavor Daqu showed the highest thermostability among GH16 fungal 1 3 D glucanases with half lives of thermal inactivation t

@highlight NFEg16A exhibited the highest thermostability among the fungal 1 3 4 D glucanases in GH16 family.
@highlight N173Y and S187A were identified as the most thermotolerant and thermolabile mutants of NFEg16A by multiple rational designs respectively.
@highlight Each of S187A D144N and T164N was independently detrimental to the thermostability while their combinatorial mutants S187A D144N and S187A T164N showed beneficial effect on the thermostability.
@highlight S187A T164N was the most thermostable mutant and showed higher thermostability than wild type of NFEg16A.
