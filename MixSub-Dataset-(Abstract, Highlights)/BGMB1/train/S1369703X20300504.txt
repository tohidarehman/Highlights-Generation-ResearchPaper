 This work investigated the operational and fouling characteristics of the combined oxidation ditch membrane bioreactor under a continuous flow mode . During the operating period foulants gradually accumulated on the membrane surface and caused increasing in the filtration resistance whose appearance showed obvious heterogeneity along with the variation of some influencing factors . Correlation analysis of all variable factors revealed the key factor that contributed to the difference in membrane fouling . Results indicated that the foulants with loose structure caused the largest ratio in membrane resistance among all the foulants on surface and they could be easily cleaned by a physical method . After totally physical and chemical cleaning some residues still remained in the membrane module which determined the lifespan of membrane modules . From the different operational stages the foulants were sampled and characterized with multi method to reveal their physic chemical composition and microbial community though these properties and communities were very close to each other the unique microbial species contained in the foulants might be an important factor leading to their different properties and actually determined their heterogeneity which were also heavily affected by the temperature change .
