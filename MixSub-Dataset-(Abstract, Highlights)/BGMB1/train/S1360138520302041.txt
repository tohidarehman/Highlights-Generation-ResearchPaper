 Salt stress is one of the major environmental stresses limiting plant growth and productivity . To adapt to salt stress plants have developed various strategies to integrate exogenous salinity stress signals with endogenous developmental cues to optimize the balance of growth and stress responses . Accumulating evidence indicates that phytohormones besides controlling plant growth and development under normal conditions also mediate various environmental stresses including salt stress and thus regulate plant growth adaptation . In this review we mainly discuss and summarize how plant hormones mediate salinity signals to regulate plant growth adaptation . We also highlight how in response to salt stress plants build a defense system by orchestrating the synthesis signaling and metabolism of various hormones via multiple crosstalks .

@highlight Both stress hormones and growth hormones are important in the mediation of plant salinity stress responses.
@highlight Sophisticated crosstalk occurs among the different hormones in plant growth adaptation under salinity stress.
@highlight The cooperation or antagonism among different plant hormones is dependent on growth stages.
@highlight Plants adapt to salinity stress through flexible regulation of hormone levels and or signaling.
