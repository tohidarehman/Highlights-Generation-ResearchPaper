 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the sole potential cure for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria however the data on its utility in PNH are limited . This retrospective analysis of patients with PNH who underwent allo HSCT in 11 Polish centers between 2002 and 2016 comprised 78 patients with PHN including 27 with classic PNH and 51 with bone marrow failure associated PNH . The cohort was 59 male with a median age of 29 years . There was a history of thrombosis in 12 and a history of hemolysis in 81 and 92 required erythrocyte transfusions before undergoing allo HSCT . No patient received eculizumab and 26 received immunosuppressive treatment . The median time from diagnosis to allo HSCT was 12 months . Almost all patients received reduced toxicity conditioning 66 with treosulfan . The stem cell source was peripheral blood in 72 and an identical sibling donor in 24 . Engraftment occurred in 96 of the patients . With a median follow up of 5.1 years in patients with cPNH and 3.2 years in patients with BMF PNH 3 year overall survival was 88.9 in the former and 85.1 in the latter

@highlight The 3 year overall survival probability was 88.9 in patients with classic paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria cPNH and 85.1 in those with bone marrow failure associated PNH BMF PNH .
@highlight The PNH clone was reduced to 1 in 96 of patients with cPNH and in 95 of patients with BMF PNH.
@highlight The incidence of acute graft versus host disease GVHD grade II IV was 23 and that of extensive chronic GVHD at 1 year was 9 .
@highlight Reduced toxicity conditioning with treosulfan was safe and effective.
