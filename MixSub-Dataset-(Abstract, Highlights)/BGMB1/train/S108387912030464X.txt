 Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the key strategy to cure patients with mature T and natural killer cell lymphomas leukemia especially those with relapsed refractory diseases there is no consensus strategy for donor selection . We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of allo HSCT in 111 patients in 15 Japanese institutions as a multi institutional joint research project . Thirty nine patients received bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from related donors 37 received BMT PBSCT from unrelated donors and 35 received cord blood transplantation . Overall survival and progression free survival at 4 years were 42 and 34 respectively . The cumulative incidences of relapse and nonrelapse mortality were 43 and 25 . In multivariate analysis CBT showed comparable OS with rBMT rPBSCT 1.63

@highlight Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is beneficial for patients with mature T cell and natural killer cell neoplasms.
@highlight Cord blood transplantation CBT resulted in favorable outcomes with a lower risk of relapse.
@highlight CBT could be a preferred option especially for patients with uncontrolled diseases.
@highlight Better control of lymphoma at transplantation is a key to improved outcomes.
