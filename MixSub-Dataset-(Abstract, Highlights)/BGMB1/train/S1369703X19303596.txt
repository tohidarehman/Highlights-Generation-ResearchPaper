 An optimization workflow is introduced which integrates multi objective optimization of lignocellulolytic enzyme cocktail ingredients with a bioethanol production process where the enzymes are utilized . The workflow integrates data collection via exploratory experiments modeling via Kriging Pareto based multi objective optimization and process simulation . The critical links in the integration are calculation of enzyme cocktail performance and cost . This allows the identification of the best Pareto optimal result depending on process simulation results . The workflow is demonstrated on a case study involving the production of lignocellulolytic enzymes laccase glucosidase and carboxymethyl cellulase by a white rot fungus
