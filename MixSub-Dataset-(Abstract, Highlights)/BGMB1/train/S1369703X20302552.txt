 Continuing efforts have been made to produce functional exopolysaccharides using cheap substrates for valuable applications . Cheese whey is a lactose rich byproduct of cheese producing industries . In this research a one step bioprocess for the bioconversion of cheese whey to a hetero exopolysaccharide using a ropy EPS producing strain

@highlight JNULCC001 can bioconvert cheese whey into value added EPS.
@highlight The produced EPS shows a record biosorption ability toward MB.
@highlight EPS 001 plays important roles in thickening and gelling.
@highlight EPS 001 can serve as a stabilizer in the biosynthesis of SeNPs.
