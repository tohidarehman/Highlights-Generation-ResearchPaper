 A novel bioflocculant alginate protamine complex was developed and was proposed in this study . Alginate and protamine have no flocculating ability solely however the mixture solution of alginate and protamine or alginate protamine complex showed a good flocculating ability . This study reported a flocculating performance of the alginate protamine complex . The flocculation performance was evaluated by clarification experiment with kaolin and pulverized quartz sand in terms of relative absorbance . The flocculation performance was examined by varying experimental conditions especially alginate protamine mass mixing ratio and pH . The flocculation performance was significantly affected by the mass mixing ratio and pH . The most effective mass mixing ratio was found at 0.40.8 in the pH range of 37 . The flocculation performance was also affected significantly by pH . Good flocculation performance was provided at pH 37 however the performance was getting worse at pH 811 .

@highlight Flocculation ability appeared by forming associated complex of alginate and protamine.
@highlight Most effective mass mixing ratio was found at 0.40.8 in the present system.
@highlight Flocculation efficiency by the complex is effective in acidic and neutral pH range.
