 Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation has been increasingly offered to older adults with hematologic malignancies . However optimal methods to determine fitness for alloHCT have yet to be defined . We evaluated the ability of a comprehensive geriatric assessment to predict post alloHCT outcomes in a single center prospective cohort study of patients age 50 years and older . Outcomes included overall survival progression free survival and nonrelapse mortality . A total of 148 patients were included with a median age of 62 years . In multivariate regression analysis several CGA measures of functional status were predictive of post alloHCT outcomes after adjusting for traditional prognostic factors . Any deficit in instrumental activities of daily living was associated with inferior OS 1.81 95 confidence interval 1.07 to 3.08

@highlight Functional status predicts post allogeneic transplantation survival in older patients.
@highlight Physical function predicts both post allogeneic transplantation survival and toxicity.
@highlight These associations were independent of age and comorbidities.
