 Chronic hepatitis E virus infection in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients is an emerging threat . The aim of this study was to provide data on the HEV burden in an Italian cohort of HSCT recipients and analyze risk factors for HEV seropositivity . This retrospective study reports data from 596 HSCT recipients compiled between 2010 and 2019 . It included patients who underwent transplantation between 2010 and 2015 for whom pretransplantation and post transplantation serum samples were available and tested retrospectively as well as patients in whom prospective HEV testing was performed during the standard care pre HSCT IgG screening in 144 pre HSCT HEV RNA screening in addition to IgG screening in 60 and HEV RNA testing in case of clinical suspicion of HEV infection in 59 . The rate of pre HSCT HEV IgG positivity was 6.0 . Older age was an independent risk factor for seropositivity

@highlight Chronic hepatitis E virus HEV infection in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCT recipients is an emerging problem of unknown extent.
@highlight HEV IgG positivity of 6 was found in our cohort in pre HSCT screening and the incidence increased with recipient age.
@highlight Two patients were diagnosed with chronic HEV hepatitis with HEV RNA performed after an increase in alanine aminotransferase ALT was detected and both were HEV IgG negative.
@highlight The rate of HEV infection in HSCT recipients in Italy is low and the benefit of screening pre HSCT seems absent.
@highlight HEV RNA testing is mandatory in the event of an ALT increase.
