 CD19 targeted chimeric antigen receptor modified T cell immunotherapy is a novel treatment with promising results in patients with relapsed refractory lymphoid malignancies . CAR T cell therapy has known early toxicities of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity but little is known about long term neuropsychiatric adverse effects . We have used patient reported outcomes including Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measures to assess neuropsychiatric and other patient reported outcomes of 40 patients with relapse refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia non Hodgkin lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia 1 to 5 years after treatment with CD19 targeted CAR T cells . Mean T scores of PROMIS domains of global mental health global physical health social function anxiety depression fatigue pain and sleep disturbance were not clinically meaningfully different from the mean in the general US population . However 19 patients reported at least 1 cognitive difficulty and or clinically meaningful depression and or anxiety and 7 patients scored 40 in global mental health indicating at least 1 standard deviation worse than the general population mean . Younger age was associated with worse long term global mental health

@highlight Overall long term survivors after chimeric antigen receptor CAR T cell therapy report good mental health.
@highlight A subset of patients may experience psychiatric symptoms or cognitive impairment.
@highlight Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation before or after CAR T cells does not affect long term mental health.
@highlight Older age is associated with better mental health in long term CAR T cell survivors.
@highlight Cognitive difficulties are associated with worse global mental and physical health.
