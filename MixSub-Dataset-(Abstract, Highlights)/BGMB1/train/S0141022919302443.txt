 Biomass from oil palm frond leaves is an excellent reservoir of lignocellulosic material which full potential remains untapped . This study aimed to statistically optimize the covalent immobilization of

@highlight NC and MMT was used as reinforcing filler in the natural polymer ALG.
@highlight The developed CRL ALG NC MMT gave maximum protein loading of 5.80mg g.
@highlight Optimal immobilization conditions 7h 35 pH 5.0 7mg mL CRL gave 92.89 of EL.
@highlight CRL ALG NC MMT was thermally more stable than free CRL and reusable up to 9 times.
