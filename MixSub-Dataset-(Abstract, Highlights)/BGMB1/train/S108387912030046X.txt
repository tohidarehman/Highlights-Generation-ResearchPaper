 The present study was conducted to investigate cellular and molecular features of chronic graft versus host disease fibroblasts and to assess the effectiveness of nilotinib as a fibrosis modulator . Growth kinetics phenotype and differentiation of cultured skin biopsy derived GVHD Fbs were compared with normal fibroblasts from both a dermal cell line and healthy individuals undergoing cosmetic surgery . Collagen genes and p SMAD2 expression were assessed by real time PCR and immunofluorescence . The in vivo effects of nilotinib on chronic GVHD affected skin were investigated by immunohistochemistry the relationship to TGF plasma levels was assessed . Although the morphology phenotype and differentiation of cultured GVHD Fbs were comparable to normal fibroblasts growth was slower and senescence was reached earlier . The expression of COL11 and COL12 mRNAs was respectively 4 and 1.6 times higher in cGVHD Fbs

@highlight Chronic graft versus host disease cGVHD fibroblasts grow slower and become senescent earlier than normal fibroblasts.
@highlight Collagen mRNA expression and TGF levels are elevated in patients with cGVHD.
@highlight Nilotinib reduces TGF levels and collagen production by cGVHD fibroblasts.
@highlight Nilotinib induced TGF inhibition is associated with an intracellular p Smad2 decrease.
@highlight TGF pathway inhibition is a basic antifibrotic mechanism of nilotinib in vivo.
