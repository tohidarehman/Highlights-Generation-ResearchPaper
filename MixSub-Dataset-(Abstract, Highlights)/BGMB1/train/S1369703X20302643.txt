 It is expected that a high cell volumetric concentration of human mesenchymal stromal cells for cell therapy can be achieved by using scalable cell culture platforms as bioreactors . In this paper the Taylor vortex flow bioreactor was evaluated for hMSCs expansion due to its potential to produce low and homogeneous hydrodynamic forces which is important for the expansion of these cells . Thus parameters such as volumetric coefficient of oxygen transfer and shear stress were estimated for the TVFB . Additionally hMSCs cell expansion on microcarriers was evaluated in TVFB and compared with the traditional spinner flasks . Maximum shear stress and k

@highlight Taylor vortex flow bioreactor TVFB supports scalable manufacturing of human mesenchymal stromal cells MSC on microcarriers.
@highlight Cells post expansion preserved the MSC identity.
@highlight Cell microcarrier aggregates formed in the TVFB were smaller than obtained in Spinner flask.
