 Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not generate sufficient insulin or the body can not effectively utilize the produced insulin . If it remains unidentified and untreated then it could be very deadliest . One can lead a healthy life with proper treatment if the presence of diabetes can be detected at an early stage . When the conventional process of detecting diabetes is tedious there is a need of an automated system for identifying diabetes from the clinical and physical data . In this study we developed a novel diabetes classifying model based on Convolutional Long Short term Memory that was not applied yet in this regard . We applied another three popular models such as Convolutional Neural Network Traditional LSTM and CNN LSTM and compared the performance with our developed model over the Pima Indians Diabetes Database . Significant features were extracted from the dataset using Boruta algorithm that returned glucose BMI insulin blood pressure and age as important features for classifying diabetes patients more accurately . We performed hyperparameter optimization using Grid Search algorithm in order to find the optimal parameters for the applied models . Initial experiment by splitting the dataset into separate training and testing sets the Conv LSTM based model classified the diabetes patients with the highest accuracy of 91.38 . In later using cross validation technique the Conv LSTM model achieved the highest accuracy of 97.26 and outperformed the other three models along with the state of the art models .
