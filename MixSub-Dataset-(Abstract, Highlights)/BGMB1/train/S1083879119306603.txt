 Mixed chimerism and or secondary graft failure with recipient or donor type chimerism is a major obstacle in allogeneic transplantation for aplastic anemia . From a registry database in Japan patients with AA age 15 years who underwent a first allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation between 2000 and 2014 and achieved engraftment were included in this study . MC that did not require either granulocyte colony stimulating factor or transfusion support MC that required G CSF and or transfusion support SGF with MC or complete recipient type chimerism and SGF with complete donor type chimerism developed in 26 16 19 and 17 patients respectively . The overall median duration of follow up for survivors was 1727 days . The overall survival was 90.4 at 1 year and 83.5 at 5 years in patients without MC or SGF which was not different from the OS in groups 1 and 2 . However inferior OS was observed in group 3 and group 4 . In multivariate analyses the use of fludarabine and the absence of irradiation in conditioning were associated with the development of SGF with MC or complete recipient type chimerism and the use of Flu in conditioning was associated with SGF with complete donor type chimerism . In conclusion the use of Flu may affect the occurrence of SGF with both recipient type and donor type chimerism .

@highlight The influence of mixed chimerism MC and or secondary graft failure SGF in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for aplastic anemia was retrospectively evaluated.
@highlight SGF with both MC recipient and donor type chimerism was observed.
@highlight Patients who developed SGF with both types of chimerism had unfavorable outcomes.
@highlight The use of fludarabine may affect the occurrence of SGF with both types of chimerism.
