 Establishing laws of plant and ecosystems functioning has been an overarching objective of functional and evolutionary ecology . However most theories neglect the role of human activities in creating novel ecosystems characterized by species assemblages and environmental factors that are not observed in natural systems . We argue that agricultural weeds as an emblematic case of such an ecological novelty constitute an original and underutilized model for challenging current concepts in ecology and evolution . We highlight key aspects of weed ecology and evolutionary biology that can help to test and recast ecological and evolutionary laws in a changing world . We invite ecologists to seize upon weeds as a model system to improve our understanding of the short term and long term dynamics of ecological systems in the Anthropocene .

@highlight Agricultural weeds constitute an original model to understand the impact of anthropogenic changes on ecological and evolutionary dynamics.
@highlight A combination of environmental factors in cultivated fields has driven the selection of novel functional trait combinations in agricultural weeds. Therefore agricultural weeds can be considered as rule breakers of ecological and evolutionary laws.
@highlight Weeds in cropped fields are particularly valuable for assessing the consequences of out of equilibrium and transient dynamics on community assembly.
@highlight Weed herbicide resistance and crop mimicry syndromes represent some of the best documented examples of rapid evolution in plants and provide a promising context for the study of eco evolutionary feedbacks.
