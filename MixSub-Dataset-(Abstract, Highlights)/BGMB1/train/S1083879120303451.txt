 Bloodstream infections from oral organisms are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients . There are no proven strategies to decrease BSIs from oral organisms . The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of daily xylitol wipes in improving oral health decreasing BSI from oral organisms and modulating the oral microbiome in pediatric HSCT recipients . This was a single center 1 1 randomized controlled trial in pediatric HSCT recipients age 2 years . Age matched healthy children were enrolled to compare the oral microbiome . The oral hygiene standard of care group continued to receive the standard oral hygiene regimen . The xylitol group received daily oral xylitol wipes in addition to the SOC . The intervention started from the beginning of the transplantation chemotherapy regimen and extended to 28 days following transplantation . The primary outcome was oral health at interval time points and secondary outcomes included BSIs from oral organisms in the first 30 days following transplantation oral microbiome abundance and diversity and oral pathogenic organism abundance . The study was closed early due to efficacy after an interim analysis of the first 30 HSCT recipients was performed . The xylitol group had a significantly lower rate of gingivitis at days 7 14 and 28 following transplantation

@highlight Bloodstream infections BSIs from oral organisms are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCT recipients.
@highlight The addition of xylitol to standard oral care significantly improves gingivitis and dental plaque in HSCT recipients.
@highlight The addition of xylitol to standard oral care may be associated with decreased BSIs from oral organisms after HSCT.
