 Poly a widely used plastic around the world causes various environmental and health problems . Several groups have been extensively conducting research to solve these problems through enzymatic degradation of PET at high temperatures around 70C . Recently

@highlight To optimize the substrate binding site of
@highlight PETase we compared the residues constituting the substrate binding site with those from other PETase candidates.
@highlight PETase
@highlight and
@highlight PETase
@highlight variants showed increased PET degradation activity.
@highlight We introduced S242T and N246D to the
@highlight PETase
@highlight variant developed in the previous paper and generated the
@highlight PETase
@highlight variant with PET degradation activity increased by 58 fold compared to
@highlight PETase
