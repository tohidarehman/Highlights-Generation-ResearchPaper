 In optogenetics light sensitive proteins are specifically expressed in target cells and light is used to precisely control the activity of these proteins at high spatiotemporal resolution . Optogenetics initially used naturally occurring photoreceptors to control neural circuits but has expanded to include carefully designed and engineered photoreceptors . Several optogenetic constructs are based on plant photoreceptors but their application to plant systems has been limited . Here we present perspectives on the development of plant optogenetics considering different levels of design complexity . We discuss how general principles of light driven signal transduction can be coupled with approaches for engineering protein folding to develop novel optogenetic tools . Finally we explore how the use of computation networks circular permutation and directed evolution could enrich optogenetics .

@highlight Optogenetics uses light to stimulate cells that have been genetically modified to express light sensitive proteins.
@highlight Despite their potential several experimental and computational approaches in optogenetics remain underutilized.
@highlight Although most optogenetic systems were developed from plant photoreceptors optogenetics has rarely been applied to plants.
