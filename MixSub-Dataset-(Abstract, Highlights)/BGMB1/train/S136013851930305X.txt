 The study of transcriptional regulation of tomato ripening has been led by spontaneous mutations in transcription factor genes that completely inhibit normal ripening suggesting that they are master regulators . Studies using CRISPR Cas9 mutagenesis to produce knockouts of the underlying genes indicate a different picture suggesting that the regulation is more robust than previously thought . This requires us to revisit our model of the regulation of ripening and replace it with one involving a network of partially redundant components . At the same time the fast rise of CRISPR Cas mutagenesis resulting in unexpectedly weak phenotypes compared with knockdown technology suggests that compensatory mechanisms may obscure protein functions . This emphasises the need for assessment of these mechanisms in plants and for the careful design of mutagenesis experiments .

@highlight A string of recent publications has put into question the function of TFs which were previously considered master regulators in the control of tomato fruit ripening.
@highlight RNA interference and CRISPR Cas9 mutagenesis have enabled a re evaluation of their proposed functions which were previously thought to be mostly derived from the phenotype of spontaneous ripening mutations.
@highlight Three spontaneous mutations in TF genes all appear to be gain of function mutations and interestingly probably represent three different mechanisms of this phenomenon.
@highlight These observations raise interesting fundamental and practical questions related to the manipulation of fruit ripening and other processes.
@highlight Although CRISPR Cas9 mutagenesis has dramatically improved our options for addressing gene function recent results suggest that compensatory mechanisms in CRISPR mutants also hide true gene functions.
