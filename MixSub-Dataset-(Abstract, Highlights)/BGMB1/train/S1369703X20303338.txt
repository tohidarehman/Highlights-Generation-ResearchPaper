 Microbial fuel cells are innovative bioelectrochemical approaches for natural conversion of waste resources into energy based on the metabolic activities of inoculated bacteria which served as biocatalysts . From all the MFC components the anode electrode plays a vital role in energy generation and pollutant removal . Thus it is in direct contact with bacteria and is responsible for the rate of electron transfer from the electroactive bacteria to the anodes surface . Currently the material and cost of the anode electrode are emerging challenges in MFC research . This review summarizes some potential natural materials and modification strategies for the construction of anode electrodes to decrease the cost and enhance the performance of MFCs .
