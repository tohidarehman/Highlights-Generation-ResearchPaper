 The nickel nanoparticles are harmful atmospheric pollutants and the damage caused by them in humans has become a topic of great relevance . In this study we investigate the interaction of the Ni

@highlight Nickel nanoparticles Ni
@highlight and Ni
@highlight  are harmful atmospheric pollutants which damage humans.
@highlight Quantum molecular simulations for the molecular system under realistic thermodynamic conditions NVT are performed.
@highlight The results show the formation of stable organometallic compounds of the Ni nanoparticles with the DNA nucleic acid bases.
@highlight The organometallic compounds may be a factor in the development of diseases for the people exposed to the Ni nanoparticles.
