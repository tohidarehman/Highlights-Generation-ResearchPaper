 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains an important treatment modality for patients with acute myeloid leukemia . Recent advances have extended donor availability for patients without matched donors . Transplantation is now increasingly offered to older patients including those above 70 years and less fit individuals . Better prognostic models are being developed . Proceeding faster to transplantation with haploidentical donors if an urgent transplant is needed such as in patients with detectable minimal residual disease may allow more patients to get to transplant and it is hoped more will be cured from their disease . With continuous improvements in treatment related toxicity and mortality relapse has become the most important cause of treatment failure and novel approaches are needed to make the next big leap in the treatment of this disease with transplantation . In this review we aim to summarize recent advances and provide future research directions in the transplantation for patients with AML .

@highlight Reduced intensity conditioning increased the use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation allo HSCT to older patients with acute myeloid leukemia AML and those with comorbid conditions.
@highlight Haploidentical donors expanded the availability of allo HSCT for patients with AML.
@highlight Improved graft versus host disease prophylaxis with post transplantation cyclophosphamide may further reduce nonrelapse mortality for patients with HLA matched donors.
@highlight Relapse post transplant is the main cause of treatment failure ongoing research will clarify if it can be decreased especially for high risk AML.
@highlight Integrated comprehensive and more precise prognostic tools can better assess risk prediction for patients with AML.
