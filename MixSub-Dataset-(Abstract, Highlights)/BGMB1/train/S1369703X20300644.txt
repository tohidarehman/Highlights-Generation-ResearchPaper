 Flue gas desulphurization wastewater from coal fired power plant contained sulfate halogens metals metalloids and organics which led to serious corrosion and environment pollution . For establishing intensive treatment of FGD wastewater a mixed bacterial sulfate reducing consortium was obtained from strain BY7 and SR10 sulfate reducing bacteria . Intensively removal of SO

@highlight FGD wastewater was treated by mixed bacterial sulfate reducing consortium MBSRC .
@highlight MBSRC conduct intensive removal of SO
@highlight  metals metalloids organics and halogens.
@highlight MBSRC enhanced refractory organics degradation in FGD wastewater.
@highlight Biosorption of chloride and fluoride were promoted by higher cell density.
