 Structural optimization molecular docking analysis electronic and vibrational properties have been investigated for the 1 benzofuran 2 carboxylic acid and 1 benzofuran 3 carboxylic acid using DFT B3LYP 6 311 G level of theory . The theoretical parameters have a very good consistency with the experimental ones . The weak intermolecular interactions were analyzed by different tool such as Hirshfeld surfaces topological analysis and natural bond orbital studies . The nonlinear optical properties have been investigated . Molecular electrostatic potential and frontier molecular orbitals analysis have been carried out to understand the reactivity of the molecule . In addition TD DFT calculation is initiated to simulate the UVvis absorption spectrum and to determine several important electronic properties like HOMO LUMO gap energy and electronic transitions . The complete vibrational assignments and the force constants were reported for monomer and dimers of both acids . The biological activities of the tow acids have been studied via molecular docking analysis . The later calculations prove that the studied acids have an inhibitor effect against cancer and microbial diseases .
