 Currently Alzheimer s disease is a devastating neurological disorder that mainly affects the elderly . The treatment of AD has as main objective to increase the levels of ACh in the synaptic cleft by inhibiting the cholinesterase enzymes which are responsible for the degradation of ACh . Twenty one synthesized coumarins and neoflavanones and theoretical studies were used to select the most promising ligands for

@highlight Synthesized coumarins and neoflavanones derivatives as potential inhibitors of Acetylcholinesterase.
@highlight The coumarin 
@highlight presented a good inhibition of
@highlight AChE.
@highlight The coumarin 
@highlight  showed good results for oral bioavailability and permeability according to the rule of five by Lipinski.
@highlight MD simulations enhanced our understanding about of the interaction of AChE with coumarins and neoflavanones derivatives.
