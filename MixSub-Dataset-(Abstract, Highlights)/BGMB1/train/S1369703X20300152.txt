 Due to the availability of natural gas shale gas and flared gas there is increased interest in converting methane in these gases into commodity chemicals via cost effective and sustainable processes . Recently we have demonstrated an efficient process concept converting methane to lactic acid by methanotrophic bacteria with high carbon flux pivoting potentials for commercialization . Herein we present a first of kind conceptual design and a techno economic analysis of a biorefinery process with calculated minimum selling prices . This study includes both sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis for key cost drivers and for projecting path forwards in research and development . The analyses reveal that the conversion efficiency LA product titer LA productivity and gas flow rate have the most significant impacts on cost . The MSP varies from 5.83 2.17 kg LA depending on these key process attributes . Further a life cycle assessment of this process concept is evaluated and compared to understand the sustainable aspects . In this TEA study the bio upgrading process from natural gas to LA presents a potentially promising approach in terms of the feedstock versatility economic viability and environmental impact .

@highlight Four different scenarios of BioGTLA were analyzed in the n
@highlight  plant.
@highlight Productivity titer and CCE are identified as the key cost drivers for MSP.
@highlight A promising MSP of 2.17 kg can be realized in a long term scenario.
@highlight A preliminary LCA was performed to show environmental considerations.
