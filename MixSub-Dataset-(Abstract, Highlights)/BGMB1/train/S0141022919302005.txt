 Linalool a valuable monoterpene alcohol is widely used in cosmetics and flavoring ingredients . However its scalable production by microbial fermentation is not yet achieved . In this work considerable increase in linalool production was obtained in

@highlight Overexpression of MVA pathway in both mitochondria and cytoplasm in
@highlight Down regulation of ERG20 and overexpressing tHMG1 improved linalool production.
@highlight Pyruvate and mevalonlactone were helpful to linalool production in
@highlight The maximum titer of linalool reached 23.45mg L in a 2L fermenter.
