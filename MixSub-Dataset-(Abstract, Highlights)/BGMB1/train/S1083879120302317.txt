 In this study we compared the outcomes of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia in complete remission treated with myeloablative conditioning and those treated with reduced intensity conditioning before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . In addition we explored the efficacy of dual T cell depletion using anti thymocyte globulin and post transplantation cyclophosphamide for the prevention of graft versus host disease in patients undergoing RIC allo HCT . Our study cohort comprised 356 adults with AML in complete remission who underwent allo HCT between 2013 and 2018 . One hundred eleven patients received a MAC regimen and 245 received an RIC regimen . One hundred seventy one of the patients who received an RIC regimen received ATG PTCy and cyclosporine for GVHD prophylaxis in accordance with our institutional protocol . Data were collected retrospectively and updated in July 2019 . With a median follow up of 14.5 months 161 patients died and 66 relapsed . Two year overall survival relapse free survival and GVHD free RFS were 55 52.6 and 35 respectively . The intensity of the conditioning regimen with or without ATG PTCY CsA did not have a significant impact on OS and RFS . However RIC in combination with ATG PTCY CsA was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of acute GVHD and chronic GVHD . The use of RIC with ATG PTCy CsA was a significant predictor for higher GRFS secondary to the reduction of clinically relevant GVHD

@highlight Dual T cell depletion for graft versus host disease GVHD prophylaxis in reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation reduces clinically significant GVHD thereby improving GVHD free relapse free survival GRFS in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia AML .
@highlight The intensity of the conditioning regimen was not a significant predictor for better post transplantation outcomes overall survival GRFS in patients with AML.
