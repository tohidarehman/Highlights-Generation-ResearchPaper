 Among possible drug delivery system strategies the prodrug based self assembly DDS has been paid much attention in terms of high loading and controlled release . In the application of SADDS the properties and structures of self assembly by prodrug molecules usually play important roles in their bioactivity . However existing strategies to prepare various structures through prodrug molecular design seem to be insufficient . In this study we investigated pH responsive prodrug based SADDSs as an alternate strategy focusing on controlling self assembly behavior via pH change and molecular structural design . The prodrug structure design was inspired by self assembling fatty acids . Here the aryl carboxylic acid Oxaprozin a primary non steroidal anti inflammatory agent was selected as a model molecule to design Oxa lipid prodrug molecules possessing carboxyl groups and different hydrocarbon chain lengths . This prodrug design strategy achieved control of the drug self assembly behavior changing from micelle to fiber to solid which was responsive to pH conditions and molecular concentration . Thus our proposed study may contribute to the development of a biological environment sensitive SADDS .

@highlight pH responsive self assembly behavior of Oxa lipids was observed by designing fatty acid like Oxaprozin prodrug.
@highlight Different self assemble structures can be formed by Oxa C6 and Oxa C8 under various biological pH conditions.
@highlight Oxa lipids showed enhanced fluorescence intensity after aggregated to fiber structure.
