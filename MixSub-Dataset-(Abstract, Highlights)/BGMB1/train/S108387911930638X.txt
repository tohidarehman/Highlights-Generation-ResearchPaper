 Critically ill pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant patients may benefit from early and aggressive interventions aimed at reversing the progression of multiorgan dysfunction . Therefore we evaluated 25 early risk factors for pediatric intensive care unit mortality to improve mortality prognostication . We merged the Virtual Pediatric Systems and Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research databases and analyzed 936 critically ill patients 21 years of age who had undergone allogeneic HCT and subsequently required PICU admission between January 1 2009 and December 31 2014 . Of 1532 PICU admissions the overall PICU mortality rate was 17.4 15.6 to 19.4 but was significantly higher for patients requiring mechanical ventilation renal replacement therapy or extracorporeal life support . Mortality estimates increased significantly the longer that patients remained in the PICU . Of 25 HCT and PICU specific characteristics available at or near the time of PICU admission moderate severe pre HCT renal injury pre HCT recipient cytomegalovirus seropositivity 100 day interval between HCT and PICU admission HCT for underlying acute myeloid leukemia and greater admission organ dysfunction as approximated by the Pediatric Risk of Mortality 3 score were each independently associated with PICU mortality . A multivariable model using these components identified that patients in the top quartile of risk had 3 times greater mortality than other patients 35.1 versus 11.5

@highlight Using a multicenter cohort of 936 critically ill pediatric allogeneic HCT patients across 77 intensive care units this study identified that pre HCT renal injury pre HCT cytomegalovirus seropositivity acute myeloid leukemia Both myeloid and myelogenous are acceptable post HCT day and a continuous metric of multiorgan dysfunction the Pediatric Risk of Mortality 3 score prognosticated pediatric intensive care unit mortality for the highest risk patients.
