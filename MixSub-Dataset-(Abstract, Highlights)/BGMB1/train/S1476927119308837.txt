 The heterocyclic aromatic compounds are primarily used to make pharmaceutical and agrochemicals . In addition these compounds can be chosen as antioxidants corrosion inhibitors electro and opto electronic devices polymer material dye stuff developers etc . On the account of this the heterocyclic aromatic 6 nitro 2 3 dihydro 1 4 benzodioxine was chosen and the structure is optimized to predict the important properties of it . The structural parameters such as bond length and bond angle have been obtained by DFT B3LYP 6 311 G basis set to know the geometry and orientation of 6N3DB . The molecule has been characterized by FT IR and FT Raman spectroscopic techniques to predict the functional groups vibrational modes and aromatic nature of 6N3DB . The chemical shifts of
