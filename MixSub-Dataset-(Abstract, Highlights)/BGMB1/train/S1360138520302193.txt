 Plantmicrobearthropod three way interactions have important implications for plant health . However our poor understanding of the underlying regulatory mechanisms hampers their biotechnological applications . To this end we searched for potential common patterns in plant responses regarding taxonomic groups or lifestyles . We found that most signaling modules regulating two way interactions also operate in three way interactions . Furthermore the relative contribution of signaling modules to the final plant response can not be directly inferred from two way interactions . Moreover our analyses show that three way interactions often result in the activation of additional pathways as well as in changes in the speed or intensity of defense activation . Thus detailed basic knowledge of plantmicrobearthropod regulation will be essential for the design of environmentally friendly crop management strategies .

@highlight Plantmicrobearthropod PMA interactions have important impacts on plant fitness and recent studies shed light on how plants regulate responses in such complex interactions.
@highlight Biosynthetic pathways for the production of defensive and signaling compounds and the corresponding signaling modules mostly related to phytohormones are key regulators both in interactions of the plant with either microbes or arthropods two way interactions or when exposed to both PMA three way interactions .
@highlight Most signaling modules regulating two way interactions of plants with microbes or arthropods also operate in three way PMA interactions but changes in their speed or intensity e.g. defense priming and or activation of additional pathways frequently occur.
@highlight These differences shape the outcome of PMA interactions and may have implications for ecologically based crop protection.
