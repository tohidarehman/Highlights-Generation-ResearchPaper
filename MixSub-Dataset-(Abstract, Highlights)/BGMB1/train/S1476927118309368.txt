 In plants NAC is a class of transcription factors involved in growth regulation and is associated with abiotic stress morphogenesis and metabolism . Celery

@highlight A total of 111 putative NAC TFs were found and identified based on celery transcriptome and genome database.
@highlight The AgNAC TFs were classified into 18 subfamilies and their physicochemical properties were preliminary analyzed.
@highlight Expression profiles of selected
@highlight genes in response to abiotic stress were detected.
