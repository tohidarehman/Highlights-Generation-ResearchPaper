 The acclimation process of activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant for degradation of glyphosate and its biodegradation kinetics were studied in a batch reactor . The parameters monitored included the concentrations of glyphosate as well as aminomethylphosphonic acid its main metabolite total organic carbon pH dissolved oxygen and biomass concentration . At the end of the acclimation process glyphosate removal efficiency of the acclimated sludge was compared to the fresh sludge one . The results showed that the acclimation process highly increased degradation efficiency . Complete glyphosate removal has been achieved during kinetics experiments . Glyphosate removal kinetic of the acclimated sludge was modeled by Monod model that accurately fitted the experimental results with a maximum growth rate

@highlight Complete glyphosate removal has been obtained by acclimated activated sludge.
@highlight C N cleavage confirms the use of glyphosate as carbon source.
@highlight Monod model fitted experimental data of glyphosate biodegradation kinetics with a maximum growth rate of 0.34h
@highlight A biodegradation pathway was deduced from kinetic results.
