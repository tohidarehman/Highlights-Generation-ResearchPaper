 This work describes for the first time the green synthesis of neopentyl glycol diheptanoate in a solvent free medium via an enzymatic pathway . The process has been carried out in an open air reactor in order to ease water removal through evaporation and shift the chemical equilibrium towards product formation . The inhibiting effect of high concentrations of heptanoic acid has been put into evidence by a reduction of initial reaction rate when esterification was performed with stoichiometric amounts of substrates . Therefore in this work different strategies for the stepwise addition of heptanoic acid are proposed and best results were obtained when stoichiometric quantities of acid were divided in four equal amounts and added when previous batch was consumed . Biocatalyst Novozym 435 concentration and temperature were optimised giving yields of 90 in neopentyl glycol diheptanoate when 7.5 and 70C were used . With a remaining 7 of heptanoic acid the addition of neopentyl glycol led to a conversion of 95 . Thus product can be used in cosmetics without further purification and can be labelled as environmentally friendly synthesized because of its enzymatic origin .

@highlight The enzymatic synthesis of neopentyl glycol diheptanoate is reported for the 1
@highlight time.
@highlight Reaction rate decreases are caused by high heptanoic acid concentrations.
@highlight A stepwise acid addition strategy leads to product concentrations of 93 in 8h.
@highlight Product purity can be increased to 95 if neopentyl glycol is finally added.
