 In order to enhance productivity and cost effectiveness of current lipase catalyzed processes of flavonoid esters synthesis different LifeTech ECR carriers varying in functional groups polarity and porosity were hereby screened as immobilization supports for free lipase B from

@highlight CAL B was successfully immobilized onto eight different LifeTech ECR supports.
@highlight Immobilization onto ECR8409F ECR8806cf and ECR8285F supports were optimized.
@highlight Novel immobilized preparations show very good activity in flavonoid esterification.
@highlight Immobilized preparations catalyzed flavonoids transesterification with natural oils.
@highlight Lipase immobilized onto hydrophobic support show exceptional operational stability.
