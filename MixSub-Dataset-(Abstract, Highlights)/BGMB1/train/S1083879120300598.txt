 Clinical outcomes in children with steroid refractory acute graft versus host disease are generally poor with a high mortality rate and limited therapeutic options . Here we report our updated investigational experience with mesenchymal stromal cell therapy with remestemcel L in a multicenter expanded access protocol in 241 children with aGVHD who failed to respond to steroids with or without other secondary and tertiary immunosuppressive therapies . A total of 241 children with grade B D SR aGVHD were enrolled at 50 sites in 8 countries and received 8 biweekly i.v . infusions of human MSCs 210

@highlight There are no approved therapies for acute graft versus host disease aGVHD in children 12 years.
@highlight A total of 241 children with steroid refractory aGVHD received remestemcel L as salvage therapy.
@highlight Day 28 overall response was achieved by 65.1 66.9 were alive at day 100.
@highlight Day 28 overall response strongly predicted day 100 survival.
@highlight Remestemcel L is a promising therapy for steroid refractory aGVHD in children.
