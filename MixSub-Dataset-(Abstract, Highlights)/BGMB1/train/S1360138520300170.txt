 Foliar water uptake has been identified as a mechanism commonly used by trees and other plants originating from various biomes . However many questions regarding the pathways and the implications of FWU remain including its ability to mitigate climate change driven drought . Therefore answering these questions is of primary importance to adequately address and comprehend drought stress responses and associated growth . In this review we discuss the occurrence pathways and consequences of FWU with a focus predominantly on tree species . Subsequently we highlight the tight coupling between FWU and foliar fertilizer applications discuss FWU in a changing climate and conclude with the importance of including FWU in mechanistic vegetation models .

@highlight Foliar water uptake FWU has been identified as a mechanism commonly used by plants originating from a range of biomes.
@highlight FWU can rehydrate tissues and result in turgor driven growth.
@highlight FWU and the absorption of foliar fertilizers are interlinked making FWU research important for both natural and agricultural ecosystems.
@highlight As the number of climate change induced drought events increases so too will the relative importance of FWU.
@highlight Future models should include FWU to correctly assess the impact of climate change on tree growth.
