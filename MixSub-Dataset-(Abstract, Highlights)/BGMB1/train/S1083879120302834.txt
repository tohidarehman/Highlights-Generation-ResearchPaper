 Hemorrhagic cystitis is an important complication after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with post transplantation cyclophosphamide . Sodium 2 mercaptoethanesulfonate can prevent bladder injury when given with PT CY . However the best way to deliver MESNA is not known . This study assessed the incidence of HC after haplo HSCT with PT CY with 2 different methods of MESNA administration . The cumulative incidence of HC was lower in patients who received MESNA as a continuous infusion compared with those who received it as an intermittent bolus 5.6 versus 27.8

@highlight Hemorrhagic cystitis is a common complication after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with post transplantation cyclophosphamide.
@highlight This study evaluated two different regimens of sodium 2 mercaptoethanesulfonate MESNA administration.
@highlight A continuous infusion of MESNA lowered the incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis.
@highlight Adverse events were similar regardless of the administration scheme.
