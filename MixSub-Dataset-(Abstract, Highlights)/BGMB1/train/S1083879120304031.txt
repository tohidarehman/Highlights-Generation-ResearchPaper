 Cytomegalovirus viremia occurs in 40 to 80 of CMV seropositive recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation . The preemptive therapy strategy has reduced the risk of CMV end organ disease and associated mortality but may lead to substantial healthcare resource utilization and costs . Real world data on the economic impact of PET is relevant for the evaluation of alternative strategies for CMV management . We examined the impact of clinically significant CMV treated with PET on inpatient length of stay number of readmissions and associated costs from day 0 through day 180 post HCT .

@highlight We evaluated the impact of cytomegalovirus CMV viremia managed with preemptive therapy PET on healthcare resource utilization after hematopoietic cell transplantation at a single center.
@highlight In multivariable models CMV infection managed by PET was associated with increased readmissions and higher inpatient costs.
@highlight CMV related readmission was associated with increased length of stay LOS and greater cost compared with non CMV related readmission.
