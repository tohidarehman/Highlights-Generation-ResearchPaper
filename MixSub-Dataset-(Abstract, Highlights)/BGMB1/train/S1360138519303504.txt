 Plant glandular trichomes are epidermal secretory structures producing various specialized metabolites . These metabolites are involved in plant adaptation to its environment and many of them have remarkable properties exploited by fragrance flavor and pharmaceutical industries . The identification of genes controlling glandular trichome development is of high interest to understand how plants produce specialized metabolites . Our knowledge about this developmental process is still limited but genes controlling glandular trichome initiation and morphogenesis have recently been identified . In particular R2R3 MYB and HD ZIP IV transcription factors appear to play essential roles in glandular trichome initiation in

@highlight Glandular trichomes are multicellular organs that cover the surface of more than 30 of all land plants. Glandular trichomes synthesize store and secrete diverse specialized metabolites.
@highlight Recent studies have reported genes and protein complexes regulating glandular trichome development in
@highlight and tomato. We propose a genetic model to explain the glandular trichome initiation in each species.
@highlight R2R3 MYB and HD ZIP IV transcription factor families play essential roles in glandular trichome initiation.
@highlight Glandular trichome density and size are important factors regulating metabolic content. Increasing glandular trichome density by genetic engineering successfully enhanced specialized metabolite content without any adverse effect on plant growth.
