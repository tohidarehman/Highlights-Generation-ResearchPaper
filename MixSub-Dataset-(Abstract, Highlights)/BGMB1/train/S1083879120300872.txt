 Clinical trials have shown that nivolumab has remarkable activity against relapsed refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma . However the role of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as consolidation therapy in these patients remains controversial . We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 74 patients treated with nivolumab . The overall response rate was 58 . Treatment related adverse events were reported in 56.8 of patients . The main reasons for nivolumab discontinuation were referral for transplantation and disease progression . The 2 year overall survival rate was 52 for the entire series . Ultimately 39 patients underwent allo HSCT . The cumulative incidence of grade II IV acute graft versus host disease was 33.3 . The cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was 13.2 . Among the patients who responded to nivolumab the 2 year OS and progression free survival were higher in patients who underwent consolidation with allo HSCT 77.5 versus 42.6

@highlight The efficacy and safety of nivolumab in real life for the treatment of relapsed refractory Hodgkin lymphoma are comparable to those reported in clinical trials.
@highlight The main reasons for nivolumab discontinuation were referral for transplantation and disease progression.
@highlight Based on a median follow up of 18 months our results show that consolidation with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is associated with favorable progression free survival and overall survival.
