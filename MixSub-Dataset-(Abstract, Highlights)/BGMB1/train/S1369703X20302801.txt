 Marine biological resources are significant sources of biological and chemical processes and principles from which new bioactive compounds can be explored . Here we report a new silica forming peptide called Kpt derived from a membrane protein in

@highlight Kpt KPTHHHHHHDG was found and characterized as a new silica forming peptide.
@highlight Kpt showed a high silicification activity and a high affinity with Ni IDA resin.
@highlight Kpt fusion protein can be easily purified by His tag affinity chromatography system.
@highlight Kpt fusion ferritin was prepared and employed for the generation of biosilica particles.
