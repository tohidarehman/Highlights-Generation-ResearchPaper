 The utility of surveillance imaging after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation in relapsed refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma remains unclear . The purpose of this study was to determine whether surveillance imaging predicts survival after AHCT . At the University of Minnesota serial imaging for early relapse detection has been used prospectively for all consecutive AHCT recipients treated since 2010 . The present analysis included 91 AHCT recipients with DLBCL who underwent

@highlight Routine PET imaging at day 100 post autologous HCT detects asymptomatic relapse in about 30 of patients with DLBCL and portents worse survival.
@highlight High SUV
@highlight at day 100 PET is associated with survival of less than 1 year post transplant
@highlight Identifying this high risk cohort in autologous HCT recipients highlights the opportunity to develop preemptive interventions to improve survival in DLBCL.
