 In the bioprocess modeling field a descriptive methodology that explicity considers the interactions between the environment and cells is lacking . This relationship directly affects all kinetics which have so far been formulated through empirical relationship . In this research additional steps were added to a known bioprocess modeling methodology to relate environment and cells to each other . The quantitative validation of the proposed phenomenological based semi physical model was developed for a glucose culture bioprocess carried out by the bacterium
