 Carboxylic acids are high added value compounds that can be produced via anaerobic fermentation by using agroindustrial residues as substrates . However different compounds in wastewater impose uncontrolled metabolic pathways in which the acidogenic fermentation kinetics need to be elucidated . This work aimed to assess the potential production of CA from dairy wastewater and to perform the kinetic modeling of the process . The experiments were conducted in quadruplicate batch reactors with inoculum from a brewery UASB at 0.61 0.04 gCOD gVSS
