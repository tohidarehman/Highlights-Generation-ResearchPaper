 Cadaverine is a five carbon diamine which serves as an important biochemical for the synthesis of bio based nylon . It can be produced by the bioconversion of

@highlight BL21harboring pdxY under the J23100 promoter resulted in highest yield of PLP.
@highlight pdxK plays a critical role in accumulation of PLP for biotransformation.
@highlight Lysine was 100 converted to cadaverine in co expressing pdxK and CadA.
@highlight Cadaverine biotransformation was enhanced for
@highlight and
