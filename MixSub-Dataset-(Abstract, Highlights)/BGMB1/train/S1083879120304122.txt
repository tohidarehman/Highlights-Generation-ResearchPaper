 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can cure primary immunodeficiency diseases . When a HLA matched donor is not available a haploidentical family donor may be considered . The use of T cell replete haploidentical HCT with post transplantation cyclophosphamide in children with PID has been reported in few case series . A donor is usually readily available and haplo PTCy can be used in urgent cases . We studied the outcomes of 73 patients with PID who underwent haplo PTCy including 55 patients who did so as a first transplantation and 18 who did so as a salvage transplantation after graft failure of previous HCT . The median patient age was 1.6 years . Most of the children were male and had active infection at the time of transplantation 10 children had severe organ damage . The diagnosis was severe combined immunodeficiency in 34 patients and non SCID in 39 . The median duration of follow up of survivors was 2 years . The cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery was 88 in the SCID group and 84 in non SCID group and was 81 for first transplantations and 83 after a salvage graft . At 100 days the cumulative incidence of acute GVHD grade II IV and III IV was 33 and 14 respectively . The majority of patients reached 200 L CD4

@highlight We report the outcomes of 73 patients with PID after transplantation with a haploidentical donor graft and receipt of post transplantation cyclophosphamide haplo PTCy .
@highlight Haplo PTCy can cure two thirds of PID patients and can be used to rescue graft failure after previous transplantation.
@highlight Nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens are associated with increased incidence of graft failure and mixed chimerism.
@highlight We describe the development of different conditioning regimens according to each type of disease treated which may be useful for developing specific protocols.
