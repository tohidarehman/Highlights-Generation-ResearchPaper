 The microbial production of industrial enzymes requires a large number of complex biochemical steps for purification which increases their production cost . Additionally poor thermo stability of the purified enzymes under the operational conditions along with the challenges in their recovery and subsequent reuse limit their usage in an industrial bioprocess . Surface display of heterologous enzymes on bacterial cells appear to be a suitable alternative .

@highlight A glucose tolerant glucosidase was displayed on the
@highlight cell surface.
@highlight The displayed glucosidase demonstrated enhanced thermo stability.
@highlight Displaying the enzyme on the cell surface allowed efficient catalyst recycling.
@highlight The displayed enzyme was catalytically more effective than the pure enzyme.
