 Stirred suspension culture is becoming a popular method for expanding human pluripotent stem cells . While stirring generates adequate fluid motions to lift the cells and facilitates mass transfers excessive stirring could impose hydrodynamic forces deleterious for the growth of the cells . In this study computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to first investigate hydrodynamic characteristics of fluid flows in a spinner flask a common stirred suspension culture vessel used in laboratories . Flow patterns and distributions of shear stresses and the Kolmogorov length scales at varying impeller speeds were obtained . Comparison of the Kolmogorov length scales and sizes of hPSC aggregates measured in the authors previous experimental study showed a strong correlation between the two . In addition to the spinner flask which generated complex and transient turbulent flows this study investigated a newly developed rotary wall vessel that had been designed to produce laminar circular Couette flows in order to control shear stress . CFD simulations revealed significantly more uniform and homogeneous flows compared to those in the spinner flask suggesting that the rotary wall vessel is a suitable culture vessel to investigate roles of shear stress on hPSCs in suspension .

@highlight CFD simulations of a spinner flask and a rotary wall vessel were performed.
@highlight Increasing impeller speed reduced the Kolmogorov length scales.
@highlight The Kolmogorov length scales were strongly correlated with cell aggregate sizes.
@highlight The rotary wall vessel was designed to minimize shear stress distributions.
@highlight The rotary vessel reduced shear stress distribution by half than the spinner flask.
