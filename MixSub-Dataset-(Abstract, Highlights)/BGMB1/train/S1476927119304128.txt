 Human African trypanosomiasis also known as sleeping sickness causes millions of deaths worldwide . HAT is primarily transmitted by the vector tsetse fly

@highlight We have re annotated the genome of tsetse fly and identified novel miRNAs based on a series of reliable bioinformatics tools.
@highlight 25 proteins and 35 miRNAs were found to be associated with trypanosome survival.
@highlight Two miRNAs miR 619 5p and miR 2490 3p were observed to target several critical genes that participated in the infection of human African trypanosomiasis.
@highlight Ten miRNAs were found to be unique in tsetse fly compared to other insects.
