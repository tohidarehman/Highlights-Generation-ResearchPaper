 Numerous micro physiological systems have been reported to successfully mimic the organ microenvironment . However there are currently only a few systems that focus on real time physiological monitoring for preclinical cytotoxicity assessment of drug candidates . We developed a multi sensor lung cancer on chip platform for trans epithelial electrical impedance based cytotoxicity evaluation of drug candidates . The excellent transparency of ITO electrodes allowed for visual monitoring of cells on chip using a 3D printed digital microscope which has not been previously reported . An optical pH sensor was used for online monitoring of media pH . As a proof of concept lung cancer NCI H1437 cells were cultured on glass based microfluidic chip and biosensors data were obtained in real time . The toxicity of different concentrations of drugs doxorubicin and docetaxel was then monitored in real time using the TEER impedance sensor . The TEER impedance response was evaluated in terms of cell index whereas a live dead assay was performed for the comparison of cell viability at the end of the experiments . The cell index assessment suggested that the increasing concentrations of doxorubicin resulted in a higher cell death rate than docetaxel . The pH response and microscopic images were also recorded during drug treatment . The platform we developed here is a promising tool for the cytotoxicity evaluation of novel drug compounds for future micro physiological systems and development of personalized medicine .
