 The early stage attachment behaviors of acidophiles on mineral surfaces and the subsequent biofilm formation play important roles in acid mine drainage production and also can improve the leaching efficiency of metal sulfides . However despite significant advances in correlational researches of mesophilic bacteria studies on thermoacidophilic archaeon are still limited . In this study the early attachment behaviors and biofilm formation of the thermoacidophilic archaeon

@highlight Multi layer adsorption of A. manzaensis YN 25 to mineral surfaces was transitory.
@highlight Attached cells on chalcopyrite were higher because of higher adhesion force.
@highlight Surface coverage of biofilm was positively correlated with the initial adhesion.
@highlight Dead cells have accounted for a big proportion in
@highlight YN 25 biofilm.
