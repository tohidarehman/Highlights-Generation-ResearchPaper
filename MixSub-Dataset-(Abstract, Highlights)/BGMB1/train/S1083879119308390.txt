 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only available curative treatment option for patients with aggressive adult T cell leukemia lymphoma . Donor human T cell leukemia virus 1 seropositivity is a critical concern when choosing relative donors as they are not usually recommended due solely to the occurrence of donor derived ATL . A previous report suggested that allo HCT with an HTLV 1 seropositive donor increased ATL related mortality . We updated the risk assessment for choosing an HTLV 1 seropositive allo HCT donor for ATL . Our current registry data which include larger numbers of HTLV 1 seropositive donors and longer observation periods revealed no significant difference in overall survival 0.93 95 confidence interval 0.70 1.24

@highlight We assessed the effect of donor human T cell leukemia virus 1 serostatus on outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation allo HCT in adult T cell leukemia lymphoma.
@highlight There was no significant difference in overall survival or incidence of mortality.
@highlight This might aid the choice of appropriate and timely alternative donors for allo HCT.
