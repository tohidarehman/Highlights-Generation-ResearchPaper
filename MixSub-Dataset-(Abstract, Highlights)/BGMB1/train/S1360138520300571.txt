 Plants have evolved a sophisticated innate immune system to defend against pathogen infection and intracellular nucleotide binding leucine rich repeat immune receptors are one of the main components of this system . NLR activity is fine tuned by intra and intermolecular interactions . We survey what is known about the conservation and diversity of NLR interacting proteins and divide them into seven major categories . We discuss the molecular mechanisms by which NLR activities are regulated and how understanding this regulation has potential to facilitate the engineering of NLRs for crop improvement .

@highlight NLR proteins are the major intracellular immune receptors in plants. Their transition between autoinhibited and activated states is fine tuned by intra and intermolecular interactions.
@highlight NLR interacting proteins play important roles in NLR mediated immunity. Many NLR interacting proteins have been identified however they have not been systematically classified.
