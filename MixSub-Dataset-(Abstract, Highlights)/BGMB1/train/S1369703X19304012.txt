 Environmental concerns and the depletion of fossil resources are the major factors that boost modern society towards bio based and circular economy . To this end the development of mathematical tools that can be used to perform rapid comparative analysis across multiple technology options is necessary . The aim of this work is to present a simple and accurate mathematical model which describes the economics of the bioreaction section of a typical biotransformation technology . The functional dependency of fixed capital investment and utilities consumption from parameters determined experimentally is developed using a regression model . The proposed model which consists only of three equations can be used to compare the economic performance of different bio based technologies that could potentially reach commercialization . More specifically it can be used to estimate at the early stages of process development the effect of final broth concentration fermentation time and aeration rate on overall process economics .
