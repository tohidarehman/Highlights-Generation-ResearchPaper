 Pneumococci are a common cause of severe infections such as otitis media pneumonia meningitis and bacteremia . Pili are detected in a small proportion of pneumococcal population but these structures have recently been associated with bacterial virulence in humans . Therefore the epidemiological relationships between pneumococcal pili serotype and antimicrobial resistance are of interest . This study aims to discuss the virulence contribution of the

@highlight Pili have been detected in a small proportion of pneumococcal population but associated with virulence in human.
@highlight Piliated pneumococci have been largely clonal carrying drug resistance involving many serotypes mostly covered by pneumococcal conjugate vaccines PCVs .
@highlight Most of pneumococcal molecular epidemiology network PMEN clones are piliated isolates strongly associated with multidrug resistance.
@highlight Most of the piliated pneumococci belong to a few clonal complexes CC 320 CC199 CC271 CC191 and CC156.
