 N acylated amino acids are widely used as surfactants and or actives in cosmetics and household formulations . Their industrial production is based on the use of the Schotten Baumann chemical and unselective reaction . Faced to the growing demand for greener production processes selective enzymatic synthesis in more environment friendly conditions starts to be considered as a potential alternative . This study concerns the use of the aminoacylases from

@highlight Large spectrum of N acylation activity toward the amino acids of the extracted aminoacylases from
@highlight Influence of side chain of the acyl receiver on the reactivity of the aminoacylases.
@highlight Evidence that the aminoacylase Sam AA is responsible of the major N acylation activity.
@highlight Different affinity and reactivity of the enzyme with the acyl receiver and the acyl donor.
@highlight Improvement of the catalytic performance using Cobalt as divalent ion.
