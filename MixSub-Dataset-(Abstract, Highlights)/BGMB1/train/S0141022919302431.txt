 Amylosucrase has great industrial potential owing to its multifunctional activities including transglucosylation polymerization and isomerization . In the present study the properties of

@highlight amylosucrase DGAS was expressed in
@highlight  cDGAS .
@highlight amylosucrase DGAS was expressed in
@highlight  eDGAS .
@highlight The optimal temperature of cDGAS was lower than that of eDGAS.
@highlight Luteolin transglucosylation activity of cDGAS was higher than that of eDGAS.
@highlight  strand ratios were lower for cDGAS than for eDGAS.
