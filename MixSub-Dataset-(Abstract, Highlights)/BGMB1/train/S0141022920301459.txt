 Menaquinone 4 one form of vitamin K plays an important role in cardiovascular and bone health . Menaquinone 4 is a valuable vitamin K2 that is dicult to synthesize organically and now is mainly produced by microbial fermentation . Herein we significantly improved the synthesis efficiency of MK 4 by combinatorial pathway engineering in

@highlight Overexpression of
@highlight  and
@highlight genes from
@highlight sp. PCC 6803 in MK 4 synthesis module resulted in 8.10.2mg L of MK 4.
@highlight By knocking out
@highlight gene the titer of MK 4 in the resultant strain BY03 was increased by 3.8 fold.
@highlight The MK 4 titer reached 120.10.6mg L in shake flask and 1452.8mg L in a 3 L fed batch bioreactor respectively.
