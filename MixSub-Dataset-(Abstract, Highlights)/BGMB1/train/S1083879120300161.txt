 The incidence of hepatitis B virus infection is high in the Asian population . Increasing attention is being given to the risk of HBV reactivation in hepatitis B core antibody positive patients during immunosuppressive therapy . Knowledge of HBV reactivation in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is limited . Moreover the effect of hepatitis B surface antibody on HBV reactivation in HBcAb patients during HSCT remains uncertain . We sought to investigate the role of HBsAb and the need for prophylactic antiviral treatment in hepatitis B surface antigen negative HBcAb patients during HSCT . We classified 665 HBsAg HSCT recipients into 4 groups HBcAbHBsAb HBcAbHBsAb HBcAbHBsAb and HBcAbHBsAb . HBV reactivation was identified in 16 patients after HSCT . The median time to HBV reactivation was 645 days after transplantation . The cumulative HBV reactivation rate was significantly higher in the HBcAbHBsAb group compared with the HBcAbHBsAb HBcAbHBsAb and HBcAbHBsAb groups respectively

@highlight Hepatitis B core antibody HBcAb and hepatitis B surface antibody HBsAb play protective roles in patients with resolved hepatitis B virus HBV infection undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCT .
@highlight The risk of HBV reactivation was significantly higher in HBcAb HBsAb patients compared with HBcAb HBsAb patients.
@highlight HBV reactivation in HBcAb HBsAb patients following HSCT was a rare and late complication.
@highlight Prophylactic anti HBV treatment might not be mandatory for hepatitis B surface antigen negative HBsAg HBcAb HBsAb patients following HSCT.
