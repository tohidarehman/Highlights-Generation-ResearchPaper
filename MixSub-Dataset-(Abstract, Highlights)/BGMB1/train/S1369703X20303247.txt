 The present article explores the idea of exposing an enzyme substrate complex to an induced magnetic field aiming at biogas production . Sugar beet pulp was used as a substrate and pectinase as an enzyme . Fermentation experiments were carried out in an 11L working volume stainless steel bioreactor . Additionally the influence of substrate sonication prior to the enzymatic pretreatment on the methane production and specific energy gain was investigated . The enzyme substrate mixture when exposed to an induced magnetic field increased methane production from SBP up to 62 and when sonication was added to the process the increase in methane production was up to 79 . The results indicate that exposing an enzyme substrate mixture to an induced magnetic field can increase biogas production and its methane content with a higher specific energy gain than when sonication was added to the process .
