 Corneal clouding causing visual impairment is seen in nearly all patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type 1 . Hematopoietic cell transplantation is able to stabilize disease in many organs . Residual disease in several tissues is being increasingly recognized however . Data on the effect of HCT on ocular disease in patients with MPS 1 are contradictory . With this study we aim to clarify the long term effects of HCT on ocular disease in these patients . Best corrected visual acuity refraction intraocular pressure and slit lamp biomicroscopic and fundoscopic examinations including corneal clouding were collected prospectively from 24 patients with MPS 1 who underwent HCT successfully between 2003 and 2018 . The course of corneal clouding and BCVA after HCT were analyzed using a linear mixed model . Other parameters studied were clinical phenotype age at time of transplantation and hematologic enzyme activity after transplantation . Outcomes of additional ophthalmologic tests were described . In addition IDUA and galactosidase A enzyme activity and glycosaminoglycan concentration in tear fluid were determined . Corneal clouding stabilized in the first years after HCT but increased rapidly beyond 3 years

@highlight After initial stabilization corneal clouding is progressing in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type 1 MPS 1 after treatment with hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT .
@highlight Best corrected visual acuity is also worsening in MPS 1 patients after treatment with HCT.
@highlight Despite normalized hematologic L iduronidase IDUA activity IDUA activity in tear fluid is still very low.
@highlight Long term follow up and counseling of parents and patients undergoing HCT for MPS 1 is necessary.
