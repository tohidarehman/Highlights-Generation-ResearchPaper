 Severe thalassemia syndromes are highly curable by bone marrow transplant but rejection may still occur . We retrospectively analyzed our fully matched related donor transplants to establish if isolated splenomegaly is an independent risk factor for rejection and if this risk can be reduced by modifying the conditioning protocol . In this study we compared rejection rates between patients with and without splenomegaly in 189 consecutive low risk ST transplants across 2 sequential conditioning regimens regimen A busulfan cyclophosphamide and anti thymocyte globulin 4 mg kg or Fresenius 16 mg kg on days 12 to 10 and regimen B same backbone as regimen A except fludarabine total dose of 150 mg was added upfront and ATG dose was increased to 7 mg kg in case of splenomegaly and or sex mismatched transplants . Compared with regimen A in regimen B both overall rejection rates 16 versus 6.5

@highlight Isolated splenomegaly may increase the risk of rejections in low risk thalassemia transplants.
@highlight The rejection risk due to splenomegaly can be partially overcome by increasing immunosuppression in the conditioning regimen.
