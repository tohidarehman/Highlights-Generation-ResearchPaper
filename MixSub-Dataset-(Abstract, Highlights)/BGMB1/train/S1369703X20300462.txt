 A by product of cheese industry whey is often used as a source in a microbiological lactic acid production . However an activity of microorganisms naturally occurring in whey causing an imbalance in downstream microbiological processes . Thus the whey permeate was indicated as appropriate medium to LA production because a microfiltration is a type of sterilization named very often cold sterilization and provide a pure and sterilize medium . The goal of this study was to identify the optimal concentrations of peptone egg and yeast extract needed to re supplement whey permeate medium using for industrial scale LA production because whey permeate is almost pure lactose solution . The highest value of LA production 27.5 g L

@highlight The highest value of LA production was 27.5g L
@highlight In this case content of peptone were 5 egg powder 8 yeast extract 0.2g L
@highlight 2 of the initial lactose content was in the spent medium applied these conditions.
