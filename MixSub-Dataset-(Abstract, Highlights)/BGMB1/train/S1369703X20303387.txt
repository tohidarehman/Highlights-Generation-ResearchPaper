 The slow start up of anammox process has been a big obstacle for its engineering application . In this study a new strategy was adopted to start up anammox by mixing perchlorate reduction sludge and anammox sludge with 50 1vol ratio and the mechanism in the start up process was explored . The results showed that anammox process was started up successfully after 41 days . During the operation process pH value increased from 7.880.148.060.11 extracellular polysaccharides increased from 10.56 to 24.45mg

@highlight Perchlorate reducing sludge PRS was first used for anammox start up.
@highlight The anammox successfully started up in 41 days by PRS and anammox sludge 50 1 .
@highlight The rapid start up was due to the contribution of PRS and the guide of the anammox.
@highlight C6 HSL could promote anammox activity while C8 HSL was the opposite.
@highlight Phylum
@highlight played an critical role during the start up of anammox process.
