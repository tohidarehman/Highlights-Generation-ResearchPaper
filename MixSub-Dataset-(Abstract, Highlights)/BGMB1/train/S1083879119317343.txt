 Reduced intensity conditioning regimens improved HLA matching and better supportive care allow allogeneic stem cell transplant to be offered to older patients . Only a small percentage of eligible patients between ages 65 and 74 years actually undergo alloSCT and comprehensive outcome data from the aging population are still lacking . We examined the outcome of older patients who underwent alloSCT using melphalan based RIC for hematologic malignancies at our institution . We identified 125 patients older than 65 years who underwent matched related donor matched unrelated donor or combined haploidentical umbilical cord alloSCT between 2012 through November 2017 . Among them 52 and 70 had respectively intermediate and high very high Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research disease risk index . One hundred six patients received fludarabine melphalan based RIC regimen with either antithymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab .

@highlight Older patients with hematologic malignancies tolerate melphalan based RIC alloSCT with acceptable survival outcomes.
@highlight Using
@highlight T cell depletion the incidence of cGVHD is very low and quality of life of survivors is excellent.
@highlight Outcomes of related unrelated and haplo cord alloSCT are comparable.
