 Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for multiple myeloma with its underlying graft versus tumor capacity is a potentially curative approach for high risk patients . Relapse is the main cause of treatment failure but predictors for postrelapse survival are not well characterized . We conducted a retrospective analysis to evaluate predictors for postrelapse overall survival in 60 MM patients who progressed after myeloablative T cell depleted alloHCT . The median patient age was 56 years and 82 had high risk cytogenetics . Patients received a median of 4 lines of therapy pre HCT and 88 achieved at least a partial response before alloHCT . Of the 38 who received preemptive post HCT therapy 13 received donor lymphocyte infusions and 10 received other interventions . Relapse was defined as very early early or late . At relapse 27 presented with extramedullary disease . The median postrelapse overall survival by time to relapse was 4 months for the very early relapse group 17 months for the early relapse group and 72 months for the late relapse group

@highlight Time to relapse after T cell depleted hematopoietic cell transplantation defines distinct postrelapse outcomes.
@highlight Relapse with extramedullary disease is common and associated with dismal prognosis.
@highlight Donor lymphocyte infusion for relapse prevention improves postrelapse survival.
