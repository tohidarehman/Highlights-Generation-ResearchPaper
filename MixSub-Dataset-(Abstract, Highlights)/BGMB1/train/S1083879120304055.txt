 There have been several efforts to predict mortality after autologous stem cell transplantation such as the hematopoietic cell transplant comorbidity index described for allogeneic stem cell transplantation and validated for ASCT but there is no composite score in the setting of ASCT combining comorbidities with other clinical characteristics . Our aim is to describe a comprehensive score combining comorbidities with other clinical factors and to analyze the impact of this score on nonrelapse mortality overall survival and early morbidity endpoints after ASCT . For the training cohort we retrospectively reviewed data of 2068 adult patients who received an ASCT in Argentina for multiple myeloma or lymphoma . For the validation cohort we analyzed 2168 ASCTs performed in the Medical College of Wisconsin and Spanish stem cell transplant group . We first performed a multivariate analysis for NRM in order to select and assign weight to the risk factors included in the score . The hazard ratio for NRM increased proportionally with the score . Patients were grouped as low risk with a score of 0 to 1 intermediate risk with a score of 2 to 3 high risk with a score of 4 and very high risk with a score of 5 . The score was associated with a progressive increase in all the early morbidity endpoints . Moreover the score was significantly associated with early NRM as well as long term 1 to 3 years 1.8 to 2.3 versus 3.8 to 4.9 versus 11.7 to 14.5 versus 25.0 to 27.4 respectively

@highlight Variables other than comorbidities affect nonrelapse mortality NRM after autologous transplant.
@highlight We developed in a large cohort a novel score combining hematopoietic cell transplant comorbidity index age disease and sex.
@highlight The new score predicts early morbidity events and long term NRM and overall survival.
@highlight The score was validated in an independent large cohort.
