 High stress resistance and yield are major goals in crop cultivation which can be addressed by modifying plant architecture . Significant progress has been made in recent years to understand how plant architecture is controlled under various growth conditions recognizing the central role phytohormones play in response to environmental stresses . miRNAs transcription factors and other associated proteins regulate plant architecture mainly via the modulation of hormone homeostasis and signaling . To generate crop plants of ideal architecture we propose simultaneous editing of multiple genes involved in the regulatory networks associated with plant architecture as a feasible strategy . This strategy can help to address the need to increase grain yield and or stress resistance under the pressures of the ever increasing world population and climate change .

@highlight Plant hormone homeostasis modulates plant architecture crop yield and resistance to environmental stresses.
@highlight miRNAs phytohormones key transcription factors and other important signaling proteins form complex networks to regulate plant hormone homeostasis.
@highlight Some transcription factors act as system integrators of internal and external signals to regulate lateral organ angles and or orientations and or branch and tiller numbers.
@highlight Modification of plant architecture by fine tuning the expression of key genes has proved to be a promising strategy to improve yield and or stress resistance.
