 We are facing unprecedented phosphorus challenges namely P scarcity associated with increasing food demand and an oversupply of P fertilisers resulting in eutrophication . Although we need a multidisciplinary approach to systematically enhance P use efficiency monodisciplinary studies still prevail . Here we propose to tighten the P cycle by identifying P efficient crop genotypes integrating four plant strategies increasing P acquisition efficiency photosynthetic P use efficiency and P remobilisation efficiency and decreasing seed phytate P concentrations . We recommend P efficient genotypes together with diversified cropping systems involving complementary P acquisition strategies as well as smart P fertiliser management to enhance P use efficiency in agriculture dependent on soil P status . These strategies will reduce P fertiliser requirements and offsite environmental impacts while enhancing seed quality for human and livestock nutrition .

@highlight Adopting a multidisciplinary approach is crucial to tighten the P cycle however current research still focusses on monodisciplinary approaches.
@highlight Crop genotypes with high efficiency of P acquisition photosynthetic P use or P remobilisation or low seed phytate P concentrations are crucial to reduce P fertiliser input and P related environmental impact and to enhance micronutrient availability of food and feed.
@highlight While native plant species differ substantially in their strategies for P acquisition under low P availability there is also considerable genotypic variation in P acquisition strategies in crop species and genotypes.
@highlight At the leaf level P is preferentially allocated to photosynthetic cells to enhance photosynthetic P use efficiency while at the cellular level plants maintain a higher ratio of metabolic P to lipid P and function at very low levels of ribosomal RNA.
