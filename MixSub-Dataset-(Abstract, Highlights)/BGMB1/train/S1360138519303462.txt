 Due to the ongoing prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in developing countries there has been a large effort towards increasing the carotenoid content of staple foods via biofortification . Common strategies used for carotenoid biofortification include altering flux through the biosynthesis pathway to direct synthesis to a specific product generally carotene or via increasing the expression of genes early in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway . Recently carotenoid biofortification strategies are turning towards increasing the retention of carotenoids in plant tissues either via altering sequestration within the cell or via downregulating enzymes known to cause degradation of carotenoids . To date little attention has focused on increasing the stability of carotenoids which may be a promising method of increasing carotenoid content in staple foods .

@highlight Combining strategies targeting multiple metabolic levels including synthesis storage and turnover will be necessary to achieve optimal outcomes for biofortification projects.
@highlight The plastidial proteome is a key to understanding the sequestration and storage of carotenoids.
@highlight Attenuating the activity of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases and lipoxygenases enzymes that drive carotenoid turnover can improve carotenoid retention. Increasing the vitamin E content of crops may have a similar effect.
@highlight Carotenoids are often found esterified to fatty acids. This process increases carotenoid sequestration accumulation and stability and may be a novel target for future biofortification projects.
