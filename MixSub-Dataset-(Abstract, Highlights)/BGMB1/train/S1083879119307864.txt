 Polyphenols are a group of chemical substances found in plants with immunomodulatory antiproliferative and anti inflammatory properties that might be useful in the prophylaxis and treatment of graft versus host disease . Polyphenolic extract obtained from extra virgin olive oil decreased the activation and proliferation of activated T cells . In addition a decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines was observed upon exposure to PE . Western blot assays showed a marked inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF B in activated T cells . In a murine model of acute GVHD we observed that mice that received a diet supplemented in PE presented a higher survival rate and lower risk of developing GVHD when compared with the group that received a control diet . Histopathologic examination showed a significantly lower gut involvement in mice receiving PE with a decrease in proinflammatory cytokines in serum and the reestablishment of butyrate concentration in the gut . In conclusion PE obtained from EVOO exerted a potent immunomodulatory effect reducing the activation and proliferation of activated T cells and the production of proinflammatory cytokines . In a murine model of acute GVHD a PE supplemented diet reduced the incidence and severity of the disease and increased survival after transplantation .

@highlight Polyphenolic extract PE decreased activation IL 2 and TNF secretion and AKT P and NF B in T cells.
@highlight A PE supplemented diet decreased acute graft versus host disease risk and improved survival in a mice model.
@highlight A decrease in IL 2 IL 17 and TNF secretion was observed among mice receiving PE.
@highlight Feces butyrate concentration was higher in mice receiving PE after transplantation.
