@highlight Biosynthesis of lycopene from metabolically engineered
@highlight Capable of using free fatty acids or waste cooking oil to improve lycopene yield.
@highlight Co feeding with glucose and waste cooking oil to produce 2.7g L lycopene in 40h.
@highlight Lycopene content in biomass 94mg g is among the highest levels reported so far.
