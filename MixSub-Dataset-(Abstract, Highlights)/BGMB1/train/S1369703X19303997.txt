 In modern aquaculture simple and rapid methods of predicting fish ovulation are needed to produce seedlings in a stable and efficient manner . Ovulation time is variable due to environmental and physiological factors while 17 20 dihydroxy 4 pregnen 3 one an indicator of ovulation increases its concentration rapidly just before spawning . In this paper we developed a biosensor system in which immune and enzymatic reaction assays were combined to monitor DHP levels with low environmental loads . We attempted to quantify DHP by analyzing the decrease rate in the output current after the immunoreaction using the amperometric method as a transfer inhibition degree of the enzyme generated electrons generated by the formation of the antigen antibody complex . DHP standard samples were measured under investigated optimal conditions and a specific response with a good linear correlation was obtained between the current decrease rate of the sensor system and the DHP concentration in a range of 7.81500pg ml

@highlight An amperometry immunosensor was developed for simple and fast monitoring 17 20 dihydroxy 4 pregnen 3 one DHP .
@highlight The proposed sensor system is eco friendly because it used non toxic glucose as a source of sensor output.
@highlight The sensor system may help us to predict fish ovulation which can improve the efficiency of modern aquaculture industry.
