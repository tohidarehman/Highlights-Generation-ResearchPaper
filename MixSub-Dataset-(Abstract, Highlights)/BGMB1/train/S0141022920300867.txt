 Lignin peroxidase is a well recognized enzyme for its ability to oxidize lignins but its commercial availability is limited which hinders the biotechnological application of LiP based bioprocesses in lignocellulose biorefineries . This study evaluated a combination strategy to improve the expression of LiP to promote its practical use . The strategy included optimization of the
