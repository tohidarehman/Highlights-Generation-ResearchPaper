 Polyether wastewater from chemical industries is difficult to be degraded directly by microorganisms even at low concentration . The feasibilities and differences of using complex and single carbon sources as co metabolic substrates to acclimate activated sludge for enhancing treatment of low concentration polyether wastewater were comparatively analyzed . The complex carbon source was produced from citric acid production wastewater and the sodium acetate was selected as single carbon source . Results indicated that the LCPW could be effectively treated with acclimated activated sludge and satisfying the wastewater discharge standard . Importantly the activated sludge acclimated with CAPW presented larger biomass better treatment performance and higher extracellular polymeric substance content dehydrogenase activity and bacterial diversity than that acclimated with NaAc . Moreover high throughput sequencing revealed that the relative abundance of dominant families associated with nutrient removal in AS CAPW or AS NaAc e.g .

@highlight Efficient biological treatment of LCPW was achieved.
@highlight LCPW effluent after treatment by acclimated activated sludge can meet standard.
@highlight Activated sludge acclimated by CAPW showed good EPS content and dehydrogenase activity.
@highlight Higher bacterial diversity acclimated by CAPW led to efficient LCPW treatment.
