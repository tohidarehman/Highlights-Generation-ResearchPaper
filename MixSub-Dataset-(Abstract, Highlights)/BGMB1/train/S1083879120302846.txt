 We report the outcomes of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for 52 patients with Shwachman Diamond syndrome who underwent transplantation between 2000 and 2017 . The median age at transplantation was 11 years and the median duration of follow up was 60 months . The indication for HSCT was bone marrow failure in 39 patients and myelodysplasia acute myelogenous leukemia in 13 patients . The donor type was an HLA matched sibling for 18 patients an HLA matched or mismatched relative for 6 patients and an HLA matched or mismatched unrelated donor for 28 patients . Preparative regimens for BMF were myeloablative in 13 patients and reduced intensity in 26 . At the time of this report 29 of the 39 patients with BMF were alive and the 5 year overall survival was 72 . Graft failure and graft versus host disease were the predominant causes of death . Preparative regimens for patients with MDS AML were myeloablative in 8 and reduced intensity in 5 . At the time of this report only 2 of 13 patients were alive with relapse the predominant cause of death . Survival after transplantation for SDS related BMF is better compared with historical reports but strategies are needed to overcome graft failure and graft versus host disease . For SDS related MDS or AML transplantation does not extend survival . Rigorous surveillance and novel treatments for leukemia are urgently needed .

@highlight The 5 year survival of 72 after transplantation for Shwachman Diamond syndrome SDS related bone marrow failure is superior to historical reports.
@highlight Transplantation for SDS related myelodysplasia MDS or acute myelogenous leukemia AML does not extend survival.
@highlight A standardized approach to screening may identify patients for transplantation before the onset of MDS or AML.
