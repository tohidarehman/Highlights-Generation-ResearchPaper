 protein refolding is a major rate limiting step in the large scale production of antibody fragments expressed using a microbial source like

@highlight Fab refolding follows a three state folding mechanism.
@highlight No significant variation in free energy change for Fab unfolding at 15 30 C.
@highlight The intermediate formation is an overall rate limiting step in Fab refolding.
@highlight Inter domain disulfide bond formation critically depends upon temperature.
@highlight Designed a kinetic reaction model for scalable Fab refolding.
