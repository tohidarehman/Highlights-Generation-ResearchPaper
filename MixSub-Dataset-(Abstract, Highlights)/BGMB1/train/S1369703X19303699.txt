 Lipid degradation behavior was examined during the Intermittent Contact Oxidation Process for application in in sewer purification . Lipids are known to accumulate in the sewer environment making the study of its degradation behavior relevant for in sewer purification . Changes in the lipid substrate during various flow conditions and the subsequent effect of these transformation on the performance of a channel incorporating ICOP were focused on . Biomass was first developed for 84 days in three types of sponges . Oxygen consumption rates indicative of aerobic lipid degradation were then observed during three flow conditions which were extended no flow condition frequent flow condition and a combination of extended no flow and frequent flow condition . Oxygen consumption rates decreased over time during extended no flow condition while they were generally similar during frequent flow condition for all sponge types . Lipid samples analyzed after treatment revealed that intermittent flow affected the composition of residual free fatty acid species . Overall the study provides insights on the effect of flow intermittency on lipid degradation behavior during the application of the ICOP for in sewer purification .

@highlight Lipid degradation occurred during no flow and was enhanced during frequent flow.
@highlight Oxygen mass transfer was enhanced during flow.
@highlight Oxygen mass transfer during no flow was affected by retained water volume in the porous media.
@highlight Oxygen supply affected by flow intermittency affected lipid degradation behavior.
