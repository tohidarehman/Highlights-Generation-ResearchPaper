 Oncogenic human papilloma viruses are the cause of various types of cancer specifically cervical cancer . L1 protein is the main protein of HPV capsid which targeted in many vaccine producing attempts . However they have not enough coverage on the various high risk HPV types . Therefore having a low cost potent HPV vaccine to protect against all members of the papillomaviridea family will be promising . In this study L1 protein based peptide vaccine was designed using immunoinformatics methods which provides physicochemical properties such as stability in room temperature potential of antigenicity non allergic properties and no requirement with eukaryotic host system . The designed vaccine has two HPV conserved epitopes with lengths 18 and 27 amino acids in all members of papillomaviridea . These peptides promote humoral and cellular immunity and INF responses . In order to ensure strong induction of immune responses Flagellin a Toll like receptor 5 agonist and a short synthetic toll like receptor 4 agonist were also joined to the epitopes . Structure of the designed vaccine was validated using Rampage and ERRAT and a high quality 3D structure of the vaccine protein was provided . Docking studies demonstrated an appropriate and stable interaction between the vaccine and TLR 5 . The vaccine is expected to have a high quality structure and suitable properties including high stability solubility and a high potential to be expressed in

@highlight The vaccine consists of four major sections toll like receptor 4 adjuvant toll like receptor 5 adjuvant and two epitopes.
@highlight Each section was joined together by appropriate linkers.
@highlight Different strategies were applied to enhance immunogenicity of peptide vaccine.
@highlight The vaccine is able to protection of population on all members of papillomaviridea family.
@highlight The vaccine has a high quality structure and appropriate physicochemical properties in E. coli as host.
