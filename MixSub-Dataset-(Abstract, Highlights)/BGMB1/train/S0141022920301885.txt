 A robust biocatalyst for green Henry reaction was achieved . Based on the fact that Henry reaction requires a base for proton transfer we firstly proposed that the catalytic triad of lipase could play this role . The distance between the substrate and the catalytic center and the surrounding amino acid interaction network were used as the criterion . Benzaldehyde and nitromethane were used as the model reaction

@highlight For the first time proposed the possible mechanism of lipase catalyzed Henry reaction.
@highlight Simplify the screening process of lipase catalyzing Henry reaction.
@highlight Using molecular dynamics simulation to guide experiments for explaining catalytic mechanism.
@highlight The chemical modifiers suitable for RNL catalyzed Henry reaction were selected and the yield reached 99 .
