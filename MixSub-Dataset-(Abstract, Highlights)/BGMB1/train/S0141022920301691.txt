 In this study polymer ceramic nanocomposites and or composites were prepared by solution removal method using poly and nano hydroxyapatite . They were characterized using X ray diffraction Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection spectroscopy and differential thermal analysis thermogravimetry . Their effects and biocompatibilities on antioxidant enzymes were also investigated in detail . It has been shown that nHA was dramatically dispersed at nanoscale in the polymer matrix . The interaction occurred between

@highlight PMMA nHA bionanocomposites were synthesized characterized and investigated the interactions with the antioxidant enzymes.
@highlight Samples synthesized in acetone increased GR and G6PD activities while inhibiting GSH Px and CAT activities.
@highlight Samples synthesized in THF inhibited G6PD and CAT activites.
@highlight Materials synthesized in acetone were more hemocompatible than those synthesized in THF.
