 The significant advancements made in the field of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have ensured increased longevity in transplant recipients . However they do have late effects that may adversely affect the endocrine system bone health and body composition . This study was undertaken to evaluate bone mineral density trabecular bone score and body composition in recipients of allo HSCT and compare them with age sex and body mass index matched controls . This was a cross sectional study done in 63 cases and 65 matched controls . The mean femoral neck BMD was found to be lower in cases than in controls versus 0.846 g cm

@highlight The mean femoral neck bone mineral density BMD was lower in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
@highlight Myeloablative conditioning had an adverse effect on BMD at the femoral neck.
@highlight Lumbar spine BMD was lower in the group that received total body irradiation.
@highlight The prevalence of sarcopenia was significantly higher in cases than in controls.
@highlight Calcium and vitamin D supplements are recommended in these patients.
@highlight Consider graded strength training exercises to build muscle mass.
