 Nitrifying biomass immobilized in a gel has been applied in wastewater treatment as immobilization results in a high bacterial cell density in the reactor and facilitates easy solidliquid separation in the settling tank . Herein the diffusivity reaction rate and concentration profile of oxygen in a spherical gel entrapping ammonia oxidizing bacteria were investigated . Calcium alginate gel and 2 2 bisphenyl propane gel were used as models to prepare millimeter sized spherical gels . A novel method involving controlled oxygen transfer into out of the spherical gel with alternative flow of air and N
