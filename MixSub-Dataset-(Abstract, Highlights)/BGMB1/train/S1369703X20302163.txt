 The flexible loops or domains have been widely regarded to be involved in the catalytic modulation substrate recognition or thermal stability of enzymes . However in AGE superfamily the relationship of flexible loop and the tryptophan residue with catalytic direction and substrate specificity was still a mystery . In order to uncover this the specific structures of cellobiose 2 epimerase flexible loop and Trp372 were grafted into the mannose isomerase to generate a new recombinant protein named CMW . As a result CMW showed no isomerization activity to monosaccharide mannose but displayed epimerization and isomerization activity toward disaccharide indicating that the CMW got close to CE but stepped far away from MI . These results demonstrated that the flexible loop and Trp372 were two key factors in determining the catalytic direction and substrate specificity . Combining the computational calculation and the structural analysis it was speculated that the
