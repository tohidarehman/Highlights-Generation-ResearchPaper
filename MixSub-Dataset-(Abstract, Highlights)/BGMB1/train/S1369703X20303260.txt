 A label free electrochemical biosensor was developed for the rapid detection of the matrix metalloproteinase 9 biomarker on the basis of antibody immobilizing on the zinc oxide nanoparticle and ZnO nanorod electrodes . The charge transfer resistance R

@highlight Label free electrochemical biosensor was developed for rapid detection of MMP 9.
@highlight The ZnO nanorod based biosensor exhibited linear behavior in MMP 9 concentration range.
@highlight The performance was comparable to those of commercial ELISA for real serum samples.
@highlight It is a viable alternative to the current methods with a much shorter detection time.
