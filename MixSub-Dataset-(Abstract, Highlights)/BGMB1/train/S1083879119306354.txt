 The Predicted Indirectly Recognizable HLA Epitopes score quantifies the number of PIRCHEs in patient donor pairs and represents an in silico measure of indirect alloreactivity . This biologic process is defined as T cell recognition of epitopes derived from mismatched allogeneic HLA peptides that are subsequently presented by shared HLA molecules . Its association with clinical outcome has not been examined in haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation with post transplantation cyclophosphamide . We hypothesized that the PIRCHE score would correlate with indirect alloreactivity and predict graft versus host disease risk and the incidence of relapse after haplo HCT with PTCy . We retrospectively analyzed 148 patients who underwent peripheral blood stem cell T cell replete haplo HCT with PTCy at a single center between 2009 and 2016 . For each patient donor pair the PS was calculated using the PIRCHE online matching tool . PSs were categorized by class and vector . The median class I graft versus host PS was 11 and the median class I host versus graft PS was 10 . Class I GVH PS was associated with increased risk of grade II IV acute GVHD adjusted hazard ratio 1.03 per PS unit increase 95 confidence interval 1.01 to 1.05
