 Post transplant cyclophosphamide has significantly increased the successful use of haploidentical donors with a relatively low incidence of graft versus host disease . Given its increasing use we sought to determine risk factors for GVHD after haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation using PTCy . Data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research on adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myeloid leukemia who underwent PTCy based haplo HCT were analyzed and categorized into 4 groups based on myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning and bone marrow or peripheral blood graft source . In total 646 patients were identified . The incidence of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD at 6 months was highest in MA PB followed by RIC PB MA BM and RIC BM

@highlight In haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant with post transplant cyclophosphamide conditioning intensity and graft source impact graft versus host disease GVHD .
@highlight In reduced intensity conditioning peripheral blood compared to bone marrow is significantly associated with chronic GVHD.
@highlight Older donor age is associated with higher risk of acute GVHD and nonrelapse mortality.
