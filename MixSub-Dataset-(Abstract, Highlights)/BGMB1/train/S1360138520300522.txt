 Nighttime warming poses a threat to global food security as it is driving yield declines worldwide but our understanding of the physiological basis of this phenomenon remains very limited . Furthermore it is often assumed that such declines are driven solely by increases in nighttime temperature T

@highlight Nighttime warming is reducing crop yields worldwide threatening global food security.
@highlight This phenomenon is more complex than may be assumed likely to involve interaction between two driving forces nighttime temperature and evaporative demand.
@highlight The two conspire to limit carbon availability for yield and end use quality traits while decreasing water use efficiency potentially enhancing vulnerability to droughts.
@highlight An ecophysiological framework is proposed as a guide to implement future research efforts to mitigate yield declines.
@highlight Such efforts should integrate physiology with crop modeling breeding and management to identify sustainable pathways for mitigation as climate change intensifies.
