 Almost one half of patients developing graft versus host disease will not respond to standard first line steroid treatment . Alpha 1 antitrypsin is able to induce tolerance in preclinical models of GVHD . AAT alters the cytokine milieu promotes a tolerogenic shift of dendritic cells and skews effector T cells toward regulatory T cells . Gastrointestinal steroid refractory GVHD is a protein losing enteropathy that might represent the optimal setting in which to use AAT . Here we analyze the outcomes of 16 patients treated with human derived AAT in advanced stage gut SR GVHD with two thirds of the patients having failed at least 1 treatment for SR GVHD . The overall response rate was 44 with a complete response rate of 27 . Gastrointestinal response was observed in 61 of patients . The median time to best response was 21 days . At day 56 after AAT treatment all CRs were maintained and the ORR was 39 . The 1 year overall survival was 48 . Ancillary studies showed that AAT serum levels were in the normal range at the beginning of treatment whereas fecal loss was elevated . AAT levels consistently rose after exogenous administration but no correlation was found between serum levels and response . REG3 and IL 33 levels were associated with response while in contrast to previous reports regulatory T cells decreased during AAT treatment . This retrospective analysis supports a previous report of AAT as a promising agent in the management of gut SR GVHD and should prompt its evaluation at an earlier stage .

@highlight Steroid refractory SR gastrointestinal graft versus host disease GVHD has a dismal outcome.
@highlight Gastrointestinal GVHD is a protein losing enteropathy with fecal loss of alpha 1 antitrypsin AAT .
@highlight AAT has tolerogenic immunomodulatory and anti inflammatory properties.
@highlight AAT administration was safe and effective in a cohort of high risk SR GVHD patients.
