 The microbial pathway of butanol biosynthesis is a unique route for the production of a biomass derived advanced biofuel with high potential to be utilized in place of the fossil fuels . In the present study

@highlight and
@highlight co culture was used for ABE production from starch.
@highlight has significant amylase activity leading to higher starch intake rate in process.
@highlight Butanol was efficiently produced under aerobic conditions.
@highlight VFAs formed by
@highlight were reassimilated by
@highlight for ABE.
@highlight Process parameters were optimized for higher ABE production.
