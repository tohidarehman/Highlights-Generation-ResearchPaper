 The fixed bed ion exchange column was proven to be an efficient method in the simultaneous fermentation and separation process for various organic acids and was used in my work to explore fumaric acid production process . The adsorption and desorption processes were investigated using D201 resin in the column . NaHCO

@highlight The adsorption and desorption conditions were investigated using D201 resin in the column.
@highlight HCO
@highlight was selected as ion form of resin with higher adsorption percentage 76.44 .
@highlight Extra neutralizers were avoided using HCO
@highlight as ion form of resin.
@highlight The yield of fumaric acid in simultaneous fermentation and separation process reached 17.53g L.
