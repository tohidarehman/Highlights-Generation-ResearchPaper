 Common respiratory viral infections frequently complicate hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . We conducted a retrospective single center observational cohort study to determine the incidence of CRVI in patients who received an allogeneic or autologous HSCT at the Royal Adelaide Hospital between 2009 and 2017 . The median follow up was 8.9 and 4.5 years for auto and allo HSCT recipients respectively . There were 149 CRVI episodes in 74 patients with rhinovirus being the most commonly isolated virus . The majority of CRVIs occurred more than 100 days post HSCT and 67 were diagnosed in the outpatient setting . There was evidence of lower respiratory tract infection in 45.6 of CRVIs . On multivariate logistic regression analysis coviral infections and cytomegalovirus viremia were independent risk factors for progression of CRVI to LRTI . Ten CRVI episodes resulted in admission to intensive care for ventilatory support and 8 patients died within 30 days of CRVI diagnosis . In our study 10.4 of HSCT recipients experienced a CRVI post transplant primarily causing late morbidity and potentially mortality . Prevention with strict infection control practices vaccination and patient education is essential .

@highlight Of HSCT recipients 10.4 experienced common respiratory viral infections CRVIs .
@highlight Rhinovirus infection was common accounting for nearly 50 of CRVIs.
@highlight Of CRVIs 45.6 were complicated by lower respiratory tract infection LRTI .
@highlight Respiratory viral coinfection and cytomegalovirus viremia were risk factors for LRTI.
@highlight Of CRVI episodes 6.7 resulted in intensive care admission.
