 Autologous stem cell transplantation remains the standard of care for transplantation eligible patients with multiple myeloma . Bortezomib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone is the most common triplet regimen for newly diagnosed MM in the United States . Carfilzomib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone has shown promising efficacy and may supplant VRD . We compared stem cell yields and autograft minimal residual disease negativity after VRD and KRD induction . Deeper responses were more common with KRD . Precollection bone marrow cellularity interval from the end of induction therapy to start of stem cell collection and method of stem cell mobilization were similar for the 2 cohorts . Days to complete collection was greater with KRD which more often required 3 days of apheresis . Precollection viable CD34

@highlight Bortezomib Velcade lenalidomide Revlimid and dexamethasone VRD and carfilzomib Kyprolis Revlimid and dexamethasone KRD are effective regimens for multiple myeloma.
@highlight Deeper responses ie very good partial response or better are more common with KRD.
@highlight Stem cell collection yields are higher with VRD than with KRD.
@highlight Differences in stem cell yields between VRD and KRD are associated with Revlimid exposure.
@highlight Stem cell autograft minimal residual disease negativity is higher with KRD than with VRD.
