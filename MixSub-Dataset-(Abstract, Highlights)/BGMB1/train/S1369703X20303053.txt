 Metabolically regulated transgenic rice cell suspension culture has been developed aiming to be an efficient and cost effective platform for production of rice recombinant butyrylcholinesterase that could be used as a bioscavenger enzyme against organophosphate nerve agents . In two stage batch cultures switching between growth and induction phases by exchanging media the maximum active rrBChE levels were comparable among the bioreactor runs with controlled dissolved oxygen concentrations from 1040 DO and without controlled DO at constant aeration rate . For a single stage batch operation with no media exchange at 40 DO production of rrBChE is triggered simply through sugar depletion due to the uptake of sugar by the cells showing similar maximum active cell associated rrBChE level compared to two stage batch operations . However the bioreactor process using uncontrolled DO no media exchange and half concentration of sucrose resulted in a 1.4 fold increase in the maximum total active rrBChE and 1.6 fold increase of total active rrBChE specific productivity

@highlight No substantial effect of dissolved oxygen on butyrylcholinesterase production.
@highlight Single stage operation can replace the conventional two stage operation.
@highlight Strategic simplification of bioreactor process improves butyrylcholinesterase productivity.
