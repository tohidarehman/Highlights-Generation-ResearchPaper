 Granulocyte colony stimulating factor is administered after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation to aid neutrophil recovery . We compared the effect of empiric G CSF administration on the duration of index inpatient hospitalization stay after HCT for patients aged 18 years with a hematologic malignancy . G CSF was considered empiric if administered between day 3 and day 6 in relation to graft infusion . We studied 3562 HCTs between 2007 and 2016 . Three hundred and thirteen recipients of HLA matched sibling donor HCT and 417 recipients of HLA matched unrelated donor HCT received empiric G CSF therapy . The effect of G CSF therapy on the index hospitalization stay was examined in generalized linear models with adjustment for other patient disease and transplantation characteristics and acute graft versus host disease and infection post transplantation . The duration of index hospitalization by treatment group did not differ for HLA matched sibling donor HCT but was shorter with G CSF for HLA matched unrelated donor HCT 15 days versus 19 days

@highlight Empiric granulocyte colony stimulating factor G CSF therapy shortens the duration of in patient stay after HLA matched unrelated donor transplantation.
@highlight Empiric G CSF therapy does not shorten the duration of in patient stay after HLA matched sibling transplantation.
@highlight Empiric G CSF therapy is not associated with early survival.
