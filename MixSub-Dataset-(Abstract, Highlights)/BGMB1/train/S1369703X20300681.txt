 Black odorous water contains abundant organics and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus which would lead to eutrophication of the water body and affect the water environment . In this study the eutrophic water body in the campus landscape was taken as the research object and the biological contact oxidation method and co cultivated indigenous microorganisms were adopted to pretreat black odorous water . Inoculating mutant strain M1 through ultraviolet B radiation formed algae bacteria symbiosis system in optimal effluent . The results showed that under the conditions of dissolved oxygen concentration of 5mg L light intensity of 3000 Lx and inoculum size of 125 000 cells mL the optimal organic migration effect was achieved by the combined process . In addition the ability of

@highlight Microalgae enhancement was used to purify black odorous water.
@highlight The combination of the three processes demonstrated the better efficiency.
@highlight can be used as an indicator of monitoring the degradation of nutrients.
