 Hormesis is a biphasic doseresponse relationship with contrasting effects of low versus high doses of stress . Hormesis is rapidly developing in plant science research and has wide implications for risk assessment stress biology and agriculture . Here we explore selected areas of importance to the concept of hormesis and suggest that hormesis is a highly generalizable phenomenon . We address the questions of whether hormesis occurs in high risk groups or in response to mixtures of stress inducing agents whether there is a single biological mechanism of hormesis and what the temporal features of hormesis are .

@highlight Hormesis occurs not only in normal but also in high and low risk subpopulation groups.
@highlight Some high risk subpopulation groups show different quantitative features of hormetic responses from normal and low risk subpopulation groups.
@highlight Some differences in hormetic dose responses exist between fast growing and slow growing individuals within populations.
@highlight Hormesis is widely induced by various mixtures of stress inducing agents in plants microbes and other life forms potentially interacting with plants.
@highlight No single biological mechanism of hormesis exists but some general mechanistic strategies can be suggested.
@highlight Chemical induced hormesis exhibits significant temporal variation with an initial increase of the maximum stimulation followed by a significant decline but maintained at biologically beneficial enhanced levels.
