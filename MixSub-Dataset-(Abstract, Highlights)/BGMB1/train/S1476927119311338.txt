 Hereditary Transthyretin associated amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant protein folding disorder with adult onset caused by mutation of transthyretin . TTR is characterized by extracellular deposition of amyloid leading to loss of autonomy and finally death . More than 100 distinct mutations in TTR

@highlight Hereditary Transthyretin associated amyloidosis ATTR caused by mutations in transthyretin TTR .
@highlight More than 100 distinct mutations in TTR protein are reported.
@highlight Pathogenic effect of TTR mutant remain unanswered in structural level.
@highlight Mutational effect in TTR concerning stability functionality and aggregation propensity were predicted.
@highlight A curated database TTRMDB is developed to provide free access of all the mutational data.
