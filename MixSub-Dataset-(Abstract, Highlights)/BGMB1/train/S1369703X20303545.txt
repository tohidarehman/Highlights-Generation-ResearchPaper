 Microbial Electrolysis Cells are often documented for their ability to produce hydrogen through new sources and new configurations . However few studies attempt to document the recovery of the bioanode after being exposed to operational failure conditions . This study attempted to compare the behavior and recovery of MECs after being exposed to four operational failure conditions acidification aeration osmotic shock and voltage reversal . For each failure condition three time points were tested before failure immediately after failure and after recovery efforts . Of the modes tested acidification caused the largest loss in performance and operational efficiency while osmotic shock caused the second largest loss in performance . Aeration and voltage reversal caused negligible losses in performance immediately after failure conditions and after the recovery period . Aeration and voltage reversal had a minimal effect on the removal of individual compounds . However acetate accumulated after acidification and propionic acid accumulated after osmotic shock . These findings could be useful for determining if failure will require more significant repair efforts in commercially deployed devices . While acidification created permanent losses to performance if device failures like aeration osmotic shock and voltage reversal are caught early full recovery without bioanode replacement is likely .

@highlight Microbial Electrolysis Cells were exposed to four anode failure conditions.
@highlight Performance shortly after exposure and after recovery efforts were documented.
@highlight Acidification caused irreversible damage to reactor performance.
@highlight Osmotic shock caused losses in performance but was fully reversible.
@highlight Aeration and voltage reversal caused negligible losses to performance.
