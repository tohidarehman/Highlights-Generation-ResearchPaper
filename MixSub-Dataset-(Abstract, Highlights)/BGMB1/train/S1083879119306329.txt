 Almost comparable transplantation outcomes have been reported with HLA matched unrelated donor transplantation and cord blood transplantation . We conducted a prospective phase 2 study to assess the efficacy and safety of single unit myeloablative CBT in adult leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome . Because the day 180 survival of UDT was approximately 80 we determined the alternative hypothesis of expected day 180 survival with a successful engraftment rate of 80 and set the null hypothesis of threshold rate at 65 . Sixty two patients were registered including 28 with acute myelogenous leukemia 25 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 9 with myelodysplastic syndrome . Of 61 eligible patients 52 were successfully engrafted and survived at day 180 . Single unit CBT was judged to be effective because the null hypothesis was rejected

@highlight We conducted a phase 2 single arm prospective study of cord blood transplantation CBT .
@highlight We assessed the efficacy of CBT for treating patients with adult acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.
@highlight CBT showed significantly better day 180 overall survival than threshold survival.
@highlight CBT outcomes are comparable to historical unrelated donor transplantation in adults with low comorbidity.
@highlight Patients with high risk features in complete response status may benefit from early CBT.
