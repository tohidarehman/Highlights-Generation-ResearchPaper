 Despite a well established risk of chronic kidney disease after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant the benefits of using nephrotoxic anti infective agents to treat serious peritransplant infections often outweigh this risk . While there is no consensus on the optimal management of post allo HCT human herpes virus 6 reactivation the nephrotoxic drug foscarnet is often used although its long term impact on renal function has not been established . We retrospectively reviewed 987 adult patients who underwent transplantation between 2002 and 2016 of whom 45.3 were exposed to foscarnet . The most frequent indications for foscarnet treatment were cytomegalovirus and HHV6 . In the first 3 months post transplant patients exposed versus unexposed had similar rates of acute kidney injury and acute kidney failure 61.6 versus 58.7

@highlight This was a retrospective study evaluating the impact of foscarnet on long term renal function after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant allo HCT .
@highlight Acute kidney injury is observed in most patients but is partially reversible.
@highlight Foscarnet administration results in chronic irreversible kidney injury.
@highlight Foscarnet should be used judiciously following allo HCT due to the lasting negative impact on renal function.
