 The newly developed 6 hydroxychromanol derivate SUL 109 was shown to provide protection during hypothermic storage of several cell lines but has not been evaluated in hematopoietic stem cells . Hypothermic preservation of HSCs would be preferred over short term cryopreservation to prevent cell loss during freezing thawing and would be particularly useful for short term storage such as during conditioning of patients or transport of HSC transplants . Here we cultured human CD34

@highlight SUL 109 a newly developed 6 chromanol derivate is an easy to use nontoxic cell culture additive that provides protection during hypothermic storage of hematopoietic stem cells HSCs .
