 Our current knowledge of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome predates improved specificity in the diagnosis of IPS and advances in hematopoietic cell transplantation and critical care practices . In this study we describe and update the incidence risk factors and outcomes of IPS . We performed a retrospective cohort study of all adults who underwent allogeneic HCT at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center between 2006 and 2013 . IPS was defined using the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute consensus definition multilobar airspace opacities on chest imaging absence of lower respiratory tract infection and hypoxemia . We described IPS incidence and mortality within 120 and 365 days after HCT . We examined conditioning intensity versus myeloablative with low dose TBI as an IPS risk factor in a time to event analysis using Cox models controlled for age at transplant HLA matching stem cell source and pretransplant Lung function Score a combined measure of impairment in Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second FEV

@highlight The incidence of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome IPS is declining in a modern cohort of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT recipients.
@highlight Total body irradiation dose remains a significant risk factor for IPS development.
@highlight IPS is a rare but substantial cause of post HCT morbidity and mortality.
