 Anti thymocyte globulin is an established approach to decrease chronic GVHD yet the exact mechanism is uncertain . To better understand the mechanism of action of ATG in preventing cGVHD we evaluated the day 100 immune reconstitution of known cGVHD cellular biomarkers using patients from the randomized Canadian Bone Marrow Transplant Group 0801 trial which demonstrated a significant impact of ATG on cGVHD . In a separate companion biology study we evaluated the impact of ATG prophylaxis on cGVHD cellular markers at day 100 in 40 CBMTG 0801 patients . Analysis focused on previously identified cGVHD cellular biomarkers including naive helper T cells recent thymic emigrant Th cells CD21

@highlight Chronic graft versus host disease cGVHD marker utilization in clinical trials can elucidate the mechanisms of action.
@highlight Anti thymocyte globulin ATG suppresses naive Th cell populations and expansion of CD56
@highlight natural killer cells.
@highlight ATG primarily impacts on cGVHD through suppression of naive Th cells.
