 2 3 Dihydroxyisovalerate is an intermediate of the valine synthesis pathway . However neither natural microorganisms nor valine producing engineered strains have been reported yet to produce this chemical . Based on the 2 3 butanediol synthesis pathway a biological route of 2 3 dihydroxyisovalerate production was developed using a

@highlight was set up.
@highlight disrupted strain exhibited 2 3 dihydroxyisovalerate producing ability.
@highlight Disruption of
@highlight further increased 2 3 dihydroxyisovalerate level.
@highlight 31.2g L of 2 3 Dihydroxyisovalerate was produced in fed batch fermentation.
