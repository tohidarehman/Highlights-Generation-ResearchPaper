 DegQ is a member of highly conserved htrA family proteins acting as a chaperone protease facilitating refolding or degradation of periplasmic misfolded proteins . In the current regulatory model of DegQ the resting state was inactive hexamers and they would reassemble into cage like polyhedrons to refold or degrade substrates . Here the characteristics of DegQ from

@highlight DegQ harbored both proteolytic activity and chaperone like activity.
@highlight Trimers of
@highlight DegQ possessed robust proteolytic activity as cage like polyhedrons.
@highlight Trimers suffered serious self degradation in degrading substrates while cage like polyhedrons were stable.
@highlight Chaperone activity of cage like polyhedrons was much higher than that of trimers.
