 In photosynthetic cells chloroplasts and mitochondria are the sites of the core redox reactions underpinning energy metabolism . Such reactions generate reactive oxygen species when oxygen is partially reduced . ROS signaling leads to responses by cells which enable them to adjust to changes in redox status . Recent studies in

@highlight The malate valve has long been proposed to release excess reducing equivalents from the chloroplast but mutants lacking the proposed key enzyme NADP dependent malate dehydrogenase show little impairment of chloroplast function suggesting the involvement of an alternative pathway.
@highlight New research suggests a central role for a malate valve employing chloroplast NAD dependent malate dehydrogenase which also has additional non enzymatic functions in chloroplast biogenesis.
@highlight The new malate circulation model proposes that malate exported from the chloroplast is oxidized in the mitochondrion triggering ROS production which can modulate growth and ultimately induce cell death.
@highlight It is proposed that the chloroplast to mitochondrion CTM pathway in conjunction with direct import of NAD
@highlight leads to elevated levels of NADH in the mitochondrion.
