 In this prospective randomized study we compared the outcomes of single unit umbilical cord blood transplantation and unmanipulated haploidentical stem cell transplantation with post transplantation cyclophosphamide in adults with hematologic malignancies . All patients received a myeloablative conditioning regimen consisting of thiotepa busulfan and fludarabine with antithymocyte globulin added for UCBT recipients . Nineteen patients were randomized to UCBT and the other 26 to haplo HSCT . Four patients allocated to the haplo HSCT arm lacked a suitable donor and were crossed over to the UCBT arm . Finally 23 underwent UCBT and 22 underwent haplo HSCT . The cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery was 87 at a median of 19 days in the UCBT arm versus 100 at a median of 17 days in the haplo SCT arm

@highlight Myeloablative haploidentical stem cell transplantation with post transplantation cyclophosphamide provides improved outcomes compared with antithymocyte globulin containing single unit umbilical cord blood transplantation.
@highlight Some 15 of patients lacked an appropriate haploidentical donor.
