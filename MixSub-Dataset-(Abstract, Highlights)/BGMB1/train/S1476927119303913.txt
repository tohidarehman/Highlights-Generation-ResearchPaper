 Protein Protein Interaction Network analysis unveils molecular level mechanisms involved in disease condition . To explore the complex regulatory mechanisms behind epilepsy and to address the clinical and biological issues of epilepsy

@highlight The result revealed eight pivotal genes like DNM1 CCND1 ITPR1 HRAS SRC BRAF CREBBP SPTAN1 present in epilepsy.
@highlight This study identified pathways like PI3 kinase VEGF CCKR Ras PDGF Integrin Wnt TGF beta EGF receptor signaling etc.
@highlight Functional enrichment analysis discloses critical tasks during neuron excitation as a dominating function in epileptic state.
@highlight Validation of key epileptic genes linked up pathways are investigated using clinical level results and Gene Ontology GO .
