 Immune checkpoint inhibitors are approved in relapsed classic Hodgkin lymphoma . The safety and effectiveness of allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation in ICI pretreated patients with cHL remain unclear . The aim of this study is to assess outcomes of patients with cHL receiving ICIs before alloBMT using post transplantation cyclophosphamide graft versus host disease prophylaxis . We performed a retrospective study of relapsed refractory patients with cHL undergoing alloBMT with PTCy at Johns Hopkins between November 2004 and September 2019 . Engraftment GVHD incidence nonrelapse mortality progression free survival and overall survival were compared between patients receiving pre alloBMT ICI or standard salvage chemotherapy . We identified 105 consecutive relapsed refractory patients with cHL of whom 37 received ICIs and 68 received chemotherapy without ICIs before alloBMT . ICI and no ICI patients experienced a 3 year estimated OS of 94 versus 78 0.35 95 confidence interval 0.08 to 1.56 ICIs do not increase acute or chronic GVHD incidence compared with salvage chemotherapy . Patients with cHL receiving ICIs prior to alloBMT experienced outstanding PFS and OS . Thus ICI therapy is safe in patients with cHL when undergoing alloBMT with PTCy and may improve post alloBMT disease progression and survival .

@highlight Immune checkpoint inhibition ICI before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation alloBMT does not increase risk of graft versus host disease in patients receiving post transplantation cyclophosphamide PTCy .
@highlight ICI therapy before alloBMT with PTCy in patients with classic Hodgkin lymphoma may improve disease progression and survival compared with salvage chemotherapy before alloBMT.
