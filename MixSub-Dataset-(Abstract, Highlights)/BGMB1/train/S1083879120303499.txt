 The negative impact of iron overload on outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is well recognized but its impact on umbilical cord blood transplant outcome is unknown . We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of 150 patients who received UCB HCT at our institution stratified by pre HCT serum ferritin level of 2000 ng mL . Two year overall survival rate among patients with SF 2000 and 2000 ng mL was 26.1 and 52.1 respectively hazard ratio 2.26 95 CI 1.28 to 4.00

@highlight Impact of iron overload serum ferritin SF 2000 ng mL on umbilical cord blood hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT outcomes was examined.
@highlight Overall survival rate at 2 years was significantly lower in patients with higher pre HCT SF levels 
@highlight  .005 .
@highlight Nonrelapse mortality was significantly higher in patients with higher SF 
@highlight  .02 .
@highlight Significantly faster engraftment was seen in patients with lower SF levels.
@highlight Iron overload is a strong adverse prognostic factor for cord blood transplant.
