 Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is a well recognized and potentially life threatening complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . SOS arises from endothelial cell damage and hepatocellular injury mostly due to the transplantation conditioning regimens but also to other patient disease and treatment related factors . Understanding risk factors associated with the development of SOS is critical for early initiation of treatment or prophylaxis . The knowledge about genetic contribution is limited few studies investigated so far selected a set of genes . To get more comprehensive insight in the genetic component we performed an exome wide association study using genetic variants derived from whole exome sequencing . The analyses were performed in a discovery cohort composed of 87 pediatric patients undergoing HSCT following a busulfan containing conditioning regimen . Eight lead single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified after correction for multiple testing and subsequently analyzed in a validation cohort . Three SNPs were successfully replicated including rs17146905
