 Biocatalytic oxidations mediated by laccases are gaining importance due to their versatility and beneficial environmental effects . In this study the oxidation of 1 4 dihydropyridines has been performed using three different types of bacterial laccase based catalysts purified laccase from

@highlight laccase and whole cells expressing it oxidized selected 1 4 dihydropyridines.
@highlight Whole cell biocatalyst was stable after 1 month storage at 4C.
@highlight Multicopper oxidase CueO from the expression host enhanced the oxidation activity.
@highlight Laccase based biocatalysts were immobilized on bacterial nanocellulose.
