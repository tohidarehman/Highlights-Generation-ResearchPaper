 We prepared phospholipid vesicles in continuous dilution from small phospholipid bilayer bicelles . As vesicles are useful as delivery carriers it is necessary to develop a method of continuous encapsulation . Bicelles are composed of long chain 1 2 dimyristoyl

@highlight Vesicle preparation method using discoidal bicelle membrane was introduced as a drug carrier preparation method.
@highlight Vesicles were prepared by serially diluting the bicelle.
@highlight Vesicles prepared from bicelles had membrane properties comparable to vesicles prepared by conventional methods.
@highlight With this method vesicles can be prepared continuously in aqueous solution.
