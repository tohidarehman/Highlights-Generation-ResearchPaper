 Flowering plants are the foundation of human civilization providing biomass for food fuel and materials to satisfy human needs dependent on fertile soil adequate water and favorable weather . Conversely failure of any of these inputs has caused catastrophes . Today human appropriation of biomass is threatening planetary boundaries inducing social and political unrest worldwide . Human societies are bound to rethink agriculture and forestry to restore and safeguard natural resources while improving the overall quality of life . Here we explore why and how . Through an evolutionary and quantitative analysis of agriculture and bridging plant and Earth sciences we anticipate the advent of a research and policy framework integrating plant science in all sectors the economy local and global governance and geopolitics .

@highlight Our civilization depends on a triad encompassing soil water and food biomass all of which ultimately depend on plants.
@highlight A retrospective view of evolution highlights unique attributes of flowering plants that allow the production of biomass that supports modern civilization.
@highlight Through excessive human appropriation of biomass while ignoring crucial plant needs for soil and water this renewable resource is becoming limiting and exhaustible.
@highlight Plant blindness remains pervasive and flowering plants are the forgotten item on the stakeholders menu even though plant biomass can be the main renewable solution in our finite world.
@highlight Agriculture in the 21st century needs long term resilience rather than short term performance.
