 We compared the incidence of refractory thrombocytopenia and platelet transfusion requirements in 35 children who developed veno occlusive disease with 35 matched control subjects who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant but did not develop VOD . RT developed in 100 of the VOD patients at a median of 8 days before VOD diagnosis as compared with 71.5 of the control group . VOD patients required more platelet transfusions than control subjects versus 3.57 mL kg respectively with a statistically significant difference

@highlight Refractory thrombocytopenia is a valid and early diagnostic criteria for VOD in children as included in the 2017 EBMT criteria.
@highlight RT occurs in 100 of the patients with VOD at a median of 8 days before VOD diagnosis.
@highlight Platelet transfusion requirements in VOD patients is higher than in the patients who do not develop VOD.
@highlight The positive predictive value of developing VOD was 89 in patients needing 7 mL kg day of platelets.
