 With increasing calls for improving terrestrial carbon sequestration and sustainable water use scientists are faced with the challenge of predicting changes in carbonwater relations from organisms to landscapes . We propose an integrative framework to help in answering basic and applied questions pertaining to coupled carbonwater functions in a variety of ecosystems . The conceptual framework is based on data from a globally representative set of ecosystems that hold vast amounts of carbon and provide water for rural and urban land uses . We focus on examples that demonstrate the value of an integrated approach that combines fast and slow changing state factors to improve predictions of carbonwater relations across scales .

@highlight There is a growing need for land use management and prioritization for optimal carbon gain and water conservation.
@highlight Interdisciplinary research will be necessary to better understand and improve the limits of carbon gain per water lost across scales.
@highlight A state factor approach inspired by soil and ecosystem science can be used to improve basic and applied knowledge of carbonwater relations.
