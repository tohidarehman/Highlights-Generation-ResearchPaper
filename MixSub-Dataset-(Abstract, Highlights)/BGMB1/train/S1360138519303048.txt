 Allelopathy is a biochemical interaction between plants in which a donor plant releases secondary metabolites allelochemicals that are detrimental to the growth of its neighbours . Traditionally considered as bilateral interactions between two plants allelopathy has recently emerged as a cross kingdom process that can influence and be modulated by the other organisms in the plants environment . Here we review the current knowledge on plantinterkingdom interactions with a particular focus on benzoxazinoids . We highlight how allelochemical producing plants influence not only their plant neighbours but also insects fungi and bacteria that live on or around them . We discuss challenges that need to be overcome to study chemical plantinterkingdom interactions and we propose experimental approaches to address how biotic and chemical processes impact plant health .

@highlight Plants make use of secondary metabolites to communicate with their environment. Allelopathic plants release secondary metabolites to gain a competitive advantage over other plants.
@highlight Grassy crops release benzoxazinoid compounds which impact plants animals and microbes.
@highlight Plantinterkingdom interactions in particular those with soil dwelling organisms are key factors in plant health and fitness.
@highlight Recent findings indicate that research on how allelopathic compounds modulate plant fitness in natural settings needs to integrate interkingdom interactions.
