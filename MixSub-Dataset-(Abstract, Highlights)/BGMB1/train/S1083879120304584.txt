 The use of myeloablative conditioning in umbilical cord blood transplantation has been associated with high nonrelapse mortality in patients aged 40 years especially those having a high HLA disparity thus limiting wider applications . We hypothesized that the NRM advantage of reduced intensity conditioning and higher graft versus leukemia effect associated with greater HLA disparities would expand its use for patients without compromising efficacy and compared outcomes between RIC and MAC regimens . In total 288 patients aged 40 to 60 years with de novo acute myeloid leukemia receiving UCBT with at least 2 HLA mismatches with RIC or MAC regimens were included . As compared to RIC the MAC cohort included relatively younger patients having received more single UCBT with lower total nucleated cell counts and more in vivo T cell depletion . Median time to neutrophil engraftment infections and grade II to IV acute and chronic graft versus host disease were similar in both groups . In the multivariate analysis overall survival 0.98

@highlight In HLA mismatched umbilical cord blood transplantation UCBT reduced intensity conditioning provided comparable results to myeloablative conditioning for patients with acute myeloid leukemia AML aged 40 to 60 years.
@highlight The main factor associated with poor outcomes after HLA mismatched UCBT was advanced disease status.
@highlight UCBT remains an alternative graft source for patients 40 to 60 years old with AML.
