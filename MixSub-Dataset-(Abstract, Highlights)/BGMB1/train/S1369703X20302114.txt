 2 5 Furandicarboxylic acid is one of the most important platform chemicals especially as a promising alternative to terephthalic acid . In this study a new and prospective tandem whole cell cascade composed of recombinant

@highlight The ability of
@highlight KT2440 to oxidize furanic aldehydes was investigated.
@highlight Whole cell of
@highlight M exhibited higher HMF conversion than
@highlight enzyme.
@highlight A whole cell cascade composed of
@highlight M and
@highlight KT2440 was constructed.
@highlight Improved biosynthesis of FDCA from HMF was realized by whole cell cascade.
@highlight The bioconversion rate was much faster than other reported biocatalysts.
