 At the subcellular level the cytoskeleton regulates cell structure organelle movement and cytoplasmic streaming . Autophagy is a process to remove unwanted biomaterials or damaged organelles through double membrane compartments known as autophagosomes . Autophagosome biogenesis requires vesicle trafficking between donor and acceptor compartments membrane expansion and fusion which is very likely to be regulated by the cytoskeleton . Recent studies have demonstrated that by knocking out key actin regulating proteins autophagosome biogenesis is inhibited . However the formation of ATG8 positive structures are not affected when the entire actin network is disrupted . Here we discuss this paradox and propose the function of the actin cytoskeleton in plant autophagy .

@highlight The actin network is regarded as the prevalent cytoskeleton system for subcellular membrane dynamics in plants.
@highlight Autophagosome biogenesis involves vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion both of which require a functional cytoskeleton network. In animal yeast and plant cells actin and actin associated proteins participate in the process of autophagosome formation at various stages.
@highlight Recent studies in plants have shown that mutation in components of the actin nucleator the ARP2 3 complex and two of its activators the SCAR WAVE complex and AtEH Pan1 significantly inhibit autophagosome formation and as a consequence mutant plants are more susceptible to stress conditions.
@highlight However chemically induced actin network depolymerization does not affect autophagosome formation suggesting that the actin network could be dispensable for bulk autophagy.
