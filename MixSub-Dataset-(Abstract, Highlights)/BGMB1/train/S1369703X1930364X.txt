 The expanding aquaculture industry increases the prices of fishmeal the main protein source in fish diet . A promising alternative is microalgal protein . Therefore we investigated the protein production capacities of green microalgae

@highlight Microalgal strains were optimized for protein production as alternative to fishmeal.
@highlight After optimization the maximum cultivation time of both strains was 2 days.
@highlight Maximum protein productivity for
@highlight CY1 was 0.8560.025g L d.
@highlight Maximum protein productivity for
@highlight ESP 31 was 0.9460.065g L d.
