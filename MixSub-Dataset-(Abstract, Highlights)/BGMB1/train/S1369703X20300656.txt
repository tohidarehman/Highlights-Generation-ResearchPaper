 This research aimed to demonstrate the significance of bioaugmentation in the mycoremediation of metals and metalloid polluted landfill soil using consortia of autochthonous filamentous fungi . The fungal consortia used were

@highlight Metal metalloid contamination of soil is a serious environmental problem.
@highlight Physicochemical properties of soil influence metal metalloid bioremediation.
@highlight Arsenic in the contaminated landfill soil is the most efficiently removed 77 .
@highlight Metal metalloid pollution can be treated via bioaugmentation with fungal consortia.
