 Hydroxy or ketone functionalized fatty acid methyl esters are important compounds for production of pharmaceuticals vitamins cosmetics or dietary supplements . Biocatalysis through enzymatic cascades has drawn attention to the efficient sustainable and greener synthetic processes . Furthermore whole cell catalysts offer important advantages such as cofactor regeneration by cell metabolism omission of protein purification steps and increased enzyme stability . Here we report the first whole cell catalysis employing an engineered P450 BM3 variant and cpADH5 coupled cascade reaction for the biosynthesis of hydroxy and keto FAMEs . Firstly P450 BM3 was engineered through the KnowVolution approach yielding P450 BM3 variant YE M1 2 which exhibited boosted performance toward methyl hexanoate . The initial oxidation rate of YE M1 2 toward methyl hexanoate was determined to be 23 fold higher than the wild type enzyme and a 1.5 fold increase in methyl 3 hydroxyhexanoate production was obtained . Subsequently the whole cell catalyst for the synthesis of methyl 3 hydroxyhexanoate and methyl 3 oxohexanoate was constructed by combining the engineered P450 BM3 and cpADH5 variants in an artificial operon . A 2.06mM total product formation was achieved by the whole cell catalyst including co expressed channel protein FhuA and co solvent addition . Moreover the generated whole cell biocatalyst also accepted methyl valerate methyl heptanoate as well as methyl octanoate as substrates and yielded 1 ketones as the main product .
