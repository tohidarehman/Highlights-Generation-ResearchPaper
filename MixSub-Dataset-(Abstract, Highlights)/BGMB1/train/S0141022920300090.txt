 Trehalose diesters are Gemini type surfactants that might have better surface activity than conventional surfactants . A one step method for the preparation of trehalose unsaturated fatty acid diesters has been successfully developed . The yield of trehalose diester of different unsaturated fatty acids was between 78 and 88 under optimal conditions 25mmol L trehalose 100mmol L unsaturated fatty acid 60g L 3 molecular sieves and 20g L lipase at 150rpm and 50C for 42h in 15mL of acetone . Additionally trehalose diester was the sole product obtained with Novozym 435 in acetone . The chemical structures of 6 6 di

@highlight A one step method for the preparation of trehalose diesters has been developed.
@highlight Trehalose diester was the sole product obtained with Novozym 435 only in acetone.
@highlight The highest yield of 88 of trehalose diester was attained under optimal conditions.
@highlight Trehalose diesters are gemini type surfactants with good emulsifying properties.
