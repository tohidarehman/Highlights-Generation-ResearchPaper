 Stearyl coenzyme A desaturase enzyme 1 is a key enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of saturated fatty acids into monounsaturated fatty acids and plays a vital role in lipid metabolism of tumor cells . SCD1 is overexpressed in a variety of malignant tumors and its related inhibitors showed significant anti tumor activity

@highlight Crucial protein ligand interactions of SCD1 receptor antagonists were elucidated.
@highlight TCMNP ACDNP and IBSNP databases were screened for SCD1 receptor antagonists.
@highlight MD simulation binding free energy calculation and ADMET prediction were applied to evaluate the virtual screening hits.
