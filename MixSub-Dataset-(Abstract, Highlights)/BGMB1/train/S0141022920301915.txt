 Bacterial spores maintain metabolic dormancy and have high resistance to external pressure . Germination requires degradation of the spore cortex and the participation of germination specific cortex lytic enzymes . Previously reported GSLEs have been identified in bacteria and facilitate germination . In this study we have characterized a novel spore lytic enzyme Ply67 from

@highlight Spore lytic enzyme Ply67 was purified and characterized from phage vB BpuM BpSp.
@highlight The activity of Ply67 was stable over a wide range of pH values and temperatures.
@highlight Ply67 showed lytic activities against the spores of all tested
@highlight species.
@highlight The permeability barrier of spore was disrupted after Ply67 treatment.
