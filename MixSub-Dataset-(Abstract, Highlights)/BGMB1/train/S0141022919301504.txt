 Transglycosylation is one of enzymatic methods to improve the physical and biochemical properties of various functional compounds . In this study stevioside glucosides were synthesized using sucrose as a substrate stevioside as an acceptor and dextransucrase from

@highlight 98 of Ste was converted to Ste Gs by using glucansucrase from
@highlight B 512F KM.
@highlight The concentration of Ste G1 was increased by hydrolyzed Ste Gs by dextranase from
@highlight Ste G1 and Ste G2 showed prevention of insoluble glucan formation from
@highlight The water solubility of curcumin pterostilbene or idebenone with Ste or Ste Gs was increased.
@highlight The anti inflammation activity of Ste G1 was 1.76 fold higher than Ste.
