 Lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus was immobilized onto a novel heterofunctional support divinyl sulfone superparamagnetic nanoparticles functionalized with polyethyleneimine . Particle size and zeta potential measurements elemental analysis X ray powder diffraction magnetic measurements and infrared spectroscopy analysis were used to characterize the TLL preparations . At pH 10 it was possible to achieve 100 of immobilization yield in 1h . The immobilization pH gives TLL preparations with different stabilities indeed the TLL preparation immobilized at pH 5.0 was the most stable during the thermal inactivation at all pH values . For the hydrolysis of racemic methyl mandelate the nanobiocatalysts immobilized at pH 5.0 and blocked with ethylenediamine and ethanolamine obtained good enantioselectivities with high catalytic activities in the reaction medium at pH 7.0 . The operational stability of the systems was evaluated in the esterification reaction of benzyl alcohol obtaining up to 61 conversion after the seventh reaction cycle . These results show that
