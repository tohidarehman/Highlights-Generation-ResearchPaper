 Little is known about stem cell transplantation in solid organ transplantation recipients . We conducted a nationwide retrospective survey of Japan Society for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation centers . A total of 19 patients who underwent 22 hematopoietic stem cell transplantations after SOT were identified 5 autologous HSCTs and 17 allogeneic HSCTs were performed . Patients who underwent autologous HSCT received a liver or kidney transplant . All 5 patients achieved neutrophil engraftment and 2 of 3 patients with hepatoblastoma were alive at 1 year after HSCT . Allogeneic HSCT was performed in 16 patients . Among these 2 donors were identical for both transplantations . All but 1 patient achieved neutrophil engraftment . The 5 year overall survival rate was 41.7 but that in patients with malignant disease was much lower than the overall rate . Only 1 patient with malignant disease underwent allogeneic HSCT in nonremission . In allogeneic HSCT after kidney transplantation post transplantation kidney function in 5 evaluable patients was significantly lower than that before allogeneic HSCT and 3 patients experienced renal rejection . However no severe hepatic rejection was noted . In SOT recipients HSCT is a potentially curable treatment for hematologic disorders but it must be performed with caution especially in patients with malignancy .

@highlight A nationwide survey in Japan identified 22 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCT procedures in 19 solid organ transplantation SOT recipients.
@highlight Successful hematologic engraftment aids HSCT for aplastic anemia after SOT.
@highlight Disease control before HSCT is crucial in SOT recipients with malignant disease.
@highlight Renal failure is common and often irreversible in kidney transplant recipients.
