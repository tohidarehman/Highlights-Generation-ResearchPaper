 Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant is often the only curative therapy for patients with nonmalignant diseases however many patients do not have an HLA matched donor . Historically poor survival has been seen after HLA haploidentical HCT because of poor immune reconstitution increased infections graft versus host disease and graft failure . Encouraging results have been reported using a nonmyeloablative T cellreplete HLA haploidentical transplant approach in patients with hematologic malignancies . Here we report the outcomes of 23 patients with various nonmalignant diseases using a similar approach . Patients received HLA haploidentical bone marrow or granulocyte colony stimulating factormobilized peripheral blood stem cell grafts after conditioning with cyclophosphamide 50 mg kg fludarabine 150 mg m

@highlight Modified nonmyeloablative conditioning has a low toxicity profile.
@highlight Rates of overall survival of 91 and event free survival of 78 were found.
@highlight There was a high incidence of acute and chronic GHVD.
