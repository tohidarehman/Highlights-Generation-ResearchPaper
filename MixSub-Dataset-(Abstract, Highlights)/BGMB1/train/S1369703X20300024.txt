 The assembly of multiple enzymes has received increasing attention due to the promising application in improving biocatalytic process . In this study supramolecular nanoreactors were engineered by assembly of polyphosphate kinase and bifunctional glutathione synthetase for adenosine triphosphate regeneration in vitro . Tetrameric PPK and dimeric GshF were first self assembled via peptide peptide interaction of fused leucine zipper domains to form multienzyme complexes with plate like morphology . Further under the driving force of polymerization of PPK driven by substrate polyphosphate MECs were assembled into multienzyme nanoreactors with branch like morphology . MENRs were applied to a two enzyme cascade reaction in vitro . The ATP regeneration efficiency of MENRs system was 57 higher than that of unassembled enzymes mixture and the thermal stability was improved by 46 . When reused for ATP regeneration the assemblies retained more than 70 of the initial activity even after seven cycles . This is the first report in which an artificial complex was constructed by substrate driven assembly of multiple enzymes for cascade reaction . The strategy demonstrated potential application of multienzyme assembly in synthetic biotechnology and nanotechnology .

@highlight Dimeric GshF and tetrameric family 2 PPK were self assembled into MECs through LZs mediated interaction.
@highlight MECs were assembled into supramolecular MENRs driven by the substrate polyP.
@highlight MENRs system showed higher ATP regeneration efficiency and stability than unassembled system.
@highlight MENRs retained more than 70 of the initial activity after seven cycles for reuse.
