 Lignin serves as the most abundant source of aromatic high value products but it has remained underexploited due to its inert and recalcitrant nature . White rot basidiomycetes degrade lignin by secreting a set of lignin modifying enzymes including lignin peroxidase manganese peroxidase versatile peroxidase laccase and various auxiliary enzymes . Among these LiP presents significant potential for application in various industrial sectors such as second generation biofuels cosmetics food bio pulping and biobleaching . However the lack of commercial LiP preparations has hindered its industrial application . In addition they are unstable at high temperatures deactivated by solvents susceptible to inactivation by hydrogen peroxide and challenging to produce in ample quantities . Several expression systems have been investigated to produce LiP with fungal hosts that have shown the most promise to date . We discuss the progress and challenges of producing native and recombinant LiPs and offer some future prospects on strategies to enhance the recombinant production of LiPs for industrial and biotechnological applications .
