 Steroid refractory acute graft versus host disease following hematopoietic cell transplantation is associated with poor clinical outcomes . Currently there are no safe and effective therapies approved for use in the pediatric population under the age of 12 years . Accordingly there is an urgent need for new treatments that are safe well tolerated and effective in managing this debilitating and potentially fatal complication of HSCT . In early phase clinical trials mesenchymal stromal cells have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of acute GVHD in pediatric patients . We now report the results of a phase 3 prospective single arm multicenter study in 54 children with primary SR aGVHD who were naive to other immunosuppressant therapies for aGVHD treated with MSC product dosed at 210

@highlight This is the first mesenchymal stromal cell study in acute graft versus host disease aGVHD to meet a primary efficacy endpoint.
@highlight There are no approved therapies for aGVHD in children younger than 12 years.
@highlight Day 28 overall response was 69.1 74.5 and 68.5 were alive at days 100 and 180 respectively.
@highlight Day 28 overall response strongly predicted day 100 survival.
@highlight Remestemcel L is a promising therapy in pediatric steroid refractory aGVHD.
