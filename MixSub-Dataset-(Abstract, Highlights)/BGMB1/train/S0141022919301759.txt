 Biological production of 2 3 butanediol a C4 platform chemical has been studied recently but the high cost of separation and purification before chemical conversion is substantial . To overcome this obstacle we have conducted a study to convert 2 3 BDO to mevalonate a terpenoid intermediate using recombinant

@highlight KT2440 can metabolize 2 3 butanediol as a sole carbon source.
@highlight 2 3 butandiol was converted to mevalonate by engineered
@highlight KT2440 successfully.
@highlight gene expression and aeration optimization enhanced the mevalonate production.
