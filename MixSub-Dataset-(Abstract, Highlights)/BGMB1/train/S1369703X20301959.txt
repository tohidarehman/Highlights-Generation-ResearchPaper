 Biorefinery wastewaters can be fermented to produce carboxylates which are high value platform chemicals . However the major challenges in this fermentation are limited product yields and productivities faced due to product inhibition and difficulty in carboxylate separation and recovery from fermentation broths . To mitigate the above problems process optimization via integrated fermentation separation i.e .

@highlight reactive extraction RE is investigated for ISPR coupled VFA fermentation.
@highlight 7585 increase in extraction yields was achieved with RE over physical extraction.
@highlight Aliquat 336 and TOPO solved in methyloctanoate were the best reactive extractants.
@highlight VFA extractant molar ratio of 1 2 was the most optimal for VFA extraction.
@highlight Extraction yields of 11.529.5 acetic acid to almost 100 caproic acid achieved.
