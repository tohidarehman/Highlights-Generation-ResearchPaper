 Monoacylglycerols are amphiphilic compounds with wide range of applications such as emulsifiers solubility agents and chiral building blocks . These compounds are currently produced by chemical approaches involving alkaline glycerolysis or esterification under high temperatures and pressure resulting in low yields and with by products . Lipase catalyzed processes have been alternative tools to provide more ecological approaches since MAGs can be obtained under milder reaction conditions and with higher selectivity . However just a few papers have been explored the potential of endophytic fungi as lipase sources . In this work we summarized the screening of lipolytic activity of endophytic fungus
