 Although long term antiviral prophylaxis is recommended to prevent varicella zoster virus infection in seropositive recipients of allogeneic and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation studies of VZV infections in pediatric auto HCT recipients are rare . This study aimed to investigate the incidence and characteristics of VZV infection in pediatric auto HCT recipients and explore the risk factors of VZV infection and its effect on survival outcomes . This study included all pediatric patients who underwent auto HCT at Samsung Medical Center Seoul Korea between January 1998 and December 2013 . Before 2006 short term acyclovir prophylaxis was provided until neutrophil engraftment thereafter routine prophylaxis was not provided . Patients who developed either herpes zoster or chickenpox within 2 years from transplantation were identified and a chart review was performed . A total of 413 recipients and 698 auto HCTs were included . Sixty one episodes of VZV infections were identified in 54 patients . Fourteen cases of VZV infection occurred within 30 days after auto HCT . The cumulative incidence of the first episode of VZV infection at 2 years after transplantation was 14 7.9 to 22.8 in all recipients and 9 in VZV seronegative patients . Notably the VZV infection rate increased with age and the VZV infection rate in patients age 15 to 19 years was almost three times higher than in patients age 0 to 4 years 28 versus 10

@highlight Even long term antiviral prophylaxis in hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT recipients was recommend as standard preventive stratagem for varicella zoster virus VZV infection epidemiology of VZV infection in pediatric autologous HCT recipients is uncertain.
@highlight The incidence of VZV infection differs by age.
@highlight Difference of VZV infection was evaluated between single and tandem autologous HCTs.
@highlight We explored the risk factors for severe VZV infection in the pediatric autologous HCT population.
