 We aimed to investigate the frequency risk factors and outcome of active tuberculosis after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . This retrospective nested case control study reviewed data from 6236 patients who received allo HSCT from January 2008 to December 2018 at a single center thirty three patients with active TB and 99 controls without active TB after allo HSCT were identified . We performed propensity score matching by randomly selecting 3 controls for each identified active TB patient according to the time of transplantation and follow up period . History of pretransplant active TB previously treated and inactive at time of transplantation

@highlight The frequency of active tuberculosis TB following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation allo HSCT was 0.5 .
@highlight TB infection history was an independent risk factor for active TB after allo HSCT.
@highlight The prognosis was similar between patients with or without post transplant active TB.
@highlight This study includes the largest cohort of recipients with active TB after allo HSCT.
@highlight The impact of the anti TB regimen for prophylaxis and treatment is described.
