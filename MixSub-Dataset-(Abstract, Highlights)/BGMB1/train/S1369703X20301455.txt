 Ammonia rich lagoon supernatant has a low alkalinity nitrogen ratio which is ideal for single reactor nitritation denitritation operation . In the present study an integrated fixed film and activated sludge system in sequencing batch mode was operated at 21C for 140 days . The stability and feasibility of nitritation denitritation performance was evaluated and the microbial activities and microbial community dynamics were investigated . With a hydraulic retention time of 2 days the IFAS SBR achieved a stable inorganic nitrogen removal rate of 98 . Nitritation and denitritation activities were both higher in suspended flocs as compared to biofilm . The dominant nitrifying and primary denitrifying genera were

@highlight High strength biosolid digested lagoon supernatant was treated by single reactor nitritation denitritation process.
@highlight The system showed a stable inorganic nitrogen removal rate of 98 with HRT of 2 days.
@highlight Suspended sludge showed high nitritation and denitritation activities in both nitritation and denitritation.
@highlight and
@highlight were the dominant genera for nitrifiers and denitrifiers respectively.
@highlight Suspended sludge showed higher nitritation and denitritation activities than biofilm.
