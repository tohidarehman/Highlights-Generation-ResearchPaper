 Recent investigations on cloned bacterial lipases performed in our laboratory revealed the presence of lipolytic activity that was not due to the cloned lipase coding gene but was probably the result of an intrinsic activity of

@highlight lipolytic activity reported and characterized here.
@highlight lipolytic activity shows preference for medium chain length substrates.
@highlight Optimum activity is achieved under thermophilic 50C and alkalophilic pH 8 conditions.
@highlight No activation by Ca
@highlight or SDS has been found instead SDS strongly inhibits activity.
@highlight 80 activity after SDS PAGE can be recovered after treatment with 2.5 Triton X 100.
