 Exogenous microRNAs enter the human body through food and their effects on metabolic processes can be considerable . It is important to determine which miRNAs from plants affect the expression of human genes and the extent of their influence . The binding sites of 738 The characteristics of the binding of 46 single osa miRNAs to 86 mRNAs of human genes with a value of free energy interaction equal 94 100 from maximum G were established . The findings showed that osa miR2102 5p osa miR5075 3p osa miR2097 5p osa miR2919 targeted the largest number of genes at 38 36 23 19 sites respectively . mRNAs of 86 human genes were identified as targets for 93 osa miRNAs of all family osa miRNAs with G values equal 94 98 from maximum G. Each miRNA of the osa miR156 5p osa miR164 5p osa miR168 5p osa miR395 3p osa miR396 3p osa miR396 5p osa miR444 3p osa miR529 3p osa miR1846 3p osa miR2907 3p families had binding sites in mRNAs of several human target genes . The binding sites of osa miRNAs in mRNAs of the target genes for each family of osa miRNAs were conserved when compared to flanking nucleotide sequences . Target mRNA human genes of osa miRNAs are also candidate genes of cancer cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases .

@highlight A highly complementary interaction of single and family osa miRNAs with mRNAs of human genes was shown.
@highlight The nucleotides of the binding sites of many osa miRNAs in mRNA of the target genes are conservative compared to the flanking nucleotides.
@highlight Most osa miRNAs can affect target mRNA human genes involved in the development of some human diseases.
