 Anaerobic sludge filtration tests were performed with two experimental set ups equipped with either submerged hollow fiber membranes or external tubular membranes operated with low crossflow velocity and gas sparging in a gas lift mode . Particle size distributions extracellular polymeric substance concentrations methanogenic activity reversible and irreversible fouling rates and chemical cleaning efficiency were all studied and compared . An increase in the percentage of smaller particles and a decrease in the concentration of volatile suspended solids in the external membrane set up were observed . Both soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide concentrations were also higher in the external filtration . Operating at 1215L m

@highlight Anaerobic sludge was filtered in side stream tubular and submerged hollow fiber membranes.
@highlight Particle size distribution EPS fouling rate and chemical cleaning efficiency were compared.
@highlight Fouling of the external membrane was notably greater than of the submerged one.
@highlight Shear stress associated to sludge recirculation caused a reduction in the particle size and VSS.
@highlight The effectiveness of the physical and chemical cleaning processes were also different.
