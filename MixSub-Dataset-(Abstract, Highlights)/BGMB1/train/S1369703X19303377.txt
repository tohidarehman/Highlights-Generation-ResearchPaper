 Robust microalgae cultivation at industrial scale needs complex scale up of photobioreactors since the same yields obtained at lab scale are hardly reached during pilot or industrial production . In this paper we propose a procedure based on Buckingham theorem to perform the scale up of photobioreactors used to cultivate

@highlight Theoretical scale up of photobioreactors by Buckingham theorem.
@highlight Dimensionless numbers evaluated by experimental campaign at different scales.
@highlight Airlift reactors for cultivation of Chlorella Vulgaris at pilot scale.
@highlight Set up and tuning of operating conditions for integration in biorefineries.
