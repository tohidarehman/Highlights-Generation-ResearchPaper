 5 hydroxymethylfurfural is a versatile biomass derived chemical for synthesizing useful compounds . In this work an attempt is made to produce HMF by developing a low cost process for doing that using cellulosic waste and deep eutectic solvents . The most effective DES was choline chloride citric acid which provided a greater glucose conversion percentage HMF yield and HMF selectivity than other DESs with 0.1g of pure glucose . To increase the HMF yield further the species of catalyst reaction time and reaction temperature were varied . The highest glucose conversion percentage HMF yield and HMF selectivity were obtained with a reaction time of five minutes a reaction temperature of 130 sulfuric acid as the catalyst and a ChCl citric acid ratio of the DES of 2 1 . These optimal conditions were used with the enzymatic hydrolysate of pretreated wood dusts as a substrate . The experimental results thus obtained revealed a glucose conversion percentage HMF yield and HMF selectivity of 34.86mol 16.46g g and 67.43 respectively under these conditions . These results reveal that using enzymatic hydrolysate from pretreated wood in the production of HMF can yield approximately as much as the use of pure glucose indicating that this low cost process may be commercially feasible .
