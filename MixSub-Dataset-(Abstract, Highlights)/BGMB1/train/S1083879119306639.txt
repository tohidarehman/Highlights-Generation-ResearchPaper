 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is widely performed in children and adolescents with hematologic diseases including very high risk leukemia . With increasing success and survival rates the long term sequelae of HSCT have become important . Here we provide guidance to the prevention and treatment of the most common bone morbiditiesosteoporosis and osteonecrosisemerging in the context of HSCT in children and adolescents . We give an overview on definitions symptoms and diagnostics and propose an algorithm for clinical practice based on discussions within the International Berlin Frankfurt Mnster Stem Cell Transplantation Committee and the Pediatric Disease Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation our expert knowledge and a literature review .

@highlight Risk factors for osteonecrosis ON include older age at HSCT steroids chronic graft versus host disease and prior ON.
