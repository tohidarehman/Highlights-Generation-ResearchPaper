 Using laccase as a case study an alternative methodology for discrimination of bisubstrate mechanism types useful for Bi Bi reactions when water is one of the products is presented . A purified enzyme from fungal cultures of

@highlight AICc and Akaike weights were useful to discriminate bisubstrate models of laccase reactions.
@highlight The more likely bisubstrate model for ABTS oxidation was ping pong.
@highlight The more likely bisubstrate model for DMP oxidation was Theorell Chance.
@highlight Michaelis Menten constants towards dioxygen mean that laccase is not oxygen saturated.
