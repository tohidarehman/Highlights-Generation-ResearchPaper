 Epoxide hydrolases catalyse the conversion of epoxides into vicinal diols . These enzymes have extensive value in biocatalysis as they can generate enantiopure epoxides and diols which are important and versatile synthetic intermediates for the fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries . Despite these benefits they have seen limited use in the bioindustry and novel EHs continue to be reported in the literature .

@highlight Five new active epoxide hydrolases were found.
@highlight The limonene epoxide hydrolase from pQR1982 has a wide substrate scope.
@highlight Enzymes from pQR1982 and pQR1984 had opposite epoxide ring opening stereoselectivities.
@highlight Enzymes from pQR1984 and pQR1990 de symmetrised the
@highlight  epoxide cyclohexene oxide.
@highlight The EH from pQR1984 had comparable activity in the presence of 530 MeOH.
