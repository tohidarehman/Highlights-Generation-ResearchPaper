 Phytocannabinoids are bioactive natural products found in some flowering plants liverworts and fungi that can be beneficial for the treatment of human ailments such as pain anxiety and cachexia . Targeted biosynthesis of cannabinoids with desirable properties requires identification of the underlying genes and their expression in a suitable heterologous host . We provide an overview of the structural classification of phytocannabinoids based on their decorated resorcinol core and the bioactivities of naturally occurring cannabinoids and we review current knowledge of phytocannabinoid biosynthesis in

@highlight Phytocannabinoids are bioactive terpenoids that were thought to be exclusive to
@highlight  but have now also been discovered in
@highlight species some legumes the liverwort genus
@highlight  and some fungi.
@highlight Many cannabinoids display promising non hallucinogenic bioactivities that are determined by the variable nature of the side chain and prenyl group defined by the enzymes involved in their synthesis.
@highlight The biosynthesis of cannabinoids in
@highlight is fully elucidated whereas the pathways in
@highlight and
@highlight have only recently gained research attention.
@highlight Cannabinoid biosynthesis is highly modular enabling use of the modules identified in synthetic biology based combinatorial approaches as demonstrated by the generation of new to nature cannabinoids in
@highlight The ecological functions of cannabinoids include protection against UV light and desiccation as well as in plant defense.
