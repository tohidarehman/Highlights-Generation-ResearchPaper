 Hydrolysis of biomass leads to xylose as one of the primary sugars for fermentation to bioethanol along with glucose . The selection of a suitable microorganism and consequently selection of suitable aeration levels for the selected microorganism plays a significant role in xylose conversion . This work focuses on the kinetics of bioethanol production from xylose using

@highlight Ethanol yield and productivity improve with increasing inoculum concentration.
@highlight Developed model considering oxygen terms predicts xylose ethanol and biomass levels.
@highlight Validation of the developed model with experiments of this study.
