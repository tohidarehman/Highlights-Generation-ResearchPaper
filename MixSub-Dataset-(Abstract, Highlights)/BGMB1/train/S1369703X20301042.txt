 Large accumulation of nitrate in soil has resulted in soil salinization . Nitrate and nitrite reduction are of great importance for nitrogen assimilation and understanding the specific roles of each participating reductase is necessary to describe the biochemical balance that dictates the bacteria responses to their environments . The genes encoding assimilatory nitrite reductase from
