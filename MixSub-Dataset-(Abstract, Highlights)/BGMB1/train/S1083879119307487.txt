 Allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation remains the only treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia with curative potential . Although post transplantation cyclophosphamide reduces allo BMT toxicity by decreasing the risk of graft versus host disease its effect on CLL allo BMT outcomes is unknown . We studied 64 consecutive patients with CLL who underwent nonmyeloablative haploidentical allo BMT at Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center . In this cohort the 4 year overall survival was 52 40 to 68 and progression free survival was 37 . Six patients experienced engraftment failure . PTCy prophylaxis was associated with a modest cumulative incidence of 1 year grade II IV acute GVHD and 2 year chronic GVHD . We demonstrate that NMA haploidentical allo BMT with PTCy is a safe and effective treatment option .

@highlight Outcomes of haploidentical allogeneic bone marrow transplantation allo BMT may be similar to those reported for matched donor allo BMT in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL .
@highlight Post transplantation cyclophosphamide prophylaxis is associated with low rates of acute and chronic graft versus host disease.
@highlight Pre allo BMT bone marrow CLL involvement 20 hinders engraftment.
@highlight Unfavorable risk CLL prognostic features should not preclude the consideration of allo BMT.
