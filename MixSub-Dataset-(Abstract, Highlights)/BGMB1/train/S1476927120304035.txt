 Influenza is a type of acute disease characterized by strong contagiousness and short incubation period which have posed a large potential threat to public health . Traditional Chinese Medicine advocates to the aim of combating complex diseases from a holistic view which has shown effectiveness in anti influenza . However the mechanism of TCM prescription remains puzzling . Here we applied a system pharmacology approach to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms of Qingjie Fanggan prescription in the prevention and treatment of influenza . In this study we identified 228 potential active compounds by means of absorption distribution metabolism and excretion evaluation system and literature research . Then the targets of the potential active compounds were predicted by using the WES method and the influenza related targets were obtained according to some existing gene databases . Next an herb component target network was constructed to further dissect the multi directional therapeutic approach for QFP . Meanwhile we also performed gene ontology enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotation analysis on 344 potential targets . Finally a target pathway network was constructed to further dissect the core pathways and targets in treatment of influenza for QFP . And the key components and targets were docked by AutoDock Vina to explore their binding mode . All of these demonstrated that QFP had multi scale curative activity in regulating influenza related biological processes which facilitates the application of traditional medicine in modern medicine .

@highlight Systems pharmacology could solve complex pharmacological problems.
@highlight Qingjie Fanggan prescription fight influenza by multi component target pathway mode.
@highlight The components of Qingjie Fanggan prescription have good docking activity with ERKs.
