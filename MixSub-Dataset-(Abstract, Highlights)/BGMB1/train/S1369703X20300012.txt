 Butane is an abundant side product of oil and gas production and is mostly burned for energy and heat production . The alkane monooxygenase enzyme system

@highlight Volumetric productivity is driven by butane gas to liquid mass transfer.
@highlight Gassing rate dominates volumetric productivity over pressure and temperature.
@highlight Increasing butane content is no key to significantly rise volume productivity.
@highlight a transferability demonstrated for different bubble column geometries.
