 Most children who may benefit from stem cell transplantation lack a matched related donor . Alternative donor transplantations with an unrelated donor or a partially matched related donor carry an increased risk of graft versus host disease and mortality compared with matched related donor transplantations . We hypothesized that a strategy of partial CD3

@highlight The study cohort comprised children with leukemia who underwent partially CD3
@highlight  depleted peripheral stem cell transplantation PSCT .
@highlight Three year overall survival was 61.8 95 confidence interval CI 50.2 to 71.4 and event free survival was 52.0 95 CI 40.3 to 62.4 .
@highlight Age 15 years and second complete remission were associated with worse outcomes.
@highlight The incidence of severe chronic graft versus host disease was lower in CD3
@highlight than in T cell replete PSCT.
