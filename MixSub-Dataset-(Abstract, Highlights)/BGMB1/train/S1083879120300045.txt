 Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a complex procedure that can be performed in both inpatient and outpatient care settings . We examined reimbursement service utilization and patient financial responsibility among Medicare beneficiaries with multiple myeloma who underwent auto HCT in the IP and OP settings using a merged dataset of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research observational database and Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services Medicare administrative claims data . Selection criteria included first auto HCT time from diagnosis to auto HCT 18 months and continuous enrollment in Medicare Parts A and B for 30 days before HCT index claims and 100 days post HCT or until death . Total reimbursement and patient responsibility were adjusted for patient and disease characteristics using a weighted generalized linear model . The final cohort comprised 1640 patients 1445 who received IP HCT and 195 who received OP HCT . The adjusted total mean reimbursement was higher for IP HCT compared with OP HCT versus 46 824

@highlight Hospital reimbursement patient financial responsibility and service utilization patterns vary by inpatient or outpatient transplantation setting for Medicare beneficiaries with multiple myeloma.
@highlight Mean total reimbursement is 35 544 higher for inpatient autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation auto HCT recipients and the mean patient responsibility is 2208 higher for outpatient auto HCT recipients.
@highlight The subsequent admission rate for planned outpatient auto HCT recipients is 55 .
