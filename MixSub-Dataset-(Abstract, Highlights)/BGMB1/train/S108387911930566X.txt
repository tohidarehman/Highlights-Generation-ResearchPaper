 Umbilical cord blood provides an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells for allogeneic transplantation . Administration of sufficient donor HSCs is critical to restore recipient hematopoiesis and to maintain long term polyclonal blood formation . However due to lack of unique markers the frequency of HSCs among UCB CD34

@highlight Cellular barcodes allow for quantitative longitudinal tracing of human hematopoietic stem cells HSCs in murine recipients.
@highlight The frequency of HSCs is highly variable between individual cord blood donors.
@highlight Different analysis methods can cause substantial variation in the number of retrieved clones.
