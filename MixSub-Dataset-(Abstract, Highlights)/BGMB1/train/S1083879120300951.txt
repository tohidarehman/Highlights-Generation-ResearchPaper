 While allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation currently offers the only curative option for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome there is still a high risk of relapse or transplant related complications . We collected data on all patients who had undergone allo HCT at our center between 2000 and 2018 . In total 215 patients with MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia were included . Estimated 1 year overall survival was 70.3 64.2 to 77.0 and the median survival was 7.7 years . There was a significant improvement in OS over time

@highlight Overall survival improved after the introduction of fludarabine and treosulfan FluTreo conditioning.
@highlight FluTreo patients had a median age of 59 years and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation specific comorbidity index of 2 higher than standard myeloablative conditioning.
@highlight Nonrelapse mortality was lower with FluTreo.
@highlight The incidence of acute and chronic graft versus host disease was lower with FluTreo.
