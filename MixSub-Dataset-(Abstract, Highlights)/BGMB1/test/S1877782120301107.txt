 Osteosarcoma is rare disease and there is a strong controversy about the potential impact of symptom interval on the stage of disease and patients outcomes . We want to assess whether increased symptom interval is associated with advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma . We analyzed prospectively collected data of 220 patients younger than 40 years who had osteosarcoma around the knee . Symptom interval was analyzed to evaluate its impact on metastases at diagnosis tumor volume chemotherapy response and overall survival . The median of SI was 64.5 days . The 5 year overall survival rate for patients with different length of symptom interval were 0.78 0.49 0.52 and 0.65 respectively Increased SI but not the longest SI is associated with higher incidence of metastases at diagnosis patients can benefit from an earlier diagnosis in terms of survival .

@highlight Interquartile range is a better method than setting a cut off point.
@highlight Patients with the shortest symptom have better prognosis.
@highlight Timely referral and quick initial diagnosis are still the recommendation.
