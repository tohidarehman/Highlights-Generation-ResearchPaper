 The opioid crisis is linked to an increased misuse of fentanyl as well as fentanyl analogs that originate from the illicit drug market . Much of our current understanding of fentanyl and fentanyl analog use in our communities comes from postmortem toxicology findings . In the clinical settings of addiction medicine and pain management where the opioid abuse potential is high the use of fentanyl as well as specific fentanyl analogs may be underestimated due to limited plasma testing and limited availability of assays with suitable analytical sensitivity and selectivity to detect misuse of fentanyls . We report plasma and blood assays for 17 fentanyls in clinical and medical examiner casework . A mixed mode solid phase extraction of diluted plasma or precipitated blood was optimized for maximum recovery of the fentanyls with minimized matrix effects . Analysis was performed using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC I Class interfaced with a Waters Xevo TQ S micro tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer . Method parameters were optimized and validated for precision accuracy carryover linearity and matrix effects . Application studies were performed in postmortem blood obtained in 44 fentanyl related fatalities and in serial plasma samples from 18 surgical patients receiving intravenous fentanyl therapy while undergoing parathyroidectomy . Fentanyls found in postmortem cases included fentanyl norfentanyl despropionyl fentanyl beta hydroxy fentanyl acetyl fentanyl acetyl norfentanyl methoxyacetyl fentanyl furanyl fentanyl cyclopropyl fentanyl and para fluorobutyryl fentanyl with fentanyl norfentanyl 4 ANPP and OH fentanyl predominating in frequency . Fentanyl concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 56ng mL and fentanyl was nearly always found with 4 ANPP norfentanyl and OH fentanyl . Concentrations of other fentalogs ranged from 1 to 84ng mL . In the surgical cases fentanyl was detected and quantified along with norfentanyl and OH fentanyl but without detection of 4 ANPP in any of the samples . The association and relative concentrations of OH fentanyl fentanyl and norfentanyl in the postmortem and clinical studies indicated a metabolic rather than an illicit source of OH fentanyl .

@highlight Identification and quantitation of fentanyls is needed in the clinical practice setting.
@highlight A UPLC MS MS method has been validated in plasma and whole blood.
@highlight Application of the method in medical examiner casework shows a range of fentanyls involved in the fatalities including 4 ANPP and beta hydroxy fentanyl.
@highlight Application in pharmaceutical administration of fentanyl shows no evidence of the fentanyl precursor 4 ANPP and the presence of beta hydroxy fentanyl.
@highlight Evidence points to beta hydroxy fentanyl as a metabolite of fentanyl and 4 ANPP associated with illicit fentanyl and fentanyl analog use.
