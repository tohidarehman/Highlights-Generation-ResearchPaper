 The aim of this study was to describe survival of lymphoid neoplasms in the Girona province during 19962015 . Data were extracted from the Girona cancer registry . LN incident cases were registered using the ICD O 3 following the 2008 WHO classification scheme and HAEMACARE grouping . Follow up was available until the 31 12 2015 . Observed and relative survival were estimated with Kaplan Meier and Pohar Perme methods respectively . 4294 LNs diagnosed over a 20 year period were included in the survival analyses . 5 year RS was 62.3 60.464.4 and ranged from 88.5 41.1 according to subtype . Findings were similar between men and women while survival decreased markedly with age . RS for all LNs improved during the first two periods of study being 56.5 in 19962002 64.8 in 20032008 and 65.6 in 20092015 . This pattern was mostly attributed to an improved survival of mature B cell neoplasms yet only statistically significant differences were reported for follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma subtypes . Our study provides estimates of survival in LNs and its subtypes allowing comparisons between countries . Survival for overall cases improved across the period of study yet rates are still poor for most subtypes evidencing the need of therapeutic research programs .

@highlight 5 year relative survival of lymphoid neoplasms was 62.3 95 CI 60.4 64.4 .
@highlight Estimates for specific subtypes were similar to those reported in Europe.
@highlight Survival of mature B cell neoplasms improved during the period of study.
