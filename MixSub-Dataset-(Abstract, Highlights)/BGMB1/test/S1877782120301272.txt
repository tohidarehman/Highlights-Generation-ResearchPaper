 Human papillomavirus is considered the strongest epidemiologic risk factor for cervical cancer . However it is not a sufficient cause given the high prevalence of transient infections . We examined the relationship between exposure to tobacco smoke measured using urinary nicotine metabolite concentrations and p16 Ki 67 co expression in cervical smears and subsequent risk of developing CIN2 CIN3 lesions in HPV positive women . This prospective longitudinal study enrolled women presenting to colposcopy with cytological abnormalities LSIL ASCUS at the National Maternity Hospital Dublin . Women gave a urine sample which was used to perform the Nicotine Metabolite Assay . HPV positive cervical smears were stained by immunocytochemistry for p16 Ki 67 . Two year follow up data including histological diagnosis was collected for each woman . Crude and adjusted odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression to investigate associations between tobacco smoke p16 Ki 67 positivity and CIN2 CIN3 . In total 275 HPV positive women were included . Women with nicotine metabolite concentrations above 500 ng mL indicative of smoking were classified as smokers . Smokers were at an increased risk of testing positive for p16 Ki 67 and CIN2 and CIN3 in compared to non smokers . In p16 Ki 67 positive women smoking further increased their risk of CIN2 CIN3 . HPV positive women exposed to tobacco smoke are at a higher risk of testing positive for p16 Ki 67 co expression . Risk of high grade disease is almost doubled in women who are exposed to tobacco smoke .

@highlight While smoking is a risk factor for HPV and cervical lesions little is known about its role in transforming HPV infections.
@highlight Transforming HPV infections can be characterised by the presence of p16 Ki 67 dual expression.
@highlight We used urinary nicotine metabolite concentrations to measure exposure to tobacco smoke.
@highlight HPV positive women with elevated urinary nicotine metabolites were at a higher risk of testing p16 Ki 67 positive.
@highlight p16 Ki 67 positive women with elevated urinary nicotine metabolites were at a higher risk of CIN2 CIN3 .
