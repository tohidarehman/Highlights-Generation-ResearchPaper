 The Lauren classification of gastric adenocarcinoma describes three histological subtypes the intestinal the diffuse and the mixed type carcinoma . The metastatic pattern of gastric adenocarcinoma by histological subtype has not been studied . Gastric adenocarcinoma patients with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis between 1999 and 2017 were identified through the Netherlands Cancer Registry . The Lauren classification was determined based on pathology reports archived in the Dutch Pathology Registry and was linked to individual cases in the Netherlands Cancer Registry . Among 8 231 newly diagnosed metastatic and evaluable gastric adenocarcinoma patients 57 had an intestinal type carcinoma 38 patients had a diffuse type carcinoma and 5 had a mixed type carcinoma . Intestinal type carcinomas more often metastasized to the liver and lungs whereas diffuse type carcinomas more often metastasized to the peritoneum and bones . Patients with a diffuse type carcinoma had a worse survival perspective regardless of the number or the location of the metastases . In this national cohort study metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma of the intestinal type had a predilection for the liver and that of the diffuse type for the peritoneum .

@highlight Intestinal and diffuse type gastric carcinoma have different metastatic patterns.
@highlight The most common site of metastases of the intestinal type is the liver.
@highlight The most common site of metastases of the diffuse type is the peritoneum.
@highlight Patients with metastatic gastric cancer of the diffuse type have the worst survival.
