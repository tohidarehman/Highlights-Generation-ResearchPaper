 The aim of this study was to compare quality performance of the first colorectal cancer screening campaigns with the OC Sensor Faecal Immunological Test and the Hemoccult guaiac based test . The participation rate of the eligible population screening fecal occult blood test performance indices CRC and adenoma detection rate and time interval between test positivity and colonoscopy were studied . In C7 35.9 of the eligible population completed the screening process versus 47.6 in C1 . The positivity rate was of 4.3 for OC Sensor FIT and 2.3 for Hemoccult test . A total of 3 252 colonoscopies were performed in C7 versus 2 005 in C1 246 CRCs and 1 160 advanced adenomas were detected in C7 compared to 140 CRCs and 491 AA in C1 . The FOBT cancer detection rate increased significantly from 1.4 to 2.9 between the two campaigns as did the FOBT AA detection rate from 5.7 to 13.7 . During C7 the mean time for colonoscopy after a positive FIT result was 84.3 days . There was no significant difference between the stages at diagnosis according to the time for colonoscopy within the first 6 months . CRC and AA detection rates increased significantly between the two campaigns . Longer follow up will be required to show a potential decrease in the incidence of invasive CRCs .

@highlight CRCs detection rate increased significantly from 1.4 to 2.9 between C1 and C7.
@highlight The advanced adenoma detection rate increased significantly from 5.7 to 13.7 .
@highlight 1.76 times more cancers 2.06 times more advanced adenomas were detected with FIT.
@highlight The time to colonoscopy had no impact on the stage of CRC at diagnosis.
