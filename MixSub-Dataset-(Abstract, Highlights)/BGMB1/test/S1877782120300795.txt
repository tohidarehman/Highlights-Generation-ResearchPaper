 Age standardization is vital in international comparison studies of cancer patient survival but standard approaches can fail to produce estimates in the case of sparsity . The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that using a standardization pre weighting approach is a viable alternative approach for external age standardization in population based cancer data and performs well in cases of sparsity . We further de 1 scribe how the pre weighting approach to age standardization can be coupled with the Pohar Perme estimator in both a cohort and period analysis setting . For period analysis we compare approaches for defining the internal age distribution . We use SEER public use data to illustrate our approach and estimate survival for Connecticut and by race to create a scenario with sufficient sparsity . The pre weighting approach gives comparable estimates to traditional age standardization in cases with sufficient data and produces estimates throughout follow up in cases of sparsity when a traditional approach would fail . International comparison studies and other national population based survival studies that need to age standardize estimates for comparability purposes should adopt the Pohar Perme estimator with pre weighting . This approach avoids issues of non estimation in the case of sparsity and will allow more consistent comparisons across the produced estimates .

@highlight Age standardization is vital for comparability of cancer survival metrics.
@highlight Traditional approaches to standardization can suffer issues in the face of sparse data.
@highlight Age standardization using pre weighting coupled with the Pohar Perme estimator offers a solution in these scenarios.Age standardization with a pre weighting approach provides consistent estimates for non sparse data.
@highlight A slight adaptation is needed for calculating the pre weights when considering estimates used in period analysis.
