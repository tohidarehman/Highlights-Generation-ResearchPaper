 Few studies have assessed the relation between maternal prenatal pesticides use and childhood lymphoma risk some reporting a positive association with non Hodgkin lymphoma . We investigated the association between maternal exposure to pesticides during pregnancy and childhood Hodgkin and non Hodgkin lymphoma . We pooled data from the two French national population based case control studies ESCALE and ESTELLE . Data on domestic and occupational exposures to pesticides during pregnancy were obtained through standardised maternal interviews . Logistic regression models were used to compute odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals for HL and NHL by pesticide category adjusted for potential confounders . Analyses by histological subtypes were also performed . We included 328HL 305 non Hodgkin NHL and 2 415 controls . Around 40 of control mothers reported having used pesticides during index pregnancy of whom 95 reported insecticides use . Maternal use of herbicides and fungicides occurred mostly in combination with insecticides . Insecticides use was more frequently reported in cases than controls OR These results suggest that maternal domestic use of insecticides during pregnancy might be related to both childhood NHL and HL . Further larger studies are urgently needed .

@highlight Knowledge is lacking on the role of maternal pesticides use on childhood lymphoma.
@highlight We pooled data from two French nationwide population based case control studies.
@highlight Maternal insecticides use in pregnancy was associated with both NHL and HL.
@highlight Associations were slightly stronger for Burkitt lymphoma and mixed cellularity HL.
