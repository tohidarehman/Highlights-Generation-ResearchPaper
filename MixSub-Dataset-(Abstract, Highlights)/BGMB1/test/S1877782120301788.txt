 BowelScreen The National Bowel Screening Programme in Ireland offers free colorectal screening to persons aged 60 69 through a home Faecal Immunochemical Test kit . 40.2 uptake in the first screening round was below the programme standard . To improve uptake an intervention saw FIT kits sent directly to previously screened clients rather than by the usual invitation process comprising a letter of invitation followed by a FIT kit if requested . The intervention proved successful and was fully implemented into the programme for subsequent clients . Despite the improved uptake it was noted over time that the unsatisfactory FIT rate was approaching the programme standard . The aim of this study is to compare uptake by two invite methods occurring contemporaneously alongside advertising and to compare unsatisfactory rates before and after full FIT Direct implementation . Percentage uptake and 95 confidence intervals were calculated for each invite method before and after advertising and compared using two proportion z tests . Rate ratios and 95 CI compared the unsatisfactory FIT rate before and after full FIT Direct implementation . Uptake was significantly higher amongst FIT Direct compared with Usual Invite clients during and outside advertising . The unsatisfactory FIT rate was 2.3 times higher after full FIT Direct implementation compared with before . The FIT Direct intervention had an overall positive effect on uptake . After adjusting for advertising uptake of FIT was higher outside advertising periods . Monitoring of the unsatisfactory rate is ongoing a communication enhancement strategy may be required should this persist .

@highlight FIT kits used in colorectal screening have previously shown significantly higher participation rates compared with gFOBT. Invite strategy can also have a positive effect on uptake.
@highlight We compare FIT uptake based on two invite methods occurring contemporaneously alongside nationwide advertising.
@highlight Higher participation rates are seen amongst clients sent FIT kits directly compared with those sent an invitation letter only.
@highlight High participation remains after controlling for advertising.
@highlight Our findings create a model for screening programmes in other countries to follow.
