 To describe cancer incidence and treatment utilization patterns at the regional cancer referral center for the Lake Zone of northwestern Tanzania from 2008 to 2016 . This descriptive retrospective study reviewed all cancer cases recorded in the Bugando Cancer Registry a clinical and pathology based registry at the only cancer referral hospital in the region . Primary tumor site method of diagnosis HIV status and cancer treatment were reported . Using census data the 2012 GLOBOCAN estimates for Tanzania were scaled to the Lake Zone and adjusted for 2016 population growth . These estimates were then compared to BCR cases using one sample tests of proportion . A total of 2772 cases were reported from 20082016 . Among these the majority of cases were diagnosed among adults . Most cases were diagnosed by histology or cytology . Among adults the most common cancers diagnosed were cervix breast and prostate . Among children the most common cancers were non Burkitt non Hodgkin lymphoma Burkitt lymphoma and Wilms tumor . The 1116 BCR cases represent 12.2 of the 9165 expected number of cancer cases for the Lake Zone . 1494 cases received some form of treatment surgery chemotherapy radiation or hormone therapy while 1278 cases had no treatment recorded . This comprehensive report of the BCR reveals cancer epidemiology and treatment utilization patterns typical of hospitals in low resource settings . Despite being the only cancer center in the Lake Zone BMC evaluates a small percentage of the expected number of cancer patients for the region . The BCR remains an important resource to guide clinical care and academic activities for the Lake Zone .

@highlight The Bugando Cancer Registry is the largest regional hospital based cancer registry in Tanzania.
@highlight The most commonly diagnosed cancers were cervical and breast cancer in females and prostate and Kaposi sarcoma in males.
@highlight Only 53.9 of patients in the registry received a cancer treatment.
@highlight Most cases 69 were determined based on histopathology diagnosis.
@highlight Fewer than 12 of expected cases based on population were recorded in the cancer registry highlighting the need for expanded registry services.
