 Longitudinal data are limited regarding the impact of a multidisciplinary team approach on patient outcomes among those diagnosed with lung cancer . The purpose of this study is to 1 compare 1 and 3 year recurrence and mortality rates among patients receiving a MDT vs. standard model of care and 2 assess trends in these proportions over a 10 year period . This investigation included 2044 lung cancer cases reported to the Stony Brook Cancer Registry between 2006 and 2015 . Patients were stratified into 2 groups those participating in Stony Brooks Lung Cancer Evaluation Centers MDT Program and those receiving a standard model of care . 1 and 3 year stage stratified recurrence and mortality rates are reported . Logistic regression analyses are performed and linear by linear associations are used to assess trends over time . A higher proportion of patients in the MDT program remained disease free at 1 year compared those receiving standard care . There were no significant changes in mortality over the 10 year observation period in either group however the rates were significantly lower among LCEC vs non LCEC cases after adjusting for possible confounders at 1 year OR 0.50 at 3 years . Recurrence was also lower at 3 years in the MDT group . This study suggests that a comprehensive MDT program for lung cancer yields improved patient outcomes compared to the standard model of care and this approach may help to decrease rates of disease recurrence and mortality .

@highlight A multidisciplinary team MDT approach to lung cancer care improved outcomes.
@highlight and 3 year mortality was significantly lower among patients receiving MDT care.
@highlight Lung cancer recurrence was also significantly reduced under an MDT model.
