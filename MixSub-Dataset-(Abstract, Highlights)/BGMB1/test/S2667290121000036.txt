 Cleft lip and or palate are a split in the lip the palate or both . This results from the inability of lip buds and palatal shelves to properly migrate and assemble during embryogenesis . By extracting primary cells from a cleft patient we aimed at offering a better understanding of the signaling mechanisms and interacting molecules involved in the lip and palate formation and fusion . With Rho GTPases being indirectly associated with cleft occurrence we investigated the role of the latter in both . First whole exome sequencing was conducted in a patient with cleft lip and palate . Primary fibroblastic cells originating from the upper right gingiva region were extracted and distinct cellular populations from two individuals were obtained a control with no cleft phenotype and a patient with a cleft lip and palate . The genetic data showed three candidate variables in
