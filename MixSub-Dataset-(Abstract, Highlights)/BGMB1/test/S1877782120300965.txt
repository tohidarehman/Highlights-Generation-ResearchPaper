 The burden of renal cell carcinoma in young adults received marginal attention . We assessed contemporary gender race and stage specific incidence and trends of RCC among young adults in the United States . Within Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database patients aged 2039 years with histologically confirmed RCC were included . Age standardized incidence rates were estimated . Temporal trends were calculated through joinpoint regression analyses to describe the average annual percent change . From 20002016 7767 new RCC cases were recorded . ASRs were higher in males than in females and increased significantly in both genders . Non Hispanic American Indian Alaska Native had the highest incidence vs. non Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander the lowest . ASRs significantly increased in all ethnic groups . T1aN0M0 and T1bN0M0 stages showed the highest incidence and increase . Also regional and distant stages increased . The most frequent tumor characteristics were G2 and G1 as well as clear cell histology . RCC in young adults is rare but increasing . This is mainly due to T1aN0M0 tumors . Nonetheless also regional diseases are significantly increasing . Differences between ethnic groups exist and may warrant further research .

@highlight Kidney cancer incidence rates in young adults are extremely low.
@highlight Incidence varies across ethnic groups which may be related to different prevalence in risk factors and in genetic and environmental factors.
@highlight Incidence is significantly increasing over time. The highest increase is occurring in T1aN0M0 tumors suggesting a possible ascertainment bias.
@highlight The highest and the lowest socioeconomic status quartiles showed similar increase. Also higher stages showed increasing incidence.
@highlight Different access to medical care and over diagnosis of small renal masses may not explain at all kidney cancer rising incidence in young adults.
