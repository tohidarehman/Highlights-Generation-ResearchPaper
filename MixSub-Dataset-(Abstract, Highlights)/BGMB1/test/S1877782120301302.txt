 Few studies have evaluated associations between birth defects and risk of pediatric cancers by age of attainment . Therefore we assessed the risk of cancer among children with and without birth defects by age at attainment . We examined cancer risk in children 14 years with and without birth defects born between 1996 and 2011 by linking data from the Arkansas Reproductive Health Monitoring System Arkansas Central Cancer Registry and birth certificates . Age of attainment for cancer was calculated as person years from birth to cancer diagnosis death or end of study period whichever occurred first . Using Cox proportional hazards models we evaluated associations by attained age groups between groups of birth defects and any cancer non chromosomal birth defects by organ system and any cancer and non chromosomal birth defects and subtypes of cancer . In the cohort of 629 086 children 23 341 children had birth defects and 1 037 children had cancer . For children with non chromosomal birth defects specifically cardiovascular and genitourinary highest risk of any cancer was observed in first year of life 18.5 95 confidence interval 10.1 33.8 . For children with chromosomal birth defects increased cancer risk was observed among those 1 4 years old . Overall cancer risk among children with birth defects was highest among those 5 years old . Our findings consistent with previous studies may inform surveillance strategies for children with birth defects .

@highlight Cancer risk among children with birth defects was highest among those 5 years old.
@highlight Children with non chromosomal defects had highest cancer risk during first year.
@highlight For non chromosomal defect subtypes increased cancer risk was noted in first year.
@highlight Attained age analysis is vital to understand cancer birth defects relations by age.
