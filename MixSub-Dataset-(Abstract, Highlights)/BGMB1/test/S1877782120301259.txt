 Peru has a public health problem because of asbestos imports . We analyzed the mortality trends for mesothelioma in Peru and its provinces from 2005 to 2014 and estimated their relationship with the amount of asbestos imported previously . We computed age standardized mortality rates per 100 000 population and the standardized mortality ratio . The relationship between the amount of asbestos imported annually along the period 19652010 and the number of mesothelioma deaths per year from 2005 to 2014 was estimated by log linear Poisson regression models and Pearson correlation calculations . After correcting the number of deaths Peru registered 428 cases between 2005 and 2014 . The highest ASMRs were in Arequipa and Callao followed by Huancavelica . This translates into approximately one death per each 68111 of asbestos tons imported . The latency period for the higher level of positive correlation found was 8 years . Male female sex ratio was lower in provinces such as Junin and Hunacavelica with geological asbestos risk . Two patterns of mesothelioma risk have been detected occupational and environmental . During the 20022006 years Peru increased the asbestos use . If crocidolite imports were also increased this could be behind the 8 years latency period detected . Peru should boost strategies towards the total ban of all forms of asbestos .

@highlight Asbestos use in Peru is regulated but not banned Chrysotile is still imported.
