 Pre existing chronic conditions influence the diagnosis and management of cancer . The prevalence of specific morbidities in patients diagnosed with common and rarer cancers is inadequately described . Using data from the English National Cancer Diagnosis Audit 2014 we studied 11 pre existing morbidities recorded as yes no items by participating general practitioners based on information included in primary care records . We examined the number and type of morbidities across socio demographic and cancer site strata and subsequently estimated observed and age sex standardised prevalence of each morbidity by cancer . Over three quarters of non screen detected patients had at least one chronic condition before diagnosis while nearly half had two or more . Hypertension and physical disability were the most and least common conditions . Male older and more socio economically deprived patients were more likely to have at least one morbidity . For most morbidities the standardised prevalence was similar across different cancers with a few exceptions including respiratory disease prevalence being greatest among lung cancer patients and diabetes prevalence being greatest among liver pancreatic and endometrial cancer patients . Most cancer patients have at least one morbidity while almost one in two have two or more . The findings highlight the need to take certain morbidity and cancer site combinations into account when examining associations between morbidity and cancer outcomes .

@highlight Most patients had at least one morbidity nearly one in two had multiple morbidities.
@highlight Morbidity prevalence was similar across cancers but with notable exceptions.
@highlight Related enquiries should take account of certain combinations of morbidities and cancer.
