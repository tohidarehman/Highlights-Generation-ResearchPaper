 Increasing diagnosis of cancer when the disease is still at early stages is a priority of cancer policy internationally . In England reducing geographical inequalities in early diagnosis is also a key objective . Stage at diagnosis is not recorded for many patients which may bias assessments of progress . We evaluate temporal and geographical changes in stage at diagnosis during 20082013 for colorectal non small cell lung and ovarian cancers using multiple imputation to minimise bias from missing data . Population based data from cancer registrations routes to diagnosis secondary care and clinical audits were individually linked . Patient characteristics and recorded stage were summarised . Stage was imputed where missing using auxiliary information . Logistic regression was used to estimate temporal and geographical changes in early diagnosis adjusted for case mix using a multilevel model . We analysed 196 511 colorectal 180 048 non small cell lung and 29 076 ovarian cancer patients . We estimate that there were very large increases in the percentage of patients diagnosed at stages I or II between 2008 09 and 2012 13 from 32 to 44 for colorectal cancer 19 to 25 for non small cell lung cancer and 28 to 31 for ovarian cancer . Geographical inequalities reduced for colorectal and ovarian cancer . Multiple imputation is an optimal approach to reduce bias from missing data but residual bias may be present in these estimates . Increases in early stage diagnosis coincided with increased diagnosis through the two week wait pathway and colorectal screening . Epidemiological analyses from 2013 are needed to evaluate continued progress .

@highlight Early stage diagnosis increased during 20082013 for the three cancers analysed.
@highlight Geographic inequalities reduced for colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer.
@highlight Multiple imputation was done to reduce bias from missing stage data but some bias may remain.
@highlight Improvements coincided with increased diagnoses through screening and urgent referrals.
