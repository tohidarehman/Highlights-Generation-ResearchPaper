 This study was aimed to analyze the spectrum of time intervals from the onset of symptoms to the commencement of treatment in esophagogastric cancers . Factors influencing these time delays and correlation between these time points with variables including socioeconomic strata educational level histopathology location of tumor and the initial modality of treatment were assessed . A prospective analysis of patients with esophagogastric cancer presenting to a single tertiary care unit over a period of 12 months was performed . Histopathology other than adenocarcinoma and squamous cell were excluded . 202 patients were enrolled in the study . Most patients presented with advanced disease i.e . 91.5 of esophageal and 90 of gastric malignancies belonged to either stage 3 or stage 4 as per American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor node metastasis staging system . The median delay from the appearance of the first symptoms to initiation of treatment was 15 weeks . Patient related factors contributed to a significant delay . Administrative factors were responsible for median delay of 3 weeks . Curative multimodality treatment was administered in 62.5 of patients . Significant longer delay was influenced by socioeconomic strata educational level evaluation by non specialist . No relationship was noted between histopathology location of tumor or initial modality of treatment . Delays in our setting is much more than that is seen in Western and even some Asian countries . An important component of delay is administrative related factors . These may be intervened at the hospital level compared to other factors which may need long term community oriented approaches .

@highlight Median time interval from onset of first symptoms to start of treatment in our study population was 15 weeks.
@highlight Per capita income and educational level of the patient significantly influence the Prehospital delay.
@highlight Community oriented approaches and administrative changes are required to reduce delay.
