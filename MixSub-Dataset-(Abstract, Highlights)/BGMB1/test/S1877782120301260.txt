 Race is an important determinant of cancer outcome . The purpose of this study was to identify disparities in clinical presentation treatment use and in hospital outcomes of patients with spinal metastases . The United States National Inpatient Sample database was queried to identify patients with metastatic disease and cord compression or spinal pathological fracture . Clinical presentation type of intervention and in hospital outcomes were compared between races ethnicities . Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed and adjusted for differences in patient age sex insurance status income quartile hospital teaching status and size Charlson comorbidity index smoking status tumor type and neurological status . A total of 145 809 patients were identified 74.8 Caucasian 14.1 African American 7.9 Hispanic and 3.2 Asian . Over one third of patients presented with MSCC 35.7 of Caucasians 50.3 of AAs 41.1 of Hispanics and 39.8 of Asians . Paralysis affected 8.4 of all patients 7.4 of Caucasians 12.7 of AAs 10.5 of Hispanics and 10.0 of Asians . For patients with MSCC multivariate analysis showed that AAs were less likely to undergo surgical intervention significantly more likely to experience a complication significantly more likely to experience prolonged length of stay and significantly more likely to experience a non routine discharge compared to Caucasians . Minority groups with spinal metastatic disease may be at a disadvantage compared to Caucasians with significant disparities found in presenting characteristics type of intervention and in hospital outcomes . Continued efforts to overcome these differences are needed .
