 Measuring progress against cancer is more accurate when trends in incidence survival and mortality are interpreted simultaneously . Our study aims to analyze how these key metrics have evolved over time in the Azores Portugal . Data for incident cases diagnosed in 19972016 and followed up through December 31 2017 were obtained from the Azores Cancer Registry . Data for cancer deaths that occurred in 19912016 were obtained from Statistics Portugal . To estimate temporal trends we applied a joinpoint model to age adjusted rates . We estimated five year net survival within the framework of relative survival using the Pohar Perme estimator and predicted the number of cases and deaths in 2025 . In men incidence and mortality decreased for stomach larynx and prostate cancer . In women mortality decreased for breast and cervical cancer . Five year relative survival improved for several cancers with the most pronounced improvements for prostate cancer in men and colorectal cancer in women . Conversely incidence and mortality increased for colorectal cancer in men and lung cancer in women . The incidence and mortality burdens are both expected to increase in 2025 . Overall progress against cancer in the Azores has been mixed and much of the progress has been driven by advances in treatment . Statistics for lung cancer in women and colorectal cancer in men are a call to action for policymakers . Reducing tobacco use and tackling the obesity epidemic are the two public health priorities for cancer control within the region .

@highlight This is the first study in which incidence survival and mortality are interpreted concomitantly to evaluate progress against cancer in a specific region of Portugal the Azores archipelago.
@highlight Much of the progress has been driven by treatment advances as seen by survival improvements and decreases in mortality.
@highlight Incidence and mortality increased for colorectal cancer in men and lung cancer in women.
@highlight Reducing tobacco use and obesity are cancer control priorities within the region.
