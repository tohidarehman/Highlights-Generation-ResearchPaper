 The aim of this study was to develop and validate a LC MS MS method to quantitate hydroxytyrosol in urine for clinical studies to monitor compliance of consumption of dietary extra virgin olive oil . Both pre analytical and analytical issues were examined . The stability of hydroxytyrosol was monitored in both urine and synthetic urine at four different temperatures for four weeks either with or without the additive acetic acid . The LC MS MS method was validated by performing linearity imprecision recovery and carryover studies .

@highlight A LC MS MS method for hydroxytyrosol a metabolite from extra virgin olive oil was developed.
@highlight Higher temperatures and pH led to pre analytical degradation of hydroxytyrosol.
@highlight In urine addition of acetic acid as a preservative improved hydroxytyrosol stability.
