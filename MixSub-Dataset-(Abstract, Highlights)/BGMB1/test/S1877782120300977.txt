 Early diagnosis and stage at presentation two prognostic factors for survival among patients with head and neck cancer are significantly impacted by a patients health insurance status . We aimed to assess the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on stage at presentation across socioeconomic and demographic subpopulations of HNC patients in the United States . Retrospective data analysis . The National Cancer Database a hospital based cancer database was queried for adults aged 1864 years and diagnosed with a malignant primary HNC . The outcome of interest was change in early stage diagnoses between 20112013 and 20142015 using logistic regression models . A total of 91 137 HNC cases were identified in the pre ACA and post ACA years . Overall the odds of early stage diagnoses did not change significantly post ACA aOR 0.97 95 CI 0.94 1.00 We demonstrate a significant association between ACA implementation and increased early stage presentation among Medicaid enrolled HNC patients . This suggests that coverage expansions through the ACA may be associated with increased access to care and may yield greater benefits among low income HNC patients .

@highlight Overall rate of early stage HNC presentation remained unchanged.
@highlight On the contrary late stage HNC increased post ACA.
@highlight Early stage HNC presentation increased only among patients with Medicaid.
@highlight Medicaid expansion may have impacted stage for low income patients.
