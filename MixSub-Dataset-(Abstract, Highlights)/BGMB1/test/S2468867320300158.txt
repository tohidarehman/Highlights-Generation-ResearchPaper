 A spinal injury leads to complex reactions by glial immune and other non neural cells . In mammals these reactions are thought to prevent regeneration of axons and neuronal replacement . Here we review recent insights into how different cell types may cooperate to allow functional regeneration in zebrafish .

@highlight Diverse cell types promote spinal cord regeneration in zebrafish.
@highlight Cell types in the injury site are highly dynamic and interactive.
@highlight Pro regenerative signals are discovered in zebrafish.
@highlight Novel techniques transform discovery in zebrafish regeneration research.
