 Successful outcomes of cell based therapeutic is highly dependent on quality and quantity of the cells . Epigenetic modifiers are known to modulate cell fates via reprogramming hence it is plausible to use them in enhancing the plasticity of mesenchymal stem cells . In this study we aimed to study the effects of 5 Azacytidine an epigenetic modifier pretreatment on mesenchymal stem cells derived from Wharton s Jelly fates . WJMSCs were pretreated with 5 AzaCR for 24h and subsequently cultured in culture media mixtures . The proliferative and stemness characteristics of the pretreated WJMSCs were assessed through morphological and gene expression analyses . Results showed that cells pretreated with 5M to 20M of 5 AzaCR showed to acquire higher proliferative state transiently when cultured in embryonic mesenchymal stem cell media but not in MSC medium alone and this coincides with significant transitional upregulation of stemness transcription factors . 5 AzaCR pretreatment has potential to confer initial induction of higher state of stemness and proliferation in WJMSCs influenced by the culture media .
