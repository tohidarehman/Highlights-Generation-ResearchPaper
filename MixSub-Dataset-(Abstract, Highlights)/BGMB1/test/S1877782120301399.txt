 UK primary care referral guidance describes the signs symptoms and test results of undiagnosed cancer . Guidance revision in 2015 liberalised investigation by introducing more low risk features . We studied adults with cancer whose features were in the 2005 guidance or were introduced in the revision . We compared time to diagnosis between the groups and its trend over 20062017 . Clinical Practice Research Datalink records were analysed for adults with incident myeloma breast bladder colorectal lung oesophageal ovarian pancreatic prostate stomach or uterine cancers in 1 1 200631 12 2017 . Cancer specific features in the year before diagnosis were used to create New NICE and Old NICE groups . Diagnostic interval was time between the index feature and diagnosis . Semiparametric varying coefficient analyses compared diagnostic intervals between New NICE and Old NICE groups over 1 1 200631 12 2017 . Over all cancers median Old NICE diagnostic interval rose over 20062017 from 51 to 64 days with increases in breast lung ovarian prostate and stomach cancers . Median New NICE values were consistently longer than Old NICE values over all cancers . After guidance revision New NICE diagnostic intervals became shorter than Old NICE values for colorectal cancer . Despite improvements for colorectal cancer scope remains to reduce diagnostic intervals for most cancers . Liberalised investigation requires protecting and enhancing cancer diagnostic services to avoid their becoming a rate limiting step in the diagnostic pathway .

@highlight Revised UK suspected cancer guidance liberalised investigation of patients.
@highlight Diagnostic interval was longer for patients with newly introduced referral criteria.
@highlight Scope remains to reduce diagnostic interval further.
