 There is a lack of information about the burden of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer . The present work aims to estimate the incidence and prevalence of mCRPC in 2014 using the French nationwide healthcare database . Prevalence and incidence were estimated based on an SNDS extraction of men covered by the general healthcare insurance and aged 40 . Patients with mCRPC were identified amongst prostate cancer cases using an algorithm estimating a date of first metastasis management and a date of castration resistance . This algorithm was validated by clinical experts through a blind review of 200 anonymized medical charts from SNDS data . Prevalence and incidence were standardized on the European Standard Population . Prevalence and incidence of mCRPC were estimated as respectively 62 and 21 cases per 100 000 men in 2014 . Less than one mCRPC case per 100 000 was observed in men aged 4049 . Maximum mCRPC incidence was in men aged 8089 . The algorithm used for mCRPC identification had 97 positive and 99 negative predictive values . The good performances of the algorithm for mCRPC identification and the consistency of the generated results with the existing data highlight the robustness of these first estimates of mCRPC prevalence and incidence . Future updates will call for algorithm adjustment as practices evolve over time . These first real life data will serve for future follow up of the impact of changes in the management of prostate cancer .
