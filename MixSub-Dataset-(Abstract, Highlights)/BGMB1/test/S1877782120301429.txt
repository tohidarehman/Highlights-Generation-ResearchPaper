 While the chemoprevention effect of aspirin is well established the effects of metformin in cancer prevention is still controversial . This study is to investigate the use of aspirin metformin or the combination of both is associated with delayed cancer incidence . This dataset is based on the electronic medical record of public hospitals in Hong Kong . Patients were classified into 1. aspirin user 2. metformin user 3. both aspirin and metformin user and 4. control group with neither aspirin nor metformin used . Aspirin and or metformin must have been taken for over 6 months in the treatment group and cancer incidences was counted at least 6 months after exposure to such medications . The primary outcome of this study was overall incidence of cancer during the follow up period . The secondary outcomes were cancer incidences of specific sites including colon rectum liver oesophagus pancreas stomach lung breast kidney bladder and prostate . Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted to estimate hazard ratios of cancer risks . Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to control for the medication effects . A total of 120 971 aspirin users 11 365 metformin users and 6630 aspirin plus metformin users were identified . Compare to the control groups those who used aspirin alone demonstrated a significant reduction in overall cancer risk . Similarly those who used metformin alone also showed an overall reduction in cancer risk . Patients who received both aspirin and metformin showed the most significant reduction in overall cancer risk . Metformin showed a significant reduction in cancer risk of lung oesophagus and bladder . There is a similar decrease in overall cancer rate with the use of aspirin or metformin alone . A more significant reduction in overall cancer risk was found with the use of both agents .
