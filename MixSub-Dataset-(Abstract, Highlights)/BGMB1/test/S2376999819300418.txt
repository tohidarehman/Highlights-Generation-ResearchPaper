 Tandem mass spectrometry is a powerful technique that directly measures compounds based on their molecular weight . Liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry a type of tandem MS has been increasingly adopted by clinical laboratories in recent years . While it is complicated and challenging it has selectivity and accuracy advantages over more traditional laboratory techniques such as immunoassay . Able to measure a wide range of compounds when correctly utilized and implemented LC MS MS can benefit the clinical laboratory and improve patient care . This mini review is an introduction to clinical LC MS MS for the novice user .
