 To evaluate the performance of low dose computed tomography on lung cancer screening in high risk populations in Sichuan . From April 2014 to July 2018 LDCT was performed annually on 3185 subjects aged 5074 years who had smoked 20 pack years . Information about all deaths and lung cancer diagnoses were obtained by active investigation or passive matching to disease surveillance system . The screening population had a median age of 60 years . 62.4 of which were current smokers and had smoked 30 pack years . After participating in the baseline screening the compliance rates of subjects consecutively completing one round two rounds three rounds and four rounds of annual screening were 67.22 52.84 43.24 and 40.04 respectively . The positive rates in baseline and annual screening were 6.53 and 5.79 respectively . During the 5 rounds a total of 9522 person times were screened by LDCT with a screening sensitivity of 89.13 95 The application of LDCT on lung cancer screening in high risk populations shows favorable compliance and a high screening performance in the project area of Sichuan China .

@highlight LDCT shows a high screening performance in Sichuan high risk population.
@highlight Compliance with consecutive annual screening gradually decreased over rounds.
@highlight There were no performance differences between baseline and annual screening.
