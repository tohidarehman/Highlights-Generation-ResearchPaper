 The aim of uterus transplantation is to treat uterine factor infertility due to absence of a functional uterus . This review provides information on key research findings in the field of uterus transplantation . The animal based preclinical uterus transplantation research started around 20 years back with systematic research in several animal species including non human primates . This research investigated important aspects such as surgery immunosuppression ischemia reperfusion injury rejection and fertility . In 2013 the first clinical uterus transplantation trial started and this was a live donor trial including nine transplantations . The first live birth was reported in 2014 and this has been followed by several more births from the initial trial in Sweden but also from other trials . The published uterus transplantations procedures both from live donors and deceased donors will be reviewed in detail . The surgical procedures to harvest a uterus from a live or from a deceased donor have developed and minimal invasive techniques are being introduced in live donor surgery for uterus transplantation . Some modifications of anatomical sites of venous outflows have been introduced . The efficiency of the procedure in terms of surgical success with viable grafts after one month as well as the rate of successful transplantations with live births as the primary endpoint have proven to be high . Uterus transplantation is an experimental clinical procedure that is performed within clinical trials at many centers worldwide . The accumulated research data from these trials will pave the way for establishment of uterus transplantation as a safe and efficient procedure to treat uterine factor infertility .

@highlight Uterus transplantation is still an experimental surgical procedure.
@highlight Systematic animal based research formed the basis for the successful introduction of uterus transplantation in the human setting.
@highlight Donor surgery in live donor uterus transplantation procedure is presently developed towards fully minimal invasive surgery.
@highlight Live births have been accomplished after uterus transplantation both from live and deceased donors.
