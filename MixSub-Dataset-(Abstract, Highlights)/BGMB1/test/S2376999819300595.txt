 2 hydroxyglutarate is a metabolite produced under physiologic conditions but also by tumors harboring isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations . Detection is challenging as it must be distinguished from its enantiomer 2 hydroxyglutarate which is also produced in the body but can increase under hypoxic conditions . A chiral gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay was developed which separated enantiomers using a chiral column and quantified levels using a stable isotope internal standard . The assay improves upon current methods by avoiding chiral derivatization and implementing a simplified sample extraction procedure . The assay was validated and serum 2 hg levels from healthy patients were measured establishing a new comprehensive reference range for normal levels of each enantiomer . Differences in basal levels were observed between races but not sex . Age also correlated with S 2 hg levels but not R 2 hg levels . Finally serum levels of 2 hg enantiomers were measured in a pilot study of 11 patients with and without IDH mutant gliomas . An increase in R 2 hg levels was observed in 2 3 patients with actively growing IDH mutant gliomas . S 2 hg levels were increased in 4 11 patients irrespective of IDH status . The results presented demonstrate the feasibility of a GCMS MS assay for measurement of 2 hg enantiomer levels for clinical use .

@highlight A novel GCMS MS assay was built to detect 2 hg enantiomers.
@highlight Basal levels of 2 hg enantiomers vary by race.
@highlight 2 hg enantiomer levels were measured from patients with IDHmut brain tumors.
