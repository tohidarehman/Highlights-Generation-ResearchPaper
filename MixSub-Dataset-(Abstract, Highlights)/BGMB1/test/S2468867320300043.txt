 In this short review we draw parallels and stress differences between heart regeneration in mice and human from a bioengineering perspective . As the prevailing dogma that the adult heart is completely post mitotic is starting to change there are multiple opportunities for augmenting the limited but definitive turnover of cardiomyocytes to the extent necessary developing clinically relevant modalities for enhancing heart repair . We discuss some of the most promising among these new directions mobilization of paracrine signaling by therapeutic cells cell free therapy of the heart using extracellular vesicles and direct reprograming of endogenous cells . These new directions share the cell free mechanistic approach to heart repair that could be translated into the clinic faster and safer than the traditional cell therapies .

@highlight Adult mammalian heart has a small but definitive myocyte turnover.
@highlight This turnover can be mobilized towards directing and enhancing heart repair.
@highlight Recent bioengineering strategies focus on extracellular vesicles and endogenous repair.
@highlight Use of bioactive factors and signaling mechanisms foster clinical translation.
