 Human leukocyte antigens are encoded by closely linked genetic loci and are important in cervical carcinogenesis . The association between HLA DRB1 alleles with cervical cancer has been studied extensively but results reported thus far have been inconsistent . Hence we performed a meta analysis to precisely assess this association . A literature search was conducted in various online databases to identify suitable articles . Case control studies investigating the association between HLA DRB1 alleles and cervical cancer were included in this study . Fixed and random effect models were used to calculate the pooled odds ratio and 95 confidence intervals . A total of 6645 cases and 9095 controls from 36 case control studies were included . Of the 13 HLA DRB1 family alleles DRB1 09 and DRB1 15 were associated with cervical cancer risk whilst DRB1 13 exerted a protective effect . Among the 44 HLA DRB1 specific alleles DRB1 04 01 DRB1 10 01 DRB1 11 01 DRB1 15 01 and DRB1 15 02 were associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer . However DRB1 04 06 DRB1 12 02 DRB1 13 01 DRB1 13 02 and DRB1 14 04 were associated with a decreased risk of cervical cancer . Subgroup analysis also revealed that HLA DRB1 alleles are associated with cervical cancer in Asian Caucasian Hispanic or Latin American and black sub Saharan Africa populations . Our meta analysis revealed that multiple HLA DRB1 alleles are associated with cervical cancer in women of diverse ancestry populations .
