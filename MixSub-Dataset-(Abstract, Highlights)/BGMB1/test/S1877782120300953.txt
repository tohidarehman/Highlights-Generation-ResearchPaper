 Unhealthy food environments may be associated with higher risks of developing diet related cancers such as colorectal cancer . We conducted an ecological analysis to evaluate the relationship between the local food environment and colorectal cancer incidence overall and separately for males and females . Data from the Texas Cancer Registry was utilized to geocode individuals aged 40 years and older diagnosed with colorectal cancer from 2005 to 2015 to their residential 2010 census tract . Total number of establishments classified as Limited Service Restaurants for each census tract was retrieved from the 2005 Business Patterns Survey by using a crosswalk to map zip codes to census tract . Census tract unhealthy food availability was calculated by dividing the estimated number of Limited Service Restaurant establishments in each census tract by the census tract population and divided into quartiles . Generalized estimating equations were used to assess the association between unhealthy food availability quartiles and colorectal cancer incidence . Adjusting for the census tract level sociodemographic characteristics the incidence of colorectal cancer was slightly higher in unhealthy food availability quartile 2 1.03 95 CI 1.001.05 but not quartile 3 and quartile 4 compared to census tracts with lowest unhealthy food availability . Colorectal cancer incidence was not strongly associated with census tracts with higher unhealthy food availability . Future observational studies should be conducted to examine the influence of the built environment on colorectal cancer risk .

@highlight Unhealthy food availability was weakly associated with colorectal cancer incidence
@highlight Higher rates of poverty were associated with higher colorectal cancer incidence
@highlight Research should examine how the built environment influences colorectal cancer risk
