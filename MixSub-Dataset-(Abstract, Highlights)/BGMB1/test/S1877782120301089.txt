 Based the important role of patient reported outcome in measuring patients QoL a general PRO instrument was designed for Chinese patients with cancer . The instrument was administered in eight hospitals . Based on PRO guidelines a conceptual framework and item pool were generated after literature review and patients interviews . Via two item selection process the original version of a cancer PRO measure was generated . Patients responsiveness was evaluated in four disease systems by item response theory . The reliability validity and feasibility of CA PROM were assessed . The minimum clinically important differences and risk thresholds of PRO were calculated . A total of 2213 valid questionnaires were collected . After expert opinions and cognitive tests 11 items were deleted . In the pre survey and formal survey 19 items were deleted based on six methods of classical test theory . In the respiratory digestive hematological and endocrine systems four items with poor responsiveness were deleted by item response theory . The final CA PROM included four domains 13 subdomains and 49 items . Reliability coefficients of 13 subdomain was The developed CA PROM exhibited good reliability validity and feasibility and can be used as an effective evaluation tool in cancer patients .

@highlight The developed scale was used as an effective evaluation tool for QoL of cancer patients.
@highlight Two methods including classical test theory and item response theory IRT was used to select items.
@highlight The method of calculating validity for ordinal categorical PRO data of small sample size OBID.
@highlight Explore potential subgroups and determine Risk thresholds of PRO.
