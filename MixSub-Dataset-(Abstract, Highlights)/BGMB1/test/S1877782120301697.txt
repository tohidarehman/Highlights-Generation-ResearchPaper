 Population based studies on the epidemiology of HCC are scarce . We aimed to compare CG with NCG analyze incidence etiology and survival among patients diagnosed in Iceland in a population based cohort . A previous study from Iceland showed an incidence of HCC of 1.1 100.000 mostly with NCG . A nationwide population based retrospective study . Information on patients with HCC during 19982017 was obtained and medical records viewed . Overall 152 patients with HCC were identified . The mean incidence was 1.7 100.000 and increased by 8 annually . Alcohol and hepatitis C combined was more common as a risk factor in CG than in the NCG . Tumor size was larger in NCG and portal vein thrombosis less common . Overall 44 in NCG underwent surgical treatment vs. 23 in CG . The proportion of patients diagnosed by surveillance in 19982007 was 3 and 19 in 20082017 . The disease specific median survival for cirrhotic patients diagnosed by surveillance was 519 days and 86 days in other cirrhotic patients hazard ratio 0.45 . A major increase in the incidence of patients with HCC has occurred . The non cirrhotic HCC presented with larger size tumors lower proportion of portal vein thrombosis and were more likely to be surgical candidates although not affecting prognosis . Diagnosis by surveillance in patients with cirrhosis has increased and the survival of those patients is better compared to others .

@highlight The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in Iceland has increased in the last two decades due to changes in risk factors.
@highlight Noncirrhotic Hepatocellular carcinoma differed from cirrhotic HCC regarding risk factors and pathology of the tumor.
@highlight Surveillance was found to increase survival in HCC patients.
