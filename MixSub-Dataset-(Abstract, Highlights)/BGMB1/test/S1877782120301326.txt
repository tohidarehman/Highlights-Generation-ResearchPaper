 Multimorbidity is associated with a high mortality rate and low health related quality of life . Previous studies have indicated that multimorbidity tends to be associated with not receiving cancer screening although this association remains unclear . This study aimed to investigate the associations between multimorbidity and the delivery of breast cervical and colorectal cancer screening in Japan and to identify subgroups that did not receive cancer screening . This study used cross sectional data from the 2016 Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions which used a stratified random sample of the general Japanese population . Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations between the number of chronic conditions and each cancers screening proportion . The relevant covariates included age marital status education level occupation and household income . Relative to subjects with no chronic conditions subjects with two chronic conditions received more screening for breast cervical and colorectal cancers 5.42 95 confidence interval 2.8010.5 cervical cancer aOR 4.59 95 CI 2.0310.4 male colorectal cancer aOR 3.26 95 CI 1.298.24 female colorectal cancer aOR 1.05 95 CI 0.392.81 . Low socioeconomic status was associated with not receiving any type of cancer screening consistently . Multimorbidity and high socioeconomic status were associated with higher proportions of screening for breast cervical and colorectal cancers in the Japanese population . More aggressive strategies may be needed to promote screening among Japanese individuals with no chronic conditions and individuals with low socioeconomic status .

@highlight Multimorbidity was associated with receiving cancer screening in Japan.
@highlight Socioeconomic status was an important determinant of receiving cancer screening.
@highlight Not receiving cancer screening was associated with diabetes as a comorbidity.
