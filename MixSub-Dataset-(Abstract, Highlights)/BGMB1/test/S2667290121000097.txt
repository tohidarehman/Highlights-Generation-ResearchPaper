 Wnt5a is a non canonical Wnt ligand that is essential for normal embryonic development in mammals . The role of Wnt5a in early intestinal development has been examined in gene ablation models where

@highlight We identified a subset of gut mesenchymal cells that co express the non canonical Wnt ligand Wnt5a and the winged helix transcription factor FoxL1 during development
@highlight Ablation of Wnt5a in epithelium adjacent FoxL1 cells caused increased apoptosis in the elongating epithelium resulting in a shortened gut tube at birth
@highlight FoxL1 positive mesenchymal cells are one of the relevant sources of Wnt5a during gut mammalian gut development
