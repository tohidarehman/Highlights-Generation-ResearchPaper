 This study quantifies geographic inequities in loss of life expectancy by area level socioeconomic status and accessibility to treatment . Analysis was conducted using a population based cancer registry cohort of Queensland residents aged 5089years diagnosed between 19972016 . Flexible parametric survival models were used to estimate LOLE by area level SES and accessibility for all invasive cancers and the five leading cancers . The gain in life years that could be achieved if all cancer patients experienced the same relative survival as those in the least disadvantaged high accessibility category was estimated for the 2016 cohort . For all invasive cancers men living in the most disadvantaged areas lost 34 of life expectancy due to their cancer diagnosis while those from the least disadvantaged areas lost 25 . The corresponding percentages for women were 33 and 23 . Accessibility had a lower impact on LOLE than SES with patients from low accessibility areas losing 04 more life expectancy than those from high accessibility areas . For cancer patients diagnosed in 2016 an estimated 101 387 life years will be lost . This would be reduced by 19 if all patients experienced the same relative survival as those from the least disadvantaged high accessibility areas . The impact of a cancer diagnosis on remaining life expectancy varies by geographical area . Establishing reasons why area disadvantage impacts on life expectancy is crucial to inform subsequent interventions that could increase the life expectancy of cancer patients from more disadvantaged areas .

@highlight Cancer patients living in most disadvantaged areas lost more life expectancy than those living in least disadvantaged areas.
@highlight Accessibility to health facilities has a less impact on loss of life expectancy than area level socioeconomic disadvantages.
@highlight In Queensland Australia an estimated 101 387 life years would be lost for cancer patients diagnosed in 2016.
@highlight Loss of life expectancy for 2016 cohort would reduce by 19 if all patients had the same survival as those in the most advantaged high access areas.
