 LCMS MS allows for many measurands monitoring different mass transitions simultaneously . So far such alternative mass transitions are usually assessed as quantifier and qualifier ions in order to rule out interferences in individual samples . However quantification can also be based on assessment of alternative mass transitions for both the measurand and its internal standard with two distinct results for one injection of an individual sample . These paired results can be averaged . The aim of this study was to determine the potential impact of this averaging approach on measurement imprecision . We studied the impact of averaging results from different transitions for four exemplary measurands piperacillin voriconazole ethylglucuronide . Intra batch studies were performed with 21 injections of single clinical samples in sequence for each analyte and a between batch study with evaluation of data from routine QC samples from 20 series over 20weeks . CVs and their confidence intervals were assessed comparatively for quantification based on single transitions and for averaged results from these two transitions respectively . In all data sets we observed lower CVs for the averaged results compared to the results obtained from single mass transitions . CVs from averaged results were up to 39.4 lower compared to the CVs observed for results obtained from single transitions for the respective measurands . Averaging of quantification results obtained from separate mass transitions acquired simultaneously in ID LC MS MS seems to have the potential to minimize the measurement imprecision for different measurands in short and long term settings .

@highlight Averaging of measurement results obtained from different mass transitions.
@highlight Multiple transition averaging can minimize imprecision by a moderate amount.
@highlight Use of qualifier ion as additonal quantifier ion.
@highlight May be particularly relevant for reference measurement procedures.
