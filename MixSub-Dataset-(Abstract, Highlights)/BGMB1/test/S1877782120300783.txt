 Selection bias due to non or incomplete compliance is challenging in surveys . Using data from a longitudinal survey in testicular cancer survivors we identify factors predicting incomplete compliance . In a questionnaire based national survey 1 813 5year TCSs were invited to report post treatment adverse health outcomes . We separated complete from partial participants completed the first waves questionnaire and 783 became complete and 653 partial participants . Poor socio economics unhealthy life style major co morbidity and chemotherapy related AHOs reported at the first survey wave were associated with a significant 1.51.9 times increased risk for partial participation . At the two last waves non responders had significantly decreased overall survival compared with responders . Our longitudinal study indicates positive selection bias during the 17 years of a longitudinal survey among TCSs with fewer AHOs among Complete than among Partial Participants . If not sufficiently compensated for by data from external sources and or statistical methods attrition bias in longitudinal surveys may limit the external validity of findings related to cancer survivors self reported AHOs .

@highlight Attrition bias challenges results from questionnaire based long term surveys.
@highlight We demonstrate positive patient selection in cancer survivors surveyed 30 years after treatment.
@highlight Non Responders had decreased survival compared with Responders.
@highlight Self reported adverse outcomes are negatively associated with survey participation.
