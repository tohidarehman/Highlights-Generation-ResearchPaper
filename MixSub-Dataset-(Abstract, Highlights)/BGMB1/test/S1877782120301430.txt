 Persons with Lynch syndrome have an increased risk of developing colorectal tumors . Adherence to diet quality indices associated with colorectal cancer risk in the general population has not been studied before in LS . Dietary habits of 490 participants with LS from a prospective cohort study was collected using a food frequency questionnaire . The Dutch Healthy Diet index 2015 and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension were used to score food based diet quality . Diet quality scores were divided into tertiles where a higher tertile reflects a higher diet quality . Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the association between the DHD15 index DASH score and CRT risk . During a median follow up time of 53.4 months 210 participants developed CRTs . The DHD index and DASH score were not associated with CRT risk hazard ratios for highest vs. lowest tertile were 1.00 0.67 1.48 and 1.11 respectively . No linear trends across the DHD index and DASH score tertiles were observed . In contrast to observations in the general population no evidence for an association between the food based DHD15 index or DASH score and CRT risk was observed in persons with LS . Further studies are needed investigating the association between diet quality and mechanisms leading to the development of LS associated tumors .

@highlight Both the Dutch Healthy Diet index 2015 DHD15 index and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension DASH score are inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk in the general population.
@highlight The DHD15 index and the DASH score were not associated with colorectal tumor risk in persons with Lynch Syndrome LS .
@highlight Further studies should investigate the association between diet quality and mechanisms leading to the development of LS associated tumors.
