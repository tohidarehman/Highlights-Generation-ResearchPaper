 Socioeconomic inequalities in colorectal cancer survival are a major concern of the Spanish public health system . If these inequalities were mainly due to differences in stage at diagnosis population based screening programs might reduce them substantially . We aimed to determine to what extent adverse stage distribution contributed to survival inequalities in a Spanish region before the implementation of a CRC screening program . We analyzed data from a population based cohort study that included all patients living in a region of southern Spain with CRC diagnosed between 2004 and 2013 . The European Deprivation Index was used to assign each patient a socioeconomic level based on their area of residence . The role of tumor stage in survival disparities between socioeconomic groups was assessed using a causal mediation analysis . A total of 2802 men and 1957 women were included in the study . For men the adjusted difference in deaths between the most deprived and the most affluent areas was 131 deaths per 1000 person years by the first year after diagnosis . Of these deaths 42 were attributable to differences in stage at diagnosis . No socioeconomic disparities in survival were detected among female patients . In this study we mainly detected socioeconomic disparities in short term survival of male patients . More than two thirds of these inequalities could not be attributed to differences in stage at diagnosis . Our results suggest that in addition to a screening program other public health interventions are necessary to reduce the deprivation gap in survival .

@highlight First population based study on the association between socioeconomic inequalities and colorectal cancer survival in Spain.
@highlight The role of the stage at diagnosis in survival inequalities was assessed using a causal mediation analysis.
@highlight Socioeconomic difference in survival was observed mainly in the short term after diagnosis and only for men.
@highlight Only one third of the observed disparities in survival were due to differences in stage.
