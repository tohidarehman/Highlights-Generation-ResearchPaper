 This study aimed to investigate the association between physical activity and site specific cancer incidence . UK Biobank is a prospective population based cohort study . 364 899 adults were included . The exposure variable was physical activity level derived from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form . Participants were categorised at high moderate or low levels of activity following standardised IPAQ SF scoring guidance . Primary outcome measures included incident cancers at 20 sites . Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95 confidence intervals showing relationships between physical activity and cancer . 21 816 incident cancers were identified . Significant associations were identified between high physical activity levels and lower risk of lung breast hepatobiliary tract and colon cancers compared to low physical activity levels . Moderate levels of physical activity were associated with significantly lower risk of oropharyngeal and lung cancer compared to low physical activity levels . Sensitivity analyses showed associations of higher physical activity with lower oesophageal and higher prostate cancer incidence . Regular physical activity is significantly associated with reduced risk for lung breast hepatobiliary tract colon and oropharyngeal cancers . Our findings highlight the importance of physical activity promotion particularly high levels of physical activity in cancer prevention .

@highlight Moderate physical activity levels were associated with lower risk of oropharyngeal and lung cancers.
@highlight High physical activity levels were associated with lung breast hepatobiliary and colon cancers.
@highlight Sensitivity analyses showed associations with lower oesophageal and higher prostate cancer incidence.
@highlight Results varied by deprivation smoking or combined body fat and physical activity.
@highlight Promoting high levels of physical activity may be required for cancer prevention.
