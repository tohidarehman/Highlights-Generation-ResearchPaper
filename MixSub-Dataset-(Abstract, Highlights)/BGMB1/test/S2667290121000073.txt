 Rab35 is a small GTPase that regulates plasma membrane to early endosome vesicular trafficking and mediates actin remodeling to form actin rich cellular structures . While the function of Rab35 in the cellular context has been examined its role during development has not been well studied . In this study we take advantage of the sea urchin s high fecundity external fertilization and transparent embryos to determine the function of Rab35 during development . We found that loss of function of Rab35 results in defects in skeletogenesis and gastrulation which were rescued by co injection of sea urchin
