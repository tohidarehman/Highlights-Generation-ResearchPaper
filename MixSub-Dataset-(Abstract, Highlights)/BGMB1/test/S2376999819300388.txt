 Misregulated chromatin remodeling via erroneous histone acetylation has been linked with multiple diseases including many age associated maladies . Previous studies on histone acetylation have utilized specific histone acetylation antibodies as a primary quantification tool . However antibodies that target specific histone modifications frequently lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity making signal quantification and data interpretation difficult . Here we used mass spectrometry to quantify the acetylation patterns of histone H4 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from human patients of varying age . We observed that mono acetylation of H4K16ac is lower in midlife human PBMCs and that various changes occur in the H4 acetylation signature using PBMCs prepared from old patients . Our data corroborates previous work suggesting that ageing might be characterized by specific changes in the acetylation states of histone H4 and shows that targeted mass spectrometry together with appropriate quantification methods can be used to sensitively measure such changes .

@highlight Histone acetylations can be precisely quantified in hPBMCs.
@highlight Histone H4 acetylation changes specifically during ageing.
@highlight Age related changes are evolutionary conserved.
