 REM sleep was initially described in mammals and was later found in birds . As the results obtained in reptiles were unconvincing this suggested for years that only homeothermic species have REM sleep . However recent studies in lizards also suggest the presence of two electrophysiological states and provide a better picture of their sleep . Nevertheless due to differences in the expression of these states in two lizard species as well as missing information homology with mammalian REM sleep still could not be established . As ectotherms and homeotherms have very different physiology and neuroanatomy we expect that even if a state like REM sleep exists in ectotherms its phenotypic expression should be different . Therefore we think that a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of REM sleep will come from efforts to examine both the similarities and difference between sleep states in homeotherms and ectotherms .

@highlight A third of the papers on sleep in reptiles reported a REM sleep like state.
@highlight However none of these studies provides enough clues to postulate a true homology with mammalian REM sleep.
@highlight As reptiles are not capable of expressing all the traits that define mammalian REM sleep the quest to identify the same state in reptiles could be unfounded.
@highlight The origin of REM sleep will be revealed through more comparative studies focused on how animals sleep rather than whether they have REM sleep as defined in mammals.
