 In mammals including humans the convention defining rapid eye movement sleep also called paradoxical sleep states that it is mainly characterized by a low voltage fast electrocortical rhythms rapid eye movements and a muscle atonia occasionally accompanied by brief distal twitches . When facing sleep pathologies all these criteria are not always met and identifying REM sleep becomes thus a challenge . Here we review such criteria and report the adjustments proposed to identify and measure REM sleep in animal models of sleep pathologies such as REM sleep Behaviour Disorder and narcolepsy type 1 . We also argue that video recordings synchronized to multi parametric polysomnography are mandatory to recognize REM sleep and differentiate it from dissociated states in animal models of sleep disorders .

@highlight A consensual definition for transitions from NREM to REM sleep is needed to compare data obtained in different laboratories.
@highlight The use of multi parametric polysomnography is of great help to score vigilance states in animal models of sleep disorders.
@highlight Video recording synchronized to polysomnography is necessary to analyse vigilance states in animal models of sleep pathologies.
@highlight Video recording is required to appropriately recognize REM sleep from potential dissociated states.
