 With the prevalence of cancer survivors increasing their unique needs must be better understood . We examined the health lifestyles and social circumstances of adults with and without a history of cancer . We performed a cross sectional study using exposure and outcome data from the baseline survey of participants in the 45 and Up Study a prospective cohort study in New South Wales Australia . We compared 20 811 cancer registry verified adult cancer survivors with 207 148 participants without a history of cancer using propensity score weighting and accounting for multiple testing . The propensity weighting included age sociodemographic factors and number of self reported co morbidities . Cancer survivors were more likely to report poorer physical and psychological health and quality of life compared to those without a cancer history with most deficits still evident more than 10 years after cancer diagnosis . Cancer survivors were more likely to have a higher body mass index but were less likely to smoke . Cancer survivors had greater functional limitations including sexual and were less likely to work full time volunteer and spend time outdoors . Their social connectedness was however similar . Those with haematological cancer lung cancer or distant metastases and those diagnosed at an older age had the greatest health deficits and functional limitations . A history of cancer is associated with poorer health and less paid and unpaid work . Our findings reinforce the importance of routine long term integrated multidisciplinary care for cancer survivors and indicate the subgroups with the greatest unmet needs .
