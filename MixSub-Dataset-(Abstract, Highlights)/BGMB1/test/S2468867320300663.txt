 Noise induced hearing loss has been well investigated across diverse mammalian species and the potential for prevention of NIHL is of broad interest . To most efficiently develop novel therapeutic interventions a good understanding of the current state of knowledge regarding mechanisms of injury is essential . The overarching goals of this review are to 1 concisely summarize the current state of knowledge and 2 provide opinions on the most significant future trends and developments .

@highlight Noise induced hearing loss NIHL remains a major public health issue.
@highlight Studies in animal models show that both sensory hair cells and cochlear synapses are vulnerable to noise injury.
@highlight Noise injury may compromise hearing in noise or other suprathreshold sound processing ability.
@highlight Monitoring individuals using supra threshold tests could provide the ability to diagnose early cochlear pathology.
@highlight Clinical testing of therapeutic drug agents for hearing loss prevention and restoration are ongoing.
