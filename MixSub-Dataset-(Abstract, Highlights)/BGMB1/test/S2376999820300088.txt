 Carbapenemase producing organisms are a growing threat to human health . Among the enzymes conferring antibiotic resistance produced by these organisms The objective of this study is to develop an intact protein mass spectrometry based method for detection and differentiation of clinically relevant KPC variants directly from bacterial cell lysates . The method should be specific for any variant expressed in multiple bacterial species limit false positive results and be rapid in nature to directly influence clinical outcomes . Lysates obtained directly from bacterial colonies were used for intact protein detection using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry . Bottom up and top down proteomic methods were used to characterize the KPC protein targets of interest . Comparisons between KPC producing and KPC non producing isolates from a wide variety of species were also performed . Characterization of the mature KPC protein revealed an unexpected signal peptide cleavage site preceding an AXA signal peptide motif modifying the molecular weight of the mature protein . Taking the additional AXA residues into account allowed for direct detection of the intact protein using top down proteomic methods . Further validation was performed by transforming a KPC harboring plasmid into a negative control strain followed by MS detection of the KPC variant from the transformed cell line . Application of this approach to clearly identify clinically relevant variants among several species is presented for KPC 2 KPC 3 KPC 4 and KPC 5 . Direct detection of these enzymes contributes to the understanding of occurrence and spread of these antibiotic resistant organisms . The ability to detect intact KPC variants via a simple LC MS MS approach could have a direct and positive impact on clinical therapy by providing both direction for epidemiological tracking and appropriate therapy .
