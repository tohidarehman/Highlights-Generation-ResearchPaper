 Acute myocardial infarction is a common cause of the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases in the world . Acute MI lead to cardiovascular output after formation of myocardial ischemia and circulatory arrest in coronary heart diseases . However the mechanisms underlying MI injury are poorly understood . We explored the part played by miR 26a in myocardial infarction . Decreased miR 26a expression in H PI3K Akt and JAK STAT signal transduction pathways were found to be regulated through cross talk between miR 26a and PTEN . Furthermore agomiR 26a treatment in MI mouse model considerably suppressed the size of the infarcted regions and improved cardiac activity . MiR 26a expression in MI cardiac tissues was downregulated in response to H
