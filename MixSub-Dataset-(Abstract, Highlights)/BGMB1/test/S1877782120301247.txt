 Determining the validity of self reported data is important . The aim of this study was to assess the validity of self reported cancer and investigate factors associated with accurate reporting in men and women . Study participants from the Geelong Osteoporosis Study located in south eastern Australia were utilised . Self reported cancer data were compared to Victorian Cancer Registry records . Age socioeconomic status education and time between cancer diagnosis and study appointment were investigated as factors associated with accuracy of self report . There were 142 participants who self reported a cancer and 135 with a VCR record . Comparing self report to any registry record sensitivity was 63.7 specificity 96.5 PPV 60.6 NPV 96.9 and overall agreement 0.588 . Comparing exact match records sensitivity was 58.8 specificity 95.5 PPV 49.3 NPV 96.9 and overall agreement 0.499 . In logistic regression models post secondary education was independently associated with accuracy of any and exact match self report compared to cancer registry record . For any cancer being aged 70 years was inversely associated with accuracy . Likewise for matched cancer reporting those aged 6070 years and 70 years were less accurate . No other significant associations were detected . Results suggest moderate agreement between self report and registry data for any cancer among men and women . However when comparing self report to registry data for exact match cancer type level of overall agreement deteriorated . Self report cancer data may be acceptable for determining a history of cancer although is less accurate in identifying history of specific cancer types documented in registry based data .

@highlight Moderate agreement was observed between self report and registry data for any cancer among men and women.
@highlight Agreement deteriorated when cancer cases were matched by ICD 10 classification. Overall agreement was poor for Melanoma.
@highlight Women recorded lower sensitivity specificity and PPV for self report of any and exact match cancer compared to men.
@highlight Education was associated with better accuracy of self report data and older age was associated with poorer accuracy.
@highlight Self report cancer data is less accurate in identifying history of specific cancer types documented in registry based data.
