 The relationship between deprivation and oral cancer is complex . We examined magnitude and shape of deprivation related inequalities in oral cancer in England 2012 2016 . Oral cancer was indicated by cancers of the lip and oral cavity and lip oral cavity and pharynx and deprivation by the Index of Multiple Deprivation . Deprivation inequality in incidence and mortality rates of oral cancer outcomes was measured using the Relative Index of Inequality . Fractional polynomial regression was used to explore the shape of the relationships between deprivation and oral cancer outcomes . Multivariate regression models were fitted with the appropriate functions to examine the independent effect of deprivation on cancer adjusting for smoking alcohol and ethnicity . Incidence rate ratios and mortality rate ratios were greater for more deprived areas . The RII values indicated significant inequalities for oral cancer outcomes but the magnitude of inequalities were greater for mortality . The relationships between deprivation and oral cancer outcomes were curvilinear . Deprivation Asian ethnicity and alcohol consumption were associated with higher incidence and mortality rates of oral cancer . This is the first study to our knowledge exploring the shape of socioeconomic inequalities in oral cancer at neighbourhood level . Deprivation related inequalities were present for all oral cancer outcomes with a steeper rise at the more deprived end of the deprivation spectrum . Deprivation predicted oral cancer even after accounting for other risk factors .

@highlight Area level deprivation was directly linked with oral cancer incidence and mortality.
@highlight Effect of deprivation on oral cancer was stronger at the end of the deprivation spectrum.
@highlight Area level deprivation was an independent risk factor for oral cancer.
