 The main evidence regarding social inequalities in cancer risk comes from industrialized countries . The aim of this manuscript was to analyze the association between cancer incidence and socioeconomic position in a middle income country between 2011 and 2015 . An ecological study at the level of the electoral district was conducted . The 477 districts were divided by area and wealth using the 2011 Census . The sample was defined using the National Electoral Rolls used for presidential elections of 2006 and 2010 . 44 799 cancer cases were included coming from the Costa Rican Cancer Registry . Cox models were used . All cancer sites combined we observed a positive gradient with incidence being lower in the poorest districts than in the wealthiest HRQ3 0.92 HRQ4 0.83 . For colon skin breast prostate thyroid and other cancer sites a positive social gradient was observed . For stomach lung and cervical cancers a negative social gradient was found . For uterine cancer and lymphoma there was no significant relationship between wealth and incidence . For skin cancer incidence was higher in rural as compared to urban areas after adjustment for wealth . For lung cervical and uterine cancer incidence was lower in rural as compared to urban area after adjustment for wealth . The all cancer combined results were in contradiction with the international literature but confirmed recent study results in Costa Rica . It confirmed the importance of studying socioeconomic inequalities in middle income countries .

@highlight A positive social gradient in all cancer combined incidence in Costa Rica.
@highlight The relationship between socioeconomic position and cancer incidence varied according to the cancer site.
@highlight For skin cancer incidence was higher in rural as compared to urban areas after adjustment for wealth.
@highlight For lung cervical and uterine cancer incidence was lower in rural as compared to urban area after adjustment for wealth.
