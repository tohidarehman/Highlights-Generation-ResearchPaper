 Vitamin D plays a vital role in successful pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and fetus . Vitamin D is bound to vitamin D binding protein in blood and is carried to the liver kidneys and other target tissues . Accurate measurements of the clinically measured metabolite of vitamin D 25 hydroxyvitamin D D depend on complete removal from the binding protein . It has been found that VDBP concentrations increase in maternal serum during pregnancy obfuscating the accuracy of 25D concentration measurements in pregnant women . Additionally measurements of VDBP concentrations during pregnancy have been performed using immunoassays which suffer from variations due to differences in antibody epitopes making clinical comparisons difficult . Quantification of VDBP is also of interest because changes in VDBP expression levels may indicate negative outcomes during pregnancy such as preterm delivery and restricted fetal growth . To address the need for accurate measurement of VDBP during pregnancy a method using liquid chromatography isotope dilution mass spectrometry was developed to quantify VDBP using isotopically labeled peptides as internal standards . This method was used to quantify VDBP in Standard Reference Material 1949 Frozen Human Prenatal Serum which was prepared from separate serum pools of women who were not pregnant and women during each trimester of pregnancy . VDBP concentrations were found to be lowest in the serum pool from non pregnant women and increased in each trimester . These data had good repeatability and were found to be suitable for reference value assignment of VDBP in SRM 1949 .
