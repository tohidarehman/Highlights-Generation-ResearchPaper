 Patients with disorders differences of sex development especially those possessing the Y chromosome have a higher risk of gonadal germ cell tumours . We aimed to examine the incidence of different types of gonadal neoplasia and associated risk factors . A total of 1040 DSD patients aged 16 years participated in a cross sectional multicentre European study . Data on medical history were gathered from the patients archival medical documents . A web based questionnaire was filled out individually by the participants . A physical examination was performed in all while ultrasonography of gonads was carried out in 214 and semen analysis was performed for 53 patients . Germ cell neoplasia was present in 12 of patients with DSD and in 14 of those with XY DSD . The highest risk was observed in 46 XY patients with gonadal dysgenesis complete GD and partial GD but also in mixed GD and complete androgen insensitivity syndrome . It was not reported in partial AIS XX male 46 XX DSD and congenital adrenal hyperplasia Turner and Klinefelter syndromes or in androgen biosynthesis defects . Benign sex cord stromal tumours were noted only in patients with complete AIS and Klinefelter syndrome . A relationship between risk factors for GCT and gonadal neoplasia appearance other than the Y chromosome was not found . Adult patients with GD and the Y chromosome have the highest risk of GCT and should be kept under thorough medical control and receive special medical follow up to prevent the development of gonadal tumours .

@highlight Patients with DSD and the Y chromosome have the highest risk of gonadal germ cell neoplasia.
@highlight Particularly high risk concerns patients with complete partial and mixed gonadal dysgenesis.
@highlight Patients with CAIS and Klinefelter syndrome have higher risk of somatic cell neoplasia in gonads.
@highlight Adult patients with gonadal dysgenesis and the Y chromosome should be under thorough medical control.
