 Memory reactivations occur during different states and behaviours and they may serve a multitude of functions . In this review we summarize differences in content participating brain regions and neuromodulatory milieu of these reactivations . Further we highlight how such differences could lead to the same phenomena of memory reactivation having different possible functions and outcomes such as memory retrieval cellular consolidation and systems consolidation .

@highlight During wake and sleep memories are reactivated.
@highlight There is a difference in neurotransmitter milieu across sleep and wake.
@highlight Changes in dopamine acetylcholine noradrenaline influence outcome of reactivations.
@highlight Both upregulation and downregulation of synapses are possible.
