 The aim of the study was to characterize subsequent neoplasm benign and non melanoma skin cancer treated previously for a childhood solid malignant tumor at the Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Motol University Hospital Prague . We evaluated a cohort of 4059 childhood cancer survivors treated between 1975 and 2018 . From 4059 survivors 170 developed at least one SMN 193 SMNs in 170 survivors 21 of them had two or more SMNs and 34 of them had one SMN and one or more BSNs . Mortality for an SMN was 38.2 i.e . 1.6 of all survivors . The most frequent SMNs were thyroid carcinoma tumors of the central nervous system soft tissue sarcoma breast carcinoma and leukemia . Genetic syndromes were present in 25 patients with SMNs and in 16 patients with only BSNs . SMNs usually developed in second decade or later after finishing of therapy . We observed some not well known risk factors of SNs e.g . spinal irradiation or We confirmed data from previous studies of SNs and observed some not so well known risk factors . Our results and the literature show that the incidence of SMNs is 310 of survivors and is associated with high mortality .

@highlight We evaluated 4059 childhood cancer survivors treated between 1975 and 2018.
@highlight Second malignant neoplasms SMN occur in 4.2 of survivors and have mortality 38.2 .
@highlight Most frequent SMNs are thyroid central nervous system soft tissue and breast tumors.
@highlight The highest risk of SMN have Hodgkin lymphoma survivors 9.6 of HL survivors .
@highlight Second non melanoma skin cancer or benign tumor are signs of increased SMN risk.
