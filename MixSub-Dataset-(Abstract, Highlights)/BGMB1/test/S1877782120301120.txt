 Mitochondrial DNA copy number is considered a biomarker for mitochondrial function and oxidative stress . Although previous studies have suggested a potential relationship between mtDNAcn at the time of colorectal cancer diagnosis and CRC prognosis findings have been inconsistent and no study has specifically investigated the association of pre diagnostic mtDNAcn with CRC survival . We examined the association of pre diagnostic leukocyte mtDNAcn with overall and CRC specific survival among 587 patients in Nurses Health Study and Health Professionals Follow Up Study . Cox models were constructed to estimate hazard ratios and 95 confidence intervals . During a mean follow up of 10.5 years 395 deaths were identified 180 were due to CRC . Overall we did not observe significant associations between mtDNAcn and either overall or CRC specific survival among all cases or by cancer location grade or stage . In an exploratory stratified analysis a suggestive inverse association of mtDNAcn and overall death risk appeared among current smokers for 1 SD decrease in mtDNAcn 1.50 no significant associations between pre diagnostic leukocyte mtDNAcn and either overall or CRC specific survival appeared but exploratory analysis identified potential sub group associations .

@highlight Mitochondrial DNA copy number MtDNAcn is a biomarker for mitochondrial function oxidative stress.
@highlight No study has examined the association of pre diagnostic mtDNAcn with colorectal cancer CRC survival.
@highlight Overall we found leukocyte mtDNAcn may not be a significant biomarker for survival among CRC patients.
@highlight Subgroup analyses suggested an inverse association of mtDNAcn and overall death risk among current smokers.
@highlight MtDNAcn may have a prognostic value for CRC patients consuming a low inflammatory diet diagnosed 70.5 or 5 years from mtDNAcn measurement.
