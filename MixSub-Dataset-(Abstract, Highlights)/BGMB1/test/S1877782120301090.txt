 LongAn Guangxi was the first county in China to implement universal childhood hepatitis B virus immunization . We aimed to determine its long term effects in preventing hepatocellular carcinoma 32 years after the immunization programme was launched . Information on HCC deaths for LongAn and its neighbouring county BinYang were obtained from the national mortality surveillance system . The data were analysed using Poisson regression . The overall age adjusted mortalities of HCC in LongAn and BinYang during 20172018 were 53.3 100 000 and 45.4 100 000 respectively . The mortality of males aged 2029 years in LongAn who were vaccinated at birth was lower than that of males in BinYang who were not vaccinated . In LongAn the HCC mortality in adults aged 2029 years declined significantly from 7.9 100 000 in 2004 to 1.4 100 000 in 20172018 Immunization of infants against HBV has reduced their risk of developing HCC as children and young adults but could not prevent all cases of HCC suggesting that the major risk factor for HCC in hyperendemic regions is shifting from HBV to other factors . Additional prevention strategies for HCC will be needed in the future .
