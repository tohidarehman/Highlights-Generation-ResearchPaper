 To estimate a possible association between coffee intake during pregnancy and risk of childhood acute leukemia by using a cohort design . We included data from two birth cohorts the Danish National Birth Cohort and the Aarhus Birth Cohort . Recruitment of 141 216 eligible pregnancies occurred from 1 August 1989 to 31 December 2012 . Information on maternal prenatal coffee intake and covariates was collected in early second trimester of pregnancy . Information on childhood AL diagnosed in offspring was obtained from the Danish National Patient Register . We used competing risk time to event regression analysis using the pseudo observation method to estimate risk ratio with no coffee intake during pregnancy considered the reference group . In total 96 children were diagnosed with AL hereof 73 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Coffee intake of 0.53 cups day during pregnancy was not associated with a higher risk of childhood AL aRR 0.89 95 confidence interval 0.48 1.65 however an intake of 3 cups day resulted in aRR 1.37 95 CI 0.56 3.32 . Only including ALL as outcome we found similar results aRR 0.80 95 CI 0.371.74 and aRR 1.46 95 CI 0.524.09 respectively . We found no significant association between maternal coffee intake and risk of childhood AL but the number of cases was limited . The confidence limits does not exclude that a high prenatal coffee intake may increase the risk of childhood AL and larger studies based on prospective data are needed .

@highlight Cohort study including more than 140 000 mother offspring dyads.
@highlight This study does not support an association between moderate coffee intake during pregnancy and risk of acute leukemia in offspring.
