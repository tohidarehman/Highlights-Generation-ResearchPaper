 Although there is some evidence of positive associations between both the glycemic index and glycemic load with cancer risk the relationships with lung cancer risk remain largely unexplored . We evaluated the associations between GI and GL with lung cancer . The analyses were performed using data from a population based case control study recruited between 1999 and 2004 in Los Angeles County . Dietary factors were collected from 593 incident lung cancer cases and 1026 controls using a modified food frequency questionnaire . GI and GL were estimated using a food composition table . Adjusted odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals were estimated using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders . Dietary GI was positively associated with lung cancer . For histologic subtypes positive associations were observed between GI and adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma . No clear association between GL and lung cancer was observed . These findings suggest that high dietary GI was associated with increased lung cancer risk and the positive associations were observed for both lung adenocarcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma . Replication in an independent dataset is merited for a broader interpretation of our results .

@highlight Glycemic index was associated with increased lung cancer risk.
@highlight Positive associations of glycemic index on adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma.
@highlight Stronger associations in individuals who had smoked BMI 25 and no diabetes history.
