 The inflammatory skin wound response is regulated by argonaute 2 bound microRNAs such as miR 139 5p which inhibit transcription of their target mRNAs . Jiang Tang Xiao Ke is a traditional Chinese medicine that reduces miR 139 5p expression suggesting that topical application of JTXK may have effects on wound healing . miR 139 miR 139 miR 139 5p negatively regulates the neutrophilic response during

@highlight We demonstrate that the microRNA miR 139 5p is vital in skin wound healing.
@highlight miR 139
@highlight mice display impaired sterile wound healing but improved infected wound healing.
@highlight miR 139
@highlight mice show elevated neutrophilic activation and upregulation of Eif4g2.
@highlight miR 139
@highlight neutrophils enhanced infected wound healing in an Eif4g2 dependent manner.
@highlight Topical JTXK also enhanced wound healing in a miR 139 5p dependent manner.
