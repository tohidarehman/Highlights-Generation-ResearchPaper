 Little is known about the etiology of childhood Wilms tumor and potentially modifiable maternal risk factors in particular . Unpublished data derived from the hospital based case control study of the Greek Nationwide Registry for Childhood Hematological Malignancies and Solid Tumors were included in an Effect estimates from 72 cases and 72 age and sex matched controls contributed by NARECHEM ST were meta analysed together with those of another 17 mainly medium size studies of ecological case control and cohort design . Maternal intake of folic acid and or other vitamins supplements during pregnancy was inversely associated with WT risk 6 studies OR 0.78 95 CI 0.690.89 I In the largest to date meta analysis there was an inverse association of maternal folic acid or vitamins supplementation with WT risk in the offspring derived mainly from ecological studies . The association with maternal alcohol consumption found in our study needs to be further explored whereas no association with maternal smoking was detected . Given the proven benefits for other health conditions recommendations regarding folic acid supplementation as well as smoking and alcohol cessation should apply . The maternal alcohol consumption associations however should be further explored given the inherent limitations in the assessment of exposures of the published studies .

@highlight There seems to be an inverse association of maternal folate vitamins supplementation with WT risk.
@highlight The association of WT with maternal alcohol consumption should be further explored.
@highlight Modifiable maternal lifestyle factors in the etiology of WT should be further explored.
