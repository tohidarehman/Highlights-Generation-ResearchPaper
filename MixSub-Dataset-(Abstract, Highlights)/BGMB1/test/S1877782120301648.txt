 In the UK inequalities exist in prostate cancer incidence survival and treatment by area deprivation and rurality . This work aimed to identify variation in patient reported outcomes of men with prostate cancer by area type . A population based survey of men 1842 months after prostate cancer diagnosis measured self assessed health using the EQ 5D and five functional domains using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite . Mean SAH was higher for men in least deprived areas compared to most deprived . SAH scores were lower for men in most urban areas compared to most rural . Equivalent estimates in the general population reported a 13 point difference by deprivation and a 4 point difference by rurality . For each EPIC 26 domain functional outcomes were better for men in the least deprived areas with clinically meaningful differences observed for urinary incontinence and hormonal function . There were no clinically meaningful differences in EPIC 26 outcomes by rurality with less than a three point difference in scores for each domain between urban and rural areas . In men 1842 months post diagnosis of prostate cancer in the UK impacts of area deprivation and rurality on self assessed health related quality of life were not greater than would be expected in the general population . However clinically meaningful differences were identified for some prostate functional outcomes by deprivation . No impact by rurality of residence was identified .

@highlight National study exploring the impact of deprivation and rurality on health related quality of life following prostate cancer.
@highlight The impact of deprivation and rurality on HRQL was not greater than would be expected in the general population.
@highlight Some functional prostate specific outcomes were affected by deprivation.
@highlight No clinically meaningful differences in HRQL were identified by rurality of residence.
