 In tandem mass spectrometry analyte detection is based on collision induced fragmentation which is modulated by the collision energy setting . Variation in CE leads to differential ion yield and optimization is usually performed empirically as tuning during method development . Our aim was to build a method to objectify the impact of collision energy settings on ion yield for individual compounds . Collision energy breakdown curves were generated based on acquisition files in which a large number of quasi identical mass transitions were recorded simultaneously with variation of CE over a defined range within a single injection . Ion yield was plotted as a curve versus CE settings . Piperacillin and testosterone were studied as exemplary analytes in matrix free and serum matrix based liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry measurements . More detailed testosterone CE breakdown curves were investigated with regard to sample preparation techniques and the isotope labeling pattern of corresponding internal standards . CE breakdown curves were found characteristically for the piperacillin quantifier transition with respect to CE related maximum ion yield as well as curve width and shape . A diverging curve profile was observed for the piperacillin qualifier transition . For testosterone analyses no impact from different sample preparation techniques or the isotope labeling patterns on the selected CE was shown . CE breakdown curves are a convenient and valuable tool to verify LC MS MS methods regarding consistent fragmentation characteristics between sample sources or native analytes and isotope labeled counterparts .
