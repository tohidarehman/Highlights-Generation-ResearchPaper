 Outdoor artificial light at night has been implicated in a growing number of adverse health outcomes . ALAN is believed to disrupt circadian rhythms and has been associated with increased inflammation one of the hallmarks of cancer . We examined the association between outdoor ALAN and a cancer strongly associated with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions non Hodgkin lymphoma in the prospective California Teachers Study cohort . Outdoor ALAN was assigned to participant addresses at study baseline through use of the New World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness . Among 105 937 women followed from 1995 to 2015 linkage to the California Cancer Registry identified 873 incident cases of NHL . Age stratified Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios and 95 confidence intervals for overall NHL and the most common NHL subtypes diffuse large B cell lymphoma follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma . Multivariate analyses adjusted for previously reported subtype specific covariates for DLBCL . Compared to the lowest quintile participants residing in the highest quintile of outdoor ALAN at baseline were more likely to develop NHL and in particular DLBCL . The elevated risk for DLBCL remained statistically significant after adjusting for age race ethnicity BMI and socioeconomic status . There was no association between ALAN and FL or CLL SLL . DLBCL risk was elevated among women residing in neighborhoods with greater outdoor ALAN . Future research in circadian disruption and DLBCL may clarify potential biological processes implicated in this association .

@highlight The New World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness was used to assess exposure to light at night.
@highlight There was increased risk of NHL for those in highest quintile of light at night.
@highlight The risk association was strongest for the DLBCL subtype.
@highlight The World Atlas is a unique resource for studying health effects associated with light at night.
