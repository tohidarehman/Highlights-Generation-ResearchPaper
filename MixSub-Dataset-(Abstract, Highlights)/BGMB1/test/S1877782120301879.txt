 Incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease has increased substantially in developed countries during the past decades . We aimed to analyze trends in incidence of esophageal cancer by histological subtypes and trends in acid suppressing drugs prescription in the Czech Republic . The incidence of EC by histological subtypes sex and stage from 19842017 was examined using data from the Czech National Cancer Registry . Defined daily doses of acid inhibiting drugs were analyzed from annual reports by the State Institute for Drug Control . Age standardized incidence of EAC in men increased annually by 4.88 with 95 confidence interval from 1984 to 2017 and by 5.11 in women . Squamous cell carcinoma increased annually by 5.52 from 1984 to 1994 with subsequent slower increase by 0.87 from 1994 to 2017 . It still represents 50 of all EC in 2017 . The comparable early stages of EAC showed similar annual percentage change of 5.77 . From 2001 to 2018 the use of proton pump inhibitors increased dramatically from 6.8 to 72.9 defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants . The incidence of EAC is still increasing in the Czech Republic however it represents less than half of ECs . The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma is relatively stable . Broad use of acid suppressing drugs did not seem to impact the incidence of EAC even in early stages .

@highlight Esophageal cancer incidence by histology was studied over the past three decades.
@highlight Squamous cell carcinoma is still the predominant subtype 50 .
@highlight Increasing esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence with time shift in western countries.
@highlight No association between use of proton pump inhibitors and adenocarcinoma incidence.
