 Infection is hypothesised as a contributory cause of childhood immune cell malignancies . Although some have reported associations between individual infections and immune cell malignancies some could be spurious due to infections caused by malignancies that were already active prior to diagnosis . Identified from Taiwan Cancer Registry 3000 children with four commonest immune cell malignancies diagnosed during 20012015 at age 120 years were identified and matched with 1 10 controls . Using logistic regression we estimated the time specific case versus control odds ratios of seven common infection presentations in their health records . We also compared recorded unexplained lymph nodes between cases and controls to explore for how long malignancy may be active prior to diagnosis . Unexplained lymph nodes were increasingly recorded months before the diagnosis of childhood leukaemias and years before the diagnosis of childhood lymphomas . When using p 0.01 as a guide large case control differences in infection records were found mostly within 02 months prior to the diagnosis . Changes in odds ratios within 335 months and case control differences beyond 36 months prior to diagnosis was relatively small . Statistical power varied according to incidence of malignancy incidence of infection records and the age distribution . Immune cell malignancies were likely to be active some time before the diagnosis . Previous studies using conventional population based methods may not be able to distinguish any small causal link between infection and immune cell malignancies from spurious associations .

@highlight Associations between individual infections and childhood immune cell malignancies have been reported.
@highlight Some associations may be due to infection caused by malignancies already active prior to diagnosis.
@highlight Guided by unexplained lymph nodes we found malignancies could be active years before diagnosis.
@highlight We also found increase in multiple infection presentations prior to malignancy diagnosis.
@highlight In all most apparent associations could not be largely attributed to infection as a cause of malignancy.
