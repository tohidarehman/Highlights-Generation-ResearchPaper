 Previous studies disagree on the oxidative status of omega 3 supplements . The great deviation raises concerns about quality and the methods used to monitor it . This study investigated 49 omega 3 products for their fatty acid content lipid class and oxidative status using official methods gas and liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy . With minor deviations omega 3 fatty acid content and lipid class of all products were as declared . 24 of studied products exceeded thresholds set by The Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega 3s for peroxide and or
