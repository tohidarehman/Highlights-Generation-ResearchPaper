 Efficient delivery of macular carotenoid lutein to target retinal tissue is possible with enhanced intestinal uptake remains a major challenge owing to the polarity sensitivity to light heat and solubility . In this study to overcome such constraints biodegradable polymers chitosan sodium alginate oleic acid based nano carrier loaded with lutein was prepared and safety efficacy was examined

@highlight Chitosan sodium alginate oleic acid hybrid nanocarrier system NCs for retinal delivery of lutein.
@highlight No mortality morphological and clinical changes in acute and sub acute toxicity of NCs and LNCs in rats.
@highlight Polymeric lipid based NCs are safe carriers for oral delivery of lutein.
