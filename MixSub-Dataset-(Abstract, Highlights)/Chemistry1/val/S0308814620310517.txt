 The aim of the study was to assess the effect of incandescent fluorescent and LED white cold white warm lighting on characteristics of kale sprouts . The highest concentrations of chlorophylls carotene lutein neoxanthin and violaxanthin were found in cotyledons of sprouts growing in RGB LED light . These had the largest proportion of cotyledons to the mass of plants and the highest content of ascorbic acid . The highest contents of protein and total thiocyanates were observed in sprouts cultivated in incandescent light followed by plants growing under RGB LED light . The application of a conventional bulb led to the lowest yield as well as the smallest amounts of chlorophylls carotene lutein and neoxanthin in fresh mass of cotyledons . Of the light sources used RGB LED treatment allowed plants with the highest content of most of the examined compounds to be obtained .

@highlight The effect of artificial lights on kale sprouts quality was assessed.
@highlight The highest content of protein and thiocyanates was obtained in incandescent light.
@highlight The highest content of ascorbic acid and pigments was obtained in RGB LED lights.
@highlight Similar pigments content was obtained in Cold Warm white LEDs and fluorescent light.
@highlight Cold Warm LED was the most energy saving but did not give the best quality sprouts.
