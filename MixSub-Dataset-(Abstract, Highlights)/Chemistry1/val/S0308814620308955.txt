 Some varieties of edible mushrooms can accumulate high contents of arsenic which is a public health concern . In this study we developed a high performance liquid chromatography method linked to inductively coupled plasma triple quadrupole mass spectrometry for sensitive and accurate determination of arsenite arsenate monomethylarsonic acid dimethylarsinic acid arsenocholine and arsenobetaine in edible mushrooms . The six arsenic species were extracted ultrasonically from mushrooms using ultrapure water at 60C as the solvent separated on a PRP X100 anion exchange column with 20mmol L NH

@highlight mode was applied to eliminate interferences in determination of arsenic.
@highlight Ultrasonic extraction with ultrapure water ensured the stability of arsenic species.
@highlight Most wild edible mushrooms tested contained only non toxic organic arsenic species.
@highlight Inorganic arsenic in some tested mushrooms were relatively high.
