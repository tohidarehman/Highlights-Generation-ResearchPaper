 Camelina oil is increasingly popular as consumption as oil . Erucic acid is an unwanted fatty acid in oil . First studies on several genotypes have shown that this oil contains varying amounts of eriuc acid . The aim of the study was to analyses content of eriuc acid in all genotypes camelina . Hypothesis was that the content of erucic acid in winter forms is lower than in spring ones . A field experiment with 65 spring genotypes and 9 winter genotypes of camelina was conducted in Poland from 2016 to 2018 . The analyses based on two chromatographic methods i.e . UPLC DAD and GCMS showed no differences in the results for the camelina samples . The average percentage content of the erucic acid in the spring genotypes was 3.432 and in the winter genotypes was 0.1 . Our three year research shows that some winter varieties can be used as low erucic acid forms .

@highlight 65 spring genotypes and 9 winter genotypes of camelina were analyzed.

@highlight The content of the C22 1 acid was 3.432 in spring and 0.1 in winter genotypes.
@highlight The content of individual lines fluctuated around the average.
