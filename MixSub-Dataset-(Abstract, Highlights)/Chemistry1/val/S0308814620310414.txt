 The prebiotic activities of hydrolyzed guar gum manno oligosaccharide and galacto oligosaccharide were evaluated by

@highlight Hydrolyzed guar gum MOS and GOS showed selective prebiotic effects.
@highlight GOS and GMOS promoted the growth of bifidobacteria and
@highlight  respectively.
@highlight GMOS gave higher yield of lactate propionate and butyrate than other carbohydrates during human fecal fermentation.
@highlight Prebiotic activity was related to the glycoside compositions and molecular weights.
