 The co existence of polysaccharides and enzymes in the food matrix could form complexes that directly influence the catalytic efficacy of enzymes . This work investigated the self assembly behaviors of amylase and charged polysaccharides and fabricated the amylase polysaccharides complex coacervates . The results showed that the linear charge density of polysaccharides had a critical impact on the complex formation structure and enzyme protection under acidic conditions . At low pH amylase formed compact and tight coacervates with the carrageenan . However amylase pectin coacervates dissociated when the pH was lower than 3.0 . The optimized binding ratio of amylase carrageenan was 12 1 and amylase pectin was 4 1 . Finally the amylase carrageenan complex coacervates effectively immobilized the enzyme and almost 70 of enzyme activity remained in coacervates after exposure to pH3.0 for 1h . This study demonstrates that the change in the linear charge density of polysaccharides could regulate the enzyme catalyzed process in food processing by a simple and fine controlled method .

@highlight Charge density of polysaccharides had a critical impact on self assembly with amylase.
@highlight Self assembled polyelectrolyte complexes PECs immobilized amylase effectively.
@highlight A higher linear charge density resulted in forming a compact and tight PECs.
@highlight Alpha amylase carrageenan PECs reduced the pH sensitivity of amylase.
