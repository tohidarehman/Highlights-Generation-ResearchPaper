 The stability of whole pasteurized milk packaged in clear PET bottles was studied throughout 13 days storage in the dark but including at specific times light exposure of 6 12 or 18h to simulate conditions potentially occurring in refrigerated display counters . The aim was to investigate the effects of light exposure when overlapping the unavoidable endogenous modifications in pasteurized milk during storage . Dissolved oxygen riboflavin and other flavins proteolysis products volatile compounds and sensory characteristics were evaluated . Besides the expected progress of proteolysis occurring during storage light negatively affected milk flavour especially after longer exposure times . The development of mushroom flavor related to the increase of volatile 2 3 octanedione was the most characterizing modification . Gathered data were considered in view of providing the background knowledge for the control of light exposure conditions on a retail display thus supporting the shelf life extension of pasteurized milk in a fully recyclable packaging .

@highlight Effects of lighting on pasteurized milk in clear PET bottles were studied during shelf storage.
@highlight Major light induced changes involved flavins volatiles and sensory properties.
@highlight Shelf life of pasteurized milk was defined considering its overall characteristics.
@highlight Estimated shelf life was longer than that assigned by the manufacturer.
@highlight Light exposure management by retailers is crucial to preserve bottled milk quality.
