 The objective of this work was to study carotene functionalities and practical limitations when included in the aqueous systems containing milk proteins . According to the results self association constant of carotene in the presence of casein is 1.7 fold of that calculated for WPI . Casein and WPI were capable of conserving carotene against chemical oxidation up to 15 and 12 respectively at 1 5M ratio of carotene to protein . While WPI reduced its photodegradation quantum yield from 0.03 to 0.012 compared to 0.017 obtained for casein . A 2.7 and 3.6 fold enhancement in carotene solubility was observed in the presence of 1.5mg mL of casein and WPI respectively . The study of carotene interaction with proteins showed on the one hand a negative effect on electron transfer and on the other hand improved hydrogen transfer to the radical species in the solution .

@highlight  Carotene binding to milk proteins enhanced its solubility.
@highlight Photo and chemical stability of carotene increased with milk proteins.
@highlight Whey proteins was more effective than caseins in reducing of carotene aggregates.
@highlight Milk proteins improved hydrogen transfer property of carotene to radical species.
@highlight Milk proteins diminished electron transfer property of carotene to radical species.
