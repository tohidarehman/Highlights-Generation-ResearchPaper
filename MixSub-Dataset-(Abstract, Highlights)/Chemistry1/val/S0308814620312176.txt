 Ara h1 is a major allergen from peanut . We investigated the effect of covalent conjugation of Ara h1 and dietary polyphenols on allergenicity and functional properties of Ara h1 . Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay revealed that the covalent conjugation of dietary polyphenols significantly reduced the IgE binding capacity of Ara h1 . Covalent binding of dietary polyphenols with Ara h1 reduced histamine release by 40 in basophils . The decreased IgE binding capacity of Ara h1 could be ascribed to changes in protein conformation . The IgE epitope of Ara h1 might be blocked by polyphenols at the binding site . Analysis of pepsin digestion of Ara h1polyphenol conjugates indicated that the covalent binding increased pepsin digestibility and reduced IgE binding capacity . Furthermore covalent conjugation of Ara h1 with polyphenols decreased denaturation temperature and increased antioxidant activity . Ara h1 conjugated with polyphenols may be a promising approach for reducing the allergenicity of Ara h1 .
