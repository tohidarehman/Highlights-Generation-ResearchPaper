 We report for the first time the use of biochar as a stabilizer for oil in water Pickering emulsion . The emulsion is subsequently used to prepare tetracycline imprinted biochar composite microspheres with tailored sizes and good uniformity . The adsorption properties of tetracycline to the MIPMs were investigated using different adsorption experiments including adsorption kinetic experiment equilibrium binding experiment selectivity evaluation and competitive adsorption tests . The MIPMs were used as adsorbent for solid phase extraction for the extraction of tetracycline present in drinking water fish and chicken samples . Under optimal conditions the results showed good recovery yield ranging from 73 to 95 with a relative standard deviation ranging from 0.3 to 8.4 respectively .
