 In this study the effect of roasting on the formation of furan in nuts was investigated . Nut samples were roasted at 150200C for 525min . As the roasting temperature and roasting time increased the levels of furan in the nuts increased up to 348ng g. The concentration of furan was 2.76224 0.7169.0 1.46348 2.6887.0 and 3.7094.4ng g in almonds peanuts cashew nuts hazelnuts and sacha inchi respectively . In kinetics analysis the chemical reaction responsible for the production of furan in nuts followed the zero order kinetic model with reaction constants of 3.2610
