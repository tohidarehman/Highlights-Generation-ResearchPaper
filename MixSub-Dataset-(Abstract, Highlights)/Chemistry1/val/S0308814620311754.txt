 Starch granule surface proteins and granule channel proteins are granule associated proteins which have been found to be distributed on the surface and channels of starch granules respectively . To investigate the impacts of SGAPs on amylase hydrolysis of starch SGCPs or SGAPs of waxy low and high amylose rice starches were removed . Removal of SGAPs or SGCPs greatly increased hydrolysis rate of rice starches . Meanwhile these granules incurred a greater number and size of pores on their surfaces during hydrolysis . Compared to low and high amylose starches waxy starch before and after removing SGAPs exhibited a higher hydrolysis rate . Rice starch hydrolysis began with enlargement of cavity and channels both horizontally and vertically . XRD analysis revealed that removal of SGAPs decreased relative crystallinity of starch and advanced changes in RC during hydrolysis process . This study provides new information about the role of SGAPs in the mechanisms of amylase hydrolysis .

@highlight The digestion rate of rice starch was increased by removal of SGAPs.
@highlight A greater number and size of pores were found in hydrolyzed granules without SGAPs.
@highlight  amylase hydrolysis of granules began with enlargement of cavity and channels.
@highlight Removal of SGAPs advanced changes in crystallinity of starch during hydrolysis.
