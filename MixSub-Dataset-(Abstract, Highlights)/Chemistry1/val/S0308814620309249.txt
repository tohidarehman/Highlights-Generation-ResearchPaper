 Soy glycinin was mixed with soyasaponin to elucidate the mechanism involved in the stabilization of emulsions by mixed systems based on dynamic interfacial tension and dilatational rheology at the oilwater interface . The short long term properties of oil in water emulsions stabilized by 11SSsa mixtures included droplet size distribution droplet potential microstructure and Turbiscan stability index . The combination of Ssa with 11S significantly affected the interfacial dilatational and emulsion properties although the interfacial properties were still dominated by the protein . Higher concentrations of Ssa combined with 11S synergistically decreased the interfacial tension which was attributed to the interaction between 11S and Ssa . Using high Ssa concentrations enhanced the long term stability of emulsions after 42 d. These results will aid the basic understanding of proteinSsa interfacial adsorption during emulsion formation and can help prepare natural food additives for designing emulsions .
