 This study investigated the effect of lysosomal iron involvement in the mechanism of mitochondrial apoptosis on bovine muscle protein degradation during postmortem aging . Six crossbred cattle were studied to evaluate intracellular reactive oxygen species antioxidant enzyme activity lysosomal membrane stability mitochondrial dysfunction induced apoptosis desmin and troponin T degradation in both control and iron chelator desferrioxamine groups . Results showed that lysosomal iron induced ROS accumulation and lysosomal membrane destabilization by decreasing the antioxidant enzyme activity
