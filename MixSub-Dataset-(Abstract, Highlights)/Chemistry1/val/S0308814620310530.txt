 The awareness of the functional and nutraceutical properties of olives and olive oil bioactive constituents contributed to oliviculture recent increase . Olives metabolism and nutritional quality are determined by how the olive tree is coping to climate change related episodes which increasingly occur in the Mediterranean . We characterize the most relevant lipophilic and phenolic compounds of olives from

@highlight Cobranosa olives are richer in organic acids esters and carbohydrates.
@highlight C.Serpa olives present higher levels of phenolic compounds.
@highlight Stress modulates olives phenolic lipophilic contents in a cultivar dependent way.
@highlight C.Serpa olives have higher stress susceptibility than Cobranosa and C.C.Branco.
@highlight Olives can be enriched in bioactive compounds in response to environmental stresses.
