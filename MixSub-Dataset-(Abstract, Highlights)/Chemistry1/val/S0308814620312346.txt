 The physicochemical and physiological properties of soluble dietary fiber and insoluble dietary fiber from bamboo shoots were investigated in present study . IDF showed better adsorption capacity than the corresponding SDF from the same species . Microstructure observation results indicated that the surface of IDF was porous whereas the SDF was relatively flat and compact . The cholesterol adsorption capacities of IDF and SDF from

@highlight IDF had better adsorption capacity than the corresponding SDF from same species.
@highlight Cholesterol adsorption capacity of bamboo shoot dietary fiber was sensitive to pH.
@highlight IDF had lower crystallinity larger amorphous area than other species.
@highlight IDF and SDF from
@highlight showed potential prebiotic activities.
@highlight IDF significantly enhanced the production of SCFAs by
@highlight fermentation.
