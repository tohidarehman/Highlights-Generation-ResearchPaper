 Biogenic amines are a class of bioactive organics produced during the fermentation of soy sauce . A high concentration of BAs may bring about serious physiological and toxicological effects on the human body . In this study we reported an optimized process to produce soy sauce with lower BA concentration and found the contents of putrescine cadaverine and histamine increased with the increase of fermentation temperature but decreased with the increase of NaCl concentration . The final content of total BAs with improved fermentation was 105.560.13mg L which was reduced by 89.11 compared to traditional brewing . Besides the pilot production test was performed to verify the optimized conditions and physicochemical indexes were measured to better understand the change principle of the chemical compounds . Taken together we present an effective process to inhibit the formation of BAs while ensuring that characteristic nutrients are not lost .

@highlight Different parameters during soy sauce fermentation was optimized.
@highlight The improved process greatly inhibits the formation of BAs by 89.11 .
@highlight The characteristic nutrients are not lost after fermentation.
@highlight The change principle of putrescine cadaverine and histamine was revealed.
