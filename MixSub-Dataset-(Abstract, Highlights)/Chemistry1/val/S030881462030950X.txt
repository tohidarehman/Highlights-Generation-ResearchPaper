 Evaluation of oxidizing lipid systems in terms of the kinetics governing both initiation and propagation phases will provide more comprehensive and reliable information than those based on the single parameter analyses used frequently . The aim of this study was to promote the ordinarily used evaluation methods by using many kinetic parameters and rate constants representing the two phases . To do this a variety of triacylglycerols of various fatty acid compositions were peroxidized over time at 60C and the kinetic curves of lipid hydroperoxides accumulation were drawn . The unifying parameters representative for the initiation

@highlight A comprehensive kinetic based terminology was used to evaluate lipid peroxidation.
@highlight Many kinetic parameters was employed to characterize the initiation and propagation phases.
@highlight Oxidizability was differentiated based on the initiation and propagation parameters.
@highlight Initiation and propagation oxidizabilities were investigated as affected by unsaturation degree.
