 In this work novel edible coating films based on beeswax in water Pickering emulsions had been investigated . The Pickering emulsions were stabilized with cellulose nanofibrils carboxymethyl chitosan . The emulsions with a droplet diameter of around 10m had uniform particle size distribution and the creaming stability was improved with the increasing the contents of CNFs in the complexes rheological analysis demonstrated that the Pickering emulsions had an elastic gel like network . Furthermore free standing films were obtained when the emulsions were dried at ambient condition the tensile strength of the coating films could be 5.0MPa at a strain of 2.2 and the water vapor permeability value was lower than 210

@highlight Beeswax in water emulsions stabilized with CNFs CCS were fabricated.
@highlight The obtained emulsions performed high stability and good antimicrobial activity.
@highlight The formed coating films exhibited excellent mechanical and barrier properties.
