 In this study the inhibitory potentials of food originated 34 phenolic acids and flavonoid compounds were screened against acetylcholinesterase butyrylcholinesterase urease and tyrosinase enzymes . All compounds included in this study exhibited high antioxidant activity with an ignorable cytotoxic activity . In general they also showed poor anti urease and anti tyrosinase activities . Compounds in aglycone form showed strong anticholinesterase activities . No relation was observed between the tested bioactivities except from the case that aglycone compounds exhibited a strong positive relationship between antioxidant activities and anticholinesterase activity . Interestingly there was a relation between the molecular weights of aglycone compounds and their anticholinesterase activities . The study showed that flavonoids with molecular mass of 250320g mol have high potential of anticholinesterase activities and are valuable for future experiments on animals and humans . Potential inhibitory effects of these molecules on target proteins were investigated using docking and molecular dynamics calculations .
