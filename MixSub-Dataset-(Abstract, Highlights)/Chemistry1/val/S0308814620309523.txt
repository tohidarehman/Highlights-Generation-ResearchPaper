 Chlorothalonil is a class of 2B carcinogen which is widely used in the prevention and treatment of fungal diseases in food samples . Its residual problem has been increasingly concerned by society . In this paper a fast and simple colorimetric assay based on Manganese dioxide nanosheets MnO

@highlight A simple rapid colorimetric method using MnO
@highlight nanosheets was developed to detect chlorothalonil.
@highlight The sterilization mechanism of chlorothalonil by construction of sensor was used for the first time.
@highlight The method presented a low detection limit and significantly shortened the measurement time.
