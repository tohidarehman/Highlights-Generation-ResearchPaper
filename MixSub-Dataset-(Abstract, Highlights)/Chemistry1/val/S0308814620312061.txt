 There is a contentious need for robust and rapid methodologies for maintaining the authenticity of foods and food additives . The current paper presented a new Raman spectroscopy based methodology for detection and quantification of lard in butter . Hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis were successfully performed for the classification and discrimination of butter and lard adulterated samples . Strong discrimination pattern was observed in the HCA analysis . Also partial least squares regression and principal component regression

@highlight Demand exists for detection of lard in butter.
@highlight A new Raman based method was developed for detection of lard in butter.
@highlight Developed method has a great potential for discrimination of butter from adulterated samples.
@highlight Developed method has a great potential for quantification of lard in butter PCR and PLSR .
@highlight Portable Raman based method could be easily adapted for control of butter in the field industry .
