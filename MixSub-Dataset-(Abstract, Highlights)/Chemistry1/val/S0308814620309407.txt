 The potential of cross processing herring or salmon by products with brown seaweed shrimp peeling by products and lingonberry press cake to minimize lipid oxidation during acid alkaline pH shift protein isolation was evaluated . Lingonberry press cake remarkably reduced levels of lipid hydroperoxides malondialdehyde and 4 hydroxy trans2 hexenal in both herring and salmon protein isolates while seaweed and shrimp by product mitigated generation of MDA and HHE in herring PI . The salmon PI however by itself had very low oxidation levels . Cross processing reduced protein yield compared with the classical pH shift process by diminishing protein solubility but still the alkaline process version was promising . The color of the PIs varied greatly between different process combinations reflecting partitioning of natural pigments into isolates . Altogether cross processing seems a promising tool for inhibition of lipid oxidation during pH shift processing of sensitive fish by products with the alkaline version and lingonberry press cake being closest at hand for further studies .

@highlight Cross processing was verified as a novel approach for mitigating lipid oxidation.
@highlight Lingonberry press cake remarkably diminished oxidation during pH shift processing.
@highlight Seaweed and shrimp by product also reduced generation of MDA HHE in herring protein.
@highlight Alkaline version of the process and lingonberry press cake are most promising.
