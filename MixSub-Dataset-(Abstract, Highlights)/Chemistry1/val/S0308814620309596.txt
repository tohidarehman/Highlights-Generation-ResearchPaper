 In this study polyaniline modified polyacrylonitrile nanofibers mat was prepared as a novel adsorbent for the solid phase extraction of non steroidal anti inflammatory drug residues in meat or egg samples . The solvent extracts of samples were simply diluted with water to perform the SPE and then the eluent was directly analyzed . Significant reduction of the matrix effect was obtained after SPE using only 5mg of PANI NFsM . The entire sample preparation time is 510 times lower than the existing methods . The limits of detection of the target analytes ranging from 0.6 to 12.2gkg

@highlight Novel PANI NFsM is firstly applied in food analysis as absorbent in SPE.
@highlight Only 5mg absorbent 1.7mL organic solvent and 1g sample are needed.
@highlight The sample preparation process is greatly simplified requiring only 4 steps.
@highlight The sample preparation time is 5 to 10 times lower than existing methods.
@highlight The practical application of the method was evaluated in real samples.
