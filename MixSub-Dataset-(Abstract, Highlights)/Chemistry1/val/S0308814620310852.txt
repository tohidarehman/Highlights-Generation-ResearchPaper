 The carotenoids in the peel and flesh of 41 apricot cultivars were qualitatively and quantitatively analysed by UHPLC APCI MS MS and the L a b and quality indexes of the fruits were determined . The results showed that the L a b and quality indexes of the fruits were quite different and 13 carotenoids were detected in the peel and flesh of apricots among which carotene cryptoxanthin and apocarotenal were newly detected carotenoids in apricots . The total carotenoid content of the 41 apricot cultivars varied from 20.983 to 320.278g g FW and the total carotenoid content varied from 17.353 to 222.098g g FW in the peel and from 2.536 to 98.179g g FW in the flesh . The main components of apricot fruits were carotene and phytoene followed by cryptoxanthin and lutein . This study shows that carotenoids in apricot fruits have rich metabolic diversity .

@highlight The metabolism of carotenoids in apricot fruit was studied by LC MS MS.
@highlight  Carotene cryptoxanthin and apocarotenal were found in apricot fruit.
@highlight The diversity of carotenoid components and contents of the Central Asian variety group in Xinjiang were explored.
@highlight  carotene and E Z phytoene are the main carotenoids in apricot fruits.
@highlight The content of carotenoids in the peel of 41 apricot fruits was higher than that in the flesh.
