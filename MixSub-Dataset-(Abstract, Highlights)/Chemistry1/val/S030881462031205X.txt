 spp . are generally utilized as kimchi starters because of their beneficial effects on kimchi fermentation and sensory characteristics . We developed a DNAzyme based colorimetric method for measuring the abundance of the kimchi starter

@highlight We developed a DNAzyme based colorimetric method for WiKim32 specific detection.
@highlight Free DNAzyme formed G quadruplex hemin conjugates generating a visible product.
@highlight This method could quantitatively detect the target sequence in the kimchi.
@highlight This strategy provided a rapid sensitive simple and reliable detection method.
