 The influence of food components on nanoparticle internalization indicates a need to investigate the behaviors of NPs in a complex system . This study measured the changes of TiO

@highlight Anthocyanins reduced TiO
@highlight NPs internalization into 3D Caco 2 spheroids.
@highlight Anthocyanins only minimally changed the colloidal properties of TiO
@highlight NPs.
@highlight TiO
@highlight NPs and anthocyanins minimally induced cytotoxicity or oxidative stress.
@highlight NP internalization was inversely correlated with the binding affinity.
@highlight TiO
@highlight NPs and anthocyanins up regulated some types of ABC transporters.
