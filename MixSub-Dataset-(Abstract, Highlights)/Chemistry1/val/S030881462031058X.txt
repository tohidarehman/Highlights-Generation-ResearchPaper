 Pigeon pea is rich in proteins but has low protein digestibility like other legumes . This work investigated the effects of processing including soaking grinding ultrasound and microwave on the protein digestibility of pigeon pea flour . Only microwave treatment significantly increased

@highlight Effects of processing on protein digestibility of pigeon pea were evaluated.
@highlight Only microwave method significantly increased
@highlight protein digestibility.
@highlight Enhanced digestibility was due to starch and protein structure changes in flour.
@highlight Small particle size and high zeta potential of proteins also enhanced digestibility.
@highlight Microwave is a promising approach to increase pigeon pea protein utilization.
