 Bovine casein is an amphiphilic protein that exists as a monomer and self organizes into micelles in aqueous solution . The protein has been used as natural vehicles for bioactives .

@highlight  Casein can bind
@highlight  and or
@highlight  resveratrol to form casein ligand complexes.
@highlight Both
@highlight  and
@highlight  resveratrol could be entrapped by casein micelles.
@highlight  Casein micelles delayed isomerization more effectively than protein complexes.
@highlight  Casein complexes showed better protective effect for resveratrol than micelles.
