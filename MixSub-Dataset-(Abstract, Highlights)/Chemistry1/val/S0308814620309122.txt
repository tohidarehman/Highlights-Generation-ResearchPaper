 A visualization and quantification image analysis method is developed to evaluate the water absorbing characteristics of rice . A projected image of soaked rice was obtained by a scanner in real time the expansion ratio of the soaked rice in the projected image was calculated with computer software and the change in the internal structure was analyzed . The results showed that water absorption had a positive correlation with expansion and the cracks occurred in the internal structure of rice could accelerate the water absorption . The maximum expansion ratio of

@highlight A new method was developed to evaluate water absorbing characteristics of rice.
@highlight The water absorbing characteristics of each rice grain could be analyzed.
@highlight The water absorbing characteristics had positive correlation with expansion.
@highlight The appearance of cracks accelerated the absorption of water.
@highlight Different factors had significant effect on the water absorbing characteristics.
