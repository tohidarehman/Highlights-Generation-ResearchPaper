 Aroma defects limit the application of fish protein hydrolysates as flavourings . This study aimed to develop a flavour concentrate from fermented tilapia fish head hydrolysate by

@highlight Aroma of a new fish flavouring was modulated by the cysteine xylose Maillard reaction.
@highlight Response surface methodology assessed the optimum condition of this reaction.
@highlight 2 Methyl 3 furanthiol MFT and 2 furfurylthiol FFT were used as responses.
@highlight Heating temperature significantly affected the production of MFT and FFT.
