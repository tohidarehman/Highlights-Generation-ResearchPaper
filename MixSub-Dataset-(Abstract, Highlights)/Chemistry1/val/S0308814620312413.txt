 The safety and regulatory status of fermented products derived from gluten containing grains for patients with celiac disease remains controversial . Bottom up mass spectrometry has complemented immunoassays for the compositional and immunogenic analyses of wheat beers . However uncharacterized proteolysis during brewing followed by the secondary digestion for MS has made the analysis and data interpretation complicated . In this study the composition and immunogenic potential of seven commercially available wheat beers were evaluated using bottom up MS with the aid of fractionation and a multi step peptide search strategy to identify peptides generated by various types of proteolysis . Gluten derived peptides accounted for approximately 50 and 20 of the total number of wheat derived and barley derived peptides respectively in the investigated beers . Although relatively large polypeptides can not be thoroughly characterized using traditional bottom up proteomics up to 50 of peptides identified contained celiac immunogenic motifs and consumption of wheat beers would pose risks for celiac patients .

@highlight Fractionation and custom informatics improved the proteomic analysis of wheat beers.
@highlight Gluten accounted for different numbers of wheat 50 and barley 20 peptides.
@highlight Up to 50 of identified peptides contained celiac immunogenic motifs.
@highlight Consumption of wheat beers presents risks for individuals with celiac disease.
