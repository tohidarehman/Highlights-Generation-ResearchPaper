 Protein and lipid oxidation were investigated in whey protein based oleogels with varying water addition . Lipid oxidation was low 30mmol O

@highlight Whey protein oleogels with low 0.23 and high 2.8 water addition differ in their oxidation profiles.
@highlight Fluorescence increases indicate strong protein oxidation levels even with low lipid oxidation.
@highlight Primary amines and protein carbonyls degrade and only accumulate at high oxidation levels.
@highlight Typical lipid oxidation aldehydes decompose in protein oleogels.
