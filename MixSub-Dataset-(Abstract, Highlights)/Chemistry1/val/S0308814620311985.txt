 This study investigated the functional properties and structural changes associated with the complexation of rice protein with anthocyanins . Furthermore fractions isolated from RP complexed with anthocyanins were examined . The interactions with ACN altered the structure of RP leading to an increase in the sheet and spectral shift of the amide band . Additionally fluorescence spectroscopy suggested that the hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds were the dominant forces in the formation of RP ACN complexes . It was interesting to find that the RP ACN particles exhibited the best functional properties at pH 3 likely due to the specific conformational changes upon interaction . In addition the combination of RP and ACN increased the antioxidant ability of RP . Overall this research suggested that RP ACN particles at pH 3 can be designed to form and stabilize mesostructures such as foams and emulsion which can lead to health benefits .
