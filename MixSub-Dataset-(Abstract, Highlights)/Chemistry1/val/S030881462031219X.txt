 Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform spectroscopy was applied on fresh freeze dried and cell wall materials of raw and processed apples . These samples prepared from 36 apple sets and the corresponding 72 purees issued from different varieties agricultural practices storage periods and processing conditions were used to build models including exploratory analysis supervised classification and multivariate calibration . Fresh and freeze dried samples presented similar fingerprint spectral variations due to processing . ATR FTIR directly on fresh purees satisfactorily predicted textural properties such as particle average size and volume while freeze drying improved assessment of chemical and rheological parameters using partial least squares regression . The assessment of texture and macrocomponents of purees can be obtained with a limited sample preparation . For research applications because of a need of sample preparation changes of cell wall composition during fruit processing could be assessed in relationship with pectin degradation .

@highlight Proposition of puree sample preparation according to the expected quality traits.
