 Fish by products are excellent sources of collagen . Acid soluble collagen derived from a mixed by product of different fish species was hydrolyzed to obtain peptide fractions and evaluate their biological and functional activities . All fractions obtained exhibited antioxidant activity at concentrations of 5 10 and 15mg mL . However F5 registered the highest reducing power and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity at 15mg mL whereas the highest DPPH

@highlight Peptide fractions 30 1030 510 15 and 1kDa were obtained from fish collagen.
@highlight All peptide fractions from fish collagen hydrolysate exhibited antioxidant activity.
@highlight The peptide fraction F1 30kDa exhibited the best functional activity.
@highlight Mixed by products were excellent source of peptide fractions from fish collagen.
