 Reconstituted polyphenolic and aromatic fractions from 33 different Garnacha and Tempranillo grapes were incubated in strict anoxia . Obtained hydrolyzates were characterized by sensory analysis gas chromatography olfactometry and gas chromatography mass spectrometry . Five different aroma categories emerged . Garnacha may develop specific tropical citrus fruit kerosene and floral and Tempranillo toasty woody and red fruit characteristics . Those notes seem to mask alcoholic and fruit in syrup descriptors and the common vegetal background . Twenty seven odorants were detected by GC O. GCMS data showed a clustering closely matching the one found by sensory analysis suggesting the existence of five specific metabolomic profiles behind the five specific sensory profiles . Overall results suggest that 3 mercaptohexanol is responsible for tropical citrus fruit TDN for kerosene volatile phenols for woody toasty damascenone and massoia lactone likely with Z 1 5 octadien 3 one for fruit in syrup and alcoholic notes . Nine lipid derived unsaturated aldehydes and ketones may be responsible for the vegetal background .
