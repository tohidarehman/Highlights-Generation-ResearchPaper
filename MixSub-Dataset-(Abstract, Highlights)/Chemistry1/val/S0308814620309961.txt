 An efficient single quadrupole gas chromatography with mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the determination of indoxacarb residues in tomato and soil . Residues were extracted from the samples using acetonitrile as extracting solvent and the extracts were purified through primary secondary amine and graphitized carbon black . Recoveries were obtained in the range of 92.12110.51 with the relative standard deviation of 1.324.32 . Indoxacarb dissipated with half life of 3.123.21 and 1.241.35d for tomato and soil respectively following doses of indoxacarb 14.5 SC at 60 90 and 120g.a.i . ha . Safe waiting periods were found to be 1 3d . The residues were removed from tomato fruit was in the range of 16.73 to 54.32 using simple decontamination approaches . The present study suggest that the use of indoxacarb in tomato at recommended dose does not seem to pose any dietary risk to the consumers . The soil RQ values indicated low level of risk to earthworms and arthropods .

@highlight An efficient GCMS method developed for indoxacarb residue estimation.
@highlight A safe waiting period of 1d suggested for consumption of tomato.
@highlight Consumption tomato fruit was toxicologically safe following indoxacarb application.
@highlight Soil risk quotient values indicated low level of risk to earthworms and arthropods.
