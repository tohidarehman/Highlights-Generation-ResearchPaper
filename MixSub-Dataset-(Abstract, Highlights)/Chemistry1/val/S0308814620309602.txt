 Poly conductive film was coated successfully on the gold electrode . The electrochemical behavior of vanillin was studied on the 1H 1 2 4 triazole 3 thiol Au electrode . The determination of VAN was performed on the T3T Au electrode using a differential pulse voltammetry technique . In order to detect the concentration of VAN suitable supporting electrolyte solution and pH value were determined . At pH 3 in HClO

@highlight The usage of easy and fast prepared the T3T Au sensor for determination of vanillin.
@highlight Low detection limit of the method was found as 10nmol L
@highlight of vanillin.
@highlight The novel electrode exhibited high sensitivity and good stability.
@highlight The practical accurate and precise application of VAN in sugared vanilla and coffee.
