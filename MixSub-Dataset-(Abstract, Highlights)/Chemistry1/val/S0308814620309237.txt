 This study mainly investigated the effect of different salt concentrations on triglycerides hydrolysis in muscle during salting by analyzing moisture distribution TG hydrolysis TG hydrolase activity native and phosphorylated adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone sensitive lipase protein content lipid droplets morphology and muscle microstructure . The results showed that increasing salt concentration could significantly decrease

@highlight Intramuscular TG hydrolysis was significantly affected by salt content during dry salting.
@highlight 3 salt content could significantly promote the phosphorylation of ATGL and HSL.
@highlight Increasing salt could significantly promote the large lipid droplets to split into small ones.
