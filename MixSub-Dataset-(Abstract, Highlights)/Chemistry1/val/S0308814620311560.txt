 The pH shift process for isolation of gel forming proteins from fish processing by products was extended to allow parallel isolation of fish oil . Subjecting the floating emulsion layer formed during pH shift processing of salmon by products to pH adjustment or freeze thawing efficiently released the emulsified oil at 4C . However for herring by products higher temperature and a combination of the emulsion breaking techniques was required for efficient oil release . Oil recovery yield using the adjusted pH shift process was lower than with classic heat induced oil isolation but pH shift produced oils had higher amounts of n 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids . Also alkaline pH shift processing produced oils with remarkably less oxidation products and free fatty acids compared with acid pH shift process or heat induced isolation . Extending the pH shift process with emulsion breaking techniques can thus be a promising biorefinery approach for parallel cold production of high quality fish oil and gel forming proteins from fish by products .

@highlight A multiple product biorefinery approach was developed for fish by products.
@highlight Fish oil was extracted from by products parallel with gel forming proteins at 10C.
@highlight Cold produced oils had higher amounts of LC n 3 PUFA compared to heating method.
@highlight Alkaline pH shift processing produced oils with remarkably less oxidation products.
