 The high temperature short time pasteurization of human milk has been proposed as an alternative to the Holder method to increase the preservation of bioactive compounds . We have investigated the impact of HTST and HoP pasteurization on the gastrointestinal kinetics of human milk using a dynamic

@highlight Similar protein and lipid digestibility in Holder HoP and HTST pasteurized human milk.
@highlight Digestion of HTST treated human milk caused higher retention of bioactive proteins.
@highlight Digestion of HTST treated human milk gave AA release pattern similar to raw HoP milk.
