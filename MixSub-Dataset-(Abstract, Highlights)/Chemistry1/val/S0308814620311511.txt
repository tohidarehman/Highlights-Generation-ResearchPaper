 Konjac glucomannan electrogels were successfully prepared under alternating current in the presence of potassium chloride . The structure of the gels was studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy . A single factor experiment was performed to optimize the preparation of the gels . Our results showed that KGM was degraded under AC and partially deacetylated . KGM and KCl formed the structure

@highlight KCl interacts with konjac glucomannan to form the structure
@highlight Konjac glucomannan chains break and partially deacetylate under alternating current.
@highlight Alternating current induces the formation of konjac glucomannan KCl electrogel.
@highlight Konjac glucomannan KCl electrogel possesses an ununiform porosity structure.
@highlight Viscoelastic moduli of the gels depend on KCl and konjac glucomannan concentration voltage and electric processing time.
