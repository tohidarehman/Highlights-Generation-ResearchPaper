 Eggshell matrix proteins play an important biological role in eggshell mineralization and embryo development . Many studies have demonstrated that some matrix proteins undergo posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation and glycosylation which have important regulatory effects on the functional properties of the proteins . Systematic analysis of the proteome the phosphorylated modified proteome and the glycosylated modified proteome of the chicken EM was performed using a proteomics strategy . A total of 112 phosphorylation sites from 69 phosphoproteins and 297
