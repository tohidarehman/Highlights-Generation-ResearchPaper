 A magnetic hydrophilic molecularly imprinted material with multiple stimuli responses was prepared for efficient recognition of bisphenol A . MIM consisted of a magnetic core an inner silica dioxide shell and an outer hydrophilic polymer shell responsive for rapid magnetic separation protection of the magnetic core and pH thermo sensitivity to BPA respectively . Controlled adsorption and release of BPA by pH temperature regulation were realized through the reversible components of poly N isopropylacrylamide
