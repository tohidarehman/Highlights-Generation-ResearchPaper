 Naringenin is a flavonoid with many bioactive properties however its bitterness limits its use in foods . It is known that complex formation with proteins can mask this undesirable sensory property . Therefore a trained panel evaluated the effect of bovine lactoferrin on NG bitterness using time intensity analysis . LF reduced the maximum bitterness intensity and overall bitterness perception for NG by 27 and 33 respectively . Isothermal titration nanocalorimetry molecular docking and molecular dynamics were used to characterize NG LF binding . These techniques provided similar values of

@highlight Bovine lactoferrin reduces the perception of naringenin bitterness.
@highlight Naringenin forms a 1 1 complex with lactoferrin.
@highlight The complex formation is mainly driven by the entropy increase.
@highlight Naringenin binds in a predominantly hydrophobic site on lactoferrin.
