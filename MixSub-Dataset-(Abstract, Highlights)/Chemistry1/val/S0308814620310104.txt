 The performance of a whey protein hydrolysate for producing physically and chemically stable omega 3 emulsions was compared to hydrolysates obtained from other sustainable protein sources such as soy and blue whiting . The oxidative stability of hydrolysate stabilized emulsions was greatly influenced by their physical stability . Emulsion stabilized with BPH suffered a constant increase in droplet size and BPH was not able to prevent omega 3 oxidation showing high concentration of volatiles . The peroxide value of SPH emulsion increased after the first day of storage but it had a lower concentration of volatiles . In contrast WPH stabilized emulsion which did not had any change in droplet size during storage showed the highest oxidative stability . Therefore our results confirmed that WPH is an interesting option for physical and oxidative stabilization of omega 3 emulsions while SPH could be used in emulsions with shorter storage time such as pre emulsions for microencapsulation of omega 3 oils .

@highlight Stability of oil in water emulsions using protein hydrolysates was evaluated.
@highlight Whey protein hydrolysate avoided omega 3 oil oxidation during storage.
@highlight Physical stability was crucial for the oxidative protection of the omega 3 oil.
