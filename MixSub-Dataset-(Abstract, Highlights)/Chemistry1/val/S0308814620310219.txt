 The widespread use of neonicotinoids and fipronils as insecticides in modern agriculture has been widely investigated because of their adverse effects on human health . This study aimed to develop an accurate quantitative approach to analyze NEOs and FIPs in tea by using a modified QuEChERS method based on dispersive solid phase extraction procedure coupled with liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry . To minimize matrix interferences largely we selected polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and strong cationic exchange adsorbent as dispersive adsorbents to eliminate polyphenols and caffeine from tea extract respectively . Under optimal conditions a slight matrix effect was observed for NEOs and FIPs due to the highest reductions of polyphenols and caffeine . The method was validated by the European Medicines Agency and Eurachem guidelines and was successfully applied to tea samples for NEOs and FIPs analysis . NEOs and FIPs were commonly detected in tea .

@highlight A modified QuEChERS method was developed for NEOs and FIPs analysis in tea.
@highlight PVPP and PCX as dispersive adsorbents were used to remove tea interferences.
@highlight Polyphenols 94 and caffeine 88 as tea interferences were removed largely.
@highlight The method was applied in tea samples and NEOs and FIPs were commonly detected.
@highlight Acetamiprid and imidacloprid are the most frequently detected pesticides in tea.
