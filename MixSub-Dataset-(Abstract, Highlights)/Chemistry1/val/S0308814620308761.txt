 The influence of diacylglycerol combined with polyglycerol polyricinoleate on the stability of water in oil emulsions containing hydrogenated palm oil was studied . Polarized light microscope revealed that DAG promoted HPO to crystallize at the wateroil interface providing the combination of Pickering and network stabilization effects . It was proposed that the molecular compatibility of fatty acids in DAG with HPO accounted for the promotional effect . The interfacial crystallization of DAG together with the surface activity of PGPR led to the formation of emulsions with uniform small droplets and high freezethaw stability . Further exploration of physical properties indicated that the combination of DAG and PGPR dramatically improved the emulsions viscoelasticity and obtained a larger deformation yield . Water droplets in DAG based emulsions acted as active fillers to improve the network rigidity . Therefore DAG is a promising material to be used as emulsifier to enhance the physical stability of W O emulsions .

@highlight DAG in combination with PGPR was applied to stabilize HPO based W O emulsion.
@highlight DAG can promote HPO to form typical interfacial crystals at the wateroil interface.
@highlight DAG PGPR HPO emulsion had smaller droplet size and higher freezethaw stability.
@highlight DAG PGPR HPO emulsion had remarkably higher textural and rheology properties.
