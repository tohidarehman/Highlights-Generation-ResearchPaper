 In order to develop natural food grade particles as emulsifiers wet milled has been conducted to obtain apple pomace particles in varying sizes . Structural characteristics physicochemical properties and Pickering emulsifying potential of the particle in different sizes were investigated . Particle size of apple pomace was gradually reduced from 12.9m to 550nm during 8h milling . With the decrease of particles size the morphology became less angular . Meanwhile some insoluble dietary fibers transformed into soluble ones and the wettability tended to be hydrophilic therefore the water and oil holding capacities and free radical scavenging capacities increased . The properties of Pickering emulsions stabilized by wet milled apple pomace particles in different sizes were then investigated . The decrease of particle size resulted in the size reduction of emulsion droplets and gave rise to enhance gel like properties and antioxidative activities of emulsions . The results demonstrated promising prospect of wet milled apple pomace particles as emulsifiers in food industry .
