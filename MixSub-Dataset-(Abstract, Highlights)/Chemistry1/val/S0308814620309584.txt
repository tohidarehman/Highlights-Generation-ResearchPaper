 Production of bioactive peptides via enzymatic hydrolysis is a sustainable way to take advantage of proteinaceous by products from food industry such as fish discards .

@highlight Enzymatic hydrolysis improved the DPP IV inhibitory activity of sardine protein.
@highlight Hydrolysis with endo and exopeptidases gave the most bioactive hydrolysate.
@highlight Peptides ranging from 400 to 1400Da were the most bioactive.
@highlight Some new peptides from
@highlight were identified to be DPP IV inhibitors.
