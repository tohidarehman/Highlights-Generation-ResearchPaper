 The outbreaks due to the low number of foodborne pathogens present in ready to eat products can be prevented by rapid and sensitive detection method . However as a conventional detection method it is impossible to monitor foodborne bacteria existing which is less than 50cfu 25g in a food . This study was designed to investigate the possibility of detecting 1cfu in the short term through filtration DNA concentration and qPCR . As a result of the filtration DNA concentration method the recovery concentrations of

@highlight A filtration based rapid assay was developed for detecting pathogens.
@highlight Filter base concentrated samples are rapidly detected using qPCR.
@highlight Sample to result time is 3h with a pathogen concentration of 10CFU 25g.
