 We investigated changes in the chemical composition of WPI as a result of heating with SBP in solution . The concentration of WPI was kept at a constant whereas the level of SBP was varied at 1 1.5 and 3 . The reaction products were examined using the Ellmans reagent ninhydrin assay and gel electrophoresis . The results demonstrated that the losses of the free sulfhydryl and primary amine NH

@highlight Changes in chemical composition were indicative of productive conjugation reaction.
@highlight Conjugates formed between WPI and SBP were critical for improved emulsion stability.
@highlight Electrostatic interaction contributed to the improved emulsion stability at pH 3.2.
@highlight Adverse conditions unbalanced ratios neutral pH affected the emulsion negatively.
