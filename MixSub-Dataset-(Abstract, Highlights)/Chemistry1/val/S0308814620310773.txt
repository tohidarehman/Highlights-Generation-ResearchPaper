 This study investigated changes of the structure and emulsifying properties of peanut protein isolate during multiple freeze thaw cycles . According to the Fourier transform infrared spectrum the F T treatment to PPI reduced the content of protein ordered structure significantly . The result of fluorescence spectrum revealed that the polarity of PPI surroundings first increased and then decreased . Similarly the free sulfhydryl content and surface hydrophobicity of PPI increased firstly and decreased . However the carbonyl content and particle size of PPI increased continuously after F T treatment . The emulsification performance of PPI after F T treatment was significantly improved . The emulsion prepared by PPI after 3 F T cycles had the smallest mean particle size the highest absolute value of zeta potential and the most uniform microstructure distribution showed the best performance of emulsifying ability . Therefore it can be known that F T cycles treatment could effectively change protein structure and improve protein emulsifying properties .

@highlight The structure of PPI became more disordered after multiple F T cycles.
@highlight F T cycles could effectively improve the emulsification property of PPI.
@highlight The changes of PPI structure and functional properties depended on F T cycles times.
