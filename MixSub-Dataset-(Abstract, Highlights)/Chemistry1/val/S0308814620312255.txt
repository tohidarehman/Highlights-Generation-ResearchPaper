 Rhubarb is a popular food in Europe with laxative properties attributed to anthraquinones . Long term usage of rhubarb anthraquinones has been linked to colonic toxicity including the formation of melanosis coli which is associated with increased risk of colon cancer . The major purgative anthraquinone in rhubarb is thought to be sennoside A which is metabolised by colonic microflora . Here we sought to identify the toxic metabolite responsible for melanosis coli in rats dosed with rhubarb anthraquinones for up to 90days . Three metabolites were detected in rat faeces using HPLC . Of these rhein was identified as the metabolite that accumulated most over time . Fecal flora from treated rats were capable of greater biotransformation of sennoside A to rhein compared to that from control rats . Cell culture experiments suggested that apoptosis and autophagy induced by rhein is the likely mechanism of chronic toxicity of rhubarb anthraquinones .

@highlight Rats fed with rhubarb anthraquinones RA showed colonic toxicity.
@highlight The RA metabolites in the feces were investigated by HPLC.
@highlight The metabolite rhein accumulated in RA rat feces.
@highlight Fecal flora of the RA rats biotransformed sennoside A to rhein.
@highlight Rhein induced apoptosis and autophagy in normal colon cells.
