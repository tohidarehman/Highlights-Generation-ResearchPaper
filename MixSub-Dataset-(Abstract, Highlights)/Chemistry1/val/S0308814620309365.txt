 Honeycrisp is a popular apple cultivar because of its superior appearance and flavor . We investigated its aroma profiles and characteristic aroma . Whereas the aroma profiles of developing fruits were dominated by aldehydes postharvest fruit accumulated abundant esters alcohols and sesquiterpenoids . Most of these components showed maxima at the fruits climacteric peak . There were more types and higher contents of sesquiterpenoids aldehydes and esters in the fruit skin than in the pulp while alcohol contents and types were comparable between the pulp and skin . Aroma extract dilution and gas chromatographyolfactometry analyses revealed that hexyl 2 methylbutyrate

@highlight Pre and post harvest aroma profiles in peel and pulp of Honeycrisp were determined.
@highlight Postharvest fruit accumulated abundant esters alcohols and sesquiterpenoids.
@highlight More sesquiterpenoids aldehydes and esters were in the fruit skin than the pulp.
@highlight AEDA GC O omission tests and sensory description analysis were used in the study.
@highlight Hexyl 2 methylbutyrate with a strong fruity note is the key aroma of Honeycrisp.
