 Monitoring of tropane alkaloids is regulated in the European Union in cereal based foods for infants and young children tea and herbal infusions . The European Commissions Joint Research Centre developed an improved LC MS MS analytical method using a pentafluorophenyl column validated it and conducted two proficiency tests targeting these food categories . A subset of the data gathered from laboratories that used the JRC method was additionally exploited to derive interlaboratory performance characteristics .
