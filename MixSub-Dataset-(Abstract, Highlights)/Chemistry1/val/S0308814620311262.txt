 This work aimed to develop a method permitting an informed choice of antioxidants to reduce carcinogenic heterocyclic aromatic amine formation during proteinaceous food cooking . Therefore a three step approach was developed . First the most promising antioxidants were selected using molecular modeling approaches . For this analog design was used to highlight the most suitable antioxidants based on their diversification potential using bioisosteric replacement . Then structure activity relationship studies allowed drawing the relevant properties for inhibiting HAA formation and explained partly the inhibitory activity . Secondly the approved antioxidants were tested in ground beef patties to assess their inhibitory properties against HAA formation . Resveratrol was found to be the most efficient as it totally inhibited MeIQ and reduced MeIQx and PhIP formation by 40 and 70 respectively . Finally natural ingredients rich in these antioxidants were evaluated . Oregano was found to totally inhibit MeIQ formation and to reduce by half MeIQx and PhIP formation .
