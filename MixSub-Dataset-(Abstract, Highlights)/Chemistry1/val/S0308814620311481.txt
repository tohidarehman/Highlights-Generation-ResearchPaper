 Nowadays novel tools have been developed for efficient analysis and visualization of large scale metabolite profile data associated with metabolic pathways . A high throughput platform using PathVisio 3 combined with multivariate analysis is proposed for the first time . Additionally this is the first analysis of the relationships among terpenoids monoterpene sesquiterpene triterpene and tetraterpene during pepper fruit ripening and their changes . This platform was successfully applied to interpret large scale data related to 131 metabolites from mature and immature fruits of 13 pepper phenotypes . The carotenoid derived volatiles such as dihydroactinidiolide and ionone were closely correlated with carotenoids indicating that the synthesis and degradation of carotenoids occurred in pepper fruit mature stage . Using PathVisio 3 the metabolic changes in pathway could be presented quickly revealing the accumulation of stress related metabolites such as proline capsaicin and phenylalanine in the mature stage . This approach could provide useful information about comprehensive biochemical regulation of fruit ripening .

@highlight Metabolomics results of 131 metabolites were obtained from 26 pepper phenotypes.
@highlight Carotenoids were correlated with the carotenoid derived volatiles in pepper fruit.
@highlight Our data reveal the accumulation of stress related metabolites in mature pepper fruit.
