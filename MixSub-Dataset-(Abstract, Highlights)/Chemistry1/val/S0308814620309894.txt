 Poor stability of fish hydrolyzed collagen hampers its applications especially as food ingredients . The use of liposome as a vesicle can be a potential means to enhance bioactivities and stability of HC . HC from defatted Asian sea bass skin at different levels were loaded into liposomes prepared from soy phosphatidylcholine with various stabilizers or glycerol . The highest encapsulation efficiency was found in SPC CHO 0.5 HC

@highlight Hydrolyzed collagen HC from defatted Asian sea bass skin was loaded in liposomes.
@highlight Liposomes were prepared by soy phosphatidylcholine SPC and cholesterol glycerol.
@highlight Higher encapsulation efficiency was found in liposome with cholesterol SPC CHO .
@highlight SPC CHO 0.5 HC had high stability during storage and in gastrointestinal tract model.
@highlight SPC CHO 0.5 HC appeared as the vesicle with double layers.
