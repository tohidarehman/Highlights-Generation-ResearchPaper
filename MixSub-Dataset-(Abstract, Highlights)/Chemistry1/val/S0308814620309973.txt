 Watermelon seed a watermelon processing industry by product is a good protein source for the preparation of antioxidant peptides due to its high protein content low cost special amino acid composition . Antioxidant hydrolysates obtained from watermelon seed protein after slit divergent ultrasound treatment were studied . The stepwise multiple linear regression model verified that the reducing power of watermelon seed protein hydrolysates is positively related with SH and turn content of WSP

@highlight A new slit divergent ultrasonic equipment was used.
@highlight Effects of ultrasonic pretreatment on reducing power of hydrolysates were studied.
@highlight Structural properties of WSP pretreated by ultrasonic were investigated.
@highlight Stepwise MLR model of structural and antioxidant property of WSP was established.
@highlight WSPHs 1 kDa were more effective antioxidant capacity
