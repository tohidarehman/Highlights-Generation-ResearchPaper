 Methanol is highly toxic for human so methanol detection is valuable especially in water and ethanol medium without complicated and time consuming procedure . In this work we present a new fluorescence probe for direct detection of methanol in aqueous and ethanol medium based on the ZnS Mn

@highlight Synthesis of new ZnS Mn
@highlight QDs NMPPy hybrid as fluorescence switchable sensing system.
@highlight Hybridization was caused a selective and sensitive fluorescence response to methanol.
@highlight Successfully utilized to determine the amount of methanol in water and ethanol medium.
@highlight Sensing mechanism of ZnS Mn
@highlight QDs NMPPy hybrid is competitive interaction.
