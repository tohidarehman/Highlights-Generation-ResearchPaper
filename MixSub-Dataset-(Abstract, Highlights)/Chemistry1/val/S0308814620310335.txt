 The inhibition effects of glutathione on acrylamide in the asparagine glucose model systems and cookies were investigated . The formation of AA was significantly inhibited by GSH addition in the model systems . The decreasing levels of AA were in the range of 3886 5782 and 341 at 120 140 and 160C respectively . In addition the presence of GSH in cookies also inhibited the AA formation but with no corresponding relationship between the GSH level and the inhibition ratio . The addition of 0.05g kg GSH in cookie dough resulted in the decreasing of AA by 48 some improvement in cookie lightness but no influence on cookie texture . Kinetic analysis showed that the application of GSH not only inhibited the formation of AA but also improved the elimination of AA . In the summary GSH could be a potential inhibitor to reduce the AA formation in food during the heating process .

@highlight Inhibition of GSH on AA in the Glc Asn model system and cookies.
@highlight Inhibition of GSH on AA caused by the competitive reaction and declined pH value.
@highlight GSH could be used as a potential inhibitor to decrease AA formation in foods.
@highlight Presence of GSH improved cookies lightness but not affected cookies texture.
