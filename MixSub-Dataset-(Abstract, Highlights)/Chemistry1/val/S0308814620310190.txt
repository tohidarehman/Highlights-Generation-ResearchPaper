 The processing and digestive stability of ethanolic extracts from four Thai rice bran varieties namely Khao Dawk Mali 105 Hom Nil Kiaw Ngu and Leum Pua were assessed by applying different thermal and pH conditions as well as

@highlight Heat treatment induced loss of phenolics and flavonoids in non colored brans.
@highlight Degradation of anthocyanins was observed after heat treatment of colored brans.
@highlight Phenolic compounds from rice brans showed high stability under low pH conditions.
@highlight Loss of bioaccessibility was observed after simulated gastrointestinal digestion.
@highlight New insights on the stability of extracts can support functional food applications.
