 Melatonin and serotonin are bioactive compounds present in foods and beverages and related to neuroprotection and anti angiogenesis among other activities . They have been described in wines and the role of yeast in their formation is clear . Thus this study evaluates the content of these bioactives and other related indolic compounds in beer . For this purpose commercial beers were analyzed by a validated UHPLC HRMS method and sample treatment optimized due to the low concentrations expected . Moreover a wort was fermented with different commercial beer yeast in order to monitor the formation of these bioactives during the elaboration process . Results show that indolic compounds such as

@highlight PTFE filters is the most convenient to diminish losses of
@highlight  TRP metabolites.
@highlight MEL is stable in beer matrix for 30days at 20C.
@highlight 5 HTRP NA5 HT 3 IAA and
@highlight  TRP EE is described for the first time in commercial beers.
@highlight NA5 HT and 3 IAA is produced during the alcoholic fermentation of wort.
