 The utility of an autoencoder as a feature extraction tool for near infrared spectroscopy based discrimination analysis has been explored and the discrimination of the geographic origins of 8 different agricultural products has been performed as the case study . The sample spectral features were broad and insufficient for component distinction due to considerable overlap of individual bands so AE enabling of extracting the sample descriptive features in the spectra would help to improve discrimination accuracy . For comparison four different inputs of AE extracted features raw NIR spectra principal component scores and features extracted using locally linear embedding were employed for sample discrimination using support vector machine . The use of AE extracted feature improved the accuracy in the discrimination of samples in all 8 products . The improvement was more substantial when the sample spectral features were indistinct . It demonstrates that AE is expandable for vibrational spectroscopic discriminant analysis of other samples with complex composition .

@highlight Autoencoder AE was evaluated as a feature extraction tool for NIR discrimination analysis.
@highlight AE extracted feature was used to discriminate geographic origins of 8 kinds of agricultural products.
@highlight Raw spectra PC Principal Component scores and LLE Locally Linear Embedding extracted features were also used for the discrimination.
@highlight AE extracted feature improved the SVM Support Vector Machine based discrimination accuracy in all the 8 different cases.
@highlight The improvement was substantial when the sample spectral features were relatively indistinct.
