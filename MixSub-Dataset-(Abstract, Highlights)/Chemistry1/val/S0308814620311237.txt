 The first detailed phytochemical screening was performed on juices prepared from arils of wild pomegranate fruits taken from several locations in Montenegro with the aim of their future valorization . Particular attention is paid to the effect of pomegranate growth conditions on the juice quality . In addition to the basic parameters of pomegranate fruits and juices nine primary metabolites were determined in the juices . Among 97 phenolic compounds 23 anthocyanins and their derivatives 33 ellagitannins and derivatives of ellagic acid 12 flavanols 4 flavonol glycosides 1 flavone 17 hydroxybenzoic acids and 7 hydroxycinnamic acids and their derivatives were identified . Flavanols as well as ellagitannins and ellagic acid derivatives had the highest concentrations in pomegranate juices . Juices from the pomegranates grown on two soil types had total analyzed phenolics ranging from 4387mg L up to 8461mg L .

@highlight Quality of pomegranate juice could vary greatly between different local genotypes.
@highlight P. juice has similar or higher sweetness than apple orange and sour cherry juice.
@highlight Most abundant phenolics are flavanols ellagitannins and ellagic acid derivatives.
@highlight Level of anthocyanins in pomegranate juice is in positive relationship with soil Mg.
@highlight Some local genotypes are useful for genetic characterization and breeding purposes.
