 The influence of fresh egg white addition on the quality characteristics and protein aggregation in oat noodles containing wheat flour and gluten was studied . EW addition decreased cooking loss and increased cooking time of 70 oat noodles . The hardness chewiness tensile force and tensile distance improved significantly . A smooth surface and continuous protein network were observed by scanning electron microscopy after adding EW . After cooking the peak area in SE HPLC profile of 70 oat noodles with EW decreased obviously . The extractabilities of protein in sodium dodecyl sulfate containing medium of cooked wheat and oat noodles under non reducing condition were lower than those of samples under reducing condition . The protein bands changes in SDS PAGE profiles showed that EW could induce disulfide cross linking of proteins in noodles . EW addition promoted proteins interaction and improved the cooking and texture properties of oat noodles .
