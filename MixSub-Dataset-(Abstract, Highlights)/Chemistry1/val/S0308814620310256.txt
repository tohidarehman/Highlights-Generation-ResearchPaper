 Herein a surface plasmon resonance enhanced DNA biosensor has been developed for real time detection of donkey meat marker using biotinylated reporter and streptavidin functionalized gold nanostars

@highlight An SPR based DNA biosensor has been developed for detection of donkey meat marker.
@highlight Gold nanostars was used as enhanced label in the sandwich hybridization assay.
@highlight Target DNA could be detected with the LLOQ of 1.0nM and RSD of 0.85 .
@highlight The detection of 1 and 5 values of donkey meat adulteration was successfully done.
