 The influences of konjac glucomannan on the water distribution of frozen dough and steamed bread quaility made from frozen dough were addressed in this study . Low Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis demonstrated that the less tightly bound water of the dough was transferred to tightly bound water with the increase of KGM . Differential Scanning Calorimetry showed that the freezable water of the frozen dough was transferred to non freezable water with increasing the amount of KGM . DSC and LF NMR results indicated the water state in the frozen dough was consistent . The addition of KGM enhanced the height and whiteness of steamed bread but it decreased springiness cohesiveness and resilience of steamed bread . As the KGM substitution rate increased the hardness of steamed bread first decreased and then increased . The steamed bread with 1.5 of KGM showed the best quality .

@highlight Konjac glucomannan has a good water holding capacity.
@highlight DSC and NMR showed that the water distribution in the frozen dough was consistent.
@highlight The water migration behavior and KGM addition had a significant linear correlation.
@highlight Konjac glucomannan caused a decrease in the water content of freezable water and increased the relative amount of non freezable water in frozen dough.
@highlight KGM can improve the corresponding steamed bread quality.
