 This study demonstrates the development of biocompatible Ag nanoparticles Tannic acid Zein electrospun membranes with synergistic antibacterial catalytic and antioxidant activity . The optimal spinning concentration of zein was 32wt . The prepared zein electrospun membranes were immersed into tannic acid solution to investigate the effects of TA concentrations pH temperature and time on the loading amount of TA . Then the TA Zein electrospun membranes were immersed into a silver nitrate solution to reduce the AgNPs in situ . The morphology of the electrospun membranes was characterized by scanning electron microscopy . UVvisible spectrophotometer Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X ray diffraction were used to carry out the loading amount of TA and Ag nanoparticles . Finally the antioxidant antibacterial and catalytic activity of TA Zein and AgNPs TA Zein electrospun membranes were studied . It was found that the AgNPs TA Zein electrospun membranes with different TA concentrations have certain antibacterial antioxidation and catalytic ability which may be of interest for the development of active packaging that could extend the shelf life of perishable foods .

@highlight The morphology of the membranes was significantly depending on the concentration of Tan.
