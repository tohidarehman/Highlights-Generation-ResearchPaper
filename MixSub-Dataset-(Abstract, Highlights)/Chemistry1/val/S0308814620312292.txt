 PC PE PI and PA in 9 peanut matrices obtained during the AEP of peanut were quantified employing HPLC ELSD analysis in this study . Phosphorus contents of crude oils obtained from different demulsification treatments were also investigated . Decantation had a larger effect than grinding in terms of phospholipids loss due to alkaline hydrolysis indicating this processing step was vital for the manipulation of phospholipids levels remained in oil . Over 80 of initial phospholipids were lost during AEP and only 19.8 of initial phospholipids ended up in cream skim and sediment phase . 52.55 of the remained phospholipids trapped in cream phase . Just 22.1632.61mg kg phosphorus content could be detected in crude oils which indicated the separation of phospholipids from the cream phase into aqueous medium . Degumming was not essential in AEP of peanut and the waste generated after demulsification could be a source of phospholipids .

@highlight Decantation highly reduced phospholipids in aqueous extraction processing.
@highlight A small amount of phospholipids 19.8 survived in aqueous extraction processing.
@highlight 52.55 of the remained phospholipids trapped in cream phase.
@highlight Degumming is needless for aqueous extraction processing.
