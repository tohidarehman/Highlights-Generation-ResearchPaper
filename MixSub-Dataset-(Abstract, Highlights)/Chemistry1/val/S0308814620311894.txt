 The effect of variation in acid gel pH during cream cheese production was investigated . The gel microstructure was denser and cheese texture firmer as the pH decreased from pH 5.0 to pH 4.3 despite the viscoelasticity of these gels remaining similar during heating . Protein hydration and secondary structure appeared to be key factors affecting both cheese microstructure and properties . Proteins within the matrix appeared to swell at pH 5.0 leading to a larger corpuscular structure greater turn structure was also observed by synchrotron Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy and the cheese was softer . A decrease in pH led to a denser microstructure with increased aggregated sheet structure and a firmer cheese . The higher whey protein loss at low pH likely contributed to increased cheese hardness . In summary controlling the pH of acid gel is important as this parameter affects proteins in the cheese their secondary structure and the resulting cream cheese .

@highlight Variation in acid gel pH affects the microstructure of cream cheese.
@highlight Greater protein hydration at pH 5.0 leads to bigger protein fat aggregates.
@highlight Reduced interaction between whey protein and casein contributes to softer cheese.
@highlight Aggregated sheet protein increases and turn protein decreases in cheese at pH 4.3.
