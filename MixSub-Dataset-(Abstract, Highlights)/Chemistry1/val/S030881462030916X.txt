 Interactions between saccharides and ions in aqueous solutions are of great importance in many fields . Thus this work proposes to develop a methodology dealing with the characterization and the understanding of interactions between saccharides and cations in presence of water molecules by a quantum mechanics approach . In the first part the saccharide hydration properties in pure water are determined . Results show that the saccharide coordination numbers as well as the saccharides hydration enthalpy increase with the saccharide hydrophilic group number . In the second part the influence of cations on saccharides hydration properties and inversely is evaluated . In saccharide cation water systems the decrease in hydration enthalpy of cations and saccharides shows that both species are dehydrated and that saccharide dehydration depends on the nature of the cation . The dehydration sequence of saccharides was explained from the study of saccharide cation interactions .

@highlight Cations and saccharides are both dehydrated in saccharide cation water systems.

@highlight Saccharides dehydration increase with the number of saccharide cation interactions.
@highlight The cation interactions number in water or in presence of saccharide is constant.
