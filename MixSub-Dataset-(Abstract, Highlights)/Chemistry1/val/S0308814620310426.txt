 Walnut leaves are rich in phenolic components with antibiotic and antioxidative effects . However few studies have reported the quantitative analysis of active components in walnut leaf . In this study a novel method for quantifying the active components in walnut leaves was developed by combining ultra high performance liquid chromatography hybrid quadrupole Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry with quantitative analysis of multi components by a single marker . In total 13 bioactive components were analyzed by a single marker quercetin . To evaluate the accuracy of this method an auxiliary quantification method with 13 reference standards was established and validated . The standard method differences of the quantification results between QAMS and the auxiliary method were lower than 20 indicating that the QAMS method can accurately determine the active components in walnut leaves . This method can provide a reference to address the absence of reference standards for analyzing other foods and herbs .

@highlight A novel method UHPLC HRMS coupled with QAMS was developed for walnut leaf analysis.
@highlight The method quantitatively analyzed 13 components by a single marker quercetin.
@highlight The developed QAMS method overcomes the absence of reference standards.
