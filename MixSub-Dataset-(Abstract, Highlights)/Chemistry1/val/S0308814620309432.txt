 Mycotoxin contaminations of tea have been considered serious problems . The presence of interfering substances presents enormous challenges to accurate detection of hazardous analytes in tea soups . In this work we have carefully predicted evaluated and confirmed the matrix effects in tea that have an undesired influence on the detection of aflatoxin B1 in tea soups by lateral flow test strips . After pretreatment of tea samples by simple dilution to change the acidic tea soups to alkaline environments the matrix effects can be completely eliminated and the reliability of AFB1 analysis in tea soups can be effectively guaranteed . AFB1 contaminated samples of different tea soups can be accurately measured with detection limits down to 0.05ppb . As the first pioneering report to study the matrix effects on AFB1 monitoring in tea soups by LFTS we definitely expect this work to further widen the application of LFTS for hazard screening in food safety .

@highlight Matrix effect to AFB1 detection in tea was predicted evaluated and confirmed.
@highlight Sample treatments were carried out to easy avoid the matrix effect.
@highlight AFB1 in tea can be direct and accurate determined with lateral flow strip.
@highlight AFB1 in various tea soups were direct detected without matrix effect.
