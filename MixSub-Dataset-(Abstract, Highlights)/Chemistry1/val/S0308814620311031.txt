 Curcumin is a promising edible phytochemical compound with ideal ulcerative colitis treatment activity however it is characteristically instable in the digestive tract and has a short retention time in colon . Therefore we designed and fabricated an oral food grade nanocarrier composed of tannic acid coated Genipin crosslinked human serum albumin to encapsulate CUR . The resulting CUR nanoparticles were about 220nm and 28.8mV . With the assistance of TA layer and Gnp crosslinking the entire nano scaled system effectively delayed CUR release in simulated gastric fluid prolonged its colon adhesion and increased its uptake in Caco 2 cells . As expected TA CUR NPs oral administration significantly alleviated colitis symptoms in DSS treated mice when compared with controls by inhibiting the TLR4 linked NF B signaling pathway . Collectively this study indicates that we have developed a convenient eco friendly nano scaled vehicle for oral delivery of CUR with anti UC benefit .

@highlight Oral food grade NPs composed of TA HSA and Gnp encapsulated CUR to treat UC.
@highlight The TA surface layer provided gastric protection and colon adherence.
@highlight Gnp is a natural and harmless cross linker used to crosslink HSA in study.
@highlight TA CUR NPs showed the good anti inflammatory effect via TLR4 NFB signaling pathway.
