 Beverages often packaged in plastic can be a source of microplastics in the human diet . In this study an improved method for detection of microplastics in white wines capped with synthetic stoppers is explored . Visual quantification in the stereomicroscope or using Nile Red were excluded due to the small size of particles . Quantification in the optical microscope identified up to 5 857 particles.L

@highlight Suspected microplastics are present in white wines up to 5 857 particles L
@highlight Micro Raman spectroscopy confirmed microplastic presence in all bottles except two.
@highlight Median dimensions of microplastics were 26122m.
@highlight The blue laser 442nm in spectroscopy allowed better signal to noise ratio.
@highlight A reduction in filtered volume is preferred to 15 H
@highlight treatment.
