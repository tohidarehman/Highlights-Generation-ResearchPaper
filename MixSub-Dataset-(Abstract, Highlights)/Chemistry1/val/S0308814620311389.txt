 The inclusion on the label of packed foods of any ingredient or technological adjuvant causing allergies is required by EU food legislation . In this study a targeted proteomics method for detecting four allergens in animal derived food matrices was developed . Liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution tandem mass spectrometry was used to select marker peptides from four allergens and develop a quantitative method able to simultaneously detect the presence of milk egg crustaceans and soy . The method was validated on fish or swine processed food products contaminated at 5gg

@highlight LC HRMS MS method to detect egg soy milk and crustaceans in food products.
@highlight Addition of heavy labeled peptides reduced variability during the sample analysis.
@highlight Method suitable for quantification of 4 allergens in food with high protein content.
@highlight Analysis of real samples revealed unexpected presence of soy in some processed foods.
