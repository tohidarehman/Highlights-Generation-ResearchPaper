 Plant based proteins and polyphenols are increasingly being explored as functional food ingredients . Colloidal complexes were prepared from pea protein and grape seed proanthocyanidin and the ability of the PP GSP complexes to form and stabilize oil in water emulsions were investigated . The main interactions between PP and GSP were hydrogen bonding . The stability of PP GSP complexes to environmental changes were studied pH ion strength and temperature . Emulsions produced using PP GSP complexes as emulsifiers had small mean droplet diameters and strongly negative surface potentials . Compared to PP alone PP GSP complexes slightly decreased the isoelectric point thermostability and salt stability of the emulsions but increased their storage stability . The presence of GSP gave the emulsions a strong salmon color which may be beneficial for some specific applications . These results may assist in the creation of more efficacious food based strategies for delivering proanthocyanidins .
