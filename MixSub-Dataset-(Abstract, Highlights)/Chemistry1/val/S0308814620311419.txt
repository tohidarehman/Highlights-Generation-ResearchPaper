 Stability of protein polyphenol aggregate particles created by complexing polyphenols from blueberry and muscadine grape pomaces with a rice pea protein isolate blend was evaluated in an

@highlight Berry pomace polyphenols were complexed with protein to form protein polyphenol aggregate particles.
@highlight The particles were evaluated in an

@highlight Complexed particles were more stable than unmodified samples post digestion.
@highlight Complexed particles delivered higher polyphenol concentrations in their digest.
@highlight Complexed particles retained higher antioxidant anti inflammatory activities.
