 This study evaluates the addition of monolayered and multilayered fish oil microcapsules to meat model systems and determines the effects of processing and culinary cooking . Adding MO and MU increased the content of EPA and DHA and the level of secondary oxidation products but being far away from the oxidation values that generate anomalous flavours . However it did not lead to oxidative damage of the enriched batches or affect the moisture and lipid content during processing and or culinary cooking . The type of fish oil microcapsules the processing and or culinary cooking and the type of meat matrix influenced the fatty acid digestion . The highest bioaccessibility of EPA and DHA occurred in cooked samples enriched with MO after processing and before culinary cooking . To optimize EPA and DHA enrichment and bioaccessibility the type of fish oil microcapsules may be selected as a function of the type of added meat products .

@highlight Multilayered fish oil microcapsules achieve high EPA and DHA enrichment.
@highlight Monolayered fish oil microcapsules led to a high EPA and DHA bioavailability.
@highlight EPA and DHA bioavailability are affected by the meat processing cooking.
@highlight The type of meat model system influenced on EPA and DHA bioavailability.
