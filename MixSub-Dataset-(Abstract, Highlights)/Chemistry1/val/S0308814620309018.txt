 In this study we investigated the tailoring of food emulsions using interactions between rice bran cellulose nanocrystals and lauric arginate which is food grade cationic surfactant . Complexes of anionic CNCs and cationic LAE were formed through electrostatic attraction which were characterized using isothermal titration calorimetry turbidity and zeta potential measurements . The saturation complexes could be formed at ratios of 1 2 CNCs to LAE . Furthermore the physical and oxidative stability of oil in water emulsions containing lipid droplets coated by CNCs LAE complexes was determined . Electrostatic complexes formed from 0.02 CNCs and 0.1 LAE produced stable Pickering emulsions that were resistant to droplet coalescence . It was also exhibited that 0.02 CNCs and 0.1 LAE complexes stabilized emulsions was able to extend the lag phase to 20days for lipid hydroperoxide and to 14days for hexanal production . This study shows that food grade Pickering emulsions with good stability can be produced by CNCs with LAE complexes .

@highlight The emulsifying properties of CNCs was improved by electrostatic forming with LAE.
@highlight CNCs LAE complexes produced stable Pickering emulsions resisting to destabilization.
@highlight CNCs LAE stabilized emulsion had good oxidative stability.
@highlight The synergistic of 0.02 CNCs and 0.1 LAE complexes could decrease lipid oxidation.
