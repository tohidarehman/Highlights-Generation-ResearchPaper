 A simple and environmentally friendly method was developed for simultaneous determination of benzoic acid sorbic acid and propionic acid in fermented food samples . The analytes were extracted and pre concentrated by headspace solid phase microextraction and analysed by GC FID . Central composite design was conducted for the optimization of HS SPME conditions.Under optimal conditions a good linear range was obtained in the range of 5150mg L

@highlight Solvent free extraction method for determination of preservatives in food samples.
@highlight Fermented food samples are analyzed with no pretreatment step.
@highlight Good reproducibility environmentally friendly and no matrix interference.
