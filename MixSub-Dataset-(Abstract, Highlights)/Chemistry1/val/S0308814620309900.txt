 From an interfacial phenomena standpoint gallic acid methyl gallate and their combination alone and together with lecithin were evaluated for their inhibition against the formation of lipid hydroperoxides and carbonyl compounds in a stripped sunflower oil . Lecithin at a level lower than its critical micelle concentration was able to protect the lipid system to some extent . GA which was of higher capacity than MG in donating H e
