 Stevioside is the main and the sweetest glycoside of stevia plant . It is attractive as a natural sweetener to diabetics and others on carbohydrate controlled diets . This paper discusses the stability of stevioside under food processing conditions . It was found that stevioside was transformed not only to rubusoside steviolbioside steviol monoside and steviol but also to previously unknown stevioside anomer and rubusoside anomer . Those two identified stevioside transformation products are formed not only during the heating of acidic neutral and alkaline stevioside standard solutions and stevia leaves suspensions in water and ethanol water solvents but also during the processing of foods containing stevia .

@highlight The influence of different factors on the transformation of stevioside was examined.
@highlight 2 anomers which have not been reported yet were obtained in this study.
@highlight Transformation of stevioside during its extraction.
@highlight Transformation of stevioside during food processing.
@highlight Transformation of stevioside in ESI source.
