 With the current agro food industry demands for more environmentally friendly production the use of natural antifungal compounds extracted by emerging technologies led to a sustainable alternative to control microorganisms . Therefore the present work aimed to determine antifungal activity against

@highlight The high hydrostatic pressure achieved to extract of flavonoids.
@highlight The extracts obtained by high hydrostatic pressure proved highest inhibition rates.
@highlight In order to increase the antifungal activity a fractionation was performed.
@highlight The ethanolic and methanolic extracts showed highest inhibition rates.
@highlight In total 21 possible secondary metabolites were identified.
