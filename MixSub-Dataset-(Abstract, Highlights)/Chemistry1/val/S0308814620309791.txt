 This study was aimed to reduce the concentrations of benzopyrene and acrylamide in roasted coffee beans by corona discharge plasma jet . The initial concentrations of BaP and ACR in roasted beans were decreased by 53.6 and 32.0 respectively following CDPJ treatment for 60min . The levels of total solid total acid chlorogenic acid caffeine trigonelline and pH were insignificantly changed upon CDPJ treatment compared to controls . However the concentration of total phenolic content and Agtron color values were altered significantly . The treatment of beans did not alter descriptive sensory properties of the corresponding coffee brews except aroma and aftertaste characteristics . As the treatment time increased from 15 to 60min scores for aroma profiles in PCA plot were shifted from right to left although overlapping was observed between 15 and 30 min treated samples . Additionally none of the treated samples were discriminated from the control by electronic tongue .

@highlight Benzopyrene and acrylamide in roasted coffee beans can be degraded by CDPJ.
@highlight The treatment did not alter the biochemical characteristics of the coffee beans.
@highlight Sensory quality was determined by electronic nose and electronic tongue technology.
@highlight Descriptive sensory evaluation was performed.
