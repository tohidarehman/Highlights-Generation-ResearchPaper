 This study represents a rapid and non destructive approach based on mid infrared spectroscopy time domain nuclear magnetic resonance and machine learning classification models for monitoring soluble pectin content changes in orange juice . Current reference methods of SPC in orange juice are laborious requiring several extractions with successive adjustments hindering rapid process intervention . 109 fresh orange juices samples representing different harvests were analysed using MIR TD NMR and reference method . Unsupervised algorithms were applied for natural clustering of MIR and TD NMR data in two groups . Analyses of variance of the two MIR and TD NMR datasets show that only the MIR groups were different at 95 confidence for SPC average values . This approach allows build classification models based on MIR data achieving 85 and 89 of accuracy . Results demonstrate that MIR ML can be a suitable strategy for the quick assessment of SPC trends in orange juices .

@highlight MIR could be a useful method for classifying the pectin content in orange juice.
@highlight SVM and kNN regression were able to model the MIR spectra data.
@highlight MIR spectroscopy measurements coupled to machine learning models can be used as a screening method in orange juice factories.
