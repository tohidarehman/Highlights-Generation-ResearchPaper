 Granular protein is an important structural feature in determining starch digestibility . High amylose wheat starch with 80 amylose content contains more granular protein than wild type starch . As analyzed by mass spectrometry based proteomics granular bound starch synthase is the major granular protein in isolated starch materials . GBSS content increases with amylose content Spearmans correlation

@highlight High amylose wheat starch HAWS has more granular protein content than wild type.
@highlight Mass spectrometry Proteomics revealed the protein profile of HAWS.
@highlight Granular bound starch synthase GBSS content increases with amylose content.
@highlight Relative abundance of major granular proteins in HAWS does not differ from wild type.
@highlight Greater granular protein content in HAWS contributes to slower amylolysis.
