 The present study aimed to characterize the nutritional value and potential use of elderberries as a source of antioxidant compounds . The chemical composition fatty acids and phenolic compounds were determined for elderberries . The optimization of extraction parameters was designed with a Box Behnken design coupled with response surface methodology and desirability function analysis . The process parameters tested included extraction temperature of ethanol and pH while response variables were global extraction yield total phenolic and anthocyanins content carotenoids and antioxidant activity . Analyses revealed that elderberry was a rich source of total soluble solids proteins and polyunsaturated fatty acids . Regarding phenolic compounds elderberries were found abundant in flavonoids and phenolic acids
