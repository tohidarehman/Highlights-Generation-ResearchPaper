 A magnetic fluorescence probe was fabricated by coating carbon quantum dots doped molecularly imprinted polymers layers on the surface of Fe

@highlight Magnetic fluorescence probe was got by coating CDs doped MIPs layer on surface of Fe
@highlight particles.
@highlight N Z 
@highlight  homoserine lactone molecular was used as the template to prepare AHLs MIP layers.
@highlight The probe was applied to the analysis of AHLs in fish juice and milk samples.
@highlight AHLs fluorescence probe owned great potential for wide ranging application in food products.
