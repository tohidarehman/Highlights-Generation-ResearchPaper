 The objective of this study was to determine the biophysical properties of buckwheat endosperm and their influences on detachment of intact cells starch gelatinization and digestibility . The intact cells were isolated from BW kernels by dry milling and sieving . The microscopy and texture analysis showed intact endosperm cells could be detached easily due to the fragile structure and low hardness of BW endosperm . More than 70 intact cells were found in commercial light flour . The starch granules entrapped in intact cells exhibited a delay gelatinization and restricted swelling behavior . Starch in BW flour had a markedly lower extent of digestion compared to the broken cells and isolated starch . This study provided a new mechanistic understanding of low glycemic index of BW food and could guide the processing of BW flour to retain slow digestion properties .

@highlight Endosperm cells in BW kernels can be detached easily as intact cells during milling.
@highlight Starch granules entrapped in BW intact cells have the restricted swelling behaviors.
@highlight More than 70 intact endosperm cells retained in BW flour limit starch digestion.
@highlight BW kernels had the fragile structure and only 1 3 of the hardness of cereal kernels.
@highlight BW endosperm cells detached along cells wall rather through than in cell matrix.
