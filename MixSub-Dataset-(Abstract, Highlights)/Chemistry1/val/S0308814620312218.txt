 Cyanide is a highly toxic anion . Nonetheless many food plants could produce endogenous cyanide which causes great danger to human health . Thus monitoring cyanide in food samples is critically significant . Herein we rationally developed the first ratiometric near infrared fluorescent probe for sensing cyanide in food samples . The probe displayed noticeable fluorescence in near infrared region . Moreover upon treatment with cyanide the probe exhibited highly selective and sensitive ratiometric fluorescence response with limit of detection determined to be 0.075M and limit of quantification determined to be 0.25M . The ratios of fluorescent intensities at 519 and 688nm I

@highlight A ratiometric NIR fluorescent probe for cyanide was developed.
@highlight The probe showed selective sensitive and reversible response to cyanide.
@highlight The probe was applied for sensing cyanide in various foods.
@highlight The method was validated.
