 In this work the effect of oxidation induced by hydroxyl radicals on the binding abilities of myofibrillar protein gels to aldehydes and ketones and their relationship with MP gel properties were investigated . Mild oxidation 00.2mM H

@highlight Oxidation could induce a shift from the immobile water to free water during gelation.
@highlight Release of aldehydes and ketones in gel decreased with the carbon chain length.
@highlight Flavours release of MPs gel was affected by their microstructure.
@highlight The binding abilities of oxidized MPs gels to aldehydes were stronger than to ketones.
@highlight Flavours release of MPs gel might be affected by gel water mobility.
