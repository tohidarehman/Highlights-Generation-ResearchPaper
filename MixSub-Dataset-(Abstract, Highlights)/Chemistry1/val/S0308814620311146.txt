 Mycoprotein is a food ingredient from filamentous fungi rich in protein and fibre . This study investigated the protein bioaccessibility from the fungal cells by colourimetric assays in different mycoprotein formulations following extraction methods and

@highlight Mycoprotein cell walls are highly resilient to mechanical physical processing and digestion.
@highlight Intestinal proteases are the main factors controlling protein bioaccessibility from mycoprotein products.
@highlight Diffusion of proteases through the cell wall is the proposed mechanism which facilitates the high protein bioavailability.
@highlight An optimal ratio of mycoprotein to enzymes is crucial for protein release.
