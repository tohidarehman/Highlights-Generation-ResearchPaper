 The development of functional foods based on medicinal food ingredients has become a hot topic in China . Di Wu Yang Gan is a Chinese medicinal food that contains five dietary plants . Various health benefits including anti inflammation liver regeneration regulation have been reported though the mechanism is not clear . This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of DWYG on carbon tetrachloride induced acute liver injury in embryonic liver L 02 cells and mice model . DWYG medicated serum protected L 02 cells from carbon tetrachloride induced damage reduced the levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in the culture medium decreased the expression of Bax and increased the expression of Bcl 2 . Mice study suggested that DWYG decreased the levels of malondialdehyde ALT and AST . Together these results suggest the hepatoprotective effects of DWYG against ALI and provide an experimental basis for the utilization of DWYG to treat liver damage .
