 Flavor stability is important for the quality of tea beverages . Baking is a typical processing technology to improve the flavor of tea leaves . In present study seven raw tea materials including steamed spring and autumn tea leaves pan fired spring tea leaves and their corresponding baked tea leaves were used to investigate the effect of baking on flavor stability of green tea beverages . The results showed that tea beverages prepared with baked tea had better flavor stability . The baking process obviously changed the concentrations of some important flavor substances especially the aromatic pyrrole substances from 0 to 338.13g L in tea beverages . Heat treatment had little influence on the flavor of tea beverages prepared from baked tea but caused great changes in non volatile and volatile components in those prepared from unbaked leaves . These results could help guide the processing of tea beverages which would improve their flavor quality stability .

@highlight Flavor of green tea beverages processed from baked leaves was more stable.
@highlight Baking decreased concentrations of catechins amino acids and carbohydrates.
@highlight Baking increased concentrations of gallic acid caffeine and pyrrole substances.
@highlight Pyrrole substances in baked tea beverages were stable after heat treatment.
@highlight Steamed leaves are more suitable for beverage procession than pan fired leaves.
