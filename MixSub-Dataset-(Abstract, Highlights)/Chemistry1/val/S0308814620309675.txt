 Synthetic dyes have been widely applied to food processing but abuse of colourants in food may pose risks to human health . To analyze new coccine and orange II in food a versatile surface enhanced Raman scattering platform was proposed . A metal organic framework MOF UiO 66 NH

@highlight UiO 66 NH
@highlight  @Au SERS platform with adsorbability and SERS activity was synthesized.
@highlight New coccine and orange II were measured by SERS platform with satisfactory R
@highlight LOD was 0.4015mg L for new coccine and 0.0546mg L for orange II.
@highlight New coccine and orange II in food matrices were analyzed with acceptable recovery.
