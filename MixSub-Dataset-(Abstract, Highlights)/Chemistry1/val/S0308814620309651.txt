 The removal of pesticide residues in food by ultrasound has attracted more attention in recent years and the formation of intermediate products may have some profound effects on the toxicity of treated food . Therefore degradation of parathion methyl in bovine milk by ultrasonic treatment was studied in this paper . Results showed that the ultrasonic intensity and the initial concentration of PM had a significant effect on the degradation rate of PM . The maximum degradation rate of PM was 97.10 . Three transformation products were identified through UPLC QTOF MS analysis and the oxidation pathway was proposed as the consequence of ultrasonication . Furthermore according to Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship model prediction the ecotoxicity of the transformation products may be higher than that of PM . These findings showed that although ultrasonic treatment can effectively degrade pesticide residues in food it may also generate transformation products with the higher ecotoxicity .

@highlight Ultrasonic treatment effectively enhanced the degradation of parathion methyl PM .
@highlight The degradation of PM was properly fitted the first order kinetics.
@highlight Three degradation products of PM were determined by UPLC QTOF MS.
@highlight The toxicities of three degradation products of PM were evaluated.
@highlight Among the degradation products two of them were more toxic than PM.
