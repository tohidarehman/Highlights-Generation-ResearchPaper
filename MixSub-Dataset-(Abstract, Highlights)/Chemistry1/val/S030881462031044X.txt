 In this paper we report the importance of swelling on gastric digestion of protein gels which is rarely recognized in literature . Whey protein gels with NaCl concentrations 00.1M were used as model foods . The Youngs modulus swelling ratio acid uptake and digestion rate of the gels were measured . Pepsin transport was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using green fluorescent protein . With the increase of NaCl in gels Youngs modulus increased swelling was reduced and digestion was slower with a reduction of acid transport and less GFP present both at surface and in the gels . This shows that swelling affects digestion rate by enhancing acid diffusion but also by modulating the partitioning of pepsin at the food gastric fluid interface and thereby the total amount of pepsin in the food particle . This perspective on swelling will provide new insight for designing food with specific digestion rate for targeted dietary demands .

@highlight Swelling can increase digestion of whey protein gels.
@highlight Swelling properties of whey protein gels can be manipulated by modulating Youngs modulus.
@highlight Acid uptake can be enhanced by swelling.
@highlight Pepsin partitioning between protein gel and gastric juice was increased with more swelling.
