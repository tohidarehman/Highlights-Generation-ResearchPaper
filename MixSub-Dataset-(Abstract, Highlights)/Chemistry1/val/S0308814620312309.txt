 A novel strategy for AFB1 detection in grains was proposed based on DNA tetrahedron structured probe and horseradish peroxidase triggered polyaniline deposition . Briefly the DNA tetrahedron nanostructures were assembled on the gold electrode with carboxylic group designed on top vertex of them . The carboxylic group was conjugated with the AFB1 monoclonal antibody to form DTP . The test sample and a known fixed concentration of HRP labeled AFB1 were mixed and they compete for binding to DTP . The HRP assembled on the gold electrode catalyzed the polymerization of aniline on DTP . AFB1 in grains could be determined by using PANI as electrochemical signal molecules . Interestingly DNA tetrahedron structure which has mechanical rigidity and structural stability can improve antigenantibody specific recognition and binding efficiency through the use of mAb ordered assembly . Meanwhile nucleic acid backbone with a large amount of negative charge is good template for aniline polymerization under mild conditions .
