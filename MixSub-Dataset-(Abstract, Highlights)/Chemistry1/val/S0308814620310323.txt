 With the increasing concerns on food safety foodborne toxicants particularly advanced glycation end products have drawn large attention ascribing to their central role in the pathogenic process of diabetic complications . In this study the antiglycative ability and action mechanism of 10 dried flowers were measured in fructose glucose BSA model with apple flower as the most effective one probably through trapping reactive carbonyl species . Furthermore apple flower was added in cookies to evaluate its antiglycative effect and data suggested that the fortification of cookies with apple flower powders significantly inhibited the formation of methylglyoxal and fluorescent AGEs . Moreover sensory evaluation data showed that 2.5 apple flower fortified cookies had the highest acceptance . The active component in apple flower was further identified as phlorizin by chromatographic analysis . Our results highlighted the health benefits of consuming apple flower fortified foods which might possibly be developed into functional foods especially for diabetic patients .

@highlight Apple flower shows strong antiglycative capability in BSA models and cookies.
@highlight Apple flower fortified cookies 2.5 have high customer acceptance.
@highlight The effective component in apple flower is identified as phlorizin.
@highlight RCS trapping and antioxidant play central role in antiglycation.
