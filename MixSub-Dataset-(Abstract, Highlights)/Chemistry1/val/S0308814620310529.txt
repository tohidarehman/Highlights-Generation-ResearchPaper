 Monitoring neonicotinoid residues in grains is of significant interest for the proper assessment of pesticide exposure to human . The quick easy cheap effective rugged and safe extraction method combined with dispersive liquid liquid micro extraction was developed for extracting purifying and concentrating seven common neonicotinoid pesticides from the grains . Water and acetonitrile were used in tandem as extractants in QuEChERS while water acetonitrile and trichloromethane in DLLME acted as the external phase dispersant and extractant respectively . Comprehensive consideration of the single factor test and response surface method to optimize parameters including type and volume of extractants and dispersant . The evaluation showed that the QuEChERS DLLME method held excellent linearity
