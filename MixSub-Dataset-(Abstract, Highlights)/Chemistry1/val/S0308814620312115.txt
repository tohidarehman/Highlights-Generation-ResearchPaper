 Atomic force microscopy was applied to characterize the self assembling behaviors of zein molecules in 70 aqueous ethanol solution under different parameters including zein concentration pH and the thermal treatment . Zein at pH 7.0 formed globules while zein assemblies exhibited the co existence of worm like strings bundles of fibers and rod like fibers . Heating the aqueous ethanol solutions containing 0.001 zein at 90C and pH 4.0 converted the irregular aggregates into regular spherical particles followed by fibrils at a prolonged times . Besides fibrils were formed after heating aqueous ethanol solutions containing zein at pH 2.0 for 8h . A two step mechanism was proposed to explain such findings which involved the aggregation of zein molecules to form aggregates and followed by the rearrangement of zein molecules to form fibrils .

@highlight Environmental parameters affected the self assembling behaviors of zein molecules.
@highlight Zein self assembled into spherical spheres worm like strings and ordered fibrils.
@highlight A heating induced bottom up approach was established to create zein fibrils.
@highlight A two step mechanism was used to explain various morphologies of zein assemblies.
