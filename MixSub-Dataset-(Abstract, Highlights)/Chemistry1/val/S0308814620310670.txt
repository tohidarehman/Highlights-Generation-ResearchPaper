 The incidence of endocrine disruptors both possible and demonstrated was estimated in baby food commodities . Ion chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry analysis of the 105 samples did not show traces of glyphosate glufosinate or their metabolites while in 10.5 of the samples a quantifiable amount of perchlorate was found . Some samples based on fruit and vegetables revealed a substantial amount of chlorate especially the preparations that contained carrots and potatoes five samples were in a concentration range of 40120gkg

@highlight 105 baby food of different typology were analysed for polar pesticides by IC HRMS.
@highlight Glyphosate glufosinate and their metabolites were not detected in baby food.
@highlight Sporadic presence of perchlorate was revealed always under MRL.
@highlight Some fruit vegetables preparation contained potentially problematic chlorate amount.
@highlight Chlorate content verified in some baby food exceeding the actual MRL.
