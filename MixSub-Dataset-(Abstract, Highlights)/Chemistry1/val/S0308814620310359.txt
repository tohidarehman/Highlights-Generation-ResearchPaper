 is an edible mushroom with pharmacological potential due to its metabolites mainly polysaccharides . On here the development of a new methodology for the recovery of extract rich in antioxidant polysaccharide was reported . The extracts were characterized evaluated for antioxidant activity

@highlight A new methodology was developed for the recovery of extract rich in antioxidant polysaccharide.
@highlight Box Behnken design allowed the prediction of optimal conditions in H
@highlight O CO
@highlight  SFE.
@highlight Temperature and pressure influence the obtainment of polysaccharide extract with H
@highlight O CO
@highlight  SFE.
@highlight Anomeric bonds identified in the FTIR and NMR spectrum indicate that the extract is rich in polysaccharides.
@highlight The extract obtained with H
@highlight O CO
@highlight  SFE showed high antioxidant activity
@highlight and in a cell model.
