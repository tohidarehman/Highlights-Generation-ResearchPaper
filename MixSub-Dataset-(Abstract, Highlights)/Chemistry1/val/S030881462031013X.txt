 The research developed a diazo coupling carbon dots method for determining nitrite and optimized variables of sodium sulfanilate CDs synthesis characteristic wavelength reaction time and temperature . The method can assay 0.0252.0mg L NO

@highlight Optimized the carbon dot synthesis in ordinary pressure hydrothermal method.
@highlight Carbon dots were used successfully as a diazonium coupling reagent.
@highlight Carbon dots were used successfully for colorimetric assay of trace level nitrite.
@highlight Researched nitrite content changes in some Chinese home cooking with the method.
@highlight Staying fresher in fried vegetables with or without pork are 72h 4C or 24h room temperature .
