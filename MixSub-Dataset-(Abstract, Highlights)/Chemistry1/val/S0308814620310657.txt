 Effects of high hydrostatic pressure pretreatment on water mobility and distribution drying duration microstructure color cell wall fraction and tissue structure of strawberry slices were investigated . HHP significantly increased water mobility of the strawberry slices resulting in the reduction of drying duration by 924 . As the pretreatment pressure was increased redness value and anthocyanin content continuously increased soluble pectin content increased and then decreased while the contents of protopectin and cellulose decreased . After the HHP pretreatment chromoplasts and moisture was distributed more uniformly in the strawberry slices . Microscopy images showed the formation of microscopic holes or channels in the matrix and the breakdown of tissue structure by HHP . Results suggested HHP pretreatment disrupted the integrity of the fresh strawberry which enhanced the drying efficiency and migration of the chromoplasts during the vacuum freeze drying process .

@highlight High hydrostatic pressure HHP improved the quality of vacuum freeze dried strawberry slices.
@highlight HHP pretreatment increased the anthocyanins content and redness of strawberry slices center.
@highlight HHP pretreatment induced microstructure alteration and enhanced water mobility.
@highlight HHP pretreatment damaged the cell structures and improved chromoplasts distribution.
