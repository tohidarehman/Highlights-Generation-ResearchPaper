 This report describes the development of a methodology based on micellar electrokinetic chromatography for the separation of alcohols on chip based systems aiming the determination of alcoholic content in whiskey samples . The separation conditions were optimized the best results were achieved using 50 mmolL

@highlight Micellar electrokinetic chromatography MEKC was successfully performed on glass microchips.
@highlight A mixture of ethanol butanol and pentanol was separated within 3min with good analytical performance.
@highlight The alcoholic content was determined in seized whiskey samples and compared to the original samples.
@highlight The achieved data did not reveal statistical difference from those obtained by a reference technique.
@highlight MEKC on microchips emerges as promising analytical tool for on site forensic investigations.
