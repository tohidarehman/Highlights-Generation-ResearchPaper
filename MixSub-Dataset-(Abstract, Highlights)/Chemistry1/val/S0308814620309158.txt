 Compared with dried noodles fresh wet noodles have unique flavor and texture characteristics . However they have a short shelf life due to their high moisture content . We developed an innovative technique applying cold plasma which allows the quick removal of some of the moisture to improve their shelf life . We investigated the effect of cold plasma treatment on the extent of moisture molecule migration and on quality changes in FWNs . A rapid moisture molecule migration occurred due to the synergism between the structure driving force and drying driving force caused by cold plasma . The color of FWNs became whiter and the texture became harder upon plasma treatment . Scanning electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry showed that the structural stability of FWNs increased . Moreover cold plasma treatment had no effect on the secondary structure types of FWNs while the helix and sheet converted to turn and random coil .

@highlight We propose a new dehydration approach to fresh wet noodles by cold plasma.
@highlight Cold plasma induced a tighter structure and a lower surface water content in noodles.
@highlight The cold plasma technology can be a promising dehydration applied in food industry.
