 Glycation between target proteins and saccharides is time consuming or requires high temperatures . Here a promising reaction medium natural deep eutectic solvents for glucose glycation with bovine serum albumin was applied to improve the grafting of glucose glycated BSA by shifting reaction equilibrium . Two types of glucose glycated BSA products were prepared using NADES and water systems . SDS PAGE and MALDI TOF MS revealed that BSA and glucose were covalently bonded . Compared with in water system glycated BSA products in NADES system had more OH groups more disordered secondary structures lower intrinsic fluorescence intensity and higher ultravioletvisible absorption . Lower surface hydrophobicity 1100

@highlight Natural deep eutectic solvents NADES can serve as promising medium for bovine serum albumin BSA glycation.
@highlight NADES improves the grafting of glycated BSA by shifting reaction equilibrium.
@highlight NADES endows BSA with greater glycation extents and property changes.
