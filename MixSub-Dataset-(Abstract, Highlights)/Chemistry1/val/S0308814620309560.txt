 In this study a high throughput strategy combined with MALDI TOF TOF MS and Discovery Studio 2017 was developed to screen peptides with certain functions from hydrolysate . Two dominant peptides Ile Cys Arg Asp and Leu Cys Gly Glu Cys were predicted to have antioxidant activity by Discovery Studio 2017 . Then the activity

@highlight Two antioxidant peptides ICRD and LCGEC were screened and identified from tuna roe.
@highlight ICRD and LCGEC regulated Keap1 Nrf2 ARE pathway transcription in cell and mice.
@highlight LCGEC regulated gut microbiota structure and metabolism in mice.
