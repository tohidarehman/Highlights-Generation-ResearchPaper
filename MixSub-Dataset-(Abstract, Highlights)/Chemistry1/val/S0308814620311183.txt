 The objective of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of different 1 MCP treatment patterns on alleviating chilling injury of postharvest nectarine stored at 01C . Nectarine fruits were subjected to the following treatments Single High dose 1 MCP treatment 1L L

@highlight Different of 1 MCP treatment patterns all alleviated chilling injury of nectarine.
@highlight Multiple 1 MCP treatment maintained higher firmness than single 1 MCP treatment.
@highlight Different of 1 MCP treatment patterns enhanced antioxidant ability of nectarine.
@highlight Different of 1 MCP treatment patterns regulated the energy state of nectarine.
@highlight Multi 1 MCP alleviated chilling injury more effective than conventional single 1 MCP.
