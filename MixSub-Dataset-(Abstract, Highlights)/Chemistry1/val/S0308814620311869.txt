 Enzymes currently used in cheesemaking have various drawbacks and there is a continual need to find new coagulants . This study describes the extraction and biochemical characterization of two proteases from the red alga

@highlight Two proteases from the alga
@highlight were isolated and characterized.
@highlight The extract showed good caseinolytic and milk clotting activities.
@highlight The proteases were confirmed to be a serine and metalloprotease with MW of 44 and 108kDa.
@highlight They cleave
@highlight None
@highlight  casein at four main sites one of which being the same as calf rennet.
@highlight The proteases have good potential for application in cheesemaking.
