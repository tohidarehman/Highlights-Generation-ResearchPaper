 The compounds that the wood releases to the wine and the oxygen transmission rate of the barrel define the final wine . The new possibility of choosing the OTR of the barrel allows the winemaker to globally control the ageing process . The aim of this work was to study the volatile composition of woods classified according to their OTR which are used to build barrels for wine ageing . The results showed that volatile composition differs depending on wood OTR and the temperature reached during toasting . On the toasted side of the stave in contact with the wine low OTR wood had a statistically higher content in furan compounds acetovanillone and phenolic aldehydes while 4 ethylguaiacol and

@highlight Low OTR staves showed higher content in phenolic aldehydes and furanic compounds.
@highlight High OTR staves had higher content in some volatile phenols aldehydes and lactones.
@highlight Red wines aged for three months in high OTR and low OTR barrels were different.
