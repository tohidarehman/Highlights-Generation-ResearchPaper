 In view of the high polarity and ubiquitous occurrence of perchlorate achieving an ultra trace analysis has become a challenging task . The present study aimed to develop a simple and generic pretreatment protocol based on cold induced liquidliquid extraction to efficiently extract perchlorate from tea and dairy products and remarkably decrease potential matrix interferences and laborious cleanup . By optimizing the pretreatment conditions the enrichment factor of perchlorate increased by 7.79 times under the compromise between the matrix effect and extraction recovery . The validated method presented satisfactory selectivity linearity accuracy precision and matrix effect providing recoveries of 78.2 106.2 with RSD

@highlight Highly efficient and cost effective analytical method of perchlorate was developed.
@highlight The superior selectivity and sensitivity was achieved by LC HRMS analysis.
@highlight The enrichment factor of perchlorate increased by 7.79 times by one step CI LLE.
@highlight The high speed centrifugation method was used to avoid background interference.
@highlight The method was validated and applied in a total of 178 tea and dairy products.
