 Acorn flour was used as a gluten free ingredient to produce acorn muffins . Interaction effects between xanthan carboxymethyl cellulose and carrageenan on the height and textural parameters of the formulated acorn flour muffins were investigated using a mixture design approach . Each studied parameter was optimized individually . Then an optimal formulation giving a product with characteristics as close as possible to those of a wheat flour muffin sample was determined . Results revealed that addition of each hydrocolloid separately or their ternary combination improved the muffin height . Optimal height value was predicted to reach 3.96cm when using 26.8 X 50.5 CMC and 22.7 C. As regard to textural parameters presence of the three hydrocolloids had an antagonistic effect . The best hydrocolloids mixture giving optimal height firmness and adhesiveness was that containing 20.5 X and 79.5 CMC .
