 In this study the melanin in persimmon and its formation were investigated . Melanin was found to be deposited on the cell walls of the upper epidermis and subepidermal cells in persimmon skin and the isolated pigment appears to have lamellar structures . Diagnostic analysis of the isolated pigment showed results that were similar to those of melanin from other sources . Ultravioletvisible spectroscopy revealed that the extracted skin pigment displayed a broadband structureless absorption profile that increased progressively towards shorter wavelengths . The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy assay revealed that melanin in persimmon skin exhibits many characteristic absorption peaks . The phenolic profile analysis suggested that the precursors of this pigment may include gallic acid procyanidin B1 procyanidin B2 ferulic acid and epigallocatechin gallate . The PPO activity and

@highlight The black pigment in Heishi persimmon fruit skin was a kind of melanin.
@highlight This melanin deposits on the cell walls of the upper epidermis and subepidermal cells.
@highlight Transient overexpression of
