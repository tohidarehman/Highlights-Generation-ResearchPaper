 Rabbit is a healthy meat with low allergenicity and excellent nutritional properties . The global popularity of rabbit meat makes it a target for food fraud . We present a LC QTOF MS MS approach for detecting and identifying rabbit specific peptide markers from thermally processed meat products to differentiate rabbit from other commonly consumed animal species . We identified 49 heat stable specific peptides . We selected the most stable markers for testing complex meat matrices by analysing pts type products with a rabbit meat content ranging from 5 to 85 . Of the 49 heat stable peptides detected in pure cooked rabbit meat three were consistently detected in all investigated pt samples i.e . SSVFVADPK AFFGHYLYEVAR and PHSHPALTPEQK . Monitoring meat species other than rabbit in the examined pts using pork lamb and chicken specific peptides identified the presence of undeclared chicken in two samples . The results confirm that LC QTOF MS MS is a suitable tool for multi species detection in processed meat products particularly for authentication purposes .

@highlight LC QTOF MS MS identification of species specific peptides was carried out.
@highlight Heat stable peptide markers specific to rabbit were detected and identified.
@highlight 49 markers originating from 23 myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins are reported.
@highlight 11 pt type products were tested for their compliance with labelling.
