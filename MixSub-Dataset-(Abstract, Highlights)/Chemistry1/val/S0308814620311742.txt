 Growing interest in the health benefits of soy isoflavones has led to research in the isolation of individual isoflavone species for further application . Herein we develop a new strategy to isolate daidzein genistein daidzin and genistin in soybean . We investigated the impact of solvents used and the extraction time on the extracted isoflavone contents from soybean . A 30 min extraction with 65 aqueous methanol gave a total isoflavone yield of 345mg 100g soybean the highest value among tested conditions . Further we proposed a two stage adsorption desorption chromatography comprising macroporous resin and aluminium oxide to isolate isoflavone . First HP 20 resin was used to separate the glucosidic and aglyconic forms of isoflavone then individual species of isoflavone could be isolated using aluminium oxide by specific retention of 5 hydroxy isoflavone . This process achieved overall high recovery and purity of the four isoflavones which confirms a high separating efficiency for isoflavones from soybean .

@highlight The 65 aqueous methanol is the most suitable solvent for isoflavone extraction from soybean.
@highlight Isoflavone extract could be separated into glucosides and aglycones by HP20 resins.
@highlight Individual isoflavone was further isolated by aluminum oxide chromatography.
@highlight Four individual isoflavone products with high purities and an overall remarkable recovery were prepared.
