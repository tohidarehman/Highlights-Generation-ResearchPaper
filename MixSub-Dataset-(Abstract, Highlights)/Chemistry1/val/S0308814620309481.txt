 Principal component analysis and partial least squares regression were applied to investigate the effect of glutathione enriched inactive dry yeast on the amino acids and volatile components of kiwi wine . Results indicated that the addition of g IDY had positive effect on most amino acids of kiwi wine especially glutamine and glycine . In case of pure juice fermentation the concentrations of ethyl decanoate 2 methylbutyric acid trans 2 nonenal and hexyl butyrate had notably positive correlation with the addition of g IDY . PLS regression indicated that the amino acids were highly interrelated to the volatile compositions and glycine had the strongest positive impact on the concentrations of esters and total volatile components . This might explain the similar effect of g IDY on the amino acids and volatile components of kiwi wine . Besides PLS regression showed that E nose was a good method to predict volatile compositions of kiwi wine especially esters .

@highlight Glutathione enriched inactive dry yeast g IDY improved the amino acid of kiwi wine.
@highlight Addition of g IDY modified the profile of volatile components of kiwi wine.
@highlight Amino acids in kiwi wine can reflect the volatile compositions of kiwi wine.
@highlight E nose had good ability to predict the concentration of esters.
@highlight Application of g IDY had better effect on kiwi wine fermented without pomace.
