 The objective of this study was to analyze existing taro mucilage extraction techniques for extraction of a pure product with high emulsifying action to chemically characterize the mucilage . Five taro mucilage extraction techniques were analyzed which used room temperature 4C or 80C with or without ethanol precipitation . Protein was detected in the mucilage extracted by each method and is ideal for the emulsifying action . Only mucilage extracted at low temperature and precipitated with ethanol did not contain starch which is considered an impurity in the product . Therefore from the tested techniques cold extraction was found to provide mucilage with good emulsion activity and stability making it possible to be used as a natural emulsifier . This mucilage is primarily formed by arabinogalactans connected to proteins which form AGP glycoprotein a macro molecule responsible for the emulsifying action .

@highlight Five different ways to extract taro mucilage TM were investigated.
@highlight The different forms of extraction change the chemical and physical structure of TM.
@highlight The cold extracted mucilage is considered as purified due to the absence of starch.
@highlight The cold extracted TM contains high emulsifying action.
