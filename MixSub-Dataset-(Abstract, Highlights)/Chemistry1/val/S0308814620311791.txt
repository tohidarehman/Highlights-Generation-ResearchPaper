 Fermentation may enhance the nutritional properties of foods by increasing metabolite bioactivity or bioavailability . This study explored the effect of fermentation on isoflavone bioavailability and metabolism . Isoflavone metabolites were tracked in foods and biospecimens of healthy adults after fermented soybean or non fermented soybean consumption in a randomized controlled crossover intervention study . The change in soybean isoflavones caused by fermentation resulted in faster absorption and higher bioavailability after consumption of FS . Although the urinary level of total isoflavone metabolites was similar after the consumption of the two diets urinary genistein 7 O sulfate was derived as a discriminant metabolite for the FS diet by partial least squares discriminant analysis . This study suggests that an isoflavone conjugate profile might be a more appropriate marker than total isoflavone levels for discriminating between the consumption of FS and NFS diets .

@highlight Fermentation changed soybean isoflavones enhancing absorption and bioavailability.
@highlight Total isoflavone levels were similar in 24h urine samples after FS or NFS diet.
@highlight Urinary genistein 7 O sulfate level may discriminate between FS and NFS diets.
@highlight Isoflavone conjugate profiles might be a potential marker for FS diet.
