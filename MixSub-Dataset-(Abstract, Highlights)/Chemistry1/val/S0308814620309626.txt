 Pyridines are produced during food processing and are important flavor compounds . In spite of that their formation pathways are still poorly understood in particular those related to 3 hydroxypyridines . In an attempt to fill this gap this study describes for the first time precursors and reaction pathways leading to 3 hydroxypyridine formation . 3 Hydroxypyridines are produced by reaction of lipid derived reactive carbonyls and ammonia producing compounds and were studied by using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry . Their main precursors resulted to be 4 5 epoxy 2 alkenals and 2 4 alkadienals . 3 Hydroxypyridines were produced at temperatures higher than 100C at slightly basic pH values and with an activation energy of about 50kJ mol . A reaction pathway that explains their formation in the course of the lipid oxidation pathway is proposed . The role of lipid oxidation on the production of 3 hydroxypyridines was confirmed by studying their formation in oxidized linseed and menhaden oils heated in the presence of glutamine .
