 This study examined the effect of green tea extract at 10 and 50 g L as the steeping solution on the chemical nutritional and microbial quality of wheat grain during 14days of germination . Fat dry matter and ash contents in the control was higher than GWG treatments due to the faster growth of control germs . Moisture phenolic compounds thiamin niacin and tocopherols decreased whereas fat dry matter carbohydrate protein crude fiber ash folic acid Ca Mg Fe Mn and Zn increased significantly in all samples during germination . GWG5 showed the highest values in total phenols vitamins minerals and carbohydrate followed by GWG1 and then the control . No significant differences in protein and crude fiber content were detected among treatments . GWG decreased the growth of total bacterial yeast and mold in germinated seeds . Overall GWG improved the microbial and nutritional quality of wheat germ during 14days of germination .

@highlight Green tea extract GWG as the irrigation source delayed the seed germination.

@highlight contents were higher in GWG germs than control.
@highlight Higher mineral and tocopherol contents were obtained using GWG instead of water.
@highlight GWG decreased the microbial count on wheat germ.
