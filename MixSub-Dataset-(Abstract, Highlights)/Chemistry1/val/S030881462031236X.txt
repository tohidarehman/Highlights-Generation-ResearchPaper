 Effects of a novel slit divergent ultrasound treatment on soybean protein isolate lentinan conjugates via Maillard reaction was investigated . Besides the stability of emulsions prepared by SPI and SPI lentinan conjugates as emulsifiers was compared . The results showed that ultrasonic treatment markedly increased the degree of grafting by 1.91 times comparing with traditional heating method . In addition structural analysis showed that the conjugates obtained by SDU treatment changed the secondary structure and had higher surface hydrophobicity and fluorescence intensity than those obtained by traditional heating method . Apart from this SDU treatment could significantly improve the functional properties of conjugates . Furthermore the emulsions prepared by the SPI lentinan conjugates as emulsifiers possessed the highest stability against environmental stresses . Taken together SDU assisted heating could be an excellent method to improve the functional properties of conjugates .

@highlight Slit divergent ultrasound enhanced the glycation reaction between SPI and lentinan.
@highlight Ultrasound assisted Maillard reaction could enhance the utilization of SPI.
@highlight The secondary structure of conjugates was changed by ultrasound treatment.
@highlight Emulsion prepared by SPI lentinan conjugates had better physical stability.
