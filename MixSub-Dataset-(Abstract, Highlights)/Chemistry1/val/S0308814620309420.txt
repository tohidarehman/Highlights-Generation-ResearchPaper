 A hydrazone based Schiff base has been synthesized and investigated for the detection quantification and degradation of selective organophosphates phosphate and dichlorvos . The organophosphates form a covalent bond with OH groups of SB and form SB OP which quenches emission signal at 533nm . Therefore it can be used for the spectrofluorimetric detection and quantification of OPs upto the detection limits of 10.2 158.2 10.3 and 122.7nM respectively . Besides the SB OP duo undergoes degradation to non toxic species in the presence of Zn
