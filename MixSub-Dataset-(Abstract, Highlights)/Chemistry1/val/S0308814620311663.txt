 Synthetic amorphous silica is widely added to commercial foods as an anticaking agent . Concern about the potential application of nanosized silica in foods has increased as nanomaterials are not intended for use as food additives . This study evaluated the particle size distributions and biological responses of food additive SAS . An accurate sensitive and cost effective analytical method for probing SAS was established and quantitative analysis of its presence in commercial foods was performed . The results demonstrate that food additive SAS is an aggregated material composed of nanosized particles with nanosized aggregates of silica particles identified in commercial foods . Food additive SAS did not exhibit acute cytotoxicity compared to both general grade nano and bulk silica . Moreover intestinal transport amounts of food additive SAS were significantly lower than for G nano . Taken together we find that food additive SAS does not exhibit acute toxicity resulting from nanosized materials .
