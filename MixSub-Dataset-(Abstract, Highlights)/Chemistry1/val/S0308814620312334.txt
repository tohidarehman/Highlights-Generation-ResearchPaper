 A simple and sensitive salting out assisted dispersive liquid liquid microextraction method using deep eutectic solvent combined with back extraction and micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography was developed for the determination of fluoroquinolones in milk honey and water samples . Several parameters affecting the extraction efficiency including DES volume vortex time centrifugation time salt type and amount sample pH and volume etc . were investigated . Good linearity were obtained for fluoroquinolones in a range of 0.0203.200gmL

@highlight The SO DLLME combined with MECC was developed for determination of fluoroquinolones.
@highlight Deep eutectic solvent DES was used as an extraction solvent combined with back extraction.
@highlight A detection limit less than 10ngmL
@highlight for fluoroquinolones could be achieved.
@highlight The method was successfully applied to determination of fluoroquinolones in food and water samples.
