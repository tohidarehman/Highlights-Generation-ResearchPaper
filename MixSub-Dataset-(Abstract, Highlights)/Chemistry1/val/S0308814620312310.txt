 To make better use of chicken liver a byproduct of meat processing with rich proteins the influence of ultrasound pretreatment on the extent of Maillard reaction and the properties of MR products of chicken liver protein and its hydrolysate were investigated . The extent of MR of sonicated CLPH was significantly higher than that of the other two MRPs . The decreased fluorescence intensity of the SCLPHMs indicated adequate reaction of

@highlight Ultrasound pretreatment UP in substrates improved the degree of Maillard reaction.
@highlight The volatile matters of MRPs by UP were richer than those by untreatment.
@highlight Furfural was the main heterocyclic compounds with 668.51mg mL in MRPs with UP.
@highlight UP and Maillard reaction provided a basic of high value application in chicken liver.
