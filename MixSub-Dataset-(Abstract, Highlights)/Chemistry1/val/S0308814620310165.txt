 Dextran containing sourdough has been exploited in breadmaking obtaining additive free bread of high quality . Effect of dextran weak acidification and their association on gluten dough structure thermal properties and rheology was investigated . Electrophoresis showed that dextran and acids both lowered the band intensity in the high molecular weight area

@highlight Dextran and acids intervened in the formation of disulfide bonded glutenin polymers.
@highlight Acidification weakened structural thermal and rheological properties of gluten dough.
@highlight Dextran improved gluten dough characteristics based on weak acidification.
