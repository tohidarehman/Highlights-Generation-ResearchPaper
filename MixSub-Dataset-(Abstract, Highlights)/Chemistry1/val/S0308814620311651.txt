 phenylethylamine and tryptamine are biogenic amines often found in foods . In general BA are assumed to be toxic and their accumulation in food is not recommended . However present knowledge regarding the toxicity of phenylethylamine and tryptamine is limited more information is needed if qualitative and quantitative risk assessments of foods are to be successfully conducted . This study describes a real time analysis of phenylethylamine and tryptamine toxicity on a human intestinal epithelial cell line . Both BA caused cell necrosis and apoptosis although the former was the main mode of action of phenylethylamine and the latter the main mode of action of tryptamine . Only tryptamine was cytotoxic at concentrations found in BA rich foods . The results presented in this work may contribute to establish legal limits for phenylethylamine and tryptamine in food .

@highlight The
@highlight cytotoxicity of phenylethylamine and tryptamine was determined.
@highlight The cytotoxic threshold for tryptamine was 3.7 times lower that of phenylethylamine.
@highlight  Phenylethylamine and tryptamine caused intestinal cell necrosis and apoptosis.
@highlight  Phenylethylamine was not cytotoxic at the concentrations found in food so far.
@highlight Tryptamine was cytotoxic at food concentrations.
