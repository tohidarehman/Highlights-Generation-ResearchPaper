 This study was aimed to produce bioactive peptides from optimally fermented tempe and map their overall bioactivities . There were three preparative methods utilized for producing tempe based peptides such as water facilitated extraction alcalase and papain hydrolysis and in combination with membrane filtration . Fermenting soybean at 144h was selected as the optimum time based on protein content and degree of hydrolysis . Through SDS PAGE analysis an increased degree of hydrolysis with longer fermentation time was confirmed . The best preparative method for producing bioactive peptides was through papain hydrolysis and followed by 5kDa membrane filtration . By this the enhancement was distinct for antioxidant activity ACE glucosidase and Kunitz trypsin inhibitory activity . The annotated peptide sequences resulting from Nano LC Ultimate 3000 Series System tandem Q Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer were matched with the BIOPEP database . The major bioactivities of tempe peptides obtained were as an ACE inhibitor antioxidant and antithrombotic .

@highlight Bioactivities of tempe peptides were assayed.
@highlight Papain was found as the best biocatalyst for hydrolysate preparation.
@highlight UF PES membrane with 5kDa MWCO was the best membrane for fractionation.
@highlight Overall map of tempe based bioactivities was obtained.
@highlight Major bioactivities were as ACE inhibitor antioxidant and antithrombotic.
