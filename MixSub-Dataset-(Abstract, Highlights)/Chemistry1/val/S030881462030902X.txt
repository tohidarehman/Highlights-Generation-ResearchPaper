 Wine ageing in barrels is conditioned among other factors by the amount of oxygen received during this process which thus impacts its final properties . The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of oxygen on wine colour during ageing in barrels and bottles during different times . The use of barrels with different and known rates of oxygenation allows the effect of different oxygenation conditions throughout the process in barrels and its later evolution in bottles . A simulation process of ageing in bottles was used to study the impact of bottling in wines after differing ageing periods in barrels . The study of wins oxygen consumption capacity has been tied to colour modifications during ageing in barrels and bottles . Wines aged in barrels with a high oxygenation rate showed greater avidity to consume oxygen taking less time to consume that available which is reflected in a greater increase in colour intensity .

@highlight The variation in the rate of oxygenation during ageing produces different wines.
@highlight Wines aged with high oxygenation rate showed greater avidity to consume oxygen.
@highlight Wine colour increase after air saturation is greater with barrel ageing time.
@highlight Air saturated wine stored for 35days at 12C reproduces 4months of bottle ageing.
