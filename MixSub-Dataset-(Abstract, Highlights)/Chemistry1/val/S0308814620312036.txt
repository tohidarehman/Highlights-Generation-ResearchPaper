 The aim of the present study was to evaluate the phenolic composition of crude lyophilized extracts and partially purified extracts of

@highlight Ternatins B2 B3 B4 and D2 were identified in
@highlight aqueous extracts.
@highlight Epigallocatechin 3 gallate was identified by for the first time.
@highlight Anthocyanins presented structural reversibility in relation to pH changes.
@highlight Aqueous extracts at pH 3.6 and 5.4 exhibited thermal stability.
@highlight Fructooligosaccharides added to the extracts provided a protective effect on the stability.
