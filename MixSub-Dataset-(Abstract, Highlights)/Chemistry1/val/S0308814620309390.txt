 Compositional analyses of eggs have primarily focused on nutritional components including large molecules such as proteins . However few reports have investigated the effects of heating and hen feed crops on taste components such as free amino acids and sugars . Herein water soluble metabolites in raw and boiled eggs produced from chickens raised with corn or rice fed were analyzed . Each egg was separated into yolk and white and freeze dried samples were analyzed by CE MS and LC MS. Abundant metabolites included amino acids in yolks and sugars in whites . Compared to corn fed rice fed resulted in three times higher betaine and uridine monophosphate concentrations in yolks and whites respectively . Boiled whites contained more than four times higher concentrations of amino acids and fructose than raw whites . Metabolites in yolks exhibited minimal changes after boiling . Our findings support the use of water soluble metabolomics to evaluate the effects of heating and feed crops on taste components .

@highlight Chicken egg components were evaluated by metabolome analysis without hydrolysis.
@highlight Unlike conventional nutritional analysis metabolite heat effects were elucidated.
@highlight In egg white amino acids and fructose concentrations were increased by boiling.
@highlight In egg yolk boiling effects on water soluble components were less than egg white.
@highlight By changing from corn to rice fed betaine and UMP concentrations were increased.
