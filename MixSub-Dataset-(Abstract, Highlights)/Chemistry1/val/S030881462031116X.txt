 This work studied the quantitation of myofibrillar protein isolated from giant squid by three methods . The results were examined in relation to compositional size exclusion chromatography static light scattering zeta potential and thermal analysis comparisons between the apparent

@highlight Nano protein particle NPP in myofibrillar protein solutions was uncovered.
@highlight The diameter of NPP ranged from several tens nm to 140nm with a height of 23nm.
@highlight Surface characterization indicated that NPP was heterogeneous.
@highlight 90 protein molecules were aggregated to form NPP in myofibrillar protein solutions.
