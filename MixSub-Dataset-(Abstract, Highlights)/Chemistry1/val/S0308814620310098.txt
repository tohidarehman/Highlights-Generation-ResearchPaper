 The reduction of the 3 monochloropropane 1 2 diol esters and glycidyl esters was successfully achieved by the optimization of four processing parameters phosphoric acid dosage degumming temperature bleaching earth dosage and deodorization temperature by response surface methodology without the need for additional processing steps . The optimized processing conditions were 0.31 phosphoric acid dosage 50C degumming temperature 3 bleaching earth dosage and 240C deodorization temperature . The optimization resulted in more than 80 and 65 reduction of 3 MCPDE and GE levels respectively with color and FFA contents maintained in the acceptable range specified by Palm Oil Refiners Association of Malaysia . The optimized refining condition was transferred to macro scale refining units of 1kg and 3kg capacities to investigate its successful application during scale up process .

@highlight RSM was used to optimize the physical refining process of palm oil.
@highlight Bound MCPD and glycidol was successfully reduced with acceptable oil quality.
@highlight Interactions and effects of physical processing parameters were evaluated.
@highlight Successful application of optimized refining conditions at macro refinery.
