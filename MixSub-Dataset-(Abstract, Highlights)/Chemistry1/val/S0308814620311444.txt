 Phenolics are important secondary metabolites in plants with strong antioxidant effects . Seeds germination and exogenous stimulation could activate endogenous enzymes to enhance the content of phenolic acids and flavonoids . Barley seeds geminated under NaCl treatment to evaluate the accumulation of phenolics in this study . Results showed that NaCl treatment significantly enhanced the growth of seedlings especially bud length . NaCl treatment up regulated genes and proteins expression of phenylalanine ammonia lyase cinnamate 4 hydroxylase and 4 coumarate CoA ligase resulting in the enhancement of their activities . As a result phenolic acids and flavonoids contents increased by 11.19 and 32.54 respectively in which gallic acid protocatechuic fisetin myricetin and quercetin were affected mostly . Moreover NaCl treatment enhanced 2 2 azino bis and 1 1 diphenyl 2 picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging capacity . Hence NaCl stimulated the synthesis of phenolic components via enhancing gene protein expression and the activity of key enzymes .

@highlight Low concentration NaCl promotes growth and nutritional quality of barley seedlings.
@highlight The 10mM NaCl treated barley seedlings exhibited higher antioxidant capacity.
@highlight The 10mM NaCl enhanced the biosynthesis of phenolic acids and flavonoids.
@highlight NaCl stimulated the gene protein expression and enzymes activity level.
