 An ultra high performance liquid chromatography triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry method was established and validated for the simultaneous quantification of eight cyanogenic glucosides in agri food . The eight CNGs were linamarin lotaustralin linustatin neolinustatin taxiphyllin amygdalin dhurrin and prunasin . CNGs were extracted with aqueous methanol and cleaned via solid phase extraction . Analytes were separated with a C
