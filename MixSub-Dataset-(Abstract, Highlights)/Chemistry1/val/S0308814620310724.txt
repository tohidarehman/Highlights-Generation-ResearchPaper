 In this study a novel easy rapid and green zirconium nanoparticles based dispersive solid phase extraction method is presented for the precise and sensitive determination of selenium by slotted quartz tube flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry . Influential parameters of the extraction procedure were optimized by altering one parameter while keeping the other parameters constant . The optimum conditions were selected as 10mg of Zr NPs 75s vortex period and 200L of concentrated HCl for 30mL of sample standard solution . The linear range of the developed method was found to be between 25 and 100g L and the respective limits of detection and quantification were 5.3 and 18g L. About 415 folds enhancement in detection power was achieved by the optimized method relative to the conventional FAAS . Green tea samples were spiked and used for recovery experiments and the results obtained were between 92 and 102 .
