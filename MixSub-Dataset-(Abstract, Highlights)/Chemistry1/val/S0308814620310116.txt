 A novel approach for the discrimination of different glucosinolates using a colorimetric sensor array is reported herein . The developed CSA technique exhibited an acceptable linearity

@highlight A colorimetric sensor array CSA was developed for glucosinolate determination.
@highlight The method is facile and cost effective and exhibited an acceptable linearity.
@highlight Most glucosinolate samples were correctly distinguished according to their type.
@highlight Most different vegetable samples were correctly classified.
@highlight Sensor responses were correlated with the concentrations of glucosinolates.
