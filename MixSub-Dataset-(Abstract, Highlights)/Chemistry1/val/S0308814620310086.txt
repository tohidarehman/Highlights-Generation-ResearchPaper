 A non target screening method of cyclopeptide toxins and their analogues in mushroom was developed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometry followed by mass spectrometry databases retrieval and software tools analysis for the candidate analogues . Three cyclopeptide toxins in the toxic mushroom
