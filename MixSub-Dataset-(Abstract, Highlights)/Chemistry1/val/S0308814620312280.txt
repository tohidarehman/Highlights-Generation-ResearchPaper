 High methyl esterified citrus pectin molecules could be self assembled into micelles in water . The morphology of HMCP micelles in water was irregular spheres long rods and arc shaped . Most of HMCP molecules cross linked with HMCP micelles in the presence of calcium chloride and increased the range of size distribution of HMCP micelles . A little number of HMCP molecules cross linked with each other to form 80 nn 200nm microgel particles . Calcium chloride could improve HMCP emulsification when its concentration was more than 70mmol L. HMCP micelles could be adsorbed on the surface of emulsion droplets . The emulsion prepared with HMCP and calcium chloride was similar to the Pickering emulsion .
