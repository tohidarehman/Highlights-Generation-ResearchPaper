 This work demonstrates the challenges for selenium determination in bean samples using high resolution continuum source Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry and line source Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry . Different chemical modifiers were optimized namely Ir Ru and Pd Mg nitrates . At selenium contents 5ngg

@highlight A 30pgg
@highlight detection limit of Se in beans was achieved by in situ trapping setup.
@highlight At ultraviolet range high resolution continuum source AAS drawbacks were explored.
@highlight Limitation of the HR CS GF AAS at 196.026nm was illustrated.
@highlight Neither HR CS GF AAS nor LS GF AAS is suitable for Se quantification at ng level.
