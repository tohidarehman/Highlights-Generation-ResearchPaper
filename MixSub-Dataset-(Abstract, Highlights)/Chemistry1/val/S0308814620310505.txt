 The effect of dietary protein on the induction of intestinal hormones is recognised . However little is known about the nature of the digestion products involved in this intestinal signalling . Our aim was to characterise egg white protein digestion products and study their ability to induce CCK and GLP 1 release in enteroendocrine STC 1 cells . Intestinal digests triggered GLP 1 release at a higher rate than gastric digests . Peptides but not free amino acids showed a potent GLP 1 secretagogue effect while proteins only had a modest effect . CCK was released in response to peptides and free amino acids but not proteins . Two hydrophobic negatively charged peptides triggered CCK release while the highest GLP 1 response was found with a hydrophobic positively charged peptide pointing to the involvement of different receptors or active sites . Identifying peptide sequences and receptors involved in hormonal secretion could open up new ways to control food intake and glucose metabolism .

@highlight Egg white peptides are identified as main GLP 1 secretagogues.
@highlight CCK is released in response to peptides and free amino acids but not proteins.
@highlight Two hydrophobic negatively charged peptides were found to trigger CCK release.
@highlight The highest GLP 1 response was found with a hydrophobic positively charged peptide.
