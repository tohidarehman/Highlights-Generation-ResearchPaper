 The needing of rapid and sensitive detection method for pesticides is increasing to facilitate its detection without complicated instruments . Herein a novel paper based senor was developed for the visual detection of three carbamate pesticides based on CdTe quantum dots and nano zinc 5 10 15 20 tetra 21

@highlight A direct and effective method for the carbamate pesticides detection was developed.
@highlight The LODs of our methods are comparable with traditional chromatographic techniques.
@highlight Our methods have high sensitivity and selectivity even in complex food matrices.
@highlight Carbamate pesticides detection could be achieved within 5min by paper sensors.
