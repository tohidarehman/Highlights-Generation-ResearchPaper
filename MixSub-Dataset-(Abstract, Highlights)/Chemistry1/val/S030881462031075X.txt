 Chitosan and whey protein isolate conjugate films were prepared as a novel matrix for encapsulating and extending the postharvest shelf life of strawberries . Film forming solutions of chitosan WPI and chitosan WPI conjugate were mixed with glycerol casted for films at 602C and assessed for their colour water vapour and oxygen transfer rate textural functional groups and secondary structure thermal crystallinity and antioxidant properties . Chitosan WPI conjugate films were applied as an edible coating on strawberries and studied for storage stability at 5C and 20C by assessing physical and biochemical parameters . A considerable reduction in colour indices weight loss pH and titratable acidity reducing sugars ascorbic acid total phenolics DPPH and ABTS assay was noted in the coated strawberries over the control at both the studied temperatures . The control strawberries had a shelf life of 5 and 3days whereas coating enhanced the shelf life of strawberries to 8 and 5days when stored at 5C and 20C respectively .

@highlight Chitosan and WPI were conjugated with citric acid to fabricate edible films.
@highlight Films possessed significant barrier textural thermal and antioxidant properties.
@highlight Senescence ripening of strawberries delayed on coating with chitosan WPI conjugate.
@highlight Biological coatings prevented losses of bioactive components during storage.
@highlight Chitosan WPI coating extended the shelf life of strawberries by 40 and 60 at 20 5C.
