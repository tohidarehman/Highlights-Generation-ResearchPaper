 The aim of this study is to simultaneously evaluate anti oxidative and anti inflammatory activities of the hop extracts by different solvents . Hop water extract and hop ethanol extracts were prepared by extracting hop pellets with hot water at 90C and ethanol solutions respectively . Bioactive compound such as acid acid total phenolic and total flavonoid contents were determined . All the HEEs showed higher anti oxidative activities than the HWEs . The HEEs showing the highest anti oxidative activities are different in the experiments with different free radicals . For anti inflammatory activities both the HWE and HEEs decreased NO productions . HWE decreased TNF and IL 6 secretion but showed no effect on IL 1 while HEEs decreased IL 1 and IL 6 secretion but increased TNF secretion . Except for TNF secretion the HEEs showed higher anti inflammatory activities than the HWE . Future work is to explore the possible mechanism to improve the ethanol extraction procedure .

@highlight Bioactive compounds of hop were quickly and simply extracted with aqueous solvents.
@highlight The solvents included hot water as well as 55 75 and 95 ethanol solutions.
@highlight Both anti oxidative and anti inflammatory activities of the extracts were evaluated.
@highlight The hop ethanol extracts HEEs had more polyphenols flavonoids and bitter acids.
@highlight The HEEs showed high anti oxidative and partial anti inflammatory activities.
