 For more effective using of HHP in starch processing in this study molecular dynamics simulation was used to explore the effects of pressure on amylose molecular conformation at the atomic level . The results shown that firstly high pressure decreased the intramolecular hydrogen bonds and increased the amylose solvent hydrogen bonds which is consistent with the process of high pressure starch gelatinization . Secondly high pressure made amylose polymers more stout . Meanwhile high pressure decreased the angle of 1 4 glycosidic linkage and increased the dihedral angles of 1 4 glycosidic linkage which indicates that pressure has obvious effects on amylose molecular conformation . Thirdly high pressure made amylose polymers more stable . Moreover in view of the results of energies HHP may have an opposite gelatinization mechanism to heating . The results may be complementary to the existing experimental phenomena and provide theoretical guidance value for the using of HHP in starch processing .
