 Flours obtained from unripe and ripe inaj palm tree fruit pulp as well as co products that were generated after oil extraction were evaluated for the first time . In addition the oils extracted using ethanol as a solvent were also analyzed . The oils showed similar thermal characteristics such as thermal stability up to about 253C while also presenting a rich composition of phenolic compounds antioxidant capacity and carotenoid content . Concerning the raw flours and their defatted counterparts their free and bound phenolic compounds which comprised gallic acid 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid ferulic acid

@highlight Six phenolic compounds have been identified for the first time in inaj flours.
@highlight Ethanol solvent provided oil samples with high thermal stability.
@highlight 4 Hydroxybenzoic acid is the major bound phenolic in unripe inaj flour.
@highlight Oils and inaj flours are potential sources of natural antioxidants.
