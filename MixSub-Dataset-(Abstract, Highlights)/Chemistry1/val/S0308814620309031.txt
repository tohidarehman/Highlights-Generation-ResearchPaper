 The physicochemical characteristics of honey vary according to bee species climate region period of collection processing and storage . In this context this work aimed to perform a comparative study of the physicochemical characteristics of

@highlight Characterization of honey by the stingless bees produced in the semi arid region of the Brazilian northeast.
@highlight Concentration of carboxylic acids and physic chemistry parameters were used in the evaluation.
@highlight Analysis of principal components and hierarchical cluster analysis was performed.
