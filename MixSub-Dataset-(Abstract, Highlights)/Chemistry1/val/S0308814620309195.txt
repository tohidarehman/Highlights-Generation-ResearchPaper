 Chilling injury restricts the quality and shelf life of bell pepper fruits reducing these CI induced detrimental effects is therefore of high economic and agricultural relevance . Here we investigated the effects of trisodium phosphate salicylic acid and TSP SA treatments on pepper fruits under cold stress at 4C for 25 d. Combined TSP SA treatment performed an optimal effect . Specifically TSP SA treatment enhanced fatty acid desaturation efficiency as indicated by the increased expression of key fatty acid desaturase genes and higher content of unsaturated fatty acids . Meanwhile TSP SA treatment inhibited the CI induced membrane damage manifested as lower electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde content . Furthermore low field nuclear magnetic resonance and proline content also revealed that TSP SA treatment mitigated CI through enhancing water retention in pepper fruits . Collectively our results may shed new light on optimizing the low temperature storage conditions of post harvest peppers .

@highlight Trisodium phosphate TSP salicylic acid SA and TSP SA treatments delayed and alleviated CI symptoms of bell pepper.
@highlight TSP SA TSP SA treatments suppressed LOX activity and MDA content enhanced GSH and AsA content.
@highlight Combined TSP SA treatment was more effective than individual.
@highlight Greater cold tolerance is apparently linked to moisture retention and elevated fatty acid desaturation.
@highlight TSP SA treatment prevented membrane degrading and cytoplasm leakage.
