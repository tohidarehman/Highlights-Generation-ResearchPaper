 The formation of short lived and stable radicals was investigated using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and compared with hydroperoxides and hexanal in complex starch protein lipid model systems as well as in corn extrudates . Stable radicals were detected directly in ground samples . Short lived lipid radicals were measured

@highlight Stable and short lived radicals are formed in starch protein lipid systems.
@highlight PBN adduct hydroperoxide and hexanal formation correlate in model systems.
@highlight Spectra simulation identifies alkoxyl radical adducts as major short lived radicals.
@highlight Extrusion cooking promotes formation of stable protein radicals.
