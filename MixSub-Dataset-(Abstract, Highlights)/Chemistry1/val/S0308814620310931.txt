 A standardised methodology was used to compile and validate a methyl group carrier database including folate choline betaine and methionine for use in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study . Compilation was performed by following structured guidelines to match the EPIC dietary intake data to food items from four food composition databases according to their assigned priority of use . To assess relative validity calculated dietary folate intakes were compared between the MGDB and the EPIC nutrient database used as the reference database . Folate intakes based on the MGDB and those generated using the ENDB showed good agreement and were strongly correlated . This MGDB can be used for investigating potential associations between methyl group carrier intakes and risk or prognosis of cancer and other diseases in the EPIC study population .

@highlight Standardised procedures were developed to compile a methyl group carrier database.
@highlight The EPIC nutrient database was extended with choline betaine and methionine.
@highlight The relative validity of the compiled methyl group carrier database was confirmed.
@highlight The database is available for studying methyl group carriers and cancer.
