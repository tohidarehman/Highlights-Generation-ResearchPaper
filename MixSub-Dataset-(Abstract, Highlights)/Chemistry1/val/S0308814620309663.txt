 The effects of different microwave heating methods on gelation properties of golden threadfin bream myosin and related mechanism were investigated in this study . Compared with conventional heating and one step MH methods myosin gel developed by 100W coupled with 300W MH method had stronger gel strength

@highlight Mild microwave heating increased myosin solubility with suitable conformation.
@highlight 100W coupled with 300W microwave could obviously improve gelation properties.
@highlight Two step microwave heating contributed to a compact three dimensional network.
@highlight Two step microwave heating enhanced protein water hydrogen bonds during gelling.
