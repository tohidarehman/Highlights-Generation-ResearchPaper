 Polyacrylonitrile nanofiber membrane functionalized with trisaminomethane was used in affinity membrane chromatography for lysozyme adsorption . The effects of pH and protein concentration on lysozyme adsorption were investigated . Based on Langmuir model the adsorption capacity of P Tris nanofiber membrane was estimated to be 345.83mg g. For the operation of dynamic membrane chromatography with three layer P Tris nanofiber membranes the optimal operating conditions were at pH 9 1.0mL min of feed flow rate and 2mg mL of feed concentration . Chicken egg white was applied as the crude feedstock of lysozyme in the optimized dynamic membrane chromatography . The percent recovery and purification factor of lysozyme obtained from the chromatography were 93.28 and 103.98 folds respectively . Our findings demonstrated the effectiveness of P Tris affinity nanofiber membrane for the recovery of lysozyme from complex CEW solution .
