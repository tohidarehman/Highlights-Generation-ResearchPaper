 In this work the mechanism of the effect of lipid oxidation on the IgG IgE binding ability of ovalbumin was investigated via the peroxyl radicals produced by 2 2 azobis dihydrochloride to simulate lipid oxidation . Results showed that the structure of OVA unfolded partially with an increase in oxidation degree leading to the exposure of the allergenic epitopes and increasing the IgG IgE binding ability of OVA . Nine oxidation sites were found on the helix and these sites may unwind the helix and expose the allergenic epitopes on the OVA surface leading to antibody recognition and combination . Consequently the IgG IgE binding ability of OVA was increased . In conclusion the allergenic capacity of OVA can be promoted by modifying peroxyl radical oxidation in processing egg products .

@highlight Lipid oxidation could enhance the IgG IgE binding ability of OVA.
@highlight Nine oxidation sites were found on the helix unwinding the helix.
@highlight Lipid oxidation could result the tertiary structure of OVA unfolded partially.
@highlight Above two could enhance abilities of OVA to be recognized and combined.
