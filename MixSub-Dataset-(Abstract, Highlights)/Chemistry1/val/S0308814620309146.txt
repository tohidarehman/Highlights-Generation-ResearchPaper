 Proso millet exhibits favorable agronomic and nutritional properties but is currently under utilized in the northern hemisphere . This study compared processing induced changes in protein characteristics of commercial pasta to fresh gluten free pasta from proso millet varieties differing in prolamin profile . Protein solubility accessible thiols and secondary structures were measured in dough sheeted and cooked pasta . Relationships between protein conformation and characteristics related to pasta quality were determined . Cooking significantly lowered protein solubility and induced exposure of thiol groups as well as a shift in secondary structure distribution while sheeting only had a minor effect . Random structures positively and significantly

@highlight Proso millet pasta displayed differences to commercial gluten free and wheat pasta.
@highlight Cooked millet pasta had low protein solubility and high sheet content.
@highlight Millet protein profile and conformation affected functional properties of the pasta.
@highlight Protein solubility correlated with digestibility and cooking loss of millet pasta.
