 In this work we investigated the interaction of docosahexaenoic acid with lactoglobulin using spectroscopic and crystallographic methods . The fluorescence results showed that DHA formed complexes with Lg with a binding constant of 4.1310

@highlight Particle size of LgDHA complexes was similar to that of Lg alone.
@highlight Formation of complexes did not significantly affect the Lg secondary structure.
@highlight Formation of complexes reduced the turbidity of DHA in aqueous solution.
@highlight Binding sites of LgDHA complexes were revealed by X ray crystallography.
