 Volatile compounds in Chinese jujubes dried by different methods hot air heat pump infrared radiation vacuum vacuum freeze and instant controlled pressure drop drying were analyzed using GCMS MOS e nose and flash GC e nose . Acids comprised more than 90 of the aroma compounds in the dried jujubes of which acetic butanoic propanoic hexanoic octanoic and decanoic acids were the most common . Jujubes dried using VFD had the highest content of total aroma compounds while DIC dried jujubes had the most diverse profile . HPD IRD HAD and VD dried jujubes had similar aroma profiles based on GCMS and flash GC e nose results . Although the results of GCMS MOS e nose and flash GC e nose were significant different

@highlight Acids contributed more than 90 of the total volatile profiles of dried jujubes.
@highlight Freeze drying was most effective in preserving acidic volatile compounds.
@highlight Jujube dried by DIC showed greater diversity in volatile compounds 26 .
@highlight GCMS coupled with an e nose provided comprehensive aroma analysis of dried jujubes.
