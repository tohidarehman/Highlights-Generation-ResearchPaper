 This study investigated inulin and calcium rich milk mineral incorporation into a pork sausage in order to examine the effects on microbiome and biochemical activity in the gastrointestinal tract upon ingestion . Rats were fed one of four sausages a pork sausage enriched with 1 inulin and milk mineral 2 inulin 3 milk mineral or 4 control sausages without enrichment . NMR based metabolomics revealed that inulin enrichment increased the fecal concentration of short chain fatty acids . Milk mineral enrichment also increased SCFA concentrations although less pronounced . In addition milk mineral reduced the concentration of nitroso compounds in feces and small intestinal content . Combined enrichment with both inulin and milk mineral showed no cumulative effect on SCFA formation and seemed to oppose the milk mineral induced reduction of nitroso compound formation . 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing indicated that alterations of the gut microbiome contributed to the observed effects .

@highlight Rats were fed pork sausages enriched with inulin and or calcium rich milk mineral.

@highlight Milk mineral enrichment decreased the bone resorption marker CTX.
@highlight Alterations of the gut microbiome accompanied the observed effects.
