 Production of high quality healthy foods through sustainable methodologies is an urgent necessity . High pressure homogenization is an interesting alternative to obtain premium citrus juices but its effects on bioactive compounds are unclear . There was studied the influence of HPH and pasteurization processing on physicochemical properties and

@highlight Bioaccessibility of carotenoids and phenolics from processed orange juice was studied.
@highlight Pasteurization and sustainable high pressure homogenization HPH were challenged.
@highlight Bioaccessibility of carotenoids and expoxycarotenoids had a 5 fold increasing by HPH.
@highlight Bioaccessibility of phenolics remained unchanged by processing.
@highlight HPH is a sustainable alternative to obtain added value health promoting foods.
