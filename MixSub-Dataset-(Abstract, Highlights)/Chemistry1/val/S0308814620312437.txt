 In this work three different polyether modified siloxanes were applied to stabilize water in oil emulsions and sodium caseinate was used to establish water in oil in water emulsions . Here PMS polymers were modified by Isolan GPS and SC by Tween 80 . The impact of modifications on the physical stability and controlled release of W O W emulsions were investigated . It was found that the storage stability and control release of double emulsions were dependent on the types of PMS used percent of Isolan GPS and Tween 80 . When PMS1 and PMS2 were combined with low percent of Isolan GPS and Tween 80 the dispersed droplet sizes were reduced lower percent in the gravitational sedimentation were achieved than using PMS3 emulsions . The controlled releases of Mg

@highlight Different PMS and SC polymers were applied to formulate W O W emulsions.
@highlight The stabilities and controlled releases of Mg
@highlight from W O W emulsions were affected by MW of PMS.
@highlight The PMS double emulsions have 1520days of storage stabilities.
