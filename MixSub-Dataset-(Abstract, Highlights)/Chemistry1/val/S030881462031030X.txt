 A polyphenols rich extract was obtained from polyvinylpolypyrrolidone winery residue and its neuroprotective effects and ability to modulate the kinetics of type 2 diabetes relevant enzymes were characterized . The PVPP white wine extract is a mixture of polyphenols dominated by proanthocyanidins and hydroxycinnamic acids affording strong antioxidant activity as detected by the protection of membrane lipids against oxidation and superoxide radical anion scavenging activity . Regarding type 2 diabetes framework the extract inhibits glucosidase K
