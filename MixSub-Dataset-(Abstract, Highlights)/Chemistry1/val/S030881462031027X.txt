 Biogenic amines are the important markers for food spoilage thus an on package sensor for biogenic amine detection is crucial for food quality control . A dual detection platform including colorimetry and LDI MS was developed for screening and quantitative determining of biogenic amines . Porous PLA film was fabricated using calcium carbonate nanoparticles to enhance film porosity leading to increased surface area of colorimetric sensor . The color intensity significantly increases depending upon the enhanced analyte concentration with a linear range of 2.010.0mg mL for putrescine and 0.16.0mg mL for cadaverine . On another layer graphene oxide paper was applied as an LDI MS substrate for sensitive quantification of biogenic amines . LOD values measured on graphene oxide coated side by LDI MS were found to be 0.07pM and 0.02pM for putrescine and cadaverine respectively . This platform was successfully applied for the detection of biogenic amines in pork samples with satisfactory results .
