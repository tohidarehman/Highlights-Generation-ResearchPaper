 Acid soluble collagen and pepsin soluble collagen were extracted and purified from the cartilages of skate and sturgeon . Their typical structure and physicochemical properties were evaluated by circular dichroism X ray diffraction and so on . Results showed that the extracted collagen was likely identified as collagen II composed of three chains with the typical peptide sequence of Gly X Y . It showed the collagen retained the native and intact triple helical structure and its intensity ratio of the positive and negative absorption peaks was 0.190.25 . In addition the extracted collagen exhibited obvious self assembly behavior with the concentration above 0.3mg mL the adjustment of pH 7.47.6 and the NaCl concentration of 120mmol L. The critical aggregate mass concentrations of pepsin soluble collagens from skate and sturgeon were 0.93 and 0.86g L respectively . Therefore collagens from skate and sturgeon cartilages have potential commercial application .

@highlight The aggregation behavior was affected by concentration pH and ionic strength.
@highlight The collagen had marked self assembly behavior when concentration above 0.3mg mL.
@highlight The adjustment of pH 7.47.6 was more suitable for collagen self assembly.
@highlight The NaCl concentration of 120mmol L was more suitable for collagen self assembly.
@highlight The critical aggregate mass concentration of type II collagen was analyzed.
