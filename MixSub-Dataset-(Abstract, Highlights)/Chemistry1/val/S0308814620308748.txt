 Coffee is considered an important source of organic nutrients and minerals and these resources are strongly affected by agricultural management . Among the minerals the element Mg is important which is essential for both plants and humans . In this work the effects of agricultural management on the absorption and storage of Mg by commercial ground roasted Arabica coffee were investigated . For this purpose some Mg and P fractions were evaluated . It was observed that Mg stored in the grain was concentrated in the inorganic fraction with an average extraction of 102 and in conventional samples and 119 in organic samples . These results suggest that in these samples Mg is probably largely presented as different inorganic salts . Phytate and organic acid salts are two possibilities discussed in this work that could explain this hypothesis . This can be corroborated by the extraction of Mg in the infusion of hot water .
