 the by product of Chinese Baijiu has attracted considerable attention due to its nutrient and microbial composition however none of the studies has explored the polysaccharides in HS yet . Here from HS we isolated a novel polysaccharide HSP 3 with an average molecular weight of 26.40kDa . The structure was elucidated based on monosaccharide composition and methylation analysis NMR FT IR and AFM analysis . It is mainly composed of mannose galactose arabinose glucose xylose fucose and rhamnose . The backbone of HSP 3 was made up of2
