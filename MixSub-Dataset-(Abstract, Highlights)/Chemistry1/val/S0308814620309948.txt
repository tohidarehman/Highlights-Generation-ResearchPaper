 It has been proven that at increased temperature sterols can undergo various chemical reactions e.g . oxidation dehydrogenation dehydration and polymerisation . The objectives of this study are to prove the existence of dimers and to quantitatively analyse the dimers . Sterol rich samples were heated at 180C 200C and 220C for 1 to 5h . Quantitative analyses of the 3 3 disteryl ethers were conducted using liquid extraction solid phase extraction and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry . Additionally for the analyses suitable standards were synthetized from native sterols . To identify the mechanism of 3 3 disteryl ether formation at high temperatures an attempt was made to use the proposed synthesis method . Additionally due to the association of sterols and sterol derivatives with atherosclerosis preliminary studies with synthetized 3 3 disteryl ethers on endothelial cells were conducted .

@highlight 3 3 disteryl ethers were prepared from the reaction of sterols with MK10 catalyst.
@highlight The GCMS method for analysing 3 3 disteryl ethers was developed and validated.
@highlight 3 3 disteryl ethers are formed by high temperature treatment of sterol rich samples.
