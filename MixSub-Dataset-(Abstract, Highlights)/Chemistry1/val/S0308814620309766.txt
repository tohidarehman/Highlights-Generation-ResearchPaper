 The application of fish gelatins in emulsions has attracted much attention and their stabilization mechanisms remain unclear . This work explores the effect of extraction methods on the structural characteristics functional properties and emulsion application of

@highlight Extraction affected emulsion stability of
@highlight skin gelatins AAG HWG PEG .
@highlight Secondary structures determined molecular interactions and emulsion stability.
@highlight The emulsion creaming velocities in the presence of NaCl were AAG HWGPEG.
@highlight The emulsion creaming velocities stored at 4C were AAGHWG PEG.
