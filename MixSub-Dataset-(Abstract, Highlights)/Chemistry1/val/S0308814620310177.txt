 Melatonin has gained increasing attention due to its pleiotropic effects . In present study Kyoho grapes were immersed in 200M of MLT to investigate the role of exogenous melatonin in postharvest metabolism response . Results indicated that berry abscission and rotten index was reduced by 37.50 and 58.37 respectively by exogenous MLT treatment while the amino acid accumulation was greatly enhanced . Furthermore the endogenous MLT biosynthesis was activated where the transcript expression of genes encoding tryptophan decarboxylase tryptophan decarboxylase

@highlight The postharvest quality of berry was maintained by exogenous melatonin.
@highlight The accumulation of amino acids was greatly promoted in response to melatonin.
@highlight The endogenous melatonin biosynthesis was enhanced by exogenous melatonin.
@highlight The phenolics oriented metabolism was accelerated by dose of melatonin.
