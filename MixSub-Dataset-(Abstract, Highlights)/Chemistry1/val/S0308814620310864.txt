 To overcome the drawbacks of antibody labeling dependence and single readout system in the conventional lateral flow immunoassays as well as the non targeted combination of new capture agents reported recently for pathogen detection in this work a multi readout and label free LFIA was proposed for rapid detection of

@highlight Man PBwas adoptedto establish a new sandwich LFIA format for bacteria detection.
@highlight Subversively the man PB can offertargeted combination towards
@highlight O157 H7.
@highlight Multi readout patterncan be used for visual and quantitative tests in this LFIA.
@highlight Functional nanozyme mediated LFIA may open up a new routefor more perfect detection.
@highlight Differ from other nanometer binders more flexible and targeted testing is achieved.
