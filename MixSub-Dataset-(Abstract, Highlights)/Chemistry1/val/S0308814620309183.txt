 The method for seafood spoilage detection is far from satisfactory for ensuring food safety and security . Here we develop a simple and cost effective method using the filter papers loaded with a dihydroquinoxaline derivative to monitor salmon spoilage . The correlation between the content of solid biogenic amines and the photoluminescence intensity of H DQ2 induced by amine vapours showed that the PL intensities of H DQ2 increased with the increase of spoilage which indicates that it is feasible to evaluate the spoilage degree of salmon based on the PL intensity of H DQ2 loaded filter papers by semi quantitation . The optimum detection condition is 75 50 and 50g of salmon 75 25 and 10M H DQ2 at 0 4 and 25C respectively . This study provides a quick and simple way for testing amine vapour from fish and provides baseline information for developing an easy to use on site method to evaluate seafood quality for customers .

@highlight Salmon spoilage was monitored by H DQ2 loaded filter paper to detect amine vapours.
@highlight The relationship between PL intensity of H DQ2 and salmon spoilage was established.
@highlight The detection conditions of H DQ2 loaded filter papers for spoilage were optimized.
@highlight The AIE method for spoilage has the advantage of simplicity rapidity and low cost.
