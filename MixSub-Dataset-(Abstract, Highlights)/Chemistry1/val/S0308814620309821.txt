 Enzymatic hydrolysis of plant derived proteins can improve their quality by offering opportunities for food applications . In this study three proteolytic enzymes were used alone or combined to produce faba bean protein hydrolysates . Their functional nutritional and antioxidant properties were evaluated and the peptidomic profile was assessed by LCMS MS. Hydrolysis improved solubility of faba proteins at acidic and neutral pH and their antioxidant properties . Peptidomic analysis identified 2031 peptides in the different PHs . Among them 9 showed 100 homology with previously known antioxidant peptides and several others had antioxidant motifs in their sequences . Sensory data analysis showed that after addition of PHs to apple juice no significant differences were perceived between control and some of the PHs . This study demonstrates that enzymatic hydrolysis enhances the functional and antioxidant properties of faba bean proteins . Specifically hydrolysates can be used as functional food ingredients to produce fortified beverages .
