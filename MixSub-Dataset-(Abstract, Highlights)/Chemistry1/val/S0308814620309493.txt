 This study investigated the lipid oxidation reactions of furan fatty acids long chain 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and tocopherols in an enriched 3 fish oil to better understand their degradation kinetics . Furthermore the influence of an added monomethyl furan fatty acid 9 nonanoic acid at 50250M on the oxidation reactions was evaluated . The results showed that the fish oil was rich in monomethyl and dimethyl furan fatty acids . Upon oxidation of the fish oil the dimethyl furan fatty acids degraded faster than the monomethyl ones but also faster than tocopherols . The addition of 9M5 revealed antioxidant activity It inhibited the degradation of the 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and the formation of primary and secondary lipid oxidation products and slowed down the degradation of the furan fatty acids and tocopherols . This research offers new insights into the importance of furan fatty acids in lipid oxidation reactions .

@highlight  3 Fish oil had a high concentration 1.3g 100g lipids of furan fatty acids.
@highlight Dimethyl furan fatty acids degraded faster than monomethyl ones in the fish oil.
@highlight Addition of 9M5 to fish oil inhibited oxidation reactions.
@highlight Antioxidant effect of 9M5 occurred after degradation of dimethyl furan fatty acids.
@highlight Dimethyl furan fatty acids degraded faster than tocopherols.
