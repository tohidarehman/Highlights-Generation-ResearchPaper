 In the present work we aimed to demonstrate the influence of inoculum starter in support high quality fermentation . Cocoa fermentations were performed in wooden boxes and eight yeasts strains were used in separated fermentations of fine cocoa type Scavina as starter inoculum . Temperature pH titirable acidity reducing sugar and free amino acids were evaluated during or after fermentation . The influence of starters yeasts on the decrease of acidity sugar concentration and free amino acids was significant . The strains

@highlight Inoculated fermentation presents higher well fermented seeds.
@highlight Influence in decrease of acidity sugar concentration and free amino acids were detected in inoculated fermentations.
@highlight A comparison of eight different inoculums was provided.
@highlight and
@highlight presented physicochemical changes relevant to the flavor in this experiment.
