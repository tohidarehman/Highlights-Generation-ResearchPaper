 Herein we proposed a duplex and homogeneous fluorescent immunoassay for the simultaneous detection of amantadine and chloramphenicol residue in chicken breast with both high sensitivity and short assay time . The immunoassay was based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer between hapten labeled carbon dots and antibody modified WS

@highlight Duplex FRET based immunassay is developed using the CDs and WS
@highlight nanosheets.
@highlight Polyamine coated blue green emissive CDs are prepared and coupled with the haptens.
@highlight The immunoassay achieves the simultaneous detection of AMD and CAP residues.
