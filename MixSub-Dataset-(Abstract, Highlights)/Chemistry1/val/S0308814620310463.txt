 Heat treatment is a commonly applied unit operation in the processing of lactoglobulin containing products . This does however influence its structure and thereby impacts its activity and digestibility . We describe how various heat treatments of lactoglobulin change the digestibility using a modified version of the current consensus INFOGEST protocol . Additionally protein was investigated for its translocation over the intestinal epithelial barrier which would bring them in contact with immune cells . The extent of gastric digestibility was higher when the protein structure was more modified while the influence of glycation with lactose was limited . Translocation studies of protein across Caco 2 cell monolayers showed a lower translocation rate of protein heated in solution compared to the others . Our study indicates that structural modifications after different heat treatments of lactoglobulin increase in particular gastric digestibility and the translocation efficiency across intestinal epithelial cells .

@highlight The influence of protein digestion after 3 different processing methods was evaluated.
@highlight Digestion and epithelial transport were analysed in coherence.
@highlight Translocated protein through Caco 2 monolayer was shown by SDS PAGE for the first time.
@highlight The results lead to better understanding of the immunological impact of processing and digestion.
