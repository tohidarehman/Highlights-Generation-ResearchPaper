 Although applied for several decades production of hollow plastic parts by extrusion blow molding is still over dimensioned . To overcome this issue a thorough investigation of the process structure property relationship is required . In this study the local process structure property relationship for high density polyethylene EBM containers is analyzed with differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanic analysis microindentation . Local process dependent crystallinity and complex modulus data at various processing conditions are supplemented with wide angle X ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy . The crystallinities and the complex moduli clearly show lower values close to the mold side than at the inner side and the middle of the cross section which reflects the temperature gradient during processing . Additionally the orientation of the polymer chain reveals a low level of biaxiality with a slight tendency towards transverse direction . The biaxiality increases for low mold temperature and high draw ratio . Finally biaxiality is confirmed with TEM which reveals no preferred lamellar orientation .
