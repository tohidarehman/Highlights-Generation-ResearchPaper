 The main problem of poor water compatibility of molecularly imprinted polymers has been addressed in this study . A new facile and highly efficient approach was developed to obtain well defined hydrophilic molecularly imprinted polymer microsphere with excellent specific recognition ability toward Chenodeoxycholic acid in crude bile . Particularly it involved computational modeling to obtain a polymer network with high affinity for CDCA and addition of a hydrophilic crosslinker diacrylate200 to increase the hydrophilicity of the polymer surface . To our knowledge this study first report splitting method in molecular imprinting technology . By using the splitting method simulation time can be saved under the premise of ensuring accuracy . The adsorption experiments revealed that an optimized CDCA MIP exhibited better selectivity toward CDCA with inhibition of the nonspecific adsorption . The CDCA MIP possessed adsorption capacity of 49.86mgg

@highlight Chenodeoxycholic acid adsorbent was prepared by molecular imprinting technology.
