 With the increasing attention to the shortage of petroleum resources and environmental pollution it is more urgent to develop new type biomass derived and bio degradability polymer materials . In this study a various of bio based ethylene co vinyl acetate poly thermoplastic vulcanizates with enhanced mechanical strength and shape memory behavior were prepared . The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy torque rheometer swelling equilibrium experiments and thermal gravimetric analysis indicate that the EVA component is more aggressive to the active radicals than PLA component and the improvement of gel content for EVA component is more than that of PLA component . The scanning electronic microscope and transmission electron microscopy show that the co continuous structure of EVA PLA AD TPV could be well maintained when the TMPTA was introduced into the multicomponent system . Obviously the results also exhibit that the improvement of mechanical strength and shape memory behavior for EVA PLA AD TPV could be attributed to the increased gel content especially the gel content of EVA component without changing the crystallization behavior of EVA PLA AD TPV .

@highlight High performance EVA PLA based TPV was obtained via introducing TMPTA.
@highlight The obtained EVA PLA based TPVs owns obvious co continuous structure.
@highlight The EVA component is more aggressive to the active radicals than PLA component.
@highlight The tensile strength of EVA PLA based TPVs is significantly improved by 42.3 .
@highlight The shape memory behavior of the EVA PLA based TPVs was obviously improved.
