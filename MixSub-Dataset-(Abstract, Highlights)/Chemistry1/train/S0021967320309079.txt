 The current study investigates a method for purification of the G quadruplex secondary structure naturally formed by a guanine rich 21 mer oligonucleotide strand using a monolithic convective interaction media quaternary amine column under ion exchange conditions . The monolithic support was initially evaluated on a preparative scale against a highly efficient TSKgel SuperQ 5PW ion exchange support designed for oligonucleotide purification . The CIM analogue demonstrated clear advantages over the particle based support on the basis of rapid separation times while also affording high purity of the G quadruplex . Various parameters were investigated including the type of mobile phase anion cation pH and injection load to induce and control quadruplex formation as well as enhance chromatographic separation and final purity . Potassium afforded the most prominent quadruplex formation yet sodium allowed for the highest resolution and purity to be achieved with a 30 mg injection on an 8 ml CIM QA monolithic column . This method was applied to purify in excess of 300 mg of the quadruplex with excellent retention time precision of under 1 RSD . Native mass spectrometry was utilized to confirm the identity of the intact G quadruplex under non denaturing conditions while ion pairing reversed phase methods confirmed the presence of the single stranded oligonucleotide in high purity under denaturing conditions .
