 Emulsifiers of the type E472 are esters of fruit acids and mono and diacylglycerols which are used to adjust techno functional properties in various food products . The most dominant representatives of E 472 emulsifiers are acetic acid esters lactic acid esters citric acid esters and mono and diacetyl tartaric acid esters . For the determination of fruit acids a high performance liquid chromatography method with ultraviolet light detection was developed . Free and total fruit acids were determined by reversed phase HPLCUV analysis of untreated and saponified emulsifier extracts with 20mM potassium hydrogen phosphate buffer as isocratic eluent . Limits of quantitation of 0.080.27g free fruit acid kg emulsifier and 414g total fruit acid kg granted a reliable method with recoveries for free and total fruit acids between 80 and 100 with relative standard deviations
