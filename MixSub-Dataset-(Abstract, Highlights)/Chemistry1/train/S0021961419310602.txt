 The pharmaceutical salt of imatinib prepared with low purity did not meet the pharmaceutically acceptable quality . The objective of this work is to research the shape of the solubility profile of imatinib in pure and mixed solvents at

@highlight Study the solubility of imatinib in pure and mixed solvents.
@highlight Solute solvent interactions and co solvency phenomenon were analyzed.
@highlight Two thermodynamic models were used to evaluate the solubility profile.
@highlight Some thermodynamic properties of dissolution process were calculated.
