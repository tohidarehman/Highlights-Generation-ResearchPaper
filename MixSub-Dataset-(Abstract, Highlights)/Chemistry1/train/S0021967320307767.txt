 Metabolic stability tests are one of the fundamental steps at the preclinical stages of new drug development . Microsomes used as a typical enzymatic model of liver biotransformation can be a challenging matrix for analytical scientists due to a high concentration of cellular proteins and membrane lipids . In the work we propose a new procedure integrating biotransformation reaction with SPME like protocol for sample clean up . It is beneficial to increase the overall quality of results in contrary to the typical protein precipitation approach . A set of ten arylpiperazine analogs six of which are considered promising drug candidates were used as a probe to assess the goodness of the newly proposed approach . In order to promote an efficient extraction protocol a new miniaturized shape of a sorbent suitable to perform the extraction in 100 L of the sample has been designed . Termination of the biotransformation process by protein denaturation with hot water was additionally evaluated . A quantitative structure property relationship study using Orthogonal Partial Least Squares technique to reveal insights to the sorption mechanism was also performed . The obtained results showed the new 3D printed sorbent can be an attractive basis for the new sample preparation approach for metabolic stability studies and an alternative for commercially available protocols based on solid phase microextraction or solid phase extraction principles .

@highlight The 3D printed sorbent is coupled to the metabolic stability test of drug candidates.
@highlight Customizable sorbent enhances the performance of LC MS analysis at low cost of sample clean up.
@highlight The additional extraction step improves the precision of drug candidates t
@highlight determination.
