 Nanostructured polyketone polyamide 6 blends can be readily prepared via melt blending technologies and exhibit ultra high toughness when PA6 is present as the nanoscale phase domains . When PA6 content is 30vol the impact strength of the blends increases from 21.4kJ m

@highlight Nanoscale phase domains of PA6 can be formed within 1min and remain stable under various processing fields.
@highlight The strong intermolecular interaction between PK and PA6 improves the compatibility of the components.
@highlight The notched impact strength of PK PA6 NPBs increases from 21.4 kJ m2 of pure PK to 113 kJ m2 of K5A5.
@highlight The low modulus PA6 nanophase is prone to cavitate and can effectively prevent the crack propagation of PK PA6 NPBs.
