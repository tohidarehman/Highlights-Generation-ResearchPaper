 Hyperspectral observations have become one of the most popular and powerful methods for atmospheric remote sensing and are widely used for temperature gas aerosol and cloud retrievals . However accurate forward radiative transfer simulations are computationally expensive since typical line by line approaches involve a large number of monochromatic radiative transfer calculations . This study explores the feasibility of machine learning techniques as an example for fast hyperspectral radiative transfer simulations by performing calculations at a small fraction of hyperspectral wavelengths and extending them across the entire spectral range . Results from the NN model are compared with those from a principal component analysis model which uses a similar principle of dimensionality reduction . We consider hyperspectral radiances from both actual satellite observations and accurate line by line simulations . The NN model can alleviate the computational burden by two to three orders of magnitude and generate radiances with small relative errors the performance of the NN model is better than that of the PCA model . The model can be further improved by optimizing the training procedure and parameters the representative wavelengths and the machine learning technique itself .
