 A new stationary phase based on glucose derived carbon dots modified on silica was prepared and applied in hydrophilic interaction chromatography . The Sil Glc CDs column showed better retention ability and separation selectivity toward polar analytes including amino acids saccharides ginsenosides antibiotics nucleosides and nucleobases when compared with a commercial HILIC column and a home made glucose modified silica column . The effect of the organic phase ratio salt concentration pH and column temperature on chromatographic retention behavior was investigated . In addition the column exhibited good stability and column to column reproducibility RSDs 0.801.97

@highlight Glucose based carbon dots modified silica packing material was prepared.
