 Pyrethrum extract is a natural insecticide that has been used worldwide for centuries with pyrethrins being considered active ingredients . Their purification is difficult due to their chemical structural similarity and instability to light . In the present study a coordination complex high speed counter current chromatography was used to separate pyrethrins from pyrethrum extract . The two phase solvent system composed of petroleum etherethyl acetate methanol water with 0.30mol L silver nitrate was selected for separation . As a result five pyrethrins including cinerin II pyrethrin II jasmalin II pyrethrin I and jasmalin I were obtained from 400mg crude extract in 6h by one step HSCCC separation with purities over 95 . The isolated compounds were identified by MS

@highlight Separation of pyrethrins by High speed counter current chromatography HSCCC for the first time.
@highlight A coordination complexation method was used to separate pyrethrins.
@highlight The presence of a silver ion complex agent significantly increased separation factor.
