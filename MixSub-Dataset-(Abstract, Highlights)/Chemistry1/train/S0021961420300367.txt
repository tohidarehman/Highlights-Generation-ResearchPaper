@highlight New experimental data of the speed of sound in
@highlight  decane along five isobaric lines were presented.
@highlight The short fundamental EOS of Lemmon and Span were assessed by the experimental speed of sound in
@highlight  decane.
@highlight The influences of the pressure on the internal pressure in
@highlight  decane first become smaller and then become greater as the temperature rises.
