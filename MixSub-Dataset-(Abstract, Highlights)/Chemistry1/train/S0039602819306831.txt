 Silicon cap annealing emerged as a promising silicidation less ohmic contact formation method that can solve the crucial reliability limitation of ohmic contacts formed with metals this limitation was due to carbon aggregation introduced during silicidation annealing . However no previous study for a complete understanding of SiCA effects on the metal SiC exists . In this study the band energy state of silicidation less ohmic contacts formed by SiCA SiC is directly estimated using hard X ray photoelectron spectroscopy . The results show that Si dot formation on the SiC surface reduces the contacts resistivity and ohmic contact behavior is still observed even after Si dot removal . A peak position analysis of Si 1s orbit using HAXPES shows a clear increase in the band energy under various SiC surface conditions . Particularly the Al SiCA SiC sample shows a peak shift of 0.765eV . This strong potential barrier lowering the derived formation of the thin depletion layer and low potential barrier on Al SiCA SiC junction . Moreover the observations made using HAXPES and transmission electron microscopy suggest that the modification of the outer most surface layer plays an essential role in the ohmic contact formation . These results provide insights on the ohmic contact formation mechanism for wide band gap semiconductor materials .
