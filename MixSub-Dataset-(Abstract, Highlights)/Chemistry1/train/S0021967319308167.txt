 A combined procedure based on using ultrasounds for target isolation followed by porous membrane protected micro solid phase extraction using a molecularly imprinted polymer as an adsorbent has been developed as a highly selective extraction and clean up procedure for isolating aflatoxins B1 B2 G1 and G2 from fish feed before ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry determination . Polymeric adsorbent beads have been synthesized by the precipitation polymerization method which guarantees a homogeneous particles size distribution and the integrity of the generated imprinted cavities . In addition polymerization was performed using a higher proportion of organic solvent in the porogen mixture which generates MIP particles adequate for interacting with targets dissolved in organic mixtures . These approaches led to a selective and high efficient pre concentration method for AFs . Ultrasound assisted extraction 10mL of 60 40 acetonitrile 0.1M KH
