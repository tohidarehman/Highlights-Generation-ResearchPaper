 Monolayers of 2 4 6 tris 1 3 5 triazine on Au surfaces were formed via solvent evaporation at different temperatures and the molecular arrangement and intermolecular association type of these monolayers were probed by scanning tunneling microscopy . Intermolecular BrN interactions were dominant in the phase formed at 70 C phase
