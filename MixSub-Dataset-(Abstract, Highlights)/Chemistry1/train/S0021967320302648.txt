 Ion chromatographyelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry is used to determine nine haloacetic acids bromate and dalapon in drinking water samples in U.S. EPA Method 557 . In this method all target analytes are separated and measured with good sensitivity without the need for sample preconcentration or derivatization . However the separation time is relatively long . In order to reduce the sample analysis time in EPA Method 557 a new anion exchange column has been developed to perform fast separation of the target analytes . Using this new anion exchange column nine HAAs bromate and dalapon can be resolved and separated from interfering matrix ions within 40 minutes about 33 faster than the analysis time obtained using an earlier anion exchange column reported in EPA Method 557 . The new anion exchange column has unique selectivity and high exchange capacity . Method optimization simplification and improvements in robustness are demonstrated while validating the new column suitability for the determine of HAAs bromate and dalapon according to EPA Method 557 .
