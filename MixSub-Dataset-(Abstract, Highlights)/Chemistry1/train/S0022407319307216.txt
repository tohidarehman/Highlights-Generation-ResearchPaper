 In the present study droplets of colloidal suspensions or emulsions are characterized using rainbow refractometry according to diameter relative refractive index and concentration of the dispersed phase . The position and angular spacing of the rainbow are used to retrieve the relative refractive index and droplet size . For the measurement of colloid concentration a novel method using the intensity ratio of the

@highlight Simultaneous measurement of refractive index diameter and colloid concentration.
@highlight Intensity ratio of
@highlight  2 and 0 scattering is used to measure colloid concentration.
@highlight Measured ratio attenuations are verified by a Monte Carlo ray tracing simulation.
