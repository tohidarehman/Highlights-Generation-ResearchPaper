 Pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry test smoke toxicity analysis and mouse biological toxicity test were carried out on the second use lithium ion battery separator and electrolyte . It was found that the types of cracked products of separator and electrolyte under different state of health were basically the same mainly phosphoryl fluoride POF

@highlight The relationship between pyrolysis products and toxicity of second use battery was analyzed for the first time.
@highlight The higher the battery state of health the greater the toxicity index of the smoke produced by combustion and the toxic gas components released are mainly CO CO
@highlight  HF.
@highlight Analysis of the toxicity during the thermal runaway of lithium ion batteries is of great significance for studying the hazards to human body and the environment.
