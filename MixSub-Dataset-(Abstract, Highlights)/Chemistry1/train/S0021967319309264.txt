 When determining contaminants from environmental samples sample treatment plays an important role . Among the different extraction techniques available solid phase extraction has been commonly used for liquid samples as well as for solid samples after an extraction technique amenable for solids . The broad applicability of SPE is attributed to the availability of different sorbents . Among these sorbents the mixed mode ion exchange polymeric ones have been widely exploited since they suitably combine both capacity and selectivity . This review overviews the application of mixed mode ion exchange polymeric sorbents in environmental field when water and solid samples are analyzed . The sample analyzed the compounds determined the type of mixed mode sorbent selected the approach used and the SPE protocol applied are comprehensively discussed through different examples . This review intends to summarize the role of mixed mode ion exchange polymeric sorbents in the environmental field .

@highlight Mixed mode sorbents have been widely applied in the environmental field.
@highlight They are used to both enrich contaminants and clean up interferences from complex samples.
@highlight The optimization of the SPE protocol mainly in terms of pHs is important to establish ionic interactions.
@highlight Different approaches single or combined cartridge can be explored to enhance their potential.
