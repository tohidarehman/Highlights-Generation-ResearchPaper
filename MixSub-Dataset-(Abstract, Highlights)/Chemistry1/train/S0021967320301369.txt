 In this work a dispersive solid phase extraction method for sulfonamides has been developed using a stable and mesoporous metal organic framework as adsorbent which was synthesized by coordination of Zr

@highlight A high performance d SPE method for sulfonamides was established.
@highlight The synergistic effect of interaction hydrogen bonding and size match was involved.
@highlight The adsorption mechanism was studied by using kinetic models.
@highlight The pore size of UiO 67 showed high match with molecular diameters of sulfonamides.
