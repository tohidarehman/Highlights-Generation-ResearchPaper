@highlight A series of bio based copolyesters have been successfully synthesized from FDCA 2 6 NDCA and BDO.
@highlight The effects of composition on thermal properties mechanical properties and UV blocking properties were investigated.
@highlight PBN and PBNF25 can crystallize rapidly. However the crystallization rates of PBNF50 PBNF75 and PBF are very slow.
@highlight PBNF25 PBNF50 and PBNF75 possessed UV protectant properties.
