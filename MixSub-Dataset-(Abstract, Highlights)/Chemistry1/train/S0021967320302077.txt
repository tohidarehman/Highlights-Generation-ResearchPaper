 Mass spectrum is one of the most commonly used tools for qualitative and quantitative analysis of glycans . However due to the complexity of biological samples and the low ionization efficiency of glycans these need to be purified and derivatized prior to MS analysis . Existing purification strategies require a combination of multiple methods and are cumbersome to operate . Here we propose a new method for the purification of glycoprotein N O glycans and their derivatives using a hand packed absorbent cotton hydrophilic interaction chromatography column . The method s reliability and applicability were verified by purifying N O glycans and the derivatives of standard glycoproteins such as chicken albumin and porcine stomach mucin . Stable isotope labelling was used to compare the glycans recovery following different purification methods . Absorbent cotton HILIC was also successfully applied for the analysis of human serum and fetal bovine serum glycoprotein N glycans . Finally testing revealed high binding capacity 9mg g

@highlight We propose a new absorbent cotton hydrophilic interaction chromatographic column HILIC for N and O glycans and their derivatives purification.
@highlight The new method is suitable for chemically or enzymatically released glycans.
@highlight The method allows for a better recovery of N glycans than solid phase extraction SPE columns.
@highlight The method can be used for the purification of O glycans released by
@highlight  elimination.
@highlight The method can successfully detect glycans in complex biological samples.
