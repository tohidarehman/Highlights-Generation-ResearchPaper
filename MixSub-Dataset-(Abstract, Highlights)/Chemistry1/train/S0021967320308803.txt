 An accurate sensitive and selective analytical method is proposed for sulfonamide residues analysis in infant formulas based on hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry in full scan mode . The sample preparation approach involves low temperature lipid precipitation followed by dispersive solid phase extraction with PSA and C

@highlight HILIC QToF MS is proposed for confirmatory analysis of sulfonamides in infant foods.
@highlight The great influence of HILIC conditions on sulfonamide ionization was demonstrated.
@highlight Plackett Burman design was used to maximize the extraction of the sulfonamides.
@highlight Low temperature and dispersive SPE cleanups provide high co extractives removal.
@highlight Method limits were low enough for the monitoring of sulfonamides in infant formulas.
