 The determination of equilibrium solubilities of thiamethoxam in solutions of 1 4 dioxane water N N dimethylacetamide water dimethyl sulfoxide water and acetonitrile water was carried out through the shake flask method from 278.15 to 323.15K under 101.2kPa . The relative contributions of solventsolvent and solutesolvent interactions on the drug solubility variation were studied via the analysis of linear solvation energy relationships . The significant contributions to the solubility variation were the cavity term and dipolarity polarizability term in aqueous solution of 1 4 dioxane and cavity term in aqueous solutions of DMAC DMSO acetonitrile . The inverse KirkwoodBuff integrals were employed to investigate the preferential solvation in light of several solution thermodynamic properties . The preferential solvation parameters for 1 4 dioxane DMAC and acetonitrile presented positive values in the three aqueous solutions within intermediate and 1 4 dioxane DMAC acetonitrile rich compositions demonstrating that the drug thiamethoxam was solvated preferentially by 1 4 dioxane DMAC acetonitrile . It is conjectured that in these regions thiamethoxam serves as a Lewis acid with the 1 4 dioxane and DMAC molecules while for the mixture the preferential solvation could be attributed to polarization effects . Moreover the solubility data in mole fraction was mathematically described by the vant HoffJouyban Acree model and Jouyban Acree model attaining the average relative deviations no more than 6.67 .
