 Properties of the surface layer of materials determine their suitability for some special applications affecting the value of adhesion between bonding materials . In the case of dental fillings the high value of adhesion to tooth tissue is important and determines their durability and tightness . The surface properties of dental methacrylic resin with the addition of various zeolite fillers were examined using inverse gas chromatography . The dispersive and specific component of the surface energy acceptor donor properties were determined from IGC experiments . The effect of the addition of zeolite filler on the surface energy values of the examined dental composites was investigated . It has been shown that using IGC it is possible to determine parameters describing the adhesion between materials expressed by the value of the work of adhesion . Different values of the work of adhesion were observed according to the type of tooth tissue .

@highlight A zeolite filler influences the surface properties of the dental resin.
@highlight The addition of a filler increases the total surface energy of the dental composite.
@highlight Work of adhesion depends on the pore size distribution of fillers.
@highlight The addition of a filler to the resin increases its electron donor properties.
@highlight Zeolite HA filler increases the adhesion of the composite to enamel.
