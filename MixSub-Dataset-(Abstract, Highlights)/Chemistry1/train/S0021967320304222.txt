 In this study a multiresidue analytical method was developed validated and applied for quantifying 85 persistent organic pollutants including 38 polychlorinated biphenyls 23 polybrominated diphenyl ethers and 24 organochlorine pesticides from 200 L of human serum . A modified QuEChERS method was applied to minimize the required sample amount and optimize various conditions including the extraction solvent and the number of extractions . The extraction efficiency was optimized using double extraction with an ethyl acetate hexane acetone mixture . Gas chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was used for analysis and two different ionization sources electron impact ionization and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization were used to compare their sensitivity . The APCI source employed soft ionization at atmospheric pressure producing abundant molecular ion formation with minimal fragmentation in contrast to extensive fragmentation caused by EI . Of the 85 POPs analyzed 59 target compounds showed lower limits of detection that were two to fifty fold lower in APCI than those determined using EI . The developed method was validated for its detection limit precision recovery matrix effect and accuracy . Its linearity was R
