 A novel nanocomposite was prepared from ethylene co vinyl acetate copolymer and poly 3 hydroxy butyrate co valerate in combination with small amounts of Fullerene C

@highlight The impact of C
@highlight on the thermal stability of EVA PHBV blend is studied.
@highlight The incorporation of C
@highlight retard the decomposition process of nanocomposites.
@highlight Smaller C
@highlight amounts increase the decomposition temperatures of nanocomposites.
@highlight reacts with free radicals that are forming during oxidation.
@highlight reaction with free radical protects nanocomposites from decomposition.
