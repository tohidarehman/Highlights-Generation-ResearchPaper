 We report the production of ultracold heteronuclear NaCs molecules in excited electronic states by photoassociation of ultracold Na and Cs atoms . The saturation of the photoassociation scattering probability is observed from the dependence of the trap loss probability on the photoassociation laser intensity . Based on the scattering theory we estimate the saturation intensity of photoassociation which is deduced by fitting the experimental data to a saturation model .

@highlight High resolution spectroscopy of
@highlight state in long range part of ultracold polar NaCs molecules.
@highlight The saturation effect was observed in the polar molecules system. The saturation of the photoassociation scattering probability is demonstrated from the dependence of the trap loss probability on the photoassociation laser intensity.
@highlight The saturation intensity is deduced from the theory and corresponding well to the experimental data.
