 A new model to account for turbulence radiation interaction on the radiation emission in the framework of Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes simulations is proposed and tested . The models development is based on Reynolds decompositions of the temperature

@highlight A new model for turbulence radiation interaction TRI is developed.
@highlight The development is based on transient data numerically generated for pool fires.
@highlight The model allows for the consideration of emission TRI in RANS simulations.
@highlight An approximation for the mean Planck mean absorption coefficient is also proposed.
@highlight Errors of the model are significantly smaller than those of existing models.
