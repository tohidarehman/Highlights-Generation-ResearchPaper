 An improved deep eutectic solvent based headspace single drop microextraction procedure has been developed as a green procedure for gas chromatography mass spectrometric analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in aqueous samples . The stability of the micro drop was significantly improved using a DES as an extraction phase and a bell shaped tube as a supporter . These strategies helped to perform the extraction process in higher temperatures and stirring rates . Finally the back extraction of the analytes into a proper solvent that is compatible with the chromatography system was applied . The efficacy of the independent variables on the extraction efficiency was evaluated via chemometric methods in two steps . The best result was obtained with choline chloride oxalic acid at the molar ratio of 1 2 a stirring speed of 2000rpm for 10min as well as a sample temperature of 50C and with ionic strength prepared by using a 10 NaCl . The method indicated a good linearity for the analytes R
