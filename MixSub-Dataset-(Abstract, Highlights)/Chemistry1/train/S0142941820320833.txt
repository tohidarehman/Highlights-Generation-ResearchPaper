 cyclodextrin based materials have been studied widely as adsorbents and filter membranes for removing pollutants in air or water applications . The present study aimed to develop a sandwich structure of eletrospun nanofibrous membrane based on cyclodextrin and PA66 to achieve the high mechanical strength and flow through adsorption of heavy metal ions in water . The surface and cross section morphology of PA66 cyclodextrin PA66 nanofibrous membranes were examined using scanning electron microscopy . The physicochemical and mechanical properties of PA66 CD PA66 NMs were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry thermogravimetric analysis and universal testing machine . The diameter of CD and PA66 electrospun fibers are 300400nm and 2040nm respectively . PA66 CD PA66 NMs show a loosely arranged fibers and layer by layer structure . The tensile strength increases remarkably for PA66 CD PA66 NMs from 1.33MPa of CD NMs to 23.17MPa and the Young s modulus increases from 34.8MPa to 253.3MPa . The mechanical behavior of PA66 CD PA66 NMs is a typical brittle fracture and its microcosmic fracture diagrams are also involved . TGA DSC results confirm the thermal crosslinking reaction is effective and complete . On the basis of SEM DSC TG and mechanical behavior analysis results the molecular mechanism of in situ thermal crosslinking reaction is discussed . Fe
