 Stationary phases with multiple mode mechanism are beneficial to meet the needs of complex samples but there are few multiple mode stationary phases which can adjust the relative strength among multiple forces imposed on the solutes . This work presents a facile preparation method of reverse phase hydrophilic interaction ion exchange tri mode stationary phase in which three functional monomers lauryl methacrylate hydroxyethyl methylacrylate and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate as co monomers underwent surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization on the surface of silica . The structure of stationary phases was characterized and their chromatographic properties were investigated using various solutes . By comparison with classical single mode columns it is found that the newly designed columns can offer multiple interactions including hydrophobic hydrophilic and electrostatic interactions and show good separation abilities to the tested solutes . Besides changing the ratios of LMA HEMA and DMAEMA in SI ATRP system can easily adjust the relative strength of three interactions imposed on the solutes inducing adjustable separation selectivity of the columns . The improved separation of multivitamin sample and the successful use of the columns in
