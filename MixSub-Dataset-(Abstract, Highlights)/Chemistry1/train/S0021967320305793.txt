 In this work we utilized basic and acidic analytes to investigate the ionic interaction participation in retention behavior of selected reversed phase and polar columns . The test analytes included nitrate benzenesulfonate and trimethylphenylammonium ions . The fully aqueous mobile phase comprising 10mM dichloroacetic acid buffered with ammonia solution to desirable pH was used for retention experiments . Developed method was utilized to study the ionic interactions of stationary phases in pH range between 2.5 and 9.0 . We demonstrate that selected sorbents used for reversed phase and hydrophilic interaction chromatography separations exhibit cation or anion exchange interactions . We compare the results to novel Atlantis PREMIER BEH C18 AX mixed mode column that combines reversed phase and anion exchange interaction modes . We evaluated the relative retention strength of selected columns for anionic and cationic analytes .
