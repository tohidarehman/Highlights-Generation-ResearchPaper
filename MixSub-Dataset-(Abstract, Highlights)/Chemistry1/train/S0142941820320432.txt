 Escalating antimicrobial resistance is causing a major threat to the public health . Failure of traditional antibiotics urges the development of alternative therapeutics which include biopolymeric nanosystems with intrinsic antimicrobial potential . In the present study mannose functionalized chitosan nanosystems were fabricated through reductive amination of chitosan with mannose and further its ionic gelation . Changes in zeta potential and characteristic peaks in FTIR spectra revealed surface functionalization of chitosan with mannose . Zeta sizer studies disclosed relatively higher size of mannosylated CNS as compared to CNS . Inversely the zeta potential was reduced from 32.2mV to 25.4mV for M CNS . Scanning electron microscopy verified the slight increase in size for M CNS . Antimicrobial evaluation of designed nanosystems as alternative antibacterial agent was assessed by time kill polystyrene adherence and antibiofilm assays against both Gram positive and Gram negative pathogens . Results indicated that mannose functionalized CNS inhibited the growth of resistant
