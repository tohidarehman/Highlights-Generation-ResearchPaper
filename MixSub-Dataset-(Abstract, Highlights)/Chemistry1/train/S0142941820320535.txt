 Bimodal network composite was prepared using a two step method containing graphene modified by propyl trimethoxysilane short chain poly C

@highlight Using a two step method to fabricate poly dimethyl siloxane bimodal network composite.
@highlight Graphene was grafted with KH560 as insulating layer to improve its dispersion which enhanced the MWS effect.
@highlight A comparison among different kinds and contents of fillers is shown here.
@highlight From this work percolation thresholds of composites are identified.
@highlight The graphene polymer percolative composites with excellent dielectric properties was acquired.
