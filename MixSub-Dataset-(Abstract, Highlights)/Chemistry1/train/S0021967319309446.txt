 As short chain chlorinated paraffins are listed on several monitoring programs validated methods are essential . However their complexity and the lack of commercially available certified reference materials hinder a proper validation of methods . Instead one method is usually validated by evaluating performances and results of spiked materials with that of one other method which could easily lead to unreliable results .

@highlight SCCPs were determined in candidate reference materials for potential certification.
@highlight Determination involved four methods with different principles.
@highlight The suitability of the GCECNILRMS method for SCCP determination is doubtful.
@highlight Using spiked samples or solutions might not always be ideal for method validation.
@highlight The results provide a good basis for possible certification of one of the materials.
