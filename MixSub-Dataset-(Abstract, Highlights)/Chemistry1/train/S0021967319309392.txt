 The facile enrichment of glycopeptides or glycoproteins poses great challenges for glycoproteomic research . In this study a novel hydrophilic material named zwitterionic hydrophilic L cysteine derivatized straticulate C

@highlight A zwitterionic hydrophilic L Cysteine derivatized straticulate C
@highlight composites were synthesized.
@highlight The materials show high selectivity low detection limit high enrichment efficiency and high recovery rate for N glycopeptides.
@highlight Up to 1809 N glycopeptides and 876 N glycoproteins could be enriched from mililiters of human urine samples.
