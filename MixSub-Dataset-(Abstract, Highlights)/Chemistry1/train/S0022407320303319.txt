 Selective spectra of absorber and emitter have great effects on the solar thermophotovoltaic performance . In this work a systematic thermal analysis of the STPV system was conducted to optimize the selective absorber and emitter . For the ideal absorber and emitter the maximum STPV efficiency can be achieved at the cutoff wavelength of 1.2 m for the ideal absorber and emitted spectrum width of 1.0 m for the ideal emitter . Increasing concentrated factor of solar radiation from 1 to 100 can enhance the total STPV efficiency from 10.4 to 20.3 indicating that the large incident solar intensity can enhance the STPV efficiency . In addition increasing ratios of length to gap eg
