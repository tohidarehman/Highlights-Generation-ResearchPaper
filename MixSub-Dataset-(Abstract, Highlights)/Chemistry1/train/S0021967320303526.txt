 In this work a new method for the determination of 5 hydroxymethylfurfural in cereal and insect bars has been developed and validated . The method consisted of a solid liquid extraction followed by a solid phase extraction employing functionalized mesostructured silica as sorbent and prior to high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry analysis . Mesostructured silica with a large pore functionalized with aminopropyl groups SBA 15 LP NH
