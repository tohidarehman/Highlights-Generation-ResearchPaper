 Polyurea a reaction product of isocyanates and an amine blend has been reported to be highly strain rate sensitive which responds in its own unique way when subjected to increasing strain rates . The amine blend comprise of a long chain amine forming the soft segments chain extender which brings the urea linkages closer and a crosslinker which serves as a chemical bond between the chains . In this work we attempt to tune the viscous contribution in polyurea by increasing crosslinking density while keeping the amount of chain extender more or less constant . The viscoelastic behavior and its effect on the time dependant behavior was established by extensive dynamic studies . Quasi static tests and Split Hopkinson testing was performed over large deformation rates 10
