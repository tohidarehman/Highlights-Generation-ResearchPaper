 Excess bilirubin can accumulate in body organs and has serious effects on human health . In this work a simple engineering strategy based on cellulose assisted high quality dispersion of carbon nanotubes is proposed to produce high performance bilirubin adsorbents . By dispersing cellulose and CNTs in NaOH thiourea aqueous solution a homogeneous and stable cellulose CNTs solution is achieved . The obtained cellulose CNTs solution is applied for the fabrication of cellulose CNTs microspheres in which cellulose serves as a base material and guarantees the blood compatibility of the composite material and CNTs contribute to the improved mechanical strength and high adsorption capacity . To further improve blood compatibility and adsorption capacity lysine is immobilized on the CCMs . The obtained lysine modified CCMs exhibit a large surface area 171.31 m

@highlight Uniform carbon nanotubes suspension is achieved by cellulose assisted dispersion.
@highlight The cellulose carbon nanotubes dispersion is used for fabricating bilirubin adsorbent.
