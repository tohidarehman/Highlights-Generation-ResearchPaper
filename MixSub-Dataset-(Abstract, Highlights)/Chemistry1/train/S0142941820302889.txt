 In this study we investigate the effect of M Type zirconium doped barium hexaferrite nanoparticles addition with reduced graphene oxide fillers in Polyvinylidenefluoride matrix to design lightweight and flexible polymer composite films for electromagnetic wave absorption and electromagnetic interference shielding . Firstly Zr doped M Type barium hexaferrite BaZrFe

@highlight PVDF RGO BaZrFe
@highlight composites were developed using simple solvent casting approach.
@highlight The synthesized samples were investigated by using XRD FTIR Raman Spectroscopy HRSEM EDX XPS and VSM analyses.
@highlight The resultant flexible films show an excellent EMI SE of 48.59dBat 11.1GHz for 10wt of BaZrFe
@highlight addition in polymer composite for 0.2mm thickness.
@highlight The combination of high dielectric loss 
@highlight  1.95 and magnetic loss 
@highlight  0.26 contributes to the high absorption 99 attenuation dominated over reflection mechanism.
@highlight RGO and minimum amount of BaZrFe
@highlight nanofillers embedded polymer composite could be promising materials for RADAR applications.
