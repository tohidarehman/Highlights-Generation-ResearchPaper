 Mole fraction solubility of rebamipide in mixtures of propylene glycol water

@highlight Rebamipide solubility in four aqueous co solvent mixtures of alcohols was determined and correlated.
@highlight Solvent effect was studied in terms of solvent solvent and solute solvent interactions.
@highlight Preferential solvation of rebamipide in four mixtures were derived through IKBIs method.
