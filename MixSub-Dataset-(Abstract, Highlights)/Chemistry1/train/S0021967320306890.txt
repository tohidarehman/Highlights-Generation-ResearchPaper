 Innovations in extraction phases extraction modes and hyphenated instrument configurations are the most important issues to address for progress in the solid phase microextraction methodology . In this regard we have embarked on the development of a novel biocompatible 96 monolithic inorganic hollow fiber array as a new configuration for high throughput SPME on a 96 well plate system . An arrangement of highly ordered 96 titania Hydroxyapatite TiO

@highlight An innovative configuration was developed for high throughput SPME approach.
@highlight A new design inorganic HAP TiO
@highlight hollow fiber with PVA modification was introduced.
@highlight Doxorubicin quantification by SPME was reported for the first time in urine media.
@highlight Biocompatibility of sorbent offers multi target monitoring in biological matrices.
@highlight Better method validation data were obtained in comparison with related techniques.
