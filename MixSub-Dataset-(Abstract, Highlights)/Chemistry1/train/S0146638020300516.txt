 Stabilization of organic matter against decomposition and its de stabilization leading to mineralization are important processes in the control of greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration in soils . Soil organisms particularly earthworms may influence these processes greatly through their potential impacts on the interaction of OM with clay minerals which is a mechanism which may protect OM for medium to long time scales . The aim of this study was to use earthworms and pure minerals in order to investigate enhancement of carbon sequestration through the formation of aggregates containing particulate OM and organo mineral associations during a composting experiment . To this end we compared OM transformations in composting treatments with and without clay minerals and epigeic earthworms
