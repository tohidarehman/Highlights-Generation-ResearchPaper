 A comprehensive study on the chiral separation of bupivacaine mepivacaine prilocaine and propanocaine with eight commercial polysaccharide based chiral stationary phases in reversed phase conditions compatible with MS detection is performed . Methanol and acetonitrile are used as organic modifiers . Retention and resolution values obtained for each compound in the different CSPs and mobile phases are compared . The polysaccharide based CSPs tested present different enantioselectivity towards the analytes . From the results the experimental conditions for determining the enantiomers of bupivacaine mepivacaine prilocaine and propanocaine in saline aqueous samples using MS detection are used for the first time to perform an enantioselective biodegradability study .
