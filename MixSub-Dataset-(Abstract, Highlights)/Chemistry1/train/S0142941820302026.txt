 Composites of wood waste and high density polyethylene resins and different melt flow index was development in this work . Therefore it was possible to assess their effect on the mechanical thermal and morphologic properties of these composites . The formulations were prepared using a twin screw extruder and the MFI tensile strength flexural strength and impact strength of the composites were analyzed . Additionally the thermal properties were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry . Finally structural analyses using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were performed to assess the particles dispersion distribution and adhesion to the polymer matrix . The results indicated that composites from HDPE resins with a lower MFI yielded a better dispersion of the wood waste . During processing was observed reduce the MFI and better dispersion of the polymer matrix which positively influenced some of the mechanical properties analyzed in the study .

@highlight HDPE composites with lower MFI have better processing conditions for dispersion in the extrusion timber.
@highlight Lower MFI of HDPE in wood composites provides greater dispersion and better interaction between the phases.
@highlight The variation in MFI HDPE to obtain composite does not influence the distribution of the wood matrix.
@highlight Better wood dispersion in HDPE results in better tensile and flexural properties for extruded composites.
@highlight The thermal properties and crystallinity of HDPE wood are not influenced by MFI.
