 Solvent Front Position Extraction procedure has been recently introduced as a novel concept for multi component sample preparation . According to the procedure thin layer chromatography is used to separate the compounds of interest from matrix components and to focus them into a common zone from which the compounds are extracted and transferred to apparatus for instrumental analysis . In the paper we investigate different adsorbent types of the chromatographic plates and various mobile phases including pH of their buffers in respect of optimization conditions of the SFPE procedure . The research was carried out using a test sample containing 9 compounds characterised by different chemical properties hence the conclusions from the obtained results can be applied to other multi component samples . Under the optimal conditions all target compounds are separated from other compounds and evenly distributed along a narrow strip which is advantageous for their quantitation . The determination results are good the percentage values of relative error and relative standard deviation do not exceed 6 .

@highlight TLC is applied to sample preparation for quantitation with instrumental technique.
@highlight Optimisation of the procedure conditions of the sample preparation is shown.
@highlight Nine components of various properties can be quantified with the procedure.
@highlight The final sample is cleaned from matrix components.
