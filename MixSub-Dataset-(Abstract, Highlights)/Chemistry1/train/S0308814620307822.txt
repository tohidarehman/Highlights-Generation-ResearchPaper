 The influence of the timing of inoculation malolactic fermentation on the chemical and sensory properties of red wines was studied . The impact of the encapsulation of

@highlight Simultaneous AF MLF using free and encapsulated LAB reduced the fermentation time.
@highlight Timing of inoculation modified wine volatile amino acid and biogenic amine content.
@highlight Only the volatile and amino acid profile of the wine was modified by the type of inoculum.
@highlight Sensory analysis did not detect significantly differences among wines.
@highlight Wines elaborated with encapsulated LAB and lysozyme completed MLF.
