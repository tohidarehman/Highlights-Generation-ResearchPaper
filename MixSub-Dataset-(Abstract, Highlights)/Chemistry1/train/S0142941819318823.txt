 The main objective of our research was development of a modified poly glutamic acid films by polylysine at different PL content as a microbioreactor to growth and protect Gamma aminobutyric acid producing bacteria . The addition of PL groups between the PG backbones was completely corroborated using FTIR analysis . Scanning electron micrographs confirmed the high changes in the microstructure of PG films by PL . Density thickness moisture content L b WI opacity and elongation at break were increased with increasing the PL content . Whereas E and tensile strength were decreased simultaneously . The change of water vapor permeability and a value of PG PL were independent from PL content . The PG PL films were active packaging material against food borne pathogens i.e .
