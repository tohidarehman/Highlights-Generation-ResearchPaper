 In this study a clean up approach using a two dimensional liquid chromatography consisting of a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography column and a reversed phase column was investigated . A fully automated 2D LC system was used and compared with a traditional quick easy cheap effective rugged and safe liquid chromatography method .

@highlight Two dimensional liquid chromatography was compared to a traditional QuEChERS method.
@highlight Both methods were compared based on a validation protocol with positive detects.
@highlight Clean up and matrix separation were evaluated with multivariate data analysis.
@highlight Two dimensional liquid chromatography was proven in European Proficiency Tests.
