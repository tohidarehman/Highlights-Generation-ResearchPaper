 A high performance liquid chromatography method equipped with a boron doped diamond electrode was established for the simultaneous determination of phenol 4 ethylphenol guaiacol 4 ethylguaiacol 4 vinylguaiacol eugenol and

@highlight Efficient reversed phase separation and sensitive detection of 9 key flavoring phenolic compounds including guaiacol and phenol in whiskey using a core shell column with ECD at a BDD electrode.
@highlight The BDD electrode with anti fouling properties and extended potential windows provided excellent detection sensitivity and selectivity.
@highlight Popular Islay whiskey had significantly higher levels of flavorings compared to Irish Scotch and Highland whiskeys.
@highlight The method can be extended to other polyphenols serving as markers to differentiate authentic whiskeys from their counterfeits.
