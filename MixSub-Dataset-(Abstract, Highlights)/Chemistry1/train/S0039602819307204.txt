 In this contribution we provide a view on the role of halide interlayers in the self assembly of layers of organic molecules at metal electrolyte interfaces with molecular resolution . In particular the ordering of tetra porphyrin molecules in cationic form abbreviated as H

@highlight Direct correlation of voltametric and in situ STM data.
@highlight Direct correlation of porphyrin over and substrate underlayer lattices.
@highlight Dynamic STM observation of structural transitions.
@highlight Elucidation of all electrostatic structure determining factors.
