 Polyacrylonitrile cellulose composite fibers have been produced by dry jet gel spinning through their co solution . The rheological properties of PAN cellulose dimethylacetamide LiCl solutions containing different cellulose contents from 0 to 10wt were characterized and 5wt PAN cellulose composite solution shows the best solution homogeneity . During gel spinning the cellulose forms elongated particles inside the gelation bath and the particle diameters depend on the as spun draw ratio . It was found that the glass transition of PAN fibers shifts to higher temperatures along with the increase of cellulose content and the glass transition activation energy of PAN chains becomes higher when cellulose particles become smaller . Regardless the changes of cellulose amount and particle diameter the cyclization activation energy of PAN cellulose composite fibers is 1317 lower than that of neat PAN fibers . Our experiments suggest that the addition of cellulose in PAN fibers has no direct effect on the cyclization reaction of PAN chains . Instead the released by products during the pyrolysis of cellulose at high temperature degradation affect the cyclization reaction of PAN chains .

@highlight Polyacrylonitrile PAN cellulose composite fibers were produced by dry jet gel spinning.
@highlight The addition of cellulose leads to 1317 decrease of the cyclization activation energy of PAN chains.
@highlight The PAN cyclization is affected by the pyrolysis by products of cellulose.
@highlight The cellulose contents and diameters do not affect the PAN cyclization reaction.
