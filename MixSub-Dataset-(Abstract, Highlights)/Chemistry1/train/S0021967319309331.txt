 Over the past decade significant progress has been found in the upstream production processes shifting the main bottlenecks in current manufacturing platforms for biopharmaceuticals towards the downstream processing . Challenges in the purification process include reducing the production costs developing robust and efficient purification processes as well as integrating both upstream and downstream processes . Microfluidic technologies have recently emerged as effective tools for expediting bioprocess design in a cost effective manner since a large number of variables can be evaluated in a small time frame using reduced volumes and manpower . Their modularity also allows to integrate different unit operations into a single chip and consequently to evaluate the effect of each stage on the overall process efficiency .
