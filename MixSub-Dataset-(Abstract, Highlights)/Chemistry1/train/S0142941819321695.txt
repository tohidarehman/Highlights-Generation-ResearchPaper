 3D printing technologies permits to produce functional parts with complex geometries optimized topologies or enhanced internal structures . The relationship between mechanical performance and manufacturing parameters should be exhaustively analyzed to warrant the long term success of printed products . In this work the mechanical performance of filaments based on acrylonitrile butadiene styrene polylactic acid and polylactic acid polyhydroxyalkanoate was investigated and also compared with their corresponding 3D printed samples . In general the specimen dimensional deviations were found to be within the tolerances defined by the standard testing protocols . Density values revealed a high level of filament fusion promoting a nearly solid internal structure . The filaments exhibited improved tensile performance with respect to their corresponding printed samples . Tensile and bending performance looked quite independent of the raster angle . Izod impact behavior was increased for ABS systems printed with the 45 raster orientation . Quasi static fracture tests displayed improved crack initiation resistance with the 0 90 raster angle . The crack propagation observed for the 45 specimens through the bonding of the inter layers suggests weak entanglements .
