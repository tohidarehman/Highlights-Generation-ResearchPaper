 Efficient and economical separation and enrichment of high content class compounds from complex natural plants are of great importance . This study describes a novel continuous chromatography system with multi zone and multi column dynamic tandem techniques for the efficient and economical separation and enrichment of high content class compounds from natural products . The CCS was split into eight zones via a multi channel logic control valve to continuously and automatically separate and enrich class compounds from complex natural plants . CCS separation conditions were optimized by static and dynamic adsorption and desorption experiments . With the CCS system 120.82 kg of

@highlight A novel CCS with multi zone and multi column dynamic tandem isolation was developed.
@highlight 120.82 kg of
@highlight saponins with high content was successfully isolated by the CCS.
@highlight The separation time of 1.0 t of
@highlight was only 33.3 hours.
@highlight The usage of the mobile phase was only 1 3 1 2 of that of traditional macroporous resin.
