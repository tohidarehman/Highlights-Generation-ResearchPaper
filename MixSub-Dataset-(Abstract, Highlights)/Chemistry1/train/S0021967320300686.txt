 In this study three batches of nano titania functionalized covalent organic frameworks were acquired depending on different solvothermal reaction stages which were named as single roll up shaped nano titania functionalized COFs double roll up shaped nano titania functionalized COFs and clover shaped nano titania functionalized covalent organic framework respectively . After comparing their extraction performances the more efficient and stable CSTF COFs were selected as sorbent for the dispersive solid phase extraction of eight target N nitrosamines in drinking water followed by the determination with liquid chromatography tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry . Owing to the introduction of hydroxy groups CSTF COFs showed high extraction efficiency for N nitrosamines with a wide range of polarities through hydrogen bonding interaction hydrophobic interaction and hydrophilic interaction . Under optimum conditions the developed method provided relatively low limits of detection and satisfactory recoveries with relative standard deviations less than 8.3 . Therefore with the assistance of CSTF COFs trace levels of N nitrosamines were quantitatively and sensitively determined in 31 out of 460 bottled drinking water samples in a sensitive and convenient way .

@highlight Nano titania functionalized COFs were synthesized with ultrasound assistance solvothermal reaction.
@highlight Eight N nitrosamines in drinking water were extracted by dSPE with CSTF COFs as sorbent.
@highlight CSTF COFs could extract N nitrosamines with a wide range of polarities from drinking water.
@highlight The dSPE method combined with LCMS MS was applied to the analysis of eight N nitrosamines ng L in drinking water samples.
