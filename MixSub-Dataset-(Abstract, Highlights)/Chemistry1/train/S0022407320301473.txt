 In this work we revise the model describing laser heating of a spherical metallic nanoparticle immersed in transparent oil . We study the generated temperature non uniformity of the ambient medium and its effect on the propagation of the laser beam . Thus the model describes the influence of thermal non uniformity on scattering and absorption of light by the heated particle . Recently different aspects of the heating of NPs by a laser beam have been actively researched . Some experimental works demonstrated an enigmatic dependence of the effective scattering cross section of the heated particle on the intensity of the laser beam illuminating it . The authors of these works labeled the observed effects as saturation and reverse saturation . In this paper we show that the propagation of the incident laser beam in a non uniform oil can by itself be the source of both saturation and reverse saturation els effects .
