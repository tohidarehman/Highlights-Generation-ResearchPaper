 Multi stimulus response materials are a kind of materials in the branch of intelligent materials which provide diversified possibilities for the application of materials . A new series of thermal and water dual induced shape memory composites were designed and prepared by simple melt blending method in this manuscript . These dual shape memory composites were mainly composed of two components natural Eucommia ulmoides rubber and polyethylene oxide . The shape memory behavior of the composites was investigated under three stimulation conditions heat water and both heat and water . We studied the mechanism of heat and water triggered the shape memory properties by considering the mechanical properties water contact angle water uptake thermal properties and other properties of the composites . We also proposed two schematic diagrams to explain the thermal and water dual induced shape memory processes of composites . Overall all these EUR PEO composites displayed both excellent mechanical properties and water heat double stimulus shape memory properties which might provide a new way for the industrial production of smart shape memory materials .
