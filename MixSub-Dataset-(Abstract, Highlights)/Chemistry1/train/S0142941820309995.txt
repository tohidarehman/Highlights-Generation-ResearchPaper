 We present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of thermal properties of cycloaliphatic epoxy networks . The networks are prepared from 3 4 epoxycyclohexylmethyl 3 4 epoxycyclohexanecarboxylate ERL 4221 as a monomer and 4 methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride as a curing agent and their glass transition temperature

@highlight The epoxy networks based on 3 4 epoxycyclohexylmethyl 3 4 epoxycyclohexanecarboxylate were prepared.
@highlight The
@highlight of cycloaliphatic epoxy networks was estimated to reach 233238C.
@highlight The effect of network structure on
@highlight was simulated by anharmonic oscillators method.
@highlight Further increase of
@highlight is restricted by intramolecular cyclic structures formation.
@highlight Mass spectrometry confirmed the formation of cyclic structures at curing.
