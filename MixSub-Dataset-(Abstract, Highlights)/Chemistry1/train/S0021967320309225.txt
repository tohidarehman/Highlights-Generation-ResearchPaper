 Novel anion exchangers with mono and dialkanolamines in the external part of covalently bonded hyperbranched functional layer were synthesized . Comparison of the chromatographic properties of the prepared stationary phases in suppressed ion chromatography mode using hydroxide eluent allowed us to evaluate the effect of the number of substituents at nitrogen atom in alkanolamine on selectivity of anion exchangers toward organic acids . Obtained anion exchangers were also examined together with previously described hyperbranched stationary phases with different mono and diamines in the external part of the layer for evaluating the influence of various parameters on their selectivity . Effects of hydrophilicity functionality of amine and the number of substituents at nitrogen atom of amine used in the last modification cycle were established independently from each other which provided the possibility to tailor selectivity toward organic acids when preparing anion exchanger for solving particular analytical task . Predominance of hydrophilicity as a key factor affecting the separation of weakly retained organic acids over other studied parameters was demonstrated .
