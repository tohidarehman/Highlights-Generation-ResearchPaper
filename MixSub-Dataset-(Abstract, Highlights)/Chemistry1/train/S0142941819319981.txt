 In packaging plastic films are very often applied as overprinting materials . The printing properties of plastic films depend on the value of the surface free energy . Usually during storage but before printing the surface free energy is decreasing as a result of ageing . The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of elevated temperature and UV radiation on ageing properties and variation of the free surface energy for three commercially available plastic films polyethylene polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate . The investigation was done experimentally and the surface free energy was calculated using two approaches Owens Wendt and van Oss Chaudhury Good . The time change of polar fractions was also analysed . The calculation results were compared and it was concluded that UV radiation causes more changes in surface free energy than elevated temperature . In some cases surface free energy values calculated with the applied methods show similar trends .

@highlight Changes of surface free energy SFE and its components during ageing was analysed.
@highlight The influence of elevated temperature and UV radiation on SFE was examine.
@highlight SFE was calculated according to Owens Wends and van Oss Chaudhury Good approach.
@highlight UV radiation causes more changes in SFE than elevated temperature.
@highlight SFE values calculated with the applied methods show similar trends.
