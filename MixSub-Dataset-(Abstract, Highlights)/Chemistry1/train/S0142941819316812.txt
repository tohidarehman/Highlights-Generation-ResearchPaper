 Renewable propane 1 2 3 triyl tris nonanoate and a tricarboxylic acid triglyceride hardener were synthesized from 10 undecenoic acid and used to produce epoxy resins with 5292wt biobased carbon . CGTU was prepared by thermally activated thiol ene coupling of thioglycolic acid onto propane 1 2 3 triyl tris in the absence of solvent . The characterized CGTU was used as a green hardener of blends based on EGU and a conventional bisphenol A based epoxy pre polymer at various mass percentages with an stoichiometric epoxy acid equivalent ratio . Calorimetric studies revealed higher peak temperature lower reaction heats and longer gelation times in resins with high EGU proportion evidencing the lower reactivity of aliphatic EGU compared with aromatic DGEBA . Cured resins were yellowish transparent rubber like materials with glass transition temperatures varying from 14C to 42C and tensile strength in the range of 1750kPa790kPa for 0 and 100wt EGU respectively . The soluble fraction of all resins was less than 4.3 reflecting a high level of crosslinking . Thermosets with high biobased content showed both UV light protection and visible light transparency .

@highlight Biobased epoxy precursor EGU and tricarboxylic acid hardener were synthesized from renewable 10 undecenoic acid.
@highlight Curing behavior of EGU DGEBA blends and stoichiometric amounts of biogenic hardener was explored.
@highlight Thermal mechanical and optical properties of the produced resins were studied.
@highlight Resins have tunable UV and visible light protection.
