 Silicone rubber has excellent heat resistance but poor high temperature friction stability which limits its application in the field of high temperature sealing . Polytetrafluoroethylene is self lubricating but its compatibility with rubber is relatively weak . In order to improve the high temperature friction property of silicone rubber fluorosilicone rubber was used as a compatibilizer and PTFE was added to MVQ by mechanical blending . The friction and wear properties of PTFE FVMQ MVQ composites at different temperatures were studied . The results show that compared with MVQ the mechanical properties of PTFE FVMQ MVQ composites was basically unchanged the coefficient of friction was hardly affected by temperature and the amount of wear decreased with increasing temperature . PTFE FVMQ MVQ composites showed excellent high temperature abrasion resistance . The high temperature wear mode was mainly changed from abrasive wear to adhesive wear . The molten layer formed by high temperature friction can prevent air from directly contacting the surface rubber which inhibited rubber surface oxidation reaction process .
