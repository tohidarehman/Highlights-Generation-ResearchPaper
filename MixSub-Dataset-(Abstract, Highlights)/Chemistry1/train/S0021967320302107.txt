 In the present study a fast multiresidue method determining three novel fungicides fenpicoxamid isofetamid and mandestrobin in cereals was developed and validated for the first time using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry . Samples were extracted by QuEChERS methodology and cleaned up using the disposable pipette extraction tips containing primary secondary amine and silica gel modified with zirconium oxide in less than 1min . Linearity

@highlight Determination of novel fungicides fenpicoxamid isofetamid and mandestrobin in cereals for the first time.
@highlight First analytical report on fenpicoxamid and mandestrobin.
@highlight Sample clean up by disposable pipette extraction DPX tips took less than a minute.
@highlight DPX tips containing PSA and Z Sep removed the most co extractives and provided good analyte recoveries.
