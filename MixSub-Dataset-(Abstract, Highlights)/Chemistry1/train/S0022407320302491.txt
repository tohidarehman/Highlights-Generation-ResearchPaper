 We present exact solutions to the Lippmann Schwinger equation for the scattering of a plane wave by an oblate spheroidal barrier modeled as a boundary wall with coupling strength

@highlight We analytically solve the Lippmann Schwinger equation for an spheroidal barrier 
@highlight We find solutions for different potentials strengths.
@highlight The resonance condition is related to the zeros of a radial spheroidal function.
@highlight We generalize our result for the scattering by N spheroidal barriers.
