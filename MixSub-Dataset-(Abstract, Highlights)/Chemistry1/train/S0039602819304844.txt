 The 2D hexagonal structure of tin atoms which is termed stanene is structurally determined on a Cu substrate using low energy electron diffraction . The structural analysis of Cu 111 p Sn at a coverage of 0.5 at low temperature reveals the relaxation of underlying Cu atoms which stabilizes the formation of almost zero buckled Sn atoms forming a honeycomb structure . Our results using quantitative LEED conclusively reveals an ultra flat stanene structure that complements well with the previous calculations . The detailed structural analysis presented in this article is expected to give in depth information for characterizing the properties of as grown stanene .

@highlight Quantitative low energy electron diffraction is used to determine the structure of Sn adsorption on Cu 111 at low temperature.
@highlight The determined model is found to have Sn atoms arranged in hexagonal honeycomb structure forming stanene with zero buckling between them.
@highlight We determined the relaxation and role of the underlying subsurface Cu atoms in stabilizing the ultra flat structure of stanene.
