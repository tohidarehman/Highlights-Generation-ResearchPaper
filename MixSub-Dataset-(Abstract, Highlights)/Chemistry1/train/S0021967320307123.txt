 In recent years mussel inspired polydopamine based materials have been widely used as stationary phases for open tubular capillary electrochromatography because of their various excellent properties . Nevertheless the traditional synthesis routes of functionalized PDA based capillary columns usually are time consuming and limited in aqueous solutions . Herein we report a facile and rapid route to prepare octadecylamine functionalized PDA coated OT CEC columns in organic solvents via a novel one step in situ solvothermal assisted coating strategy . Through this developed solvothermal assisted approach the growth rate of ODA PDA coating was significantly speeded up and their hybrid coating process on the capillary inner surface could be rapidly completed in 60min . The successful preparation of the solvothermal assisted ODA PDA hybrid coating were systematically characterized and confirmed by several methods . The influence of the preparation parameters on the formation of hybrid coating and the separation ability of the ODA PDA modified columns were systematically explored . Consequently the high efficiency baseline separation of four kinds of neutral acidic and basic analytes were achieved based on the ODA PDA modified columns . The repeatability of the solvothermal assisted ODA PDA coated column was also studied and the relative standard deviations for intra day inter day and column to column were all less than 5 . Additionally the solvothermal assisted ODA PDA modified column exhibited good stability and long lifetime .

@highlight A novel solvothermal assisted coating method for CEC stationary phase was presented.
@highlight The strategy greatly improve the preparation efficiency of PDA based CEC columns.
@highlight More stationary phases are expected to be readily prepared via the universal method.
