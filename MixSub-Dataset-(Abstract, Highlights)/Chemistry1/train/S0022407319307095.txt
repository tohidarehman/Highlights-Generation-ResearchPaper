 A detail ab initio study on the low lying states of ZnI is carried out by means of the multireference configuration interaction plus Davidson correction method . The spin orbit coupling effect of the low lying states is considered by utilizing relativistic effective core potential spin orbit operator . The potential energy curves are provided in the absence of SOC and presence of SOC . The spectroscopic constants of bound states are calculated which are in good agreement with the existing experimental results . With the help of the calculated SOC matrix elements the predissociation mechanism of 2
