 During a screening of cyclodextrins as chiral selectors for the separation of daclatasvir and its enantiomer by capillary electrophoresis an unusual phenomenon for CDs was observed that is two peaks with a plateau in between using CD as chiral selector . The same result was encountered when enantiopure DCV was injected or when analyzing a sample containing enantiopure DCV and CD in a CD free background electrolyte . Peak coalescence was observed at 45C and at a pH above 3.5 . Two peaks with a plateau were also observed for DCV stereoisomers as well as a structural analog . However only a single peak was detected if one or both amino acid moieties of DCV were lacking . Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments including Nuclear Overhauser effect based methods showed that in solution DCV adopted a folded conformation in which the isopropyl side chain of the valine residues pointed toward the aromatic rings of DCV . Moreover NMR unequivocally demonstrated the simultaneous formation of DCV CD inclusion complexes with 1 1 and 2 1 stoichiometry which was corroborated by mass spectrometry . In both complexes DCV also adopted a folded structure . The RSSR diastereomer of DCV as well as an analog lacking one of the amino acid moieties also formed 1 1 and 2 1 complexes with CD although a plateau was only observed in the case of the RSSR diastereomer . As shown by CE MS both DCV CD complexes surprisingly comigrated as the first peak while the second migrating peak represents non complexed DCV .
