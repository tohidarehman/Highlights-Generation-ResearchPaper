 Quantitative structure retention relationships analysis was applied to investigate the molecular retention mechanism of proteinogenic and non proteinogenic amino acids on the amino acid and peptide silica stationary phases . Twelve stationary phases with chemically bonded amino acids of different types glycine alanine phenylalanine leucine methionine aspartic acid and

@highlight The amino acids retention mechanism on the amino acid based packings was investigated.
@highlight The QSRR was performed on materials differing in type length of amino acid sequence.
@highlight Analysis showed that electrostatic interactions are prominent in retention process.
@highlight Formation of hydrogen bonds is characteristic feature for peptide based columns.
@highlight The derived QSRR models revealed good prediction potency for test set of analytes.
