 Physics based forward models are the basis on which many experimental diagnostics are interpreted . For some diagnostics models can be computationally expensive which precludes their use in real time analysis . Reduced models have the potential to capture sufficient physics thereby enabling the desired real time analysis . Using statistical inference and machine learning techniques the application of reduced models for inversion of atomic spectral data used to diagnose magnetic fields in a plasma will be examined . Two approaches are considered a reduction of the forward model where traditional inversion can be performed on the proxy model and a reduction of the direct inverse where parameters are a function of measured signal . The resulting inversion is sufficiently fast to be utilized in an online context for digital twinning and ultimately real time prediction design and control of plasma systems such as tokamaks . These methods will be demonstrated on both simulated and experimentally measured data .

@highlight Machine learning finds a model when no physics based model exists.
@highlight Using ML methods reduced forward and direct inverse models can be obtained.
@highlight Models trained using idealized data predict well when applied to experiment.
