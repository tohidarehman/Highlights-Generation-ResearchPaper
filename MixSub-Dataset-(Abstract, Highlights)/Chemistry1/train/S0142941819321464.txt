 The production of exfoliated polymer clay based nanocomposites is crucial to obtain an actual benefit of nanoscale reinforcement in the polymer matrix . In this project the production of exfoliated polymer clay nanocomposite was aimed through the use of poly ethylene

@highlight Pre swelled technique to obtain exfoliated O MMT nanofiller for EVA nanocomposite.
@highlight Pre swelled O MMT enhanced tensile and fatigue properties of the EVA.
@highlight Pre swelling allows the use of high O MMT loading in the EVA nanocomposite system.
@highlight Pre swelled O MMT enhanced thermomechanical properties of the EVA copolymer.
@highlight Pre swelling using water is a simple economic and safe method for exfoliating O MMT.
