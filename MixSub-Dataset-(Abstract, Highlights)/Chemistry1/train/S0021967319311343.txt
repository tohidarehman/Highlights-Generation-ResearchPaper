 An update for ASTM D2425 Standard Test Method for Hydrocarbon Types in Middle Distillates by Mass Spectrometry was recently released to expand its scope by adding modern mass spectrometric instrumentation and a new sample type synthesized hydrocarbons . While the method update is a proper step towards modernization it still lacks validation parameters . The description of the updated standard method contains precision estimations but no consideration for a possible bias meaning that the method accuracy was not evaluated . The 2019 update does not either provide the lowest concentration of an analyte that can be detected and quantitatively determined limit of detection and limit of quantification . In the present study the LOD LOQ and bias were evaluated as an intra laboratory study . The LOD and LOQ determination was based on the adjusted standard deviation of the least abundant hydrocarbon type in a sample and were 0.004 and 0.01w w in renewable jet fuel and 0.01 and 0.02w w in gas oil respectively . The bias was determined by measuring relative hydrocarbon recovery percentages for spiked samples . The renewable jet fuel was spiked with cycloparaffins and alkylbenzenes and the recovery percentages were 140 and 63 respectively . The gas oil was spiked with paraffins and alkylbenzenes and the recovery percentages were 117 and 90 respectively . Both sample sets were positively biased for paraffin content and negatively biased for alkylbenzene content . Based on above results this method may not work well for RJF samples .

@highlight The LOD was 0.004wt and the LOQ was 0.001wt for renewable jet fuel.
@highlight The LOD was 0.01wt and the LOQ was 0.02wt for gas oil.
@highlight Both sample sets were positively biased for paraffin content.
@highlight Both sample sets were negatively biased for alkylbenzene content.
@highlight The ASTM D2425 method may not work well for renewable jet fuel samples.
