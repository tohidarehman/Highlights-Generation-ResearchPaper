 A carbazolic conjugated microporous polymer was successfully synthesized through Scholl reaction of carbazole with 1 3 5 triphenylbenzene . The CZ CMP was characterized by FT IR spectrum X ray diffraction nitrogen sorption isotherms and scanning electron microscopy . The characterization results showed that the CZ CMP had a spherical structure with high surface area and good microporosity . Its adsorption performance was investigated by applying it as an adsorbent for the solid phase extraction of phenyl urea herbicides from tea drinks samples prior to high performance liquid chromatographic detection . The CZ CMP displayed high extraction efficiency for the PUHs and the primary factors affecting the SPE efficiency including the type and volume of the eluent sample solution pH sample loading rate and sample volume were optimized . Under the optimized conditions a good linear response for the analytes was observed in the range of 0.1080.0ng mL

@highlight A porous organic polymer was synthesized for the first time by scholl reaction.
@highlight It is an effective SPE adsorbent for the extraction of phenyl urea herbicides.
@highlight It had a good stability and reusability.
