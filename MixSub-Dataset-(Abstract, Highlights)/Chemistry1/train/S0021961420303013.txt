 Experimental data and modelling of electrolyte solutions are important in different fields . Separation and purification of such materials depend on knowledge of solid liquid equilibrium as well as the mathematical models allow the development of solution theories and process simulators . Therefore the current work presents the study of NaCl KCl and NH

@highlight Solubility of NaCl KCl and NH
@highlight Cl in mixtures of water and methanol was determined.
@highlight The experimental data was correlated by the modified Pitzer model.
