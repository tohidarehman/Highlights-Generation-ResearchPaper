 The behavior of isotactic syndiotactic and atactic polypropylene stereoisomers on porous graphitic carbon at different column temperatures is investigated with 1 decanol decalin and decane as the adsorption promoting solvents using gradient interaction chromatography . Column temperatures between 120180C are investigated for the three adsorption promoting solvents with 1 2 4 trichlorobenzene as the desorption promoting solvent . Owing to the different stereochemistry of the isomers their interaction with the atomic level flat surface of porous graphitic carbon is observed to be different when injected from the three different adsorption promoting solvents . Atactic and isotactic polypropylene are not separable when 1 decanol is used as the adsorption solvent but can be separated from syndiotactic PP at column temperatures of between 120 180C . The three stereoisomers have almost similar elution volumes when decalin is used as the adsorption promoting solvent between 120 170C . Decane allows for both adsorption and desorption of the stereoisomers at distinct peak elution volumes at the studied column temperatures of 120 160C . Furthermore it is shown that increasing the column temperature while maintaining other chromatographic conditions can either decrease or increase retention depending on the adsorption promoting solvent . More importantly retention is influenced by adsorption conditions which may affect macromolecular conformations upon injection onto the PGC stationary phase . This is the first study on PP stereoisomers highlighting this behaviour .

@highlight Retention of polypropylene stereoisomers on Hypercarb is dependent on tacticity adsorption promoting solvent and temperature.
@highlight Column temperature affects retention either negatively of positively depending on adsorption promoting solvent.
