 Shape memory polymers based on polynorbornene was prepared and modified by In situ reactive thermoplastic polyurethane . Analysis shows that the TPU formed in PNB matrix slightly decreases T

@highlight Small amount of TPU has obvious toughening and strengthening effects on PNB.
@highlight Adjust shape memory transition temperature close to room temperature.
@highlight Interpenetrating network is introduced through in situ reaction to improve shape memory performance reversible plastic fixation ratio is over 70 and recovery ratio is 100 .
