 The presence of pathogenic bacteria in water is one of the important health concerns in the world . Herein we report a new high performance environmentally friendly poly containing

@highlight Magnetic poly urethane imide including
@highlight  cyclodextrin moiety 
@highlight  CDPUIm was synthesized.
@highlight The synthesized polymers show high adsorption capacity for Gram positive and negative bacteria.
@highlight Magnetic
@highlight  CDPUIm can simply be separated from the water by a magnet.
@highlight The result showed that polymer attached to magnetic nanoparticles has more ability to remove bacteria.
@highlight A filter was made of
@highlight  CDPUIm MNPs and the real wastewater sample was filtered.
