 Detection of endogenous anabolic androgenic steroids misuse is a major challenge in doping control analysis . Currently a number of endogenous steroids which constitute the steroid profile are quantified using gas chromatography . With this methodology only the sum of the free and glucuronidated steroids is measured together . A dilute and shoot LC MS method which is compliant with the quality requirements for measuring EAAS established by the World Anti Doping Agency was developed and validated containing glucuronidated and sulfated steroids in order to gain some extra information and to expand the existing steroid profile . The developed method is to the best of our knowledge the first method to combine both steroid glucuronides and sulfates which is compliant with the quality standards of the technical document on EAAS established by WADA . The first advantage of this new steroid profile is the reduced sample preparation time as it is a direct injection method of diluted urine . A second advantage is the ability of the used gradient to separate 5 androstane 3 17 diol 3 glucuronide 5 androstane 3 17 diol 17 glucuronide 5 androstane 3 17 diol 3 glucuronide and 5 androstane 3 17 diol 17 glucuronide allowing to gain specific information on these isomers which can not be accomplished in GC MS screening due to hydrolysis . This steroid profile also contains free testosterone 5 androstane 3 17 dione and 5 androstane 3 17 dione as markers of degradation . In total 17 compounds and 10 isotopically labelled internal standards are included in this method .
