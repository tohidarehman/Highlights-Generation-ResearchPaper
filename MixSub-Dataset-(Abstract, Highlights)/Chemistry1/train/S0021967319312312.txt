 Royal Jelly constitutes one of the most popular beehive products and for this reason the use of inexpensive sweeteners during its production remains an important quality issue . In the present study we report results of metabolic profiling of RJ samples obtained after the application of artificial bee feeding using different feeding protocols . The hydrophilic content of RJ samples was assessed by applying UPLC MS MS . In total 96 crude RJ samples were analysed with the developed method . Multivariate statistical analysis revealed clear differentiation between the RJ samples obtained from control bees and samples obtained after feeding . In total 27 out of 57 detected molecules were statistically found to be significantly altered in the different comparisons . Among them some amino acids amino acid derivatives amines carbohydrates and vitamins were found as potential markers . The results of the study could be further used for the development of an LC MS based analytical tool for RJ quality control assessment .
