 Long chain alkyl diols in marine environments are useful indicators of source organisms ambient temperature upwelling and nutrient conditions . However the distribution of LCDs in the western Pacific marginal seas has been rarely reported where wide shallow continental shelves and huge freshwater input from many rivers occur . In this study we analyzed LCDs in surface sediments distributed from the Changjiang River estuary to the East China Sea shelf to evaluate their sources and associated environmental proxies . Our results showed that the fractional abundance of C

@highlight  15 indicates appreciable freshwater derived diols.
@highlight LDI proxy reflects the autumn SST in the East China Sea.
@highlight Nutrient indices based on 1 14 diols are not suitable in the study area.
