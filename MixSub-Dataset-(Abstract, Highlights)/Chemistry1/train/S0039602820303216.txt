 We use Density Functional Theory and Hubbard model based DFT U calculations to determine preferential adsorption sites and energies of single isolated Au Pt and Co atoms on planar SrTiO

@highlight Binding energies and diffusion barriers of Co Au Pt on SrTiO
@highlight calculated with DFT.
@highlight Diffusion is significantly faster on SrO terminations.
@highlight Au is highly mobile on both surfaces.
@highlight DFT calculations complemented by Hubbard model based DFT U.
