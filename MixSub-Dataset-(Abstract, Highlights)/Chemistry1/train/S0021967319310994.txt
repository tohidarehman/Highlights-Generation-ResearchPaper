 The objective of this paper was to extend comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigations at the molecular level to identify factors responsible for the high selectivity of imprinted sorbents . This knowledge was utilized in a new analytical strategy devoted to the analysis of hordenine in human urine after beer consumption . Among the various polymeric compositions tested the most effective material was built up from methacrylic acid and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate MIP

@highlight Highly selective imprinted sorbent for hordenine was constructed.
@highlight Selective response of material was proved theoretically and experimentally.
@highlight Characterization of material was provided.
@highlight Analytical strategy for determination of hordenine was validated.
@highlight Method was proved by analysis of hordenine in urine after beer consumption.
