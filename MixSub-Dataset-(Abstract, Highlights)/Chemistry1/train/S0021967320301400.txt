 A solid phase microextraction coupled with flash evaporation gas chromatography method was applied to the determination of phthalate esters . Polysulfone hollow fiber at 1cm length was employed as extraction element to adsorb PAEs directly . Predominant parameters including stirring velocity salt concentration extraction time and extraction temperature were optimized . PSF fiber with absorbed PAEs was put into a small sample cup . The extracted analytes were thermally desorbed at 300C in a pyrolyzer and then entered into a column for separation . The linearity of the method was satisfactory over a concentration range of 21000g L with the correlation coefficients
