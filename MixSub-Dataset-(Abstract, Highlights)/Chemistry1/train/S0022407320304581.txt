 Light pollution generated by the excessive use of artificial light at night is an environmental and ecological concern . Artificial light at night is diffused far from the sources for long distances by scattering in the atmosphere thus affecting the night sky and the biodiversity of rural and natural areas . The characterization of the level and variability of light pollution has become an important issue for several disciplines .

@highlight NSB in Tuscany ranged between 17.2 83 times brighter than the natural background and 21.5 mpsas during moonless night.
@highlight Seasonal NSB during moonless night presented a different pattern in wet and dry season at urban sites.
@highlight NSB was affected by monthly cycle of moonlight and its effect interacted with weather conditions.
@highlight Average night sky during precipitation events was approximately six times 2 mpsas than during dry days.
@highlight The presented analysis might be applied in ecological studies regarding light pollution effects on the environment.
