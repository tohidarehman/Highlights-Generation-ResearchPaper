 Basic principles are introduced for implementing discovery based analysis with automated quantification of data obtained using comprehensive three dimensional gas chromatography with flame ionization detection GC

@highlight Fisher ratio software is applied to comprehensive three dimensional gas chromatography data.
@highlight The third separation dimension replaces the mass spectrometric dimension in the data analysis.
@highlight A new signal ratio algorithm is introduced enabling automated relative analyte quantification.
@highlight The signal ratio output provides robust quantification with qualitative peak purity information.
