 This study introduces micrometric carbon strands as a suitable fiber for headspace solid phase microextraction . Compared to previous supports carbon fibers have mechanical flexibility wide thermal expansion and a large surface area which is an important factor in headspace solid phase microextraction . The electrophoretic technique was applied to modify the surface of stainless steel and carbon fibers with polypyrrole . Modified carbon fibers were used for extraction of 2 pentylfuran as a model analyte from patients breath and coffee samples . 2 PF belongs to the furan family which was suggested as a biomarker for

@highlight Micrometric carbon fibers CFs was introduced as a support for HS SPME.
@highlight Electrophoretic technique was applied to modify surface of CFs with polypyrrole.
@highlight Separation and analysis of the analytes was performed by GCMS.
@highlight Effective parameters on extraction efficiency of 2 PF were studied and optimized.
@highlight was used for extraction of 2 penthylfuran from patients breath and coffee.
