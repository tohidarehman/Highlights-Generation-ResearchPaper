 An ionic liquid hybrid zwitterionic polymer capillary microextraction column was prepared for the biomimetic enrichment of glycopeptides by one step copolymerization of 2 methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine and 1 butyl 3 vinylimidazolium bromide in the presence of crosslinker trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate . The resultant monolith was characterized by scanning electron microscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and pore size distribution measurement . Due to the incorporation of zwitterionic MPC owning a unique biomimic structure the monolithic column has large pore size and good biocompatibility exhibiting high extraction efficiency permeability and fast mass transfer to targets . Besides the use of ionic liquids as co monomer in the polymerization endows the monolith with enhanced mechanical stability uniformity and multiple interactions . The prepared column was successfully applied in CME coupled to capillary electrochromatography for the efficient enrichment and separation of glycopeptide antibiotics in foodstuff . The method demonstrated a wide linear range 50.018000.0 g L
