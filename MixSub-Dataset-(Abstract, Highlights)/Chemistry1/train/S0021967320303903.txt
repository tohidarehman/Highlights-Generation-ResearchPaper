 Antioxidants play an essential role in human health as they have been found to be capable of lowering the incidence of many diseases such as cancer and angiocardiopathy . Currently more attention is paid to natural antioxidants because of the possible insecurity of synthetic antioxidants . Thus the development of efficient techniques or methods to separate antioxidants from natural sources is requested urgently . High speed counter current chromatography is a unique support free liquid liquid chromatographic technique and has been widely applied in the field of separation of natural products . In this review we summarize and analyze the related researches on the application of HSCCC in the separation of various natural antioxidants so far . The purpose of the article is to provide a certain theoretical support for the separation of natural antioxidants by HSCCC and to make full use of advantages of HSCCC in the separation of bioactive components . In particular some key problems associated with the separation strategies the structural categories of natural antioxidants solvent system choices and the application of different elution modes in HSCCC separation are summarized and commented . We expect that the content reviewed can offer more evidence for the development of the field of natural antioxidants separation so as to achieve large scale preparation of natural antioxidants .
