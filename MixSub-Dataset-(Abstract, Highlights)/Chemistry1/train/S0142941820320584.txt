 Amphiphilic alkyl peptides as novel biomaterials form 3D scaffolds that are applicable in tissue engineering . Here the nanofibre formation capability of a distinct alkyl peptide was investigated using coarse grained molecular dynamics simulation and experimental methods . The alkyl peptide was functionalized with a peptide epitope which can help to maintenance and differentiation of neural stem cells . Two alkyl peptide systems were investigated the all functionalized system and the distributed system . The CGMD and TEM results confirm elongated nanofibres for all functionalized system and cylindrical nanofibres for the distributed one . Furthermore PC12cells show a reliable growth on both 2D alkyl peptides coated surfaces . Because of the nanofibres negative surface charges the cell morphologies show clustered form in the distributed system and rounded shape in the all functionalized one . Since the stem cell state preserves in cluster form the physicochemical property of these nanofibres allows a potential advantage in stem cell long time maintains .

@highlight Experimental and computational studies convinced the same finding for nanofiber formation from alkyl peptide self assembly.
@highlight Two predefined alkyl peptide systems obtained two distinct types of nanofiber but had nearly the same stability.
@highlight Physicochemical properties of biomaterials had a crucial impact on the cells attachment and morphologies.
@highlight Mild negative surface charge of formatted nanofibers offers the potential to preserve stem cell state.
