 Capillary electrophoresis tandem mass spectrometry is an interesting tool for proteomic analysis as the separation principle is orthogonal to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry . The combination of both techniques can bring complementary information to enlarge proteome coverage .

@highlight Two sample preconcentration approaches were optimized to improve sensitivity.
@highlight DPJ provided better results than t ITP in terms of peak width and peak height.
@highlight Triple tube and EMASS interfaces for CEMS were compared.
@highlight The number of identified peptides and proteins was compared using both interfaces.
