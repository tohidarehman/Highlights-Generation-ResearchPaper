 The dual focus property of focused circularly polarized ring Airy beam under the action of tightly focused lens is demonstrated in this paper . The radiation forces at two foci of tightly focused RAB are calculated the numerical results show that the particle could be longitudinally and transversely trapped at the two foci . By varying corresponding parameters we could control the property of two traps . The trapping force increases with NA and the scaling parameter

@highlight Dual focus property of ring Airy beams RAB is demonstrated under the action of high NA lens.
@highlight The particle could be trapped at the two foci of RAB and the radiation forces are investigated.
@highlight The modulation methods with different corresponding parameters for the dual optical trap created by RAB are proposed.
