 Marine byproducts have become popular research themes due to their biological significance . The black sharkskin protein hydrolysate based antioxidant peptides were firstly investigated in this study . The black sharkskin derived novel antioxidant peptide demonstrating 81.05 free radical scavenging activity to ABTS at 500g mL was identified to be Ala Thr Val Tyr . The crucially antioxidant interaction site of ATVY action on ABTS was determined to be Tyr in the N terminal . ATVY reacted with ABTS to generate polyphenol derived adducts which subsequently degraded into a purple compound . The MS MS showed it was formed by covalently bonding through the phenol group of ATVY to the N group of ABTS . The free radical scavenging kinetics of ATVY on ABTS demonstrated a two phase reaction process . These findings reveal the action mechanism of ATVY on ABTS implying ATVY can be incorporated in the production of antioxidant food additives .

@highlight A novel peptide ATVY demonstrating high scavenging activity to ABTS was purified.
@highlight The crucial amino acid as key action site in ATVY was Tyr in N terminal.
@highlight The scavenging kinetics of ATVY on ABTS demonstrated a two phase reaction process.
@highlight ABTS
@highlight  Peptide was formed by covalently bonding through phenol group of ATVY to ABTS.
@highlight ATVY can be used as a natural agent in controlling food oxidation in food industry.
