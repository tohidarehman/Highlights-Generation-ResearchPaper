 In this article we report a new amorphous crystalline polymer blend system consisting of poly and poly polymers the membranes of which were fabricated using the solution blending route . A series of blend membranes at different ratios were prepared and systematically analysed for chemical interactions morphological changes and their physico chemical properties studied for use as proton exchange membrane . While FT IR spectroscopy established the hydrogen bonding interactions between NH of OPBI and phosphonate ester group of PAPE X ray diffraction studies revealed the development of crystallinity in the membrane matrix . Interestingly the gradual induction of crystallinity in an amorphous OPBI matrix was found to influence the properties of the blend membranes favourably . For instance the blend membrane containing 25wt PAPE in OPBI matrix displayed the maximum property enhancement in terms of storage modulus glass transition temperature T

@highlight PEM developed from blends of polybenzimidazole and poly aminophosphonate ester .
@highlight Amorphous crystalline content of the blends affects improves the PEM properties.
@highlight Blend composition plays a significant role in tuning the proton conduction of PEM.
