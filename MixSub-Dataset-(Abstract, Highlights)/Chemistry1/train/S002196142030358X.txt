 This contribution reported the equilibrium solubility of aprepitant in four binary aqueous mixtures of methanol ethanol acetone and 1 4 dioxane acquired through a shake flask method from 283.15K to 323.15K under local atmospheric pressure of 101.2kPa . At the same mass fraction compositions of methanol ethanol acetone 1 4 dioxane and temperature the mole fraction solubility of aprepitant was greater in mixture than in ethanol acetone methanol

@highlight Solubility of aprepitant form I in four aqueous mixtures was determined and correlated.
@highlight Preferential solvation of aprepitant form I were derived via IKBIs method applied to solubility.
@highlight Solvent effect on solubility variation was investigated through KAT LSER model.
