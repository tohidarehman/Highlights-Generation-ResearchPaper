 On spot fixed charge derivatization has been suggested for the modification of amino acids for their analysis by thin layer chromatography matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry . The approach was based on post chromatographic treatment of separated analytes by trismethenium salt and triethylamine . The reaction proceeded smoothly in mild conditions and gave rise to pink red colored derivatives containing permanent positive charge . Their MALDI mass spectra recorded directly from TLC plates revealed intense peaks corresponding to decarboxylated cationic parts . All derivatives are characterized by high ionization efficiency which indicates the high sensitivity of the developed method for analyzing amino acids . Applicability of the method to analysis of amino acids was demonstrated on artificial mixtures and dietary supplement .

@highlight Post chromatographic fixed charge derivatization was used to record MALDI mass spectra of amino acids from TLC plates.
@highlight Chemical labeling is based on reaction of amino acids with tris 2 6 dimethoxyphenyl methenium salt.
@highlight TLC MALDI mass spectra of derivatives contain intense peaks of their decarboxylated cationic parts.
