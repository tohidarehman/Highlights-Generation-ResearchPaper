 In this work a polymeric composite was prepared from ethylene propylene diene monomer and silicone rubber with additives of modified fumed silica titanium dioxide TiO

@highlight EPDM and silicone S rubbers composites were compounded
@highlight mechanical mixing.
@highlight The thermal stability of the EPDM and EPDM silicone rubber composites was increased.
@highlight The dielectric breakdown strength of the EPDM composites was increased by additives loading.
@highlight TGA FTIR analysis revealed the thermal degradation of the rubber composites.
@highlight Utilizing TiO2 MFS and graphene appeared to mitigate the destructiove incidents in HV insulating materials.
