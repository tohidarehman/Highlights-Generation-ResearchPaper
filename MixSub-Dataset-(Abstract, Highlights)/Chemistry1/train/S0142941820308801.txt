 In recent years shape memory polyurethane as a smart material has been used in various applications owing to its desirable shape memory effect and biocompatibility . In this study unidirectional SMPU nanofibers are innovated by electrospinning to clarify the mechanical and shape memory properties with nanofiber directions . The results showed that when the nanofiber alignment degree is 0 the aligned SMPU nanofibers achieved the obvious improvement of tensile strength and elastic modulus compared with the random SMPU nanofiber . Moreover the developed aligned nanofibers exhibited good ability against stress relaxation and creep under constant strain or constant stress conditions in cyclic loading . The aligned SMPU nanofibers with a 0 alignment degree exhibited excellent shape memory properties with shape recovery rates larger than 93 and shape fixity rates larger than 90 and a dramatic increase of shape recovery stress .
