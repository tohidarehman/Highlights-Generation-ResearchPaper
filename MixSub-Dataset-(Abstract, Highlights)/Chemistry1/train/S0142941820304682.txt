 An acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive was synthesized in ethyl acetate at about 80C by the use of 2 ethylhexyl acrylate ethyl acrylate methyl acrylate and acrylic acid at presence of thermal radical initiator AIBN . The synthesized acrylic PSA was crosslinked at relatively low temperatures at about 110125C using thermal crosslinkers selected from melamine formaldehyde resins and benzoguanamine resins . The crosslinking process runs between carboxylic groups of acrylic PSA and reactive groups from investigated amine resins . The choice of suitable thermal reactive crosslinkers has significant and relevant influence at presence of organic acid catalysts on main performance of crosslinked PSA such as tack peel adhesion and shear strength .

@highlight Melamine formaldehyde resins and benzoguanamine resins as the thermal crosslinkers.
@highlight Effect of thermal reactive crosslinkers on main performance of crosslinked PSA.
@highlight The stability thermal crosslinkable systems depends on the amino resin type the amount of the acid catalyst and the solid content of the solvent borne acrylic pressure sensitive adhesives.
@highlight Amino resin crosslinked PSA systems containing an acid catalyst are stable for several hours or several days.
@highlight The addition of isopropanol results in aprolonging of the pot life up to a few months.
