 The purpose of this study was to prepare a novel Clay Bio Polymer Nanocomposite films by mixing polymer with exfoliated nanoclay . DRX has shown that the mechano chemical treatment of kaolinite allows its exfoliation and the significant reduction of its particles size . Physicochemical properties namely thickness water solubility color light transmission and transparency of the films were studied . Fourier transform infrared analysis was to study the interaction between chitosan and kaolinite . Differential scanning calorimetry scans showed that the transition temperature of films depends on the film s composition . The surface morphology of the films was also studied by scanning electron microscopy . Results showed that water solubility decrease with the increase of the amount of clay . In addition the presence of clay in the said films increases the mechanical strength . All prepared films were tested for their antimicrobial activities against gram positive and gram negative bacteria . It was found that all CBPN films showed good inhibitory activity against all the tested bacteria . The above analysis suggested that the CBPN films could be used as potential candidates for therapeutic application .
