 Anabolic androgenic steroids have been the most commonly abused substances taken by not only professional sportsmen but also recreational bodybuilders . The detection of micro dose testosterone misuse is particularly challenging as it possesses pseudo endogenous origin and is sometimes impossible to be identified in urine samples . Dried blood obtained by finger pricking has been proven to be an alternative matrix for better correlating to physiological responses . Moreover the introduction of the volumetric absorptive microsampling technology allows overcoming some major limitations of spotting blood onto a filter paper card . In this work a fast and sensitive GC MS MS method was developed and validated for the quantification of AAS in DB collected by means of VAMS . T and the eight top abused synthetic AAS namely nandrolone boldenone mesterolone drostanolone metenolone metandienone oxandrolone and dehydrochloromethyl T were selected as the target analytes . The method based on VAMS exhibited good precision accuracy as well as stability and superior extraction recoveries over the punched DB spots reported in the literature . The chromatographic separation was achieved within 6.4 min and the detection limit is as little as 50 fg i.e . able to detect 0.10 ng mL

@highlight Nine anabolic steroids are separated within 6.4 min and are detectable at 50 fg.
@highlight VAMS dried blood exhibits good stability and better recovery over spotting card.
@highlight Quantification of testosterone between serum and VAMS dried blood is in agreement.
@highlight Doping with micro dose testosterone can be caught by using 20 L of dried blood.
