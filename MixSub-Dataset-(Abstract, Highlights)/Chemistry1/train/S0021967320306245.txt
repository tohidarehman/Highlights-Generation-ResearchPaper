 A molecularly imprinted polymer was synthesized and characterized to be used as solid phase extraction sorbent for simultaneous chlorpyrifos and diazinon and their oxon derivatives . Several imprinted polymers were prepared and evaluated in a retention study of these analytes compared with a non printed polymer . Several parameters affecting the extraction of imprinted polymer such as washing solvent composition and volume of the eluting solvent and sample volume were also investigated . Under the optimum conditions the developed method provided satisfactory limits of detection ranging between 0.07 g L

@highlight Molecularly imprinted polymers for OPPs and their oxon forms were prepared.
@highlight Diazinon was selected as the best template for synthesizing MIPs.
@highlight MIP SPE with HPLC UV was developed for the simultaneous analysis of these pesticides.
@highlight The prepared MIP sorbent showed large capacity excellent selectivity and reusability.
@highlight The proposed method was successfully applied to several aqueous environmental samples.
