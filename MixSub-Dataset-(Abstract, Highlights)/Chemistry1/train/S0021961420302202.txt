 In this study the solubility of musk xylene in four binary solvents was measured by the isothermal saturation method at temperatures ranging from 278.15K to 313.15K under atmospheric pressure . The results indicate that the solubility of musk xylene increases with increasing temperature and ethyl acetate mass fraction . The experimental solubility data of musk xylene were correlated by five thermodynamic models including modified Apelbla equation h equation Van t Hoff equation Sun model and JouybanAcree model . All models can be well correlated with the experimental data of solubility . The JouybanAcree model provides the best correlation in this study . The thermodynamic properties of the standard dissolution enthalpy
