 A facile strategy for highly efficient fabrication of chiral monolithic column was carried out by the simple one pot hydroxymethyl polycondensation of native cyclodextrin and urea formaldehyde . In situ rapid substitution of native CD and efficient polycondensation of CD products and UF oligomers was proposed and fulfilled in one pot . The feasibility mechanism and key parameters of polycondensation reaction were discussed . The data on crosslinking polycondensation and reaction kinetics were further evaluated . Characteristics including the morphologies permeability and structure stability of the resultant monolithic columns were also studied . Under the optimal conditions the one pot hydroxymethyl polycondensation was accomplished in an aqueous solution within only 10 mins . Satisfactory stability and repeatability were gained and good enantioseparation of eight model enantiomers was successfully achieved with the resultant CD based monolith . It was simple and highly efficient and the organic solvents special CD derivatives and tediously long time polymerization reaction were successfully avoided which might light a new access to rapid preparation of CD chiral monolith for high performance enantioseparation .
