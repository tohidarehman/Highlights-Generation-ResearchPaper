 The isomerization of amino acids in peptides and proteins induces structural changes and aggregation . The isomerization rate of aspartic acid is high and causes various serious diseases including Alzheimer s disease and cataract . Herein a method for the comprehensive separation and sensitive detection of isomerized crystallin containing Asp

@highlight Analytical method was developed for isomerized peptides via derivatization and LC MS
@highlight Derivatized peptide isomers were separated through a C18 column
@highlight This method improved isomerized peptide separation and MS detection sensitivity
@highlight This method was applied to analyze the isomerized aspartic acids in a crystallin
