 We report on a study on the use of 2D LC in industry wherein we maximized the peak capacity by serially coupling up to six 15cm long columns in the 1st dimension . For the considered aromatic amine oligomer sample the combination of reverse phase pentafluorophenyl column providing selectivity based on interaction in the 1st and a more retaining reverse phase polymeric C18 column in the 2nd dimension proved to give the highest orthogonality calculated to be 0.82 . Whereas a

@highlight 900 peaks in an industrial aromatic amine sample could be separated using 2D LC.
@highlight Six coupled columns 2.6m150mm were used in
@highlight D.
@highlight 1200bar instrumentation was used for each dimension.
@highlight Peak capacity was over 10 000 was after correcting for undersampling and orthogonality.
@highlight Going from 1 to 6 columns for
@highlight D leads to 940 instead only 350 detected components.
