 Eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid are high nutritional components . Evidence for unique effects of them is increasing . Further understanding of their independent biological functions urgently needs more efficient separation techniques . Nowadays most of the commercially available fish oil products are the mixture of eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester and docosahexaenoic acid ethyl ester . It will be convenient to directly separate esterified EPA and DHA without saponification pretreatment . However it is of great challenge to separate EPAEE and DHAEE because of their extremely fat soluble nature and the equivalent chain length rule . In this research the suitability of green guanidinium ionic liquid in countercurrent chromatography solvent system for the separation of them was evaluated for the first time . Compared with imidazolium IL and phosphonium IL guanidinium IL based non aqueous biphasic system showed more outstanding separation performance . The separation mechanism was elucidated in depth through quantum mechanical calculations . It was found that guanidinium IL acted a crucial role in the CCC separation which resulted in difference of partition behavior of EPAEE and DHAEE via different hydrogen bonding affinity . EPAEE and DHAEE were successfully separated by solvent system

@highlight A novel biphasic system based on green guanidinium ionic liquid was developed.
