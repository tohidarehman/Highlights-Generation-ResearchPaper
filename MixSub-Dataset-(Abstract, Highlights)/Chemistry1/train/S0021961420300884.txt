 Sound speed measurements in 42 ternary aqueous mixtures of ethanol plus 1 propanol and new measurements in the three binary mixtures composed by the three same components were made at

@highlight New sound speed data of the ternary water ethanol 1 propanol mixtures.
@highlight Use of Cibulka equation to fit excess molar isentropic compressions.
@highlight Higher impact of 1 propanol in the packing effect in the ternary mixture.
@highlight 1 Propanol shifts the hydrophobic hydrophilic balance to the hydrophobic side.
@highlight Transfer functions of the alcohols from the binary to the ternary mixtures.
