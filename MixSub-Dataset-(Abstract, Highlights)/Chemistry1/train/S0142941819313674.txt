 Multicomponent polymer blends afford polymeric materials with specific properties for many applications . The effect of different chemical structures on the miscibility and compatibility of polymer blends composed of multicomponent acrylic and styrenic polymers was studied in this research . The influence of each component on the thermal mechanical and morphological properties as well as optical transparency was analyzed in poly homopolymer or copolymer blends where the minority constituents formed by polystyrene styrene acrylonitrile copolymer or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene terpolymer . The results showed significant changes in the properties of these mixtures due to the effect of the type of chemical structure and different elastomeric domains of the majority and minority components of polymer blends .
