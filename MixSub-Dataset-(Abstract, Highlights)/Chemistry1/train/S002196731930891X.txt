 A proteomic workflow for a simple loss less manual nano fractionation for low g sample amounts which avoids the need to dry down or transfer fractions to autosampler vials is shown to be feasible . It is demonstrated that the conventional procedure of drying samples down followed by reconstitution negatively affects the number of protein and peptide identifications . Furthermore these losses seem to disproportionately affect hydrophobic peptides from the drying down and reconstitution step . By collecting and concatenating the fractions while the outlet of the column is submerged in a small predefined volume of 0.2 formic acid the content of acetonitrile in the collecting vials was lowered such that it was compatible with direct injection for the online analysis . This additionally resulted in a time gain of approx . an hour for the total fractionation time . Acetonitrile concentrations up to 7.5 do not seem to compromise the chromatographic performance in the online analysis . Using as little as 2g digested HeLa lysate approx . 7000 protein groups could be easily identified with 2 or more unique peptides . This was the case when fractionation was performed at pH 10 as well as at pH 5.5 .
