 Optical properties can estimate morphological changes of polymer chains under flow . This work proposes a rheo optical procedure to determine turbidity and both flow and form birefringence of diluted polymer mixtures of polystyrene and polypropylene during a controlled shear flow by measuring the transmitted light intensity with and without crossed polarizers via an own built optical sensor . The turbidity in these dilute mixtures decreased with the increase of the shear rate due to deformation of the dispersed phase droplets which reduces their cross sections . The presence of PP as the dispersed phase in the PS matrix caused a decrease in the total birefringence measured whereas PS as the dispersed phase in the PP matrix caused an increase in it . Both effects are associated to the positive contribution of the form birefringence produced by the shear induced elongated morphology of the dispersed phase .

@highlight This work presents a quantitative experimental setup to follows in real time the deformation of the dispersed second phase in polymer blends during shearing.
@highlight The setup consist of a shearing device set in optical microscope.
@highlight The mixture s morphology is followed in real time by its effect in the transmitted light intensity measured by an optical sensor fitted in the light path.
@highlight It was developed and built in our department DEMa Brazil and measures simultaneously turbidity and birefringence.
