 A new turn on fluorescent probe based on a hydrazine group placed in the meso position of the BODIPY molecule was synthesized . It was then used for detecting long chain fatty aldehydes which can be harmful to human health in edible vegetable oils . In acetonitrile the probe produced strong turn on and 100 fold fluorescence enhancement with high sensitivity and rapid response to saturated fatty aldehydes . A highly sensitive detection method for long chain fatty aldehydes was established using pre column derivation fluorescence procedure by high performance liquid chromatography . The chromatographic method established provided satisfactory precision good linearity

@highlight A turn on fluorescent probe has been developed for the detection of fatty aldehydes.
@highlight The sensor possessed high sensitivity down to 6.412.4ng mL.
@highlight The probe was highly selectivity to saturated fatty aldehydes.
@highlight The method has advantages of simple operation rapid reliable and micro sample.
