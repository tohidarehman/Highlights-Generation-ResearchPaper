 The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the origin and the manufacturing processes of the chiral stationary phases on their chromatographic behaviors . Hence four chiral stationary phases based on immobilized

@highlight Polysaccharide with the same chiral selector columns from different manufacturers.
@highlight Twenty pharmaceutical compounds and nine in house compounds chosen as probes.
@highlight Study of the chromatographic parameters on each column.
@highlight Evaluation of the loading capacity of each column.
@highlight Ranking of the performances of the four columns investigated.
