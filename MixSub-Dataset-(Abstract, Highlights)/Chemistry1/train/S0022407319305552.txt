 This study investigates the relationship between surface roughness and spectral reflectivity of DP980 an advanced high strength steel alloy . Five surface states were considered as received polished roughened and two coupons annealed in a reducing atmosphere . Radiative properties were measured using a UVVis NIR spectrophotometer and two FTIR spectrometers for directional hemispherical and specular reflectance measurements while surface roughness is determined using an optical profilometer . These measurements were interpreted in the context of a theoretical relationship derived from Davies model for specular reflectance . The reflectance of the polished coupon most closely matches this theory and the remaining coupons become more aligned with this relationship after large scale roughness has been removed from the profilograms using a wavelet filter . The results show that directional hemispherical reflectance can be predicted using Davies model with local scale roughness as opposed to macroscopic artifacts although this model is intended to capture the variation of specular reflectance with respect to wavelength .

@highlight Annealed samples have distinct radiation property behavior from those of un annealed samples.
@highlight For rough surfaces profilometer derived roughnesses are much larger than optically inferred values while the roughness of wavelet filtered profilograms are more consistent with the optically derived values.
@highlight Radiative properties of Dual Phase steels can be estimated through specular model with local sub micrometer roughness scale which can be obtained by applying high pass wavelet filtering on the global surface texture.
@highlight It is critical to account for the spectral dependence of smooth surface reflectance in Davies model using the Hagen Rubens relation.
