 To obtain consistent chromatographic behavior it is important to develop resin packing methods in accordance with the characteristics of each resin . Resins particularly those with a significant level of compressibility require proper knowledge of the packing methodology to ensure scalable performance . The study demonstrates the applicability of pressure flow modeling based on the BlakeKozeny equation for cellulose based resins using the MEP HyperCel resin as a case study . This approach enabled the understanding of the appropriate bed compressibility and the determination of the minimum column diameter that can predict bed integrity during commercial manufacturing scale operation . Studies suggested that scale dependent wall effects become negligible for column diameters exceeding 20cm . Pressure flow modeling produced a minimum compression recommendation of 0.206 for the MEP HyperCel resin . Columns with diameters up to 80cm packed with this bed compression yielded incompressible beds with pressure flow curves consistent with model predictions . Model parameter values were then varied to demonstrate how changing operating conditions influence model predictions . This analysis supported the successful troubleshooting of unexpected high pressures at the commercial manufacturing scale using MEP HyperCel resin further supporting the applicability of this approach .
