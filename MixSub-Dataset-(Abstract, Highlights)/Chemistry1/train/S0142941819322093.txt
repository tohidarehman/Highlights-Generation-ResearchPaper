 The work presents a synthetic approach that combines methods of metal vapor synthesis gelation and supercritical drying in order to obtain chitosan aerogels containing silver nanoparticles . On the first stage two types of silver organosols were prepared

@highlight Chitosan is modified using silver organosols produced
@highlight metal vapor synthesis.
@highlight Silver nanoparticles are spherical and have dominant size fraction below 4nm.
@highlight Modified silver containing chitosan is used to form silver chitosan aerogel.
@highlight New states of nitrogen in the aerogel indicate silver chitosan chemical interaction.
@highlight Specific surface area of the formed aerogels is up to 100m
@highlight  g.
