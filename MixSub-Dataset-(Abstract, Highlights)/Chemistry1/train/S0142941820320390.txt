 Robust superhydrophobic surface exhibiting anti fouling and self cleaning ability were successfully fabricated by nano TiO2 modified by aminopropyltriethoxysilane and polydimethylsiloxane via wire rod coating . Due to the lower surface energy of PDMS and the hierarchical structure caused by the different aggregation sizes of TiO2 nanoparticles the contact angle of the resulting superhydrophobic coating was 154.5 and the rolling angle was 3.5 . And the coated paper still had good non wettability under water immersion . In addition the coated paper was tolerant to mechanical damage and various temperature conditions . Even after 40 sandpaper wear cycles the coating can still maintain good mechanical stability and superhydrophobicity . The superhydrophobic paper was used for oil water separation the separation efficiency was about 98 even after used 10 times . Furthermore the prepared superhydrophobic paper exhibited excellent self cleaning and anti fouling properties as well as demonstrated superb resistance to various water solutions owing to its high hydrophobicity . Moreover the prepared superhydrophobic paper has application prospects in the industry of special wetting materials .

@highlight An eco friendly superhydrophobic filter paper with excellent mechanical durability is prepared for oil water separation.
@highlight The separation efficiency of the superhydrophobic paper is above 98 after 10 cycles.
@highlight The superhydrophobic surface has much better mechanical durability than what was reported in previous studies.
@highlight The coating process do not affect the folding performance of filter paper.
