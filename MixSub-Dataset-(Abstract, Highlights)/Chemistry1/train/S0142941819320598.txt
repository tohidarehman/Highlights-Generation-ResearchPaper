 In this study a series of UV curable anticorrosive PUA coatings embedded with varying concentrations of inorganic ZnO fillers have been successfully prepared from jatropha based polyol . The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Tafel polarisation analysis revealed that increasing fillers composition lead to the improvement of the anticorrosive property of the hybrid coatings . Meanwhile the salt spray test results were found to correlate with the EIS of C

@highlight Bio based PUA with ZnO coating showed significantly enhanced corrosion resistance.
@highlight The incorporation of ZnO filler particle in organic coating matrix has good performance in coating.
@highlight The morphology and XRD analysis was support for corrosion resistance and as well coating performance.
