 5 ribonucleotides including adenosine 5 monophosphate cytidine 5 monophsphate guanosine 5 monophosphate and uridine 5 monophosphate have been widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries . This work focused on the assessment of mass transfer process and separation mechanism of four 5 ribonucleotides and counter ion Na

@highlight HSDM was used to ascertain mass transfer process of 5 ribonucleotides and Na
@highlight Breakthrough curves were predicted by fixed bed film surface diffusion model.
@highlight The concentration of 5 ribonucleotides and pH profiles were predicted.
@highlight Separation mechanism was proved based on the experimental and model results.
