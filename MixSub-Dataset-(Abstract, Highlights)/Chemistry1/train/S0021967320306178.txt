 We report on a systematic and comprehensive experimental study of the effect of the zone retention factor k on eddy dispersion h

@highlight Extensive measurement set reveals a systematic k dependency of eddy dispersion.
@highlight Eddy dispersion was determined using novel CFD validated Sherwood expression.
@highlight Eddy dispersion data h
@highlight  fit well with knox s empirical eddy dispersion model.
@highlight The k dependency of the exponent and pre factor of knox s model is mapped.
@highlight A simple mathematical expression to predict h
@highlight for different k is established.
