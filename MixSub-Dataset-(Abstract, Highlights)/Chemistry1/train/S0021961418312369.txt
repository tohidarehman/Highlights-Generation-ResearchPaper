 In this study the physiochemical and transport properties of 3 propylamine water system were investigated . The densities and refractive indices of aqueous DEAPA solutions were measured at a range of temperatures from 293.15K to 343.15K and at a pressure p 95.1 kPa . The viscosities of the aqueous DEAPA were also measured from T 298.15K to 333.15K . The excess properties of aqueous DEAPA solutions were calculated based on the experimental results . In addition the activation energies and entropies for viscous flow were estimated from the viscosity data . The RedlichKister equation was used to correlate all excess properties . Based on volumetric data DEAPA could not be described as structure breaker or structure maker however the nature of changes of viscosity against concentration suggested the formation of stable complex .
