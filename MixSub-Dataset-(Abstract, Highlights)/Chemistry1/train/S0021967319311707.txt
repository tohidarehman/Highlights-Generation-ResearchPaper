 Despite analytical advances matrix effects in pesticide residue analysis by gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry continue to be a challenge especially in difficult samples such as seeds . In this study the influence of different clean up sorbents and different mixtures of primary secondary amine C18 graphitized carbon black and MgSO

@highlight Low moisture seeds of vegetable oil plants with complex matrices were chosen.
@highlight The clean up sorbents addition of water matrix match calibration were explored.
@highlight Using PSA C18 GCB MgSO
@highlight gave maximum compensation of matrix effects.
@highlight Time consuming matrix matched calibration was shortened by using one matrix.
@highlight Residues of 21 pesticides were detected in 26 real seed samples.
