 Seal assemblies are critical elements in a variety of drilling and completion equipment such as wellhead casing hangers packers and liner hangers . Zonal isolation is accomplished by seal compression which generates contact pressure at the seal pipe interface . The performance of a seal is evaluated based on its mechanical and hydraulic integrity as well as its resistance to failure mechanisms . Objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of a seal assembly at varying compressions seal and pipe properties and chemical swelling .
