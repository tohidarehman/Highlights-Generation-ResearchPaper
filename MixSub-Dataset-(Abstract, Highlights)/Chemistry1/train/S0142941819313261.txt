 In this work lignin based nanofibers were produced from corn stalk lignin lignin derived bio oil and polyacrylonitrile co polymers via electrospinning . During depolymerization the addition of phosphotungstic acid promoted the CSL catalytic conversion to some extent the decrease of O 4 aryl ether bond molecular weight and polydispersity was obvious . Compared with CSL LBO can promotes the formation of uniform and smooth lignin based nanofibers under high replacement rates condition and maintaining good morphology . Subsequent reactions between LBO and PAN fragments formed a better integrated co polymers structure containing linear PAN backbone . The

@highlight Successfully associate lignin depolymerization with lignin based electrospun nanofibers.
