 Due to its unique properties silicon nitride has found a wide variety of applications in nanodevice fabrication and biosensing . Self assembled monolayers of phosphonic acids can be applied to prepare well defined organic interfaces suitable to anchor bioreceptor probes with a high surface density on different substrates . In this work we report on the fabrication of SAMPs functional interfaces on silicon nitride . By using several surface analysis techniques including contact angle measurements atomic force microscopy and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy we present a detailed characterization of the morphology composition and stability of the functional interface . In addition we investigate the protective properties of organophosphonate functional interfaces containing only a few ethylene glycol units per SAMPs building block against non specific surface binding of charged biomolecules by means of fluorescence spectroscopy .

@highlight Organophosphonate based functional interfaces were prepared on silicon nitride surfaces.
@highlight By water contact angle measurements atomic force microscopy and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy a detailed characterization of the morphology composition and stability of the organophosphonate functional interface is presented.
@highlight Only at 700K relevant losses of surface phosphorus can be observed suggesting the complete desorption of the organic overlayer.
@highlight SAMPs functional interfaces containing only a few numbers of ethylene glycol units exhibit remarkable protective properties against non specific DNA physisorption.
