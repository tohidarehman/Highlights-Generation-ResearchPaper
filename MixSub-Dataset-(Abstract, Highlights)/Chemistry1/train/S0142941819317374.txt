 In the process of waterflooding development it is of great importance to prevent the clay from hydration swelling and migration dispersion for protecting the formation and improving the water flooding efficiency . For those reasons we successfully synthesized a cationic clay stabilizer through melting polycondensation and cationic modification with maleic anhydride diethanolamine epichlorohydrin triethylamine and trimethylolpropane as monomers and p toluene sulfonic acid as a catalyst . The chemical structure cation degree and molecular weight of HBP QAT were studied by using FTIR

@highlight A novel cationic hyperbranched polymer HBP QAT was successfully prepared.
@highlight HBP QAT showed a excellent inhibition performance superior other inhibitors.
@highlight HBP QAT effectively decreased permeability damage of low permeability reservoirs.
@highlight HBP QAT strongly interacts with the clay minimizing clay swelling and dispersing.
