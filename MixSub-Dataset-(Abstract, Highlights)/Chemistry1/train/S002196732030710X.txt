 Differing sensitivity is the main obstacle for a direct combination of HPTLC with NMR spectroscopy . A sufficient amount of the isolated compound zone must be provided by HPTLC for subsequent offline NMR detection . To fill the gap a straightforward procedure was developed using the same analytical HPTLC system for both bioprofiling and isolation of bioactive zones from multicomponent mixtures . The HPTLC effect directed analysis revealed several bioactive compounds in five botanical extracts i.e .
