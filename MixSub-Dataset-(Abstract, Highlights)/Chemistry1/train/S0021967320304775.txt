 Plant hormones are a type of pesticide that can potentially affect human health . Therefore their quantitative detection is particularly important . In this study a green and economic method for the simultaneous extraction and determination of four PHs namely thidiazuron forchlorfenuron 1 naphthylacetic acid and 2 naphthoxyacetic acid in watermelon juice was developed by using m aminophenolureaglyoxal resin as the adsorbent for pipette tip solid phase extraction coupled with liquid chromatography . The resin was synthesized via a simple and green process . The synthesized resin possesses multiple functional groups high adsorption capacity larger specific surface area than the ureaglyoxal resin and m aminophenolglyoxal resin and can be regenerated easily . The PT SPE device is simple cheap and easy to obtain and the adsorbent dosage is only 5.0mg . The proposed method has a wide linear detection range high recovery good precision and high sensitivity and satisfies the measurement requirements for detecting trace levels of PHs in fruits and vegetables .

@highlight Amino functionalized resin MAPUGR with rich functional group was synthesized.
@highlight Low toxicity glyoxal instead of carcinogenic formaldehyde for green synthesis.
@highlight MAPUGR has the advantages of large adsorption capacity and easy regeneration.
@highlight Rubber suction ball assisted PT SPE save resources and improve reproducibility.
@highlight MAPUGRPT SPEHPLC detects four PHs in watermelon juice simultaneously.
