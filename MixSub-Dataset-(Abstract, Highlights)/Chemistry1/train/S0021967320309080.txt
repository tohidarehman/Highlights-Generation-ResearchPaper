 Lysophosphatidic acids are important bioactive phospholipids consisting of various species involved in a wide array of physiological and pathological processes . However LPAs were rarely identified in untargeted lipidomics studies because of the incompatibility with analytical methods . Moreover in targeted studies the coverages of LPAs remained unsatisfactorily low due to the limitation of reference standards . Herein a modelingprediction workflow for deep profiling of LPAs by liquid chromatographymass spectrometry was developed . Multiple linear regression models of qualitative and quantitative parameters were established according to features of fatty acyl tails of the commercial standards to predict the corresponding parameters for unknown LPAs . Then 72 multiple reaction monitoring transitions were monitored simultaneously and species of LPA 14 0 LPA 16 1 LPA 18 3 LPA 20 3 and LPA 20 5 were firstly characterized and quantified in plasma . Finally the workflow was applied to explore the changes of LPAs in plasma of breast cancer patients compared with healthy volunteers . Multi LPAs indexes with strong diagnostic ability for breast cancer were identified successfully using Student s
