 Polarimetric HPLC detector was used to acquire chromatograms for lavender lavandin essentials oils on different chiral stationary phases . Amylose tris immobilized on silica allowed the best separation of the numerous chiral phytomarkers and was thus used to obtain a chiroptical fingerprint for 158 samples of French lavender lavandin EOs . Samples from different varieties were collected over three crop years from four different locations in France to take into account seasonal and geographic origin variations . The combination of the polarimetric fingerprints and chemometrics was tested for varietal discrimination . We assessed the ability to discriminate the EOs samples and their variety by partial least squares discriminant analysis . This case study showed that liquid chromatography with polarimetric detector in tandem with chemometric analysis was efficient to differentiate the varietal origins of French lavender lavandin EOs .
