 Catalytic oxidation is most promising among various possible ways of removal of Formaldehyde . Here DFT U calculations have been utilized to explore theoretically three potential pathways of HCHO oxidation on Co doped reduced CeO

@highlight Co doping on ceria facilities much lower oxygen vacancy formation energy than defective free CeO
@highlight  111 does.
@highlight Possible chemisorbed and physisorbed configurations of formaldehyde HCHO on Co
@highlight Ce
@highlight  111 p 44 surface are both determined.
@highlight Three possible reaction modes are explored from different HCHO co adsorption configurations with O
@highlight on the defective Co
@highlight Ce
@highlight  111 p 44 surface. Corresponding reactive potential energy surfaces and minimum kinetic reaction pathways of HCHO oxidation are given respectively.
