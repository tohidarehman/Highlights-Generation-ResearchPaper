 To date little is known about the functionalized and heteroatomic compounds present in hydrothermal petroleum and how these compounds are affected by high temperature vent fluids . To address this the maltene fractions of three hydrothermal petroleum samples spanning the shallow depth of a sediment core collected in the Escanaba Trough of the Gorda Ridge in the northeast Pacific were analyzed by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry in both negative electrospray ionization and negative atmospheric pressure photoionization ionization modes . These polar compounds were structurally similar to asphaltenes but did not exceed a nominal mass range of 800Da . They were derived primarily from terrestrially sourced organic matter with common heteroatom arrangements of C

@highlight Maltene fractions of hydrothermal petroleum were analyzed using FT ICR MS.
@highlight Detected compounds are dominated by O heteroatomic components.
@highlight These compounds are largely derived from terrestrial organic matter.
@highlight The associated hydrocarbons were thermochemically weathered at the greatest depth.
