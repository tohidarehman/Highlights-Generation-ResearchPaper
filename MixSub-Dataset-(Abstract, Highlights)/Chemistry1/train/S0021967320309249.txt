 For a successful high speed countercurrent chromatography separation of multiple components the suitable solvent system selection is a critical operation . Despite the difference in separation mechanism between HSCCC and HPLC

@highlight The average polarity of multi components and solvent system the analyte retention factor were combined together at sweet point.
@highlight The average polarity of multi components was calculated by the polarity parameter model on HPLC analysis.
@highlight The proposed model is a valuable tool for selecting the appropriate solvent system.
@highlight Six antioxidant constituents were isolated from
@highlight by HSCCC for first time.
