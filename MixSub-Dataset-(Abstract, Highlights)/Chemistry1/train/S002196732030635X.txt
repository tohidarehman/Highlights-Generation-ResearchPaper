 In this study the in situ conversion of the synthesized Co Al layered double hydroxide nanosheets to three dimensional hierarchical zeolitic imidazolate framework 67 was presented as a cost effective highly efficient flexible and robust sorbent to carry out the microextraction process . In the first stage the anodized aluminum foil was prepared electrochemically . Then the Co Al LDH precursor was constructed on the surface of the previously prepared anodized Al foil applying in situ formation approach . The procedure is followed by the conversion of the prepared Co Al LDH film to 3D HZIF 67 film via a facile solvothermal method without adding cobalt salt . The in situ prepared 3D HZIF 67 anodized Al was used for the thin film microextraction of caffeine . The effective factors in TFME procedure were investigated and optimized through applying Central Composite Design . In the obtained optimal condition the calibration curves for TFME HPLC UV of caffeine were linear in the range of 1200g

@highlight 3D HZIF 67 as a cost effective flexible and robust sorbent for TFME was presented.
@highlight LDH precursor was constructed on the surface of a very cheap anodized Al foil.
@highlight Conversion of the LDH to HZIF 67 film was performed via a facile solvothermal method.
@highlight The sorbent was used for analysis of caffeine in urine followed by HPLC UV.
@highlight The method shows low LOD LOQ and proper LDR with acceptable precision.
