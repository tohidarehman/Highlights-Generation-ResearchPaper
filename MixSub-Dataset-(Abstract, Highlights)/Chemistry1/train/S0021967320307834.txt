 In the present document we report the development of an analytical method consisting of a sequential direct immersion headspace solid phase microextraction followed by gas phase chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry for simultaneous analysis of 4 chlorobenzyl alcohol 2 6 dichlorobenzyl alcohol 4 methoxybenzyl alcohol 3 4 dimethoxybenzyl alcohol pyridine and 2 3 dimethylpyrazine in oilfield production waters . These compounds are under evaluation for use as phase partitioning tracers in oil reservoirs . To the best of our knowledge this is the first time SPME has been applied to the analysis of these compounds in production waters or any other type of matrix where the compounds targeted are the base for a technical application . Relevant extraction parameters such as the adsorbent phase of the fiber direct immersion or headspace addition of salt temperature and time of extraction were investigated . The final optimal operation conditions consist on extracting 5 mL of sample at pH 9.0 with 1.8 g of NaCl with constant stirring during 5 minutes of DI SPME followed by 15 minutes of HS SPME at 70 C using a DVB CAR PDMS fiber . The limits of quantification linearity precision and accuracy of the method were evaluated . Analyses of the tracer compounds and recovery studies were also performed on production waters from 8 different oilfields of the Norwegian continental shelf . LOQs between 0.080 and 0.35 g L
