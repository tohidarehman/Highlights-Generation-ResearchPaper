 In this work a layer structure from styrene butadiene rubber composites and PU foam with improved flame retardancy property and high sound absorption coefficient at frequency range . Different types of flame retardants iron as metal chelate magnesium hydroxide and sodium tripolyphosphate were blended with SBR . The type and loading level of flame retardant had a great effect on filler dispersion and consequently on mechanical properties of SBR . MOH exhibited the best dispersion as indicated from scanning electron microscope and SBR MOH samples had almost the highest crosslink density 16.04 10

@highlight SBR MOH samples had nearly the highest crosslink density the best mechanical properties and lowest rate of burning.
@highlight The presence of air cavity after or between the composite samples improved the sound absorption at frequency range200 500Hz.
@highlight The triple layer structure gave higher sound absorption coefficient at lower frequencies than that obtained with the double layer structure where it reached to 0.98at 315Hz.
