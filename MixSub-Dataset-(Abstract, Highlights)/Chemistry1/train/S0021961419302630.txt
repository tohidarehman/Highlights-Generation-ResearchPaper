 Ethyl myristate is one of the main components of biodiesels and its thermophysical properties are critical to be supplemented and perfected . In this work the speed of sound and thermal diffusivity of ethyl myristate were measured by the light scattering method . The investigated temperature and pressure is ranged from 303.15K to 560.15K and up to 10MPa . The relative expanded uncertainties of the speed of sound and thermal diffusivity were estimated to be less than 1.3 and 2.6 respectively . The correlations for the speed of sound and thermal diffusivity as function of temperature and pressure were presented based on the experimental data . The absolute average deviations between the experimental data and the calculated results are 0.04 for the speed of sound at atmospheric pressure 0.07 for the speed of sound at
