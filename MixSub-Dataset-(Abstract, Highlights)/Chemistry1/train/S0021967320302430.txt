 In the present study 88 structurally diverse drugs were investigated by biopartitioning micellar chromatography using Brij 35 as surfactant under different chromatographic conditions . It was found that temperature and presence of NaCl have only a minor effect in BMC retention . Correlation of BMC retention factors with octanol water partitioning required the inclusion of fractions of ionized species as additional parameters showing that there is a weaker effect of ionization in BMC environment . Compared to Immobilized Artificial Membrane Chromatography BMC retention factors cover a relatively narrow span two fold smaller than retention factors on IAM stationary phases as a result of the presence of micelles facilitating elution of lipophilic compounds and the absence of secondary attractive electrostatic interactions in the BMC environment . Similarities dissimilarities between BMC octanol water partitioning and IAM Chromatography were investigated by Linear Free Energy Relationships . BMC retention factors were used to construct relationships with cell permeability Human Oral Absorption and Plasma Protein Binding . Linear BMC models were obtained with Caco 2 cell lines and Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay . For HOA a hyperbolic model was established upon incorporation of topological polar surface area as additional parameter . A sigmoidal model was constructed for PPB and a linear one for the corresponding thermodynamic binding constant logK . In both cases inclusion of the fraction of anionic species with a positive sign was required reflecting the preference of human albumin for acidic drugs .
