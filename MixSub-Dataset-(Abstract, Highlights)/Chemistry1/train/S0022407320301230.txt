 We present a detailed investigation of the spectral properties and photoionization of highly charged ions subjected to warm and hot dense plasma environments . A unified framework based on the finite temperature orbital free density functional theory is adopted to describe plasma screening effects on the nucleus electron interaction . Self consistent solving the coupled radial Diarc equations for both bound and continuum wave functions is used through the model EPPP we developed to account the relativistic and plasma shielding effects which is based on the flexible atomic code . The key features of the proposed model are the capacities to systematically include gradient corrections and exchange correlation effects . Additionally numerical tests are conducted to validate the accuracy and stability of the model . The transition energies radiative transition parameters ionization potentials and photoionization cross sections of an exemplary ion Al

@highlight We developed a model EPPP to calculate the PI process under warm dense and dense plasmas.
@highlight The reduction of energies and ionization potential giving rise to a modification of PI and RR cross sections is highlighted.
@highlight Our results are validated by comparison with those from other works available in the literature.
