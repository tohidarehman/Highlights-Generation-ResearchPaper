 In this work we examine how the properties of the poly 3 hexylthiophene ZnO solar cell are affected by interfacial modification with phenyl C61 butyric acid and doping with Sr . Using density functional theory calculations on ideal models of the P3HT ZnO

@highlight PBE0 identified as the most accurate functional to model the P3HT ZnO solar cell.
@highlight Sr doping has a negligible impact on P3HT ZnO adhesion while PCBA weakens adhesion.
@highlight PCBA decreases interfacial dipole to increase band offsets.
@highlight Sr decreases interfacial dipole but changes ZnO workfunction to decrease band offsets.
