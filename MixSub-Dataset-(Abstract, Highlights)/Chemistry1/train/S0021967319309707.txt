 Countercurrent chromatography is a unique support free liquid liquid partition chromatography . Since it was invented by Y. Ito in 1960s CCC has been widely accepted and applied as popular separation and purification technique for natural and synthetic complex . However up to date there is little study to address on hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions in CCC process although hydrophobic interaction chromatography and hydrophilic interaction chromatography as solid support chromatographic techniques are widely applied at different stages of downstream processing . In fact hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions might be more popular in CCC separation than that in the liquid chromatography . For example adding small solvents or additives in two phase solvent systems may change significantly hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions between solvents and solutes . Normally CCC separation employs a light and hydrophobic organic phase as the stationary phase and a heavy and hydrophilic aqueous phase as the mobile phase . Hydrophobic interactions between the solvent system and solutes will increase the partition coefficients
