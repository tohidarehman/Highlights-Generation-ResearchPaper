 In this work carbon nanotube was used to fabricate poly high density polyethylene blend based nanocomposites via a Haake mixer . Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that the CNT was mainly selectively located in the HDPE dispersed domains . Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that CNT addition improved the thermal stability of the blend in air environment . Differential scanning calorimetry results revealed the enhanced nucleation of individual PVDF and HDPE upon crystallization in the composites the presence of CNT inceased the stability of PVDF crystals . CNT addition increased the heat distortion temperature of the blend by up to 27C at 3 phr CNT loading . The complex viscosity and storage modulus increased due to the CNT pseudo network formation in the reduce sized HDPE phase of the composites . The rigidity of the blend was significantly improved after the addition of CNT . The impact strength of the blend increased by up to 66 after 2 phr CNT loading and the electrical resistivity of the blend decreased by up to nine orders at 3 phr CNT loading due to the double percolation like morphology formation .

@highlight CNT was mainly located in the HDPE phase forming double percolated structure.
@highlight Thermal stability and heat resistance of the blend were enhanced with CNT inclusion.
@highlight CNT assisted the nucleation and increased the crystal stability of PVDF.
@highlight Flexural modulus and impact strength increased up to 61 and 66 respectively in the nanocomposites.
@highlight Electrical resistivity of the blend decreased by nine orders at 3 phr CNT loading.
