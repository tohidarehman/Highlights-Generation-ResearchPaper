 Protein adsorption plays a role in many fields where in some it is desirable to maximize the amount adsorbed in others it is important to avoid protein adsorption altogether . Therefore theoretical methods are needed for a better understanding of the underlying processes and for the prediction of adsorption quantities . In this study we present a proof of concept that the calculation of protein adsorption isotherms by molecular dynamics simulations is possible using the steric mass action theory . Here we are investigating the adsorption of bovine human serum albumin and hemoglobin on Q Sepharose FF . Protein adsorption isotherms were experimentally determined and modeled . Free energy profiles of protein adsorption were calculated by MD simulations to determine the Henry isotherms as a first step . Although each simulation contained only one protein notably the calculated isotherms are in reasonably good agreement with the experimental isotherms . Hence we could show that MD data can lead to protein adsorption data in good agreement with experimental data . The results were critically discussed and requirements for future applications are identified .
