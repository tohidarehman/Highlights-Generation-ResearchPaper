 A wide pore diphenyl stationary phase was evaluated for the analysis of monoclonal antibodies comparing a conventional mobile phase of acetonitrile water containing overall 0.1 trifluoracetic acid with a similar mobile phase incorporating in addition 5 butanol . Alternatively TFA was replaced by ammonium formate buffer and by methane sulfonic acid . Addition of 5 butanol to the mobile phase reduces the minimum temperature at which suitable UV analysis of the mAbs can be obtained from about 70C with TFA alone to about 60C thus potentially improving column lifetime and reducing the possibility of sample degradation . AF buffers produce satisfactory UV sensitivity at 70C and have the advantage of reducing signal suppression in mass spectrometry . Some peak tailing was noted in comparison with TFA separations . Methane sulfonic acid at the same molar concentration as TFA produced the best chromatographic peaks maintaining reasonable UV sensitivity down to 50C also giving acceptable results even at only 3mM concentration of the additive . The good results with this additive were attributed to its stronger acidity and consequent suppression of the ionisation of column silanols . Surprisingly peak response was rather poorly correlated with the peak capacity of the gradient analysis . A possible explanation is self deactivation of active column sites by a portion of the sample .

@highlight Rituximab and Bevacizumab selected as difficult probes.
@highlight Column was tested with trifluoroacetic acid and a variety of additives.
@highlight Ammonium formate is mass spectrometer friendly with acceptable results at 70C.
@highlight Methanesulfonic acid gives best peak capacity and reasonable results at 50C.
