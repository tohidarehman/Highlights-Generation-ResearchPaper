 A headspace solid phase microextraction Arrow method coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry was developed for the quantitation of a large number of aroma compounds in Chinese liquor . Optimization of extraction conditions by a central composite experimental design revealed that the dilution of the alcohol content of 5mL of Baijiu to 10 followed by the addition of 1.5g of NaCl and subsequent SPME Arrow extraction with DVB CAR PDMS fiber coating over 45min at 45C was the most suitable . The quantitative method allowed the extraction and identification of 82 aroma compounds in the Baijiu sample . The method was validated with good repeatability inter and intra day precision and accuracy . Furthermore the method was validated successfully for the most significant compounds and was applied to study the composition of volatile compounds in different types of Baijiu . This research proved that SPME Arrow is an effective method for the extraction of aroma compounds in Baijiu and other distilled spirits . This developed method will allow improved analysis of other distilled spirits .

@highlight HS SPME Arrow sampling developed for volatile aroma compound extraction in Baijiu.
@highlight HS SPME Arrow fiber affords improved extraction efficiency than that of SPME fiber.
@highlight Multivariate methods including RSM were used to optimize the HS SPME Arrow method.
@highlight A method for quantitation of the 82 volatile compounds in Baijiu was established.
