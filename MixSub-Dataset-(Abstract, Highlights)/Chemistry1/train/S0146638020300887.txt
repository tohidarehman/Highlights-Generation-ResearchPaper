 The pyrobitumen in conventional petroleum reservoirs is a thermally altered product of ancient oil pools which may provide valuable source information using its molecular and isotopic signatures . Pyrobitumen formation is often associated with thermal alteration of asphaltene or polar rich components rather than that of oil as a whole . Although asphaltenes are useful in source correlation of altered oils the geochemical characteristics of asphaltene derived pyrobitumen are poorly understood . In this study artificial pyrobitumen formation through oil asphaltene cracking was performed at different thermal simulation temperatures . Systematic variations in the amounts and distributions of extractable and bound hydrocarbons released by catalytic hydropyrolysis of the artificially produced pyrobitumen were studied . Pyrobitumen production yield was high at pyrolysis temperatures corresponding to post oil peak maturities with a maximum yield of 70wt of asphaltene being reached in the early condensatewet gas stage . The molecular structure of pyrobitumen varied only slightly over the high maturity range . Compared with the parent asphaltene the pyrobitumen had a low biomarker content and even the carbon isotopic values of the more stable bound
