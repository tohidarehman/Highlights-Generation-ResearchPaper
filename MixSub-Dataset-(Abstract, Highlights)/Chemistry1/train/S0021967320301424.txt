 The complexity of determining the composition of animal tissue lipids is greatly increased by the presence of plasmalogens in which the alkyl chain is linked to glycerol by an enol ether bond instead of being esterified . Acidic methanolysis of animal tissue lipids provides the simultaneous scission of acyl and alkenyl ether moieties but the complexity of the products of reaction poses a great challenge in their gas chromatographic analysis . Two dimensional gas chromatography with online reduction provided the resolution of all components contained in acid methanolyzed animal lipids taking advantage of the selective hydrogenation of alkenyl ether methanolysis products prior to the second dimension separation

@highlight We revisisted the preparation of dimethyl acetals from plasmalogens and made recommandations to avoid unwanted degradation products.
@highlight Two dimensional gas chromatography with online reduction separates dimethyl acetals and fatty acid methyl esters.
@highlight Dimethyl acetals prepared from plasmalogens may be isolated from fatty acid methyl esters by liquid liquid repartition.
@highlight Results are confirmed by applying GC MS and NMR spectroscopy.
