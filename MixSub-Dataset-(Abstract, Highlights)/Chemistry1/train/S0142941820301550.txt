 In this work the characteristics of a vegetable fibre polyester composite are studied as a function of fibre surface treatment

@highlight Fiber dosage significance on dynamic properties are evaluated.
@highlight Theoretical model is developed for the natural fiber composite.
@highlight Cole cole plot shows higher homogeneity upon the surface treatment.
@highlight Theoretical modeling has shown a good deal with the experimental results.
