 This paper provides an overview of results obtained in the course of recent studies dealing with abiotic degradation of algal lipids in the marine realm . In the first part the photooxidation of the main lipid components chlorophyll phytyl chain carotenoids

@highlight Abiotic degradation of lipids in senescent phytoplanktonic cells is reviewed.
@highlight Photo and autoxidation processes act intensively on unsaturated lipids.
@highlight Singlet oxygen plays a key role in photosensitized oxidation processes.
@highlight Autoxidation involves the reaction of triplet molecular oxygen with the substrates.
@highlight Particular attention is given to the potential of oxidation products as tracers.
