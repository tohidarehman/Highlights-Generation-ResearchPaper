 In this work we performed spin orbit coupling included MRCI Q calculation on electronic states of SbBr . The SOC effect is treated by using the state interaction method in combination with the Breit Pauli operator . Molecular orbitals are constructed with all electron aug cc pwCVQZ DK basis sets . Without SOC total 34 S states of SbBr are obtained . It is found that the lowest three S states X

@highlight Total 34 S states of SbBr are accurately characterized at the MRCI Q level.
@highlight The SOC effect makes 34 S states split into 74 states.
