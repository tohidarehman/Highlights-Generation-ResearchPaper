 The process of filament to filament adhesion during polymer extrusion additive manufacturing is critically influenced by temperature distribution around the filament . Direct measurement of temperature distribution around the filament being deposited is therefore important for fully understanding this critical process . While past papers have reported side view

@highlight Presents in plane temperature of build plate during polymer extrusion 3D printing.
@highlight Utilizes an infrared camera in conjunction with an IR transparent window and mirror.
@highlight Both filament and bed temperature fields are measured.
@highlight Measurements help understand key thermal aspects of filament to bed interactions.
