 agonists which have been illegally used in animal production in some countries can induce bioaccumulation when blood is converted by rendering into blood meal . Unfortunately available data on this topic are scarce which result in lack of risk assessment . Therefore in this research a method for simultaneous determination of 22 agonists in blood meal by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry using isotope dilution was developed . The recoveries of the developed method ranged from 68.6 to 118.8 with RSD at below 20 . the limit of detection is blew 1g kg . The change in agonist form added and incurred blood into blood meal and long stability of agonist in blood meal were studied . Then we analyzed blood meal for 22 agonists using this method . The results suggest blood meal is a possible pathway for agonist reentry into animals . Potential risks of agonist residues in blood meal were examined . This study is the first to explore source of agonist residues in blood meal change in processing produce and stability in stored stage .

@highlight A new method for analysis of 22 agonists in blood meal was developed.
@highlight The method was successfully applied to analyze agonist in blood meal.
@highlight  agonist residues in process and stored blood meal have been studied firstly.
