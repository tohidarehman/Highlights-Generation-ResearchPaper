 Selecting the appropriate solvent system is the key to the successful separation of samples by using countercurrent chromatography . Although high speed countercurrent chromatography has been widely used in the separation and preparation of natural products the selection of a solvent system has always been a stumbling block to the application of high speed countercurrent chromatography . In order to explore a rapid and practical prediction method to select countercurrent chromatography solvent system five linear prediction models of the Arizona solvent system family was established by using fourteen compounds with different structures and five HPLC columns of different brands . And two different solvent system selection methods The partition coefficient

@highlight A rapid and practical solvent system prediction method was established.
@highlight 14 compounds and 5 HPLC columns were used to establish the prediction method.
@highlight 5 compounds and 2 Chinese herbal extracts were used to verify the prediction method.
@highlight The method simplifies the selection process of HSCCC solvent system obviously.
