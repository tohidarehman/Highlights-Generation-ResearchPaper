 The thermodynamic properties and phase behaviour of 1 3 diisopropylnaphthalene were studied for the first time using static vapour pressure measurements Tian Calvet calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry . Polymorphic behaviour of the compound was detected and studied in detail by combination of DSC and variable temperature X ray powder diffraction . The crystal structure of the disordered metastable phase was obtained using a single crystal X ray diffraction for the first time . The experimental study was supplemented by calculating thermodynamic properties in the ideal gas state using a combination of statistical thermodynamics and quantum chemical calculations . Recommended vapour pressure equation was derived by simultaneous treatment of vapour pressures experimental heat capacities of the condensed phases calculated ideal gas heat capacities and temperature and enthalpy of fusion assuring their mutual thermodynamic consistency .
