 Multi walled carbon nanotube reinforced polylactide nanocomposites were injected molded into a mold with micro needle patterns . In order to alleviate the hesitation effect caused by an increased melt viscositgy of PLA CNT nanocomposites the effects of the injection speed and holding pressure on the replication property were investigated . The effects of MWCNTs on the crystallization thermal behavior replication properties replication and surface properties of micro injection molded PLA CNT nanocomposites were investigated . An analysis of crystallinity and thermal behavior indicated that the MWCNTs promoted the unique

@highlight The surface quality of the microfeatures has been improved by elevating holding pressure and injection speed.
@highlight The MWCNTs promoted the unique to crystal transition of PLA enhancing the surface modulus and hardness.
@highlight The MWCNTs increased the activation energy for thermal degradation of PLA due to the physical barrier effect.
@highlight An equilibrium melting point depression technique was used to determine the specific interaction between PLA and MWCNTs.
