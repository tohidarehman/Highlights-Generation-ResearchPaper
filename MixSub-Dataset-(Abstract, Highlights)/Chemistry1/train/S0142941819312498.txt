 The aim of this study is to compare the mechanical properties of aged polymers measured at nano and macro scales in order to develop a fast characterization tools to predict polymer durability . Commercial thick PP PE copolymer samples were aged under artificial aging conditions . The evolution of the mechanical properties with aging time was studied either at nano scale using a nanoindenter and at macro scale using a Dynamic Mechanical Analysis aparatus nano and macro scale results were compared . Chemical degradation was monitored by infrared spectrometry and the surface topography was studied by Scanning Electron Microcopy . A Voigt model was used to calculate the Young s modulus of the bulk sample using the nano mechanical data and the results were compared to the measured macro Young s modulus . A good correlation was found between macro and nano scales as long as macroscopic defects such as cracks does not appeared . This work shows that nano indentation is a suitable technique to detect early stage degradation of polymers and therefore a powerful tool to predict durability of materials .

@highlight Phenomenons happening at nanometric scale during aging of polymers are not fully understood.
@highlight Elastic modulus variation with depth induced by aging follow an exponential law at nanometric scale.
@highlight Macroscopic defects such as cracks play a key role in the variation of mechanical properties during the aging of polymers.
@highlight Macro and nano scale correlation can be achieved by a mathematical model before the apparition of macroscopic defects.
@highlight Nanoindentation is a suitable technique for studying early days aging of polymers.
