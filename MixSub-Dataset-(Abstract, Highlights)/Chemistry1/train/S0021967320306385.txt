 The alkaloid enantiomers are well known to have different physiological and pharmacological effects and to play an important role in enantioselectivity metabolism with enzymes catalysis in tobacco plants . Here we developed an improved method for simultaneous and high precision determination of the individual enantiomers of nornicotine anatabine and anabasine in four tobacco matrices based on an achiral gas chromatography nitrogen phosphorus detector GC

@highlight Chiral derivatization combining achiral GC was applied to analyze alkaloid enantiomer.
@highlight  camphanic chloride derivatization was optimized by Box Benhnken design.
@highlight This method is validated for the identification of unknown alkaloids.
@highlight Cultivar has significant impact on enantiomer fraction of 
@highlight  nornicotine.
@highlight Enantiomer fraction of 
@highlight  anabasine shows a significant increase in curing processes.
