 The partition function of a molecule can be obtained by a direct sum over states calculation using the molecules quantum energy levels . These energies can be those obtained by a model fitted to experimental data . For molecules with exotic behaviour physically motivated models can be required . Often however such models can be limited in the range of quantum levels that can be reliably calculated making a converged SOS calculation impractical . Here we present a hybrid approach for prolate top molecules . Our hybrid approach allows the simple extension from a limited SOS calculation to a good approximation for the infinite sum limit . This is achieved by adding easily calculated closed form corrections to the limited SOS result . We test our approach using the Generalised SemiRigid Bender program as the physically motivated model . HOCl serves as a good test case because for it the GSRB model can extend to high enough levels for convergence of the direct SOS calculation . Then by limiting the range of GSRB calculated rotational levels included in the SOS we confirm our hybrid approach . The technique we present here should be particularly applicable to quasilinear molecules including those exhibiting quantum monodromy . The Appendix presents step by step instructions for implementing this hybrid procedure . Also presented there is a brief discussion of how to adapt the hybrid technique to approximately account for rotational or vibrational dissociation in the case that that is necessary .

@highlight We present an accelerated technique for calculating the molecular partition function.
@highlight The technique combines a limited sum over states calculation with a correction term.
@highlight The accuracy of this hybrid technique is validated by application to HOCl.
@highlight Convergence is much faster than with a pure sum over states SOS calculation.
@highlight The technique is applicable to prolate top molecules including quasilinear ones.
