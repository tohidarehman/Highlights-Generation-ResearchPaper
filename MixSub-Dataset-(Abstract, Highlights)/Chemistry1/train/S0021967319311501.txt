 In the present work NiFe layered double hydroxide Nylon 6 composite nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning method and used as a new sorbent for the extraction and measurement of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs in whole blood samples . The method is based on micro solid phase extraction by packed sorbent followed by HPLC UV analysis . Effective parameters on the extraction efficiency were optimized using a central composite design . In order to characterize the sorbent Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy thermogravimetric analysis field emission scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive X ray analysis and elemental mapping were applied . The method was fully validated based on linearity limits of detection and quantification precision and recovery . Under the optimal conditions LOD values were found to be 25ngmL
