 Microwave ultrasonic assisted aqueous enzymatic extraction was applied to extract tiger nut oil . The conditions of MUAAEE were optimized by Plackett Burman design followed Box Behnken design . An oil recovery of 85.23 was achieved under optimum conditions of a 2 concentration of mixed enzyme including cellulase pectinase and hemicellulase particle size 600m microwave power 300W ultrasonic power 460W radiation temperature 40C time 30 min enzymolysis temperature 45C pH 4.9 liquid to solid ratio 10mL g and time 180min . Oil by MUAAEE revealed the similar fatty acid compositions triglyceride compositions thermal behaviour and flavour compared with oil by Soxhlet extraction while the oil quality of MUAAEE is superior to that of SE . Scanning electron microscopy revealed that structural disruption of tiger nut caused by MUAAEE facilitated the oil extraction . Results suggest that MUAAEE could be an efficient and environment friendly method for extraction of TNO .

@highlight Microwave ultrasonic assisted aqueous enzymatic extraction MUAAEE is developed to extract tiger nut oil.
