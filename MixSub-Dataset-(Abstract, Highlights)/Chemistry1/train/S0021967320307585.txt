 Polymer grafting to porous materials is an effective way to create protein ion exchangers of high capacity and uptake rate because the 3D architecture of the polymeric ion exchange groups provides high binding space and facilitated transport of the bound protein . Herein a new anion exchanger was fabricated by grafting trimethyl ammonium chloride onto Sepharose FF gel for protein adsorption and chromatography . The ion exchanger denoted as FF pAPTAC presented high capacity but limited uptake rate in bovine serum albumin adsorption due to the high charge density of the cationic polymer chains . To solve the problem we proposed to copolymerize APTAC with an electroneutral monomer acrylamide onto Sepharose FF to modulate the charge density of the grafted polymer chains . By decreasing the feeding molar ratio of APTAC to AM the ionic capacity of the copolymerized resins FF pn decreased but the chain length could be remained almost unchanged due to the similar reactivity ratios of the two monomers . With decreasing IC the static adsorption capacity
