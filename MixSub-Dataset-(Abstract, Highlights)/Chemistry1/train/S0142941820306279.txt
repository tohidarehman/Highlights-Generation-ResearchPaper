 The aim of this work is to present a new approach to characterize the dielectric properties of elastomers especially at low frequencies and high electric field strength close to the operating conditions of dielectric elastomer actuators . By means of an electro rheological measuring cell static and alternating high electric field strength were applied to different types of acrylonitrile butadiene rubbers with varying content of polar acrylonitrile groups . Based on fundamental theory of electricity complex permittivity and polarization were calculated from Coulomb stress measurements at varying frequencies . During high voltage measurements it was observed that dielectric loss current increases if a certain critical field strength is exceeded . It is shown that polar NBR rubbers exhibit a critical field strength far below of the non polar polybutadiene rubber acting as a reference sample . NBR exhibits extraordinary high permittivity at low frequency which makes this material as a favorite candidate for DEA . Furthermore mechanical properties of NBR can be easily altered by application of an alternating electric field . This phenomenon opens new opportunities in a great variety of applications .
