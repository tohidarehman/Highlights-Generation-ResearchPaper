 This work describes the development of capacity orthogonal chromatography a new technique for simultaneously determining the loading capacity and orthogonality during the construction of two dimensional separations . Three steps were required for the construction of a COC based on the correlation between the selectivity factor

@highlight New method of 2D separation was developed.
@highlight The method could optimize orthogonality and loading capacity simultaneously.
@highlight Theoretical fundamental and practical terms of the new method were discussed.
@highlight The method was used to purity 228 mg corilagin from pomegranate flower extracts.
