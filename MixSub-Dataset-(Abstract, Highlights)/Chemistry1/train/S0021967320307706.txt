 In the chromatographic separation process of oligonucleotides mechanistic understanding of their binding and diffusion processes is of significant importance to determine operating conditions in a fast and robust way . In this work we determined the number of binding sites and the diffusivities of ONs in a polymer grafted anion exchange chromatography through linear gradient experiments being carried out at selected four to five gradient slopes . Synthetic poly s with length ranging from 3 to 90 mer were employed as a model of an antisense oligonucleotide with typical lengths of 10 30 bases . Comparison of the retention was also conducted between the grafted anion exchanger with a conventional ligand and an anion monolith disk . For the ONs up to 50 bases the number of binding sites determined can be correlated with the length of ONs and the grafted resin showed a better diffusion and narrower peak width compared to the nongrafted one . The retention behavior became similar for porous media when the longer ONs were applied . The results obtained suggest that antisense ONs can be separated with grafted ligands without sacrificing mass transfer properties .

@highlight The number of binding sites and oligonucleotides length have a linear correlation.
@highlight When using grafted resins intraparticle diffusion depends on salt concentration.
@highlight Intraparticle diffusion affects HETP less in grafted beads for long oligonucleotides.
@highlight Grafted resins have less intraparticle diffusion limitations among porous resins.
