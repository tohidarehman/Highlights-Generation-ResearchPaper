 In this work the purpose is to improve the solubility of fenbendazole by co solvent and study the effects of solubility parameters of solvents and solute on the solubility of objective compound . The solubility of fenbendazole in pure and mixed solvents was experimentally determined and correlated by some thermodynamic models . As expected the mole fraction solubility increased with increasing temperature and at 298.15K it was ranked in the following order 1 4 dioxane ethyl acetate acetone 1 butanol

@highlight The dissolution of fenbendazole in pure and mixed solvents.
@highlight Solute solvent interactions were analyzed.
@highlight The correlation results were evaluated by statistical analysis.
