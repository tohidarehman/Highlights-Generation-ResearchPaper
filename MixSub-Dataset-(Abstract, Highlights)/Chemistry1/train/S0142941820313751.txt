 Blends of poly and poly were evaluated using multiscale instrumental analyses to reveal the effects of blend ratio and crosslinking reagent . In the multiscale instrumental analyses molecular mobility from molecular to nano scales was examined by solid state NMR while the morphology at the micron scale was revealed by scanning electron microscopy . PHB rich blends adopted a sea island morphology and showed a larger maximum stress due to dispersed PHB filler . A PCL rich blend also adopted a sea island morphology but the sea domain consisted of PCL and showed a larger strain at break . An equal ratio PHB PCL blend had a bicontinuous morphology which showed lower maximum stress and lower strain at break because of large hemispherical defects . The crosslinking reagent changes these heterogeneous morphologies of PHB PCL blends to homogeneous at the micron scale which improved tensile properties . Even though the molecular mobility changed with the polymer content and the crosslinking reagent the bicontinuous and homogeneous morphologies more significantly affected the tensile properties of the PHB PCL blends .

@highlight Both PHB rich and PCL rich PHB PCL blends showed sea island morphology.
@highlight An equal ratio PHB PCL blend had lower tensile properties because of bicontinuous.
@highlight The crosslinker homogenized the blends enhancing
@highlight H spin lattice relaxation.
@highlight The crosslinker changed slow mobility depending on flexibility of component.
@highlight Morphology and mobility changes due to the crosslinker improved tensile properties.
