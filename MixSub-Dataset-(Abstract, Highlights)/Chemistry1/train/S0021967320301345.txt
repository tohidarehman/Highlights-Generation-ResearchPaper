 A simple portable and battery powered trapping device consisting of a purification tube a trapping unit and a miniature air pump was developed for the pre concentration of volatile organic sulfur compounds . The tested VOSCs including methanthiol ethanethiol dimethyl sulfide diethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide were firstly purged from water samples and then

@highlight A portable and battery powered trapping device was fabricated for
@highlight preconcentration of VOSCs.
@highlight The disadvantages associated with conventional sample storage methods for VOSCs analysis was overcome.
@highlight Long term preservation of VOSCs could be accomplished
@highlight collection with the developed trapping device.
@highlight Twenty six adsorbents were studied to find the most suitable adsorbent for the tested VOSCs.
