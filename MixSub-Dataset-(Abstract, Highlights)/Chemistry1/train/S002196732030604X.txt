 Eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid are essential fatty acids for human body which are widely used in the field of healthy food and medicine . Meanwhile there are some differences in their physiological functions such as scavenger for blood vessel of EPA and brain protector of DHA . In order to make full use of EPA and DHA it is necessary to prepare their high purity component . In this paper EPA and DHA were separated and purified by three zone simulated moving bed chromatography with C18 used as stationary phase and ethanol water as mobile phase . For the single column experiment a separation unit of SMB the effects of the ratio of ethanol to water pH value and temperature on the separation were investigated . The equilibrium dispersion model was used to obtain the adsorption parameters of EPA and DHA by inverse method and genetic algorithm and the accuracy of the adsorption parameters was verified by fitting the overloaded elution curves under different conditions . Based on the acquired nonlinear adsorption isotherms the complete separation region was found according to triangle theory . The effects of sample concentration flow ratios of adsorption zone and rectification zone and column distribution mode of SMB on the separation were investigated . Under the optimized SMB conditions the experimental result was that without regard to the other components the chromatographic purity and recovery values of EPA and DHA exceeded 99 with the productivity of 4.15g L h and the solvent consumption of 1.11L g .

@highlight Three zone SMB was adopted to separate EPA and DHA.
