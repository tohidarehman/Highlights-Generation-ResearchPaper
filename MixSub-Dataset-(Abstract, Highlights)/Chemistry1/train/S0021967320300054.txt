 Analyses of the complex essential oil samples using gas chromatography hyphenated with mass spectrometry generate large three way data arrays . Processing such large data sets and extracting meaningful information in the metabolic studies of natural products requires application of multivariate statistical techniques . From the GCMS raw data several different input data sets for the MSTs can be created including total chromatogram average mass spectra segmented average mass spectra and chemical composition . Herein we compared the performance of MSTs on average mass spectrum based data sets TCAMS and SAMS against chemical composition and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy in the evaluation of quality of ylang ylang essential oils based on their grade geographical origin and chemical composition using principal component analysis partial least squares regression and discriminatory analysis . PCA based on TCAMS SAMS and chemical composition showed clear trends amongst the samples based on increase in grade . PLS DA applied to TCAMS SAMS and ATR FTIR discriminated between all geographical origins . Predicted relative abundances of the 18 most important compounds using PLS regression models on TCAMS SAMS and ATR FTIR were successfully applied to ylang ylang essential oil quality assessment based on comparison with the ISO 3063 2004 standard where the SAMS data set showed superior performance compared to other data sets .
