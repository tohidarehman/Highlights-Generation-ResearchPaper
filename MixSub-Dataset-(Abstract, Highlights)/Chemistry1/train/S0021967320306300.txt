 In the present study we characterize a famous Pirkle type enantioselective stationary phase Whelk O1 from Regis Technologies and an equivalent enantiomeric phase in supercritical fluid chromatography with carbon dioxide methanol mobile phase . First the interactions contributing to retention are evaluated with a modified version of the solvation parameter model comprising five Abraham descriptors two additional descriptors to take account of molecular shape and two additional descriptors to take account of interactions with ionizable species D

@highlight Two Pirkle type stationary phases characterized for retention and enantioseparation.
@highlight Modified LSER including ionic interactions and analyte shape features.
@highlight Small spherical analytes are well included in chiral cleft and well resolved.
@highlight Analytes not fitting well to the chiral cleft may still be resolved through dipole dipole and H bond interactions.
