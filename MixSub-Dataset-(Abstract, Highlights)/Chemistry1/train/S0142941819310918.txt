 A simple experimental setup for temperature dependent mass spectrometric measurements has been constructed . It consists of a heated sample chamber and a mass spectrometer and allows for measurements under inert gas and ambient air . Based on initial measurements on two extruded polystyrene samples a methodology for the data analysis has been developed . With this methodology the outgassing temperature of volatile compounds which were used as blowing agents has been identified . Furthermore the composition of the blowing agents has been analyzed by temperature dependent mass spectra . The results indicate the use of ambient air in one material and a mixture of the banned blowing agents R142b and R22 both hydrochlorofluorocarbons in the other material . The here described methodology provides an easy to use approach to identify such compounds for example as part of environmental or quality control .

@highlight Temperature dependent mass spectra have been recorded with a simple in house build measurement setup allowing to study the outgassing behavior of polymeric materials.
@highlight Samples have been measured under inert helium and oxidative atmosphere ambient air and the effects of the temperature and pressure increase on the signa intensity have been studied.
@highlight Different approaches for the normalization of raw data have been proposed and evaluated.
@highlight The developed methodology allows to differentiate between two different materials of extruded polystyrene XPS based on their thermal behavior and the release of blowing agents.
@highlight In one sample material XPS B the two banned compounds R142b and R22 both hydrochlorofluorocarbons HCFC have been identified as blowing agents with this methodology.
