 A new type of restricted access media imprinted nanomaterials were successfully prepared on the surface of metal organic framework by reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization technology . Then it was applied as a dispersed solid phase extraction material in analysis of fluoroquinolones in untreated milk and river water by HPLC UV detection . The resulted material has a good binding amounts 60.81mg g

@highlight RAM MIPs based on MOF were prepared as DSPE material.
@highlight The method extracted FQs directly from untreated milk and river water successfully.
@highlight RAM MIPs possessed satisfactory protein exclusion properties.
