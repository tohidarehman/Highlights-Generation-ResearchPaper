 Electrical resistance and thermogram measurements were used to evaluate thermal transfer interfacial and mechanical properties of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic polycarbonate composites . Carbon nanotubes were fairly uniformly dispersed in polycarbonates using a solvent dispersion method . The CNTs were then further dispersed with an additional time using a twin screw extruder . The effect of CNT on the mechanical properties of polycarbonate was evaluated using a thin film tensile test . For thermogram to evaluate the transferring temperature the composite was placed on a hotplate and copper wires were inserted in the composite at uniform thickness intervals . Due to the different inherent thermal conductivity of CNT ER was measured to detect thermal changes in the carbon fiber CNT polycarbonate composites . The comparison of interlaminar shear strength was to investigate effects of CNT on mechanical and interfacial properties . The uniform distribution of CNTs affected all of these properties in carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic composite . Furthermore heat transfer and heat release become more rapid with the addition of CNT than the without case .
