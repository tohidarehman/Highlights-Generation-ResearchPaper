 The first quantitative multiclass approach enabling the accurate quantification of 1200 biotoxins pesticides and veterinary drugs in complex feed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry has been developed . Optimization of HPLC UHPLC and MS MS conditions were carried out in order to allow the combination of five major substance classes and the high number of target analytes with different physico chemical properties . Cycle times and retention windows were carefully optimized and ensured appropriate dwell times reducing the overall measurement error . Validation was carried out in two compound feed matrices according to the EU SANTE validation guideline . Apparent recoveries matching the acceptable range of 60 140 accounted 60 and 79 for all analytes in cattle and chicken feed respectively . High extraction efficiencies were obtained for all analyte matrix combinations and revealed matrix effects as the main source for deviation of the targeted performance criteria . Concerning the methods repeatability 99 of all analytes in chicken and 96 in cattle feed complied with the acceptable RSD 20 criterion . Limits of quantification were between 1 10 g kg for the vast majority of compounds . Finally the methods applicability was tested in 130 real compound feed samples and provides first insights into co exposure of agro contaminants in animal feed .

@highlight An LCMS MS method for biotoxins pesticides and veterinary drugs was developed.
