 In this study wound dressings consisting of dexpanthenol loaded electrospun nanofibers were fabricated using polyvinyl alcohol sodium alginate and chitosan as the core and the shell respectively . Considering the remarkable properties of chitosan it was used as a shell against drug release and to improve the thermal stability and tensile strength of the scaffold . By comparing the thermogravimetric and tensile strength results of nanofibers with and without shell it was revealed that the presence of chitosan in the shell side could improve the thermal stability and increased the tensile strength by about three times . The isotherm models of dexpanthenol release from the PVA SA Dex CS scaffold was best described by the Langmuir model . Besides Fourier transform infrared scanning electron microscopy and X ray diffraction techniques were performed to characterize nanofibers . Furthermore an in vivo investigation of a wound dressing with dexpanthenol showed better healing compared to the wound dressings without dexpanthenol .

@highlight The uniform fibers were made using natural alginate polymers.
@highlight Chitosan shells increased the thermal stability of the wound dressing.
@highlight The drug release was performed in a controlled manner and based on the Langmuir isotherm model.
@highlight Wound healing was accelerated by drug loaded nanofibers.
