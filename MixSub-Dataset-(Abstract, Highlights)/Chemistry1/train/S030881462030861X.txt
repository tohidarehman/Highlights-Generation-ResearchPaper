 The thermal degradation of bisphenol A and bisphenol S was investigated in water and fish fillets . Ultrasound assisted solvent extraction followed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry was used to analyze residues in fish . Good instrumental linearity r

@highlight The thermal degradation of BPA and BPS was studied using a non targeted approach.
@highlight BPA and BPS did not degrade in water under thermal treatment 100C 1h .
@highlight BPA and BPS degraded in fish matrices under thermal treatment 100C 1h .
@highlight The thermal degradation BPA and BPS is different in the 3 models tested.
