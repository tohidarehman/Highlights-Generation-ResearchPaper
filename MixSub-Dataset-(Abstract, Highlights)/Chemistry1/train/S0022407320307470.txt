 Haze incorporating abundant charged aerosol has become a main air problem in various metropolitan cities worldwide . Studying the propagation characteristics of electromagnetic wave in charged haze aerosol is conducive to calibrate instruments designed based on energy attenuation of EMW and is critical to providing guidance for deployment of network base stations . Here we simulated haze conditions by quantitatively controlling the concentration water content and charge quantity of aerosols in laboratory and first found that attenuation coefficient of EMW changes linearly with these factors . In addition we proposed a method to determine the complex dielectric constant of haze aerosols . Upon this a new model which combines the surface conductivity of a single particle at micro level with the charge density of the aerosol at macro level was developed to quantitatively evaluate the contributions of aerosol concentration water content and charges on the attenuation of EMW . The results show that when EMW propagates in charged haze aerosol its attenuation coefficient can be quantitatively characterized by mass concentration particle moisture and charge to mass ratio of aerosol . And the simulated results are in good agreement with the experiments .

@highlight While electromagnetic EMW propagate in a haze containing charged aerosols the energy of EMW suffers attenuation. Here we simulate haze conditions by quantitatively controlling the concentration water content and charge quantity of aerosols. We are the first to determine that the attenuation coefficient of EMW changes linearly with all these factors.
@highlight Then a new macroscopic model is presented to calculate the attenuation coefficient of EMW.
@highlight Finally we not only demonstrate that our results are in good agreement with the experimental but also used this model to pro effective guidance in the deployment of networks base stations.
