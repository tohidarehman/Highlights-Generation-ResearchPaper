 Table olives a widely consumed delicacy are often selected by consumers based on the shade of their green color . The appealing coloration of fresh olives fades to brown or pale yellow during the industrial processing necessary for commercialization and storage as a result of the degradation of chlorophyll a and b to their corresponding pheophytins and other chlorophyll degradation products . The re greening of table olives may be achieved by complexation of CDP with Cu

@highlight UHPLC ICP ID MS was first used to measure copper chlorophylls.
@highlight Most chlorophylls in bright green table olives were complexed with copper.
@highlight Bright green table olives contained total elemental copper above natural abundance.
@highlight ICP ID MS provides quantitation of copper chlorophylls without using reference materials.
@highlight High total elemental copper and copper chlorophyll content may be achieved by addition of copper salts.
