 Diagenetic aromatic carotenoids and degradation products which are derived from the carotenoids of photosynthetic sulfur bacteria were characterized in the aromatic fraction of Brazilian Cretaceous crude oils by high temperature comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time of flight mass spectrometry . Unresolved complex mixtures coeluting compounds and limited mass spectrometric identification were noted by traditional one dimensional GCMS screening of aromatic compounds . Group type separation on a two dimensional chromatographic plane first and second dimension retention times
