 Micro variations of lipid hydrocarbons and biomarkers in well laminated shales have not been extensively documented especially within different rock textures fabrics and mineralogies . Comparison of a pyrite cemented zone and its surrounding sediment may offer a new perspective on mineral control on preservation of hydrocarbons and organic carbon . A black well laminated shale comprising two adjacent and contrasting calcareous and pyrite laminae at the millimetre scale was selected from the Eocene Shahejie Formation Dongying Depression Bohai Bay Basin . It was horizontally sliced to separate a pyrite cemented concretion from the unaltered laminated shale and investigated using geochemical techniques to assess the heterogeneity of elements minerals microfossils and hydrocarbons within the two slices . Micro scale changes in source inputs were noted . For instance the 4 methylsteranes dinosteranes and the triaromatic dinosteranes show varying distributions between the two slices attributed to slight differences in dinoflagellate contributions . Similarly variation in the amount of bacterial sulfate reduction is indicated by variations in the aryl isoprenoid ratio relative amount of isorenieratane long chain
