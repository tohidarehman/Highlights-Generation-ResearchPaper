 To persuade the stent coating materials for the better sustainable development a block copolymer composed of hydrophobicity of poly and hydrophilicity of PTMC bearing ethylene glycol chains was synthesized as a potential candidate . The result of thermal stability of the polymer was analyzed which reached up to 206C

@highlight Block copolymer of hydrophobic poly trimethylene carbonate PTMC and hydrophilic ethylene glycol were synthesized.
@highlight PTMC derivatives possessed the ester free structure which does not produce any acidic organic compounds after degradation.
@highlight Surface properties of the dip coating films were evaluated by contact angles with temporal change.
@highlight Protein adsorption and blood platelet adhesion were tested on the dip coated films.
@highlight The block copolymer is expected the coating material such as stent coating.
