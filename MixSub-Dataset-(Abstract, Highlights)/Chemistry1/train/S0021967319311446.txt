 A simple magnetization method was developed for the preparation of magnetic materials from conventional solid phase packing though coprecipitation and solvothermal approaches . And the prepared magnetic materials were used for magnetic solid phase extraction of biogenic amines from beers . Furthermore to improve the analytical throughput a solid phase on situ quadraplex isotope dimethyl labeling method was developed for the quantification of BAs by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry LC

@highlight An efficient method for preparation of magnetic solid phase adsorbent.
@highlight A more favorable labeling method based on solid phase on situ labeling.
@highlight A multiplex dimethyl labeling for more efficient analysis of biogenic amines.
