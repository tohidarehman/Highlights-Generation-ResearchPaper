 Nitrocellulose based propellants require stabilizers to avoid early decomposition or even explosion during storage . A series of novel fullerene malonamide derivatives with different carbon chain lengths on the

@highlight Six novel fullerene malonamide stabilizers for nitrocellulose have been designed and synthesized.
@highlight The molecular structures of fullerene malonamide stabilizers were confirmed by NMR FT IR UVvis and HRMS.
@highlight Stability of fullerene malonamide stabilizers was better than traditional stabilizers C2 and DPA.
@highlight Stability mechanisms of novel fullerene malonamide stabilizers were studied by EPR FT IR and LC MS.
@highlight Fullerene malonamide stabilizers can react with the nitroxide radicals released from NC pyrolysis.
