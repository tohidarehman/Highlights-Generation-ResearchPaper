 Optical non invasive techniques for temperature and mole fraction measurements in flames and other reactive flows are often limited to applications under well defined laboratory environments . These limitations mainly arise from various prerequisites of the techniques e.g . regarding the optical accessibility of the systems under investigation its environmental conditions such as vibrations and temperature or the need of tracers inside the flow . In order to weaken these constrains we present a robust fiber based sensor system utilizing tracer free spontaneous rotational Raman spectroscopy with tunable near infrared continuous wave laser excitation capable of a simultaneous point wise determination of gas temperature and mole fractions in laminar spatially uniform non sooting reactive flows . Benefits and limits of this method are evaluated investigating a laminar premixed methane air flat flame of a McKenna type burner . In that case the main rotational Raman active and therefore detectable compounds are nitrogen oxygen and carbon dioxide . For the subtraction of flame luminosity two different techniques were used simple background subtraction and shifted excitation Raman difference spectroscopy . For both methods the corrected spectra are matched to simulated spectra via a least square fit algorithm in order to extract the quantities of interest . Hereby Bayesian inference enables the determination of the uncertainties of the results . The consideration of the covariance within the multi variate analysis allows for the combination of the BGS and SERDS method to establish a more advanced analysis routine .
