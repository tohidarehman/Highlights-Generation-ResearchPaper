 Designing and manufacturing functional parts with enhanced mechanical property is a major goal of fused filament fabrication for polymeric elastomers which exhibits major advantages in producing such parts with a range of structures . But the unsatisfactory mechanical performance constrains greatly its real application and there is yet no consensus in the mechanical characterization of printed samples . This work takes the nozzle height as the considered factor and tests the tensile property of FFF printed thermoplastic polyurethane . Rheological property of the TPU melt represented here by die swell behavior and shear viscosity were measured initially to obtain a preliminary assessment of the material suitability and an optimization of melt extrusion conditions for FFF processing . Then correlation between the cross section profile of deposited bead and the tensile performance of printed sample were evaluated . Both the shape of deposited bead and the bonding strength of two adjacent beads are emphasized when explaining the measured tensile strength . The significance of molecular permeation efficiency at bead bead interfaces and bonding releasing patterns between adjacent beads to the tensile failure of printed objects is discussed .

@highlight The effect of nozzle height on tensile properties of FFF printed TPU part was explored based on the evolution of bead profile and molecule diffusion.
@highlight Rheological analysis provided an initial assessment of material suitability for FFF processing. Temperature difference was found between the set and measured values.
@highlight An insight of tensile property dependence was obtained through two bonded adjacent beads with three contacting models.
