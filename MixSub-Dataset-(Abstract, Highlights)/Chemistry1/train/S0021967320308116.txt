 High to ultrahigh molar mass anionic polys are widely used industrial polymers for water treatment and oil drilling . Their properties are strongly related to their charge density and molar mass distributions . However due to inherent separation limits of SEC with currently available columns 5 10

@highlight Size based separation of ultra high polyelectrolytes up to 10 MDa.
@highlight Optimization of electrophoretic separations to reduce aggregation phenomenon.
@highlight Molar mass distributions obtained from electropherograms using a calibration curve.
@highlight Differences in polyelectrolyte charge density vanished by normalization of mobility.
