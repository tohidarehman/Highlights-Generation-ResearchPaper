 Comprehensive two dimensional liquid chromatography offers increased peak capacity resolution and selectivity compared to one dimensional liquid chromatography . It is commonly accepted that the technique produces the best results when the separation mechanisms in the two dimensions are completely orthogonal which necessitates the use of gradient elution for each second dimension fraction . Recently the use of similar separation mechanisms in both dimensions has been gaining popularity but full or shifted gradients are still used for each second dimension fraction . Herein we argue that when the separation mechanisms are correlated in the two dimensions the best results can be obtained with the use of parallel gradients in the second dimension which makes the technique nearly as user friendly as comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography . This has been illustrated through the separation of a mixture of 39 pharmaceutical compounds using reversed phase in both dimensions . Different selectivity in the second dimension was obtained through the use of different stationary phase chemistries and or mobile phase organic modifiers . The best coverage of the separation space was obtained when parallel gradients were applied in both dimensions and the same was true for practical peak capacity .

@highlight LCLC separations can be performed using similar separation mechanisms in both dimensions.
@highlight Different types of gradients were compared using emulated and real on line systems.
@highlight Parallel gradients provide the best results when the separation mechanisms are correlated.
