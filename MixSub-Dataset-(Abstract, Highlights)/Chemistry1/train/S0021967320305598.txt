 Polysaccharide based chiral stationary phases are the most used chiral selectors in HPLC . These CSPs can be used in normal polar organic and aqueous organic mobile phases . However normal and polar organic mobile phases are not adequate for chiral separation of polar compounds for the analysis of aqueous samples and for MS detection . In these situations reversed phase conditions without the usual non volatile additives incompatible with MS detection are preferable . Moreover in most of the reported chiral chromatographic methods retention is too large for routine work . In this paper the chiral separation of 53 structurally unrelated compounds is studied using three commercial amylose based CSPs coated amylose tris
