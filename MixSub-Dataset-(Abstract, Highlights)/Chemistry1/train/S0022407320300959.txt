 Product channel specific reaction kinetics at low temperature presents a significant challenge for both experiment and theory but provides essential inputs for astrochemical models of cold interstellar environments . Reaction kinetics studies using chirped pulse Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy provide a potential solution but require the use of a buffer gas to thermalize the reactants and products however collisions with the buffer gas reduce the length of the detected signal the free induction decay through pressure broadening . The effect of this on time domain signals is largely unexplored using CP FTMW spectrometers . A new E band spectrometer has been constructed using previously unavailable equipment in order to maximize its performance for detecting molecules in collisional environments . The design of this spectrometer is described in detail . The pressure broadening of OCS in He was used to test the spectrometer under collisional conditions similar to those that are routinely used to perform reaction kinetics measurements . The corresponding pressure broadening coefficients for transitions in this frequency range were determined at room temperature and the performance of the spectrometer was assessed in relation to recently reported chirped pulse in uniform flow experiments .
