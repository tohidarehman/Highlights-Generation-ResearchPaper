 Traditional polymer separation methods such as size exclusion chromatography and liquid adsorption chromatography can not provide separations exclusively based on the number of deprotonated carboxylic acid groups along the backbone chain of polymers . A novel separation method based on non aqueous ion exchange chromatography was developed which allows such a separation of acid functional polymers that are soluble in organic solvents . The polar aprotic N methyl 2 pyrrolidone was found to be a suitable solvent . It features a high relative permittivity and it is a good solvent for polymers and organic salts such as triethyl ammonium formate . A negative charge is established on these polymers by deprotonation of the carboxylic acid groups in the presence of an organic superbase . Traditional potent organic bases such as triethylamine do not possess the base strength to compensate for the increase in p
