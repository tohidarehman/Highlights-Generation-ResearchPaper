 This paper proposed an accurate and sensitive analytical method based on the combination of Liquid Chromatography Quadrupole Time of Flight Tandem Mass Spectrometry system with Quadruple Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry ID

@highlight An accurate and precise method was developed for determination of diuron.
@highlight The LOD and LOQ values were found to be 14.6 and 46.5gkg
@highlight  respectively.
@highlight ID
@highlight MS strategy was implemented after the synthesis of diuron d6.
@highlight Developed method was applied to seaweed samples with satisfactory percent recoveries.
