 In this study 3179 and 3813 rotational transition frequencies for indole and 1 2 3 4 tetrahydroquinoline respectively were analyzed using the PGOPHER software . In both analyses all the matrix elements of the sextic rotational Hamiltonians were fitted simultaneously to the hyperfine quadrupole terms . The global fits of all the transition frequencies provided the most precise ground state molecular parameters for both molecules so far . The presented experimental results are in concordance with the density functional theory calculations .

@highlight The ground states of heterocyclic organic molecules were investigated.
@highlight The rotational data were corrected and re analysed.
@highlight The molecular constants of indole and 1 2 3 4 tetrahydroquinoline are presented.
@highlight The DFT calculations were performed for both molecules.
