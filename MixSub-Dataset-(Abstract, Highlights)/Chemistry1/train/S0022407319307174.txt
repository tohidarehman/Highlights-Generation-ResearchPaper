 The photonic jet generated by an ellipsiod illuminated by a plane wave is investigated . The open source software DDSCAT is used in our calculation . The influences of polarization ellipticity particle size the wavelength of the incident wave and the relative refractive index of the particle to the surrounding medium on the jet intensity waist width and length are analyzed . Numerical results show that we can manipulate the main characteristics of photonic jet by changing the above five parameters . These results of photonic jet can help us to achieve a nanoantenna with the function of generating a specific beam .
