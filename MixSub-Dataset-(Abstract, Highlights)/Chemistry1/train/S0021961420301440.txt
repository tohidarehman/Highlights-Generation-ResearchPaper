 Although salt ions severely distort the gas hydrate lattice this phenomenon is poorly realized in the existing statistical thermodynamics models . We propose a mechanistic model by addressing a novel concept of instability in the hydrate water film arising due to salt exclusion . The consequent water reorientation in the unstable lattice due to excluded ions is described in terms of the stress buildup in the hydrate lattice using Poiriers theory of crystal creep . Tolmans theory is reworked to account for the combined influence of guest and salt concentration on the surface energy of the phases in contact . Together with an empirical conformational term the three phase hydrate equilibrium is modelled . To describe the liquid phase non ideality the UNIQUAC and Pitzer activity coefficient models are combined . For vapour phase Patel and Teja equation of state is used whereas for hydrate phase Klauda and Sandler model is utilized . The particle swarm optimization is hybridized with simplex search algorithm to identify the model parameters . The proposed thermo physical hydrate model exhibits an improved performance over the existing models which is quantified in terms of absolute average relative deviation with respect to the experimental data .
