 A novel crystalline nano cellulose and polyvinyl amine based nanocomposite membranes were synthesized and evaluated for biogas upgrading . Different concentrations of CNC was incorporated in 3wt PVAm solution on commercial polysulfone sheet using dip coating method . The effect of feed pressure was investigated for the CO

@highlight Incorporation of CNC increased the facilitated transport of CO
@highlight Increasing CNC concentration increased membrane thickness and crystallinity.
@highlight Addition CNC does not affect the transportation of CH
@highlight Increasing feed pressure reduces membrane performance.
