 The number of particle size distribution sampling points is an important factor to affect the accuracy of dynamic light scattering inversion . If the number of sampling points is not selected properly the accuracy of inversion results will be reduced or results will deviate seriously from the true value . To solve the problem combining non negative truncated singular value decomposition by studying the relationship between number of sampling points relative error of PSD and number of autocorrelation function channels it is concluded that the upper limit of optimal sampling points is limited by the number of ACF channels . Under different sampling points the study of RE of PSD and the residual of electric field ACF shows that there is a weak similarity between them . Then a criterion for determining the optimal number of sampling point is constructed . Finally a non negative constrained TSVD method for PSD adaptive sampling is proposed according to the upper limit condition of optimal number of sampling points and its determination criterion . Simulated DLS data for unimodal particles of 160 channels and bimodal particles of 120 channels were inverted under three noise levels of 110

@highlight For NNTSVD accurate particle sizing rely on optimal sampling points selection.
@highlight The number of sampling points must be less than the number of ACF channels.
@highlight There is weak similarity between the relative error of PSD and the residual of ACF.
@highlight Optimal sampling points can be achieved by minimum residual criterion.
