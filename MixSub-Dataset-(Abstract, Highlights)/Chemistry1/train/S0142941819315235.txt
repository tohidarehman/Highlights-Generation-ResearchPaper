 Mixed matrix membranes have received worldwide attention for natural gas purification due to their superior performance in terms of permeability and selectivity . The zeolitic imidazole framework 8 blended polysulfone membranes have been fabricated for natural gas purification . ZIF 8 was selected due to its low cost remarkable thermal and chemical stabilities and tunable microporous structure . The neat PSf hollow fiber membrane and mixed matrix hollow fiber membranes incorporated with the various ZIF 8 loadings up to 1.25 were fabricated . The prepared membranes were evaluated using field emission scanning electron microscopy thermogravimetric analysis differential scanning calorimetry Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atomic force microscopy and gas separation performance . The low loading of ZIF 8 nanoparticles to the MMM improved thermal stability and glass transition temperature and yielded low surface roughness . MMMs were tested using pure gases with a significant improvement of 36 in CO
