 Sealants incorporated in the lids of food cans to ensure the can is hermetically sealed are formulated from a wide variety of compounds . These compounds and associated non intentionally added substances could migrate to the food contained in the can . In this work ion mobility quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry coupled to ultra high performance liquid chromatography has been used to obtain ion mobility filtered extracted ion chromatograms . Subsequently accurate mass precursor ions and their fragments have been used to identify the compounds migrating from the sealant to the content of the cans . Moreover the correlation between the collision cross section values and

@highlight Migrants come from sealants used in food cans.
@highlight Seven migrants were found in the food simulants.
@highlight Five non intentionally added substances NIAS were detected.
