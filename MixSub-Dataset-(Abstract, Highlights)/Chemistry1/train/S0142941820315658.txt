 Biopolymer nanocomposites due to their distinctive properties and biodegradability can sustainably replace conventional polymers . Biopolymers have a massive spectrum in hydrogels environmental biomedical field bio coating sensors etc . The rheological study has been investigated to essay the viscoelastic behavior of the aqueous solution and thin films of GO reinforced PVA nanocomposite thin films . The resultant nanocomposite films have the potential to be employed in the packaging and coating domain . The viscosity curve purports the shear thinning behavior of the aqueous solution of PVA GO nanocomposite . The data evaluated from Ostwald representing flow curves could also be attributed to pseudoplastic behavior in which coefficient p 1 . Neat PVA has 162.3mPas Newtonian viscosity compared to 1 of GO PVA i.e . 66.01mPas which is quite high . XPS analysis has been conducted to evaluate the kinetics of the dispersion of nanofiller in the solvent . Water absorption kinetics revealed the behavior of bionanocomposites against moisture for packaging and biomedical applications it is mandatory to evaluate the moisture uptake capacity of polymer especially for hydrogels applications . XRD and FTIR analysis have been conducted to assay the formation of polymer nanocomposite by validating the characteristic peak of GO .

@highlight Rheological study has been carried out to unveil the dynamics in polymer when shear stress is applied.
@highlight The high surface area of GO results in load transfer hence increase in mechanical strength is observed.
@highlight Pseudoplastic behavior is observed on addition of GO nanoparticles.
@highlight The resultant nanocomposites can be well suited for paints and coating applications.
