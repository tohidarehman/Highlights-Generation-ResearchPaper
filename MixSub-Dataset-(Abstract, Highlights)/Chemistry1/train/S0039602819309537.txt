 Intercalation of metals at a graphene substrate interface can modify the electronic and vibration properties of the graphene . We investigated the intercalation of Au at the graphene polycrystalline Ni interface by scanning electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy and Raman scattering spectroscopy . Graphene coverage induces step bunching on the poly crystalline Ni surface . Au intercalation selectively occurs at the graphene Ni facets and changes the secondary electron contrast as well as recovering intrinsic graphene Raman signals . Au nanoparticles are observed only on the Ni facets and are absent on the narrow step bunched regions . High angle annular dark field images indicates the presence of monolayer Au only at the graphene Ni interface .

@highlight Au intercalation at the graphene poly crystalline Ni interface was investigated.
@highlight Graphene coverage induced step bunching was observed in situ.
@highlight Au intercalation selectively occurred at the graphene Ni 111 facet.
@highlight Au intercalation changed secondary electron contrast.
@highlight Difference in electronic states of graphene with without intercalation affects the phenomena.
