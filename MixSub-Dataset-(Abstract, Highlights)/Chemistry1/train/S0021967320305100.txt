 The separation of the enantiomers of mepromazine promethazine thioridazine and alimemazine was studied by nonaqueous capillary electrophoresis in the presence of cyclodextrins using 1 M acetic acid and 50 mM ammonium acetate in methanol as background electrolyte . Heptakis cyclodextrin heptakis cyclodextrin and octakis cyclodextrin were the most effective chiral selectors for mepromazine promethazine and alimemazine . Subsequently a method for the determination of dextromepromazine as chiral impurity of levomepromazine was developed employing quality by design principles . Using HDMS CD as selector a fractional factorial resolution V design was employed for evaluating the knowledge space while a central composite face centered design provided further method optimization and the basis for the computation of the design space by Monte Carlo simulations . The final experimental conditions included a 30 40.2 cm fused silica capillary with 75 m inner diameter and a background electrolyte composed of 0.75 M acetic acid and 55 mM ammonium acetate in methanol containing 27.5 mg mL HDMS CD . The applied voltage was 22 kV and the capillary temperature was 15C . Following method robustness testing via a Plackett Burman design the method was validated for dextromepromazine in the range of 0.01 to 3.0 relative to a concentration of 0.74 mg mL levomepromazine and applied to the analysis of reference standards of the European Pharmacopoeia and commercial tablets . The assay also allowed the detection of levomepromazine sulfoxide although the quantitation of the compound was hampered by the poor peak shape of the late migrating diastereomer .
