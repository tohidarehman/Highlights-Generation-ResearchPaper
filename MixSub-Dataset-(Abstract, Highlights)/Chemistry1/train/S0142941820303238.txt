 Optical properties of a blend thin film of poly and phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester exposed to a stepwise heating and cooling have been reported and compared with the properties of pure PCBM and P3HT films . The UVVis

@highlight UVVis 
@highlight  method reveals thermal inducted changes of thin film properties.
@highlight Thermo optical studies on the pristine PCBM film demonstrate its stability.
@highlight Pure P3HT film reveals the constant conjugation and reversible structural defects.
@highlight Thermal treatment of P3HT PCBM film up to 140C increases order in P3HT phase.
@highlight Exceeding 140C results in degradation of blend due to formation of PCBM clusters.
