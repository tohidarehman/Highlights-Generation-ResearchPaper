 FTIR ATR FPA spectroscopic imaging was used to obtain depth resolved information about degradation of a polyester melamine coating by performing measurements on drilled conical holes . The results of the FTIR FPA imaging show that combined effect of UV and moisture resulted in larger degradation effects in the outermost parts of the coatings but loss of melamine functionality was detected to the depth of approximately 810m after 2163h weathering in QUVA accelerated test and after 4 years exposure in a marine environment . Longer periods of accelerated weathering up to 4000h resulted in degradation through the whole coating outer layer .

@highlight FTIR FPA spectroscopic imaging was used for studies of degradation of polyester melamine coil coating.
@highlight Depth resolved chemical imaging of degradation effects was performed on drilled conical holes in the coating.
@highlight Depth profiling of the melamine band intensity was made by FTIR ATR FPA imaging.
@highlight Loss of melamine functionality was detected to the depth of 8 10 m for OUVA accelerated weathering and field exposure.
@highlight The degradation effects were larger in the outermost parts of the coatings as a combined effect of UV light and moisture.
