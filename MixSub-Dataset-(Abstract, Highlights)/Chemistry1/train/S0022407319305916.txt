 The Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment is a satellite based mission that has been probing the Earth s atmosphere via solar occultation since February 2004 . Instruments on board include a high resolution Fourier transform spectrometer and a pair of filtered imagers . A new processing version has been implemented for these instruments . Analysis for the ACE FTS instrument makes use of the latest spectroscopic information and features improved accuracy in forward model calculations including a new instrumental line shape and employing a 100m altitude sub grid within the tangent layer of the 1km altitude grid employed in previous processing versions . Changes were made in the handling of solar and deep space calibration spectra to avoid systematic errors that impacted previous processing versions . Emphasis was placed on improving software robustness as well as minimizing occurrences of unphysical oscillation in retrieved profiles . Seven new molecules and three new isotopologues were added to the list of atmospheric constituents retrieved from the previous processing version for a total of 44 molecules and 24 isotopologues . For the imagers forward model calculations were changed to a 100m altitude grid in version 4 processing .
