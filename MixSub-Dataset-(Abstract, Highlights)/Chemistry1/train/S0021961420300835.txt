 In the present communication measurements of experimental density speed of sound and viscosity of binary liquid mixtures of 2 ethanol with dipropylamine diethylamine and triethylamine have been carried out within the temperature range of 298.15K308.15K with temperature interval of 5K . To study the intermolecular interactions present in these liquid mixtures parameters like excess molar volume

@highlight Binary mixtures of 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethanol with amine were investigated.
@highlight Various excess and deviation properties were computed.
@highlight Interactions present between unlike molecules were discussed.
@highlight Redlich Kister polynomial was used for the correlation of excess properties.
