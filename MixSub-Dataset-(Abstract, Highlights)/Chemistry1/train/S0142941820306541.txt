 Ultrasonic testing as a non destructive evaluation technique is newly introduced to characterize additively manufactured composite materials to identify their anisotropic mechanical properties being especially facile useful and accurate approach for dimensional dependent measurement . In this study the immersion ultrasonic technique is employed to measure the energy loss of ultrasonic elastic waves and wave propagation speed in the laser sintered nanocomposite of carbon nanotube reinforced polyamine 12 . The relationship of process structure property is revealed to establish the correlations between process parameters and energy loss of ultrasound as well as mechanical moduli . The orientation dependent wave attenuation and mechanical moduli of nanocomposites along three orthogonal directions are strongly associated with the layer by layer fusion induced microstructures and internal imperfections . This technique is capable of quantifying orientation dependent mechanical properties such as moduli and attenuation without compromising additively manufactured parts showing a high potential of quality control and safety inspection in end use applications .

@highlight Ultrasonic NDE is a facile economic and effective measurement approach to quantify the wave propagation speed and hence anisotropic mechanical modulus of AM built nanocomposite along different orientations.
@highlight The interactions of ultrasonic wave with the microstructure of nanocomposites are investigated and thus to reveal the process structure property relationship via laser sintered nanocomposites.
@highlight The material damping of ultrasonic wave is associated with imperfections induced by the layer by layer building process.
