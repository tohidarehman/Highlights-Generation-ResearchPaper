 Rockwool is an inorganic fiber with interesting properties obtained from basaltic rocks . It can possibly be used in rubber technical products which work under critical conditions in several industries . This study aims to investigate properties of three short rockwool fibers nitrile rubber composites . Ten formulations were prepared with 10 25 and 40 phr of rockwool fibers with different length and modification . The composites were assessed on its morphological aspects thermal rheological and mechanical behaviors . The results remarked that the rockwool fiber with chemical modification had better interfacial interaction with the polymer enhancing modulus at 100 of deformation Shore A hardness tear strength Payne effect and stress relaxation under a compressive regime . An outstanding result was observed for the composite with 10 phr of fiber with chemical modification that had less stress relaxation when compared with the unfilled NBR indicating an excellent possibility of use of this fiber in materials that work under compressive forces . The difference in length of the rockwool fibers did not interfere significantly on most of the results .

@highlight All fibers studied did not interfere on vulcanization times of NBR.
@highlight Payne effect reduced considerably on composites with modified fiber.
@highlight SEM micrographs showed the stronger rubber fiber adhesion in composites with modified fiber.
@highlight Composite R2 10 had lower stress relaxation under a compressive regime when compared to the NBR.
@highlight Tensile strength results and SEM micrographs suggested that the fibers did not assume a preferential orientation on the polymeric matrixes.
