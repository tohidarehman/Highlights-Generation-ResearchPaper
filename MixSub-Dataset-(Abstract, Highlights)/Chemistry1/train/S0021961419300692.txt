 This work presents the experimental data on thermophysical properties of aqueous solutions of imidazolium based ionic liquids such as 1 Ethyl 3 Methylimidazolium Ethylsulfate EtSO

@highlight Thermophysical data in dilute aqueous region of Imidazolium ILs at different temp.
@highlight Excess molar volumes V
@highlight are positive for EMIM EtSO
@highlight  while negative for other ILs
@highlight Increasing concentration increases ion ion interaction with hydrophobic hydration
@highlight Water structure making nature is EMIM Tos EtSO
@highlight  MeSO
@highlight  MMIM MeSO
