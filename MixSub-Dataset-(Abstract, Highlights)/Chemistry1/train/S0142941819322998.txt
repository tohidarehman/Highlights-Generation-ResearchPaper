 EPDM rubber gaskets as a water proof sealing material installed in the tunnel segment joints were subjected to compressive stress thermo oxidative ageing at different temperature and compressive stress levels . It was found that compared with thermo oxidative ageing compressive stress thermo oxidative ageing of EPDM samples was more aggressive due to the destructive effect of compressive stress the molecular structure was oxidized to form oxygenated species such as carbonyl groups while high compressive stress level resulted in the degradation of EPDM with lower degradation activation energy

@highlight Durable sealing resilience of EPDM deteriorated during stress thermo ageing.
@highlight EPDM molecules were oxidized and degraded with lower
@highlight under thermo stress.
@highlight Breakage of CB network structure and phase separation occurred under thermo stress.
@highlight Crosslinking outweighed chain scission leading to increase of crosslinking density.
@highlight Stress promoted degradation while thermo oxidative ageing promoted crosslinking.
