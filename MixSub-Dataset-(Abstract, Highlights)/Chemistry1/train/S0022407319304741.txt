 Comparing to the 1 D resonators like strips the 2 D resonators such as squares can excite the higher order 2 D magnetic plasmon modes in addition to the fundamental and higher order 1 D MP modes . However the low absorptivity of 2 D MP modes greatly limits its applications . We propose and demonstrate an idea utilizing the near field coupling of electromagnetic fields accumulated around the tips of 2 D square resonators to enhance the electromagnetic fields intensity and the emissivity or absorptivity of 2 D MP modes . The tip tip coupling structure is formed by rotating the square resonators array 45 . The experiment demonstrates the 4.5 times absorptivity enhancement of higher order 2 D MP mode from 12.5 to 55.8 in addition to the fundamental MP
