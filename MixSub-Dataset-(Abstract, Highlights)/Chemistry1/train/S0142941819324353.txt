 Rubber is a type of material widely used in industries for waterproofing storing and transporting fluids energy shock dampers thermal insulation and corrosion protection . Natural Rubber polymer is a material that is extensively used in the automotive industries because of its unique properties such as high strength low weight and excellent corrosion resistance . In this study the mechanical properties of NR based car bumpers were investigated by adding reinforcing particles to it . The used reinforcing materials include SiC MgO Fe

@highlight Achieving better microhardness and ultimate tensile strength by adding reinforcements
@highlight Produce car bumpers by new materials and comparing their statistical stiffness and durability with base bumper
@highlight Reaching to 440 000 cycles at durability test for the bumper reinforced by 8 Glass fibers that was achieved more than 40 compared to the base material
@highlight Getting to statistical stiffness for reinforced samples more than acceptance limit that has been established by standard
@highlight Investigation of samples rupture by SEM images
