 This study aims to optimize the formulation of composite films based on chicken skin gelatin with incorporation of rice starch and curcumin . The effect of their interaction on film s tensile strength elongation at break water vapor permeability and antioxidant properties were investigated using a response surface methodology central composite design . The optimized film formulation was further validated to indicate the validity of the prediction model . The optimum conditions of the film were selected with incorporation of rice starch at 20 and curcumin at 0.03 . The optimized film formulation has revealed better mechanical properties with low WVP value and good antioxidant activity . The results showed that optimized composite films formulation based on chicken skin gelatin with the incorporation of rice starch and curcumin has proving good validation of model prediction and can be effectively utilized in food packaging industry .

@highlight The optimal film formulation were achieved through statistical modelling.
@highlight Rice starch and curcumin have significant effect on mechanical properties of film.
@highlight Optimize film exhibit slightly lower color value as compared to prediction value.
@highlight Optimized film formulation showed great potential as biodegradable composite biodegradable film.
@highlight The optimum condition of the film was at 20 w w rice starch and 0.03 w v curcumin incorporation.
