 This work is an attempt to determine appropriate solvents for extractive desulfurization which is the dominant alternative to the risky and expensive solution which is hydrodesulfurization . The main part of this research is the study on phase equilibria in IL heptane or thiophene or 2 methylthiophene or benzothiophene binary systems and IL thiophene 2 methylthiophene benzothiophene heptane ternary system . In this work five new synthesized tricyanomethanide based ILs that is

@highlight LLE data for IL thiophene 2 methylthiophene benzothiophene heptane were determined.

@highlight The NRTL model satisfactorily correlates the LLE data.
@highlight The synthesis and physicochemical properties of ILs are presented.
