 We report on the performance of three classes of evolutionary algorithms evolution strategies and covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy as a means to enhance searches in the method development spaces of 1D and 2D chromatography . After optimisation of the design parameters of the different algorithms they were benchmarked against the performance of a plain grid search . It was found that all three classes significantly outperform the plain grid search especially in terms of the number of search runs needed to achieve a given separation quality . As soon as more than 100 search runs are needed the ES algorithm clearly outperforms the GA and CMA ES algorithms with the latter performing very well for short searches but being susceptible to convergence to local optima for longer searches . It was also found that the performance of the ES and GA algorithms as well as the grid search follow a hyperbolic law in the large search run number limit such that the convergence rate parameter of this hyperbolic function can be used to quantify the difference in required number of search runs for these algorithms . In agreement with one s physical expectations it was also found that the general advantage of the GA and ES algorithms over the grid search as well as their mutual performance differences grow with increasing difficulty of the separation problem .

@highlight Have assessed use of evolutionary algorithms in 1D and 2D LC method development.
@highlight Have compared 3 algorithm classes and benchmarked them against plain grid search.
@highlight The optimised evolution strategies ES algorithm is identified as the best performing.
@highlight Difference between algorithms grows with difficulty of the separation problem.
