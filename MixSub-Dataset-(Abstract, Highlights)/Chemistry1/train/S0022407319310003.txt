 The Breit interaction is the relativistic correction to the electron electron interaction which mainly affects the level energies and it is minor in general . We present a new manifestation of the Breit interaction effects in the highly charged Li and B like ions based on the multi configuration Dirac Fock calculations where the strongly correlated many body wavefunctions of the doubly excited resonant states 1s2p

@highlight The variation of the wavefunctions is due to the ion core energy inversion induced by the Breit interaction. Based on the mechanism we propose an alternative experimental determination of the fine structure splitting of 1s2p

@highlight This work extends the conventional wisdom on the role of the relativistic effects in the electric dipole radiative transitions of highly charged ions which could be useful for future precise high temperature plasma diagnostics.
