 Co occurrences of peptides and chemical components are usually observed in complicated matrices . Notably those traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions contain both plant and animal ingredients . It is still challenging to simultaneously monitor peptides and chemical components attributing to their different liquid chromatographic and mass spectrometric behaviors . Herein efforts were made to pursue an eligible approach enabling simultaneous determination of peptides and chemical components in a TCMP namely

@highlight RPLC HILICSRM was developed for simultaneously monitoring peptides and compounds.
@highlight Online energy resolved mass spectrometry was developed for parameter optimization of peptides.
@highlight RPLC and HILIC were serially coupled to retain and separate both peptides andcompounds.
@highlight Mild inter batch variations were observed among different batches of CCPI.
