 Poly organic glass is used in aircraft windshield application these structures should have better fatigue and fracture resistance to yield good service life . The tendency towards achieving these properties is lost during manufacturing process . This study aims to determine the effect of grooving on PMMA Organic glass . The grooves are manufactured using two different processes namely Micro Milling and Laser Ablation . The tribological properties of laser ablated PMMA and micro milled PMMA were studied using Pin on disc tribometer . The grooved surface roughness of both MM PMMA and LA PMMA samples has decreased with increase in wear time whereas after reaching minimum roughness the coefficient of friction has increased due to higher adhesion between polymer and sliding metal . The tensile properties of differently machined samples have not shown significant difference whereas the fracture toughness values were higher with LA PMMA samples . This effect indicated LA PMMA had greater capacity to resist crack propagation compare to MM PMMA samples . Similarly the fatigue endurance limit was found higher with LA PMMA compared to MM PMMA due to better finish of LA PMMA . Further the microscopic analysis of laser grooved sample before and after fracture have also shown smoother surface and less conic shapes compare to MM PMMA .

@highlight Micro crack are comparatively less in case of laser cut process samples which indicated the higher surface finish.
@highlight Tensile properties has not reveled significant variation with respect to conventional and laser manufacturing process.
@highlight The higher surface finish on the grooved region of PMMA has greater capacity to resist crack propagation.
@highlight Higher surface quality enhanced the fatigue life of the PMMA Organic glass.
