 Using scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory calculations atomic arrangement of surface reconstructions in Pb Si system was examined . Through accurate evaluation of Pb coverage it was determined that 22 reconstruction contains 0.5 monolayer of Pb c 0.75 ML of Pb 21 1.5 ML of Pb and c 1.875 ML of Pb . It was revealed that the 22 Pb reconstruction can occur in two possible modifications with buckled Pb dimers in the trenches between Si dimer rows and with symmetric Pb dimers atop Si dimer rows . The 22 Pb reconstruction of the latter type develops mainly on the Si21 surface which contains relatively large density of structural defects . Known structural models of the c and 21 reconstructions were tested and received the confirmation . A new model was proposed for the c structure . The obtained data set is believed to constitute a solid base for the prospective studies of the phenomena occurring in the Pb Si system . In particular the Pb dense reconstructions 21 and c might be plausible candidates for detecting superconducting properties by analogy with the Pb dense reconstructions on Si .

@highlight Surface reconstructions in Pb Si 100 system were studied using STM observations and DFT calculations.
@highlight Established Pb coverages are 0.5 0.75 1.5 and 2.0 15 8 ML for 22 c 84 21 and c 44 respectively.
@highlight Using AIRSS analysis structural models were proposed for each reconstruction.
@highlight The obtained data set provides a solid basis for prospective investigations of Pb Si 100 system.
