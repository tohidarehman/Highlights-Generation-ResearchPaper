 A chromatographic system was adapted to allow monitoring of eluent of preparative column via absorbance and with the chromatographic analysis of the target macromolecule on the same chromatographic system . The proposed approach was tested on important macromolecules such as monoclonal antibodies monoclonal antibody aggregates and plasmid DNA . A frontal analysis was made on the preparative column while a chromatographic on line analysis was performed by sequentially injecting the preparative column outlet on a convection based analytical column operating on the same chromatographic system . Cation and or anion exchangers were used as the chromatographic media depending on the sample to be purified . The method was found to be robust and reproducible . To adjust the limit of detection an algorithm varying the number of injections was used enabling accurate monitoring of an early breakthrough for concentrations below 1 of the feed concentration . The accuracy varies according to the applied flow rate but it is typically in the range of few percent or even below . Due to its simplicity and flexibility the proposed method can be easily adapted to a pharmaceutical environment .

@highlight Monitoring the effluent of the preparative column by rapid chromatography on a single chromatographic system.
@highlight Fast chromatographic analysis was allowed at low pressure using convection based chromatographic columns.
@highlight Limit of detection can be tuned by sample loop and variable number of injections
@highlight Typical method accuracy is in the range of few percent or below.
