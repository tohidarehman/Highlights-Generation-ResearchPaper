 In this study the modification of cellulose derivative namely carboxymethyl cellulose blended with polyvinyl alcohol and doped with different content of NH

@highlight Modification on carboxymethyl cellulose blend with PVA doped NH
@highlight Br for application in electrolytes system.
@highlight The SBE systems based blend polymer shows the improvement of structural and thermal characteristic when NH
@highlight Br was introduced.
@highlight The increasing of ionic conductivity is due to the enhancement of proton conduction H
@highlight  and amorphous phase.
@highlight The determination of ionic transport via impedance approached aligned with the trend of ionic conductivity.
