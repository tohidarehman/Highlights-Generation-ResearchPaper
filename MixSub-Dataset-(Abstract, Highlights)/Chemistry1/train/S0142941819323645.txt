 Adhesives in bonded structures are exposed both to external loads and environmental conditions durability studies are currently needed to assess their service lifetime . Conditioning strategies differ in considering external load conditions for the durability analysis of double cantilever beam bonded joints . Different test procedures such as ASTM

@highlight The effect of a sustained load accelerates degradation in flexible bonded joints.
@highlight Wedge Test is not applicable for flexible bonded joints due to adhesive relaxation.
@highlight Large deviations in
@highlight values when crack length dependent methods are used.
@highlight Adhesive weakens when exposure combines load and environmental conditions.
@highlight The area affected by the applied load grows linearly with increased exposure time.
