 In this work a single cross linking functional monomer 2 5 divinylterephthalaldehyde was designed and synthesized to simplify the preparation of molecularly imprinted polymers . In the presence of estradiol as a template MIPs were successfully prepared using 2 5 divinylterephthalaldehyde along with a solvent and initiator . This method reduced most of the complex variables encountered in the traditional synthesis . Characterization of the morphology and structure of the MIPs was performed by scanning electron microscopy Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Brunauer Emmett Teller analysis . Compared with non imprinted polymers the MIPs had higher adsorption capacities for five estrogens with imprinting factors above 2.9 . The MIPs had high extraction efficiencies good functional properties long lifetimes and good reproducibility which made them suitable for solid phase microextraction . Coupled with ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry the MIP based fibers were applied to SPME for the analysis of five estrogens in milk samples . Under the best conditions the established method had a wide linear range 0.510000 ng kg
