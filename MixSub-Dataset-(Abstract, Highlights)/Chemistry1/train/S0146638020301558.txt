 Plant wax hydrogen isotopic composition is commonly used to reconstruct the hydrogen isotopic composition of precipitation used by terrestrial vegetation . However mangroves growing in coastal environments take up a mixture of freshwater and seawater . Biosynthetic fractionation differs between plant types and as a function of salinity potentially complicating interpretations of past precipitation in coastal environments . In order to reconstruct Holocene hydrologic and ecologic changes archived within sediments from Blackwood Sinkhole on Abaco Island in The Bahamas we adopt a multi proxy approach using plant wax hydrogen isotopic composition

@highlight Leaf waxes were measured in a 3000 year sediment core from Abaco Island Bahamas.
@highlight Abundance carbon and hydrogen isotopic composition of
@highlight  alkanoic acids reported.
@highlight Terrestrial plant wax hydrogen and carbon isotopes record paleohydrology.
@highlight Mangrove expansion at 850cal yrs BP modifies plant wax hydrogen isotopes.
@highlight We observe centennial variability in hydroclimate throughout the record.
