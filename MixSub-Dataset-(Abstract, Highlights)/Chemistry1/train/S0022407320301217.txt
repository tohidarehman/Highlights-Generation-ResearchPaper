@highlight Using recently developed version of the configuration interaction method for atoms with open shells we calculate electron structure and spectroscopic properties of the mendelevium atom Md 
@highlight  .
@highlight These include energy levels first and second ionisation potentials electron affinities hyperfine structure and electric dipole transition amplitudes between ground and low lying states of opposite parity.
@highlight The accuracy of the calculations is controlled by performing similar calculations for lighter homolog of mendelevium the thulium atom and comparing the results with experiments and other calculations.
@highlight The calculations for Md are to address the lack of experimental data and help in planing and interpreting the measurements.
@highlight It is the first time to report two possible energy levels bound states 5f

@highlight for the negative ion of Md and the electron affinity was predicted to be 0.169 eV.
