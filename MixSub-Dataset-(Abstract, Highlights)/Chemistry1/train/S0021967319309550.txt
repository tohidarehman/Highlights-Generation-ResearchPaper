 This work investigates the applicability of on line extraction directly coupled to liquid chromatography for the dynamic extraction of hydrophobic organic compounds from complex solid samples . The method operates within the existing apparatus of the LC by replacing the valve loop with an extraction vessel comprised of an empty guard column loaded with the sample . In this manner extraction is accomplished by the mobile phase as it flows through the extraction vessel under high pressure without the need for additional apparatus other than those comprising the LC system or additional sample pretreatment steps . The experimental parameters affecting the extraction efficiency of the method were investigated and discussed in relation to both the extraction performance and the chromatographic efficiency . The method was optimized and applied for the first time to the extraction of hydrophobic UV filters from spiked soil and sediment samples yielding recoveries between 59 and 117 and reproducibility from 4.8 to 14.3 which are comparable to those reported from more advanced sample preparation methods .
