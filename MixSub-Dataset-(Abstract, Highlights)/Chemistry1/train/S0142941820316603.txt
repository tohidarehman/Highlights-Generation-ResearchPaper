 Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene possesses high potential to be utilized as a body armor material due to its outstanding mechanical properties . The UHMWPE materials exhibit property anisotropy in the longitudinal and the transverse directions . In this study the time dependent transverse mechanical properties of UHMWPE sheet and fiber samples were systematically studied at different temperatures using the nanoindentation method . The different levels of crystallinity of the sheet and fiber samples were expected to lead to the differences in mechanical properties . These differences were revealed by XRD and DSC studies .

@highlight Time dependent mechanical properties of UHMWPE were tested with nanoindentation in the transverse direction.
@highlight Mechanical testing was conducted between room temperature and 85C using a high temperature nanoindentation setup.
@highlight Different behavior between UHMWPE sheet and fiber samples may be related to their different levels of crystallinity.
