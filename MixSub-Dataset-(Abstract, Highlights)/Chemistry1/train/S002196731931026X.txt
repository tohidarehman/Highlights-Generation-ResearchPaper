 Iron free HPLC systems better known as biocompatible systems are generally regarded to be chemically more inert compared to conventional HPLC systems . In this work we studied the chromatographic behavior of some classes of compounds of pharmaceutical interest analyzed with iron free systems . Issues typically associated with metal contamination i.e . strong peak tailing were observed when using an amide polar embedded column . Effects of the contamination were visible when anhydrous methanol acetonitrile was used indicating that this solvent albeit generally considered safe for conventional HPLC systems induce corrosion of iron free systems . The confirmation of titanium as main acting contaminant came from systematically studying the contribution of each wetted component of the HPLC system on peak shape of affected molecules . Quantification of titanium by ICP MS analysis of effluents provided further evidence on the source of contamination . A mechanistic description of the complex interaction between titanium ions organic molecules and column stationary phase is proposed . In the perspective of developing methods that are fully portable between stainless steel and titanium systems recommendations are given in terms of potentially sensitive molecules suitable mobile phase conditions and type of column to be used .

@highlight Methanol acetonitrile solvent causes titanium corrosion.
@highlight Titanium leaching from biocompatible HPLC can cause peak tailing.
@highlight Peak tailing can be caused by the formation of complexes with immobilized titanium.
