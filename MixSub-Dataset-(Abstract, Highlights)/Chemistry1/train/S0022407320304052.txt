 The hyperfine structure of 15 spectral lines of the manganese atom was investigated with the method of laser induced fluorescence on an atomic beam . Results of these investigations supplemented by the results obtained in Part I of this work series yielded the hyperfine structure constants

@highlight Hyperfine structure hfs of 15 spectral lines in atomic manganese was recorded by laser induced fluorescence on an atomic beam.
@highlight Results of these investigations supplemented with the data obtained in the previous work Part I of the series yielded the hyperfine structure constants A and B for 38 upper odd parity levels.
@highlight For 11 odd parity levels both hyperfine structure constants A and B were determined for the first time for another 10 levels new constants B were evaluated for the remaining 17 levels the hfs constants were revised.
@highlight Semi empirical analysis of the odd parity level system in Mn I was performed in a basis of 35 configurations.
@highlight Fairly good consistency was found between the experimental hfs constants and those predicted in the semi empirical fit.
