 The solubility of the antifungal drug fluconazole in buffer solutions of different acidity 1 octanol and hexane in the temperature range K is determined by the isothermal saturation method . The solubility of the compound in selected solvents increases as follows hexane buffer pH 7.4 buffer pH 2.0 1 octanol buffer pH 1.2 and does not exceed 0.2moll

@highlight Solubility of fluconazole was measured in buffers pH 1.2 2.0 7.4 hexane and 1 octanol.
@highlight The melting temperature and enthalpy of fluconazole were obtained.
@highlight The vapor pressure and sublimation thermodynamics were determined.
