 In order to improve the high temperature rutting resistance ability and stability of styrene butadiene styrene modified asphalt microwave heating emulsion polymerization strategy was used to prepare polymethyl methacrylate and graphene nanoparticles composite which was used to prepare PMMA GNPs SBS modified asphalt . Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy X ray diffraction scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis characterizations showed that PMMA GNPs particles were successfully prepared having a weight ratio of GNPs PMMA of 1 9 . Microwave heating reduced the reaction time from 5h to 30min compared to conventional oil bath heating . Dynamic shear rheological test and multi stress creep recovery test confirmed that 0.06 PMMA GNPs SBS modified asphalt exhibited an increase of 14.2 in elastic modulus while rutting resistance was enhanced and sensitivity to stress changes was reduced as compared to those of 5 SBS modified asphalt . Fluorescence microscopy analysis and phase separation test revealed that an appropriate amount of PMMA GNPs can be uniformly dispersed in SBS modified asphalt and enhance the mutual interaction of SBS with base asphalt . Based on the results of mechanical tests and characterizations a suitable modification mechanism of PMMA GNPs particles in the original SBS modified asphalt was described in detail . This study proposes a simple cost effective and fast strategy for the preparation of PMMA GNPs incorporated SBS modified asphalt and hence can be envisioned of great promise in construction and highway industries .
