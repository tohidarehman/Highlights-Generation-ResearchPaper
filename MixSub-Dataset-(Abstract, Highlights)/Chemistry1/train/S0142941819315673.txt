 A novel self heating 3D printed continuous carbon fiber epoxy mesh for deicing was proposed . Because of electron migrating conduction and hopping conduction the conductivity of CCF reached 131.3Scm

@highlight A novel self heating 3D printed CCF EP mesh for deicing was proposed and investigated.
@highlight The high conductivity and resistance stability of the CCF EP mesh was confirmed.
@highlight The deicing mechanism of the CCF EP mesh was explained by the electrical self heating performance.
@highlight The CCF EP mesh reinforcement decreased the deicing time by 85 .
@highlight The CCF EP mesh reinforcement exhibited a protective effect on the GFRTPC laminate.
