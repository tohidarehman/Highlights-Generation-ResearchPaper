 In the present study environmentally benign silver nanoparticles were synthesized using commercially purchased shrimp shell chitosan as a capping agent . The synthesized chitosan silver nanoparticles were physico chemically characterized by UVVis spectroscopy X ray diffraction Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy high resolution transmission electron microscopy along with energy dispersive X ray analysis DLS and Zeta potential analysis . Ch Ag NPs were crystalline uniformly dispersed and spherically shaped with particle size between 8 and 48nm . The average size of Ch AgNPs was 21nm .

@highlight AgNPs were synthesized using the biopolymer shrimp shell chitosan.
@highlight Ch AgNPs 848nm exhibited significant antibacterial and antibiofilm activity.
@highlight Ch AgNPs promoted wound healing activity at 75 and 100gm
@highlight after 24h.
@highlight Ch AgNPs effective inhibited the MCF 7 human breast cancer cells at 100gm
@highlight after 24h.
