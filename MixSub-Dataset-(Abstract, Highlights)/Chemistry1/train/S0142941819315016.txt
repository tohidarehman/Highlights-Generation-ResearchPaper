 Enhancement of thermal properties of epoxy resins was achieved by incorporation of polybenzimidazole fibermats filled with carbon nanomaterials prepared by the solution electrospinning technique . Different type of carbon nanostructures were compared as fillers in polybenzimidazole fibers . The carbon PBI fibermats showed remarkable thermal transport properties and therefore they were studied as thermal reinforcement material for epoxy composites . Mechanical and thermal properties of produced composites were evaluated and the effectiveness of different types of carbon fillers examined . Results showed that the produced carbon filled fibermats can be used effectively as a thermal reinforcing material in epoxy resins offering several advantages .

@highlight Epoxy composites were produced by PBI CNMs fibermats which were prepared by the solution electrospinning technique.
@highlight The fabricated composites exhibit extremely enhanced thermal properties compared to neat epoxy resin.
@highlight The incorporation of the fibermats into epoxy resin also enhanced the mechanical properties of the polymer.
@highlight Processing method can be extended towards the production of industrial laminated composites with high thermal conductivity.
