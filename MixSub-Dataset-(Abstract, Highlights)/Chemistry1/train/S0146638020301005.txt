 Pyrogenic organic matter generated via the incomplete combustion of biomass is well studied due to the presence of slow cycling condensed aromatic compounds known to sequester in soils and sediments . Recently dissolved Py OM has received interest due to its higher mobility and potential to be transferred through watersheds to aquatic systems . Py DOM quantities molecular identities and importance to global carbon budgets and cycles are only beginning to be understood . Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry analyses were performed on Py DOM isolated from oak and grass biochars produced over a range of temperatures and the data are compared to complementary

@highlight Pyrogenic dissolved organic matter Py DOM is molecularly heterogeneous.
@highlight Complementary analyses are needed to representatively characterize Py DOM composition.
@highlight Py DOM becomes less oxygenated more aromatic and more aliphatic with increasing char maturity.
@highlight Grass and oak pyrolyzed via similar conditions vary in char maturity and likely environmental fate.
