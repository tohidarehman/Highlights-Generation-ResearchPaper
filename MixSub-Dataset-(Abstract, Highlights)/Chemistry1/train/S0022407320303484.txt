 Ro vibrationally excited molecules of deuterium are involved in non equilibrium chemical reactions in divertor region of tokamak or in neutral beam injector to produce negative ion for fusion plasmas . These molecules produced both in a plasma volume and on surfaces are no longer in their electronic ground state

@highlight Insights into the ro vibrational distribution of D2 molecules are obtained in plasma.
@highlight The role of the recombinative desorption mechanism is demonstrated.
@highlight The nature of the plasma facing material modifies the vibrational levels of D2.
