 The preparation of polyimide resin with high heat resistance and toughness is a significant challenge . In this study thermoplastic PI was used to toughen thermosetting PIs and toughened PI blends were prepared . The modified PI resin system exhibited good thermal stability excellent heat resistance and high toughness . The results indicated that the TPI PI blends maintained the curing behavior and characteristics of the PI oligomer . The T

@highlight Thermoplastic polyimide TPI was used to toughen thermosetting polyimide PI and a toughened PI blend was prepared.
@highlight The toughened PI resin system exhibited good thermal stability good heat resistance and high toughness.
@highlight A carbon fiber reinforced PI composite was prepared by using the toughened PI resin systemas a matrix.
@highlight The CAI compression after impact value of the carbon fiber reinforced PI composite with 10 TPI could reach 190 Mpa.
