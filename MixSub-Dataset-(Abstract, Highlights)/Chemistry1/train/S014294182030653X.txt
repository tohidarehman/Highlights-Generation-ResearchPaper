 Poly coming from the self polycondensation of ricinoleic acid which derives from castor oil is a very interesting polymer because of its intrinsic antimicrobial activity . However its mechanical properties are insufficient for whatever application thus copolymerization is required . In this work two polyesters based on 1 3 propanediol such as poly and poly were chosen to prepare random copolyesters containing ricinoleate units . Different content of RA have been tested such as 10 and 25mol respect to the comonomer to evaluate the lowest composition able to confer antibacterial activity . The materials were tested against

@highlight Ricinoleic acid from biomass is suitable to be used in polycondensation reactions.
@highlight Copolymers properties can be tuned as a function of ricinoleic acid content.
@highlight Copolymers richest in ricinoleic acid have significant antibacterial activity.
@highlight The copolymer of PPI containing 10mol of ricinoleic acid unit presents very high elongation at break.
@highlight Copolymers with ricinoleic acid could be suitable for textile fibers and or film engineering thermoplastic applications.
