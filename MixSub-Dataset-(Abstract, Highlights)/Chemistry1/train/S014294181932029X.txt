 The Abrasive Jet Machining of Polydimethylsiloxane is very slow or even impossible at room temperature due to its ability to absorb the energy of the impacting particles . Cryogenic Abrasive Jet Micromachining can enhance the material removal rate and accordingly the mechanical performance of PDMS can critically affect its processability . The goal of this study is to investigate the physical properties of PDMS at different temperatures . For this PDMS samples were fabricated for compressive hardness X ray Diffraction and linear expansion coefficient testing according to GB standards . The results showed the following values compressive modulus of 17.311160.1MPa ultimate compressive strength of 160.25224.50MPa hardness of 43 Sh

@highlight The mechanical properties and thermal properties of PDMS material showed strong temperature sensitivity.
@highlight The ultimate tensile strength of PDMS is the largest at 150K.
@highlight The damage failure mode was a brittle plastic hybrid mode at 123K.
