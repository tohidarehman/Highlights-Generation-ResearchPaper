 A previous paper of this series of study put forward a basic model of an automated system for predicting detection limits and showed its application to a simple example of isocratic high performance liquid chromatography . This paper describes an expansion of the basic system into gradient HPLC . The most serious problem with the expansion is a long term variation in backgrounds called gradient baseline drifts which in theory can not be covered by a noise model of the original system . This paper demonstrates that the above problem can be solved with modifying a parametrization procedure of the noise model . The essential role of the system is to predict the standard deviation of measurements at low concentrations from a chromatogram without repeated measurements of real samples . Laboratory made software enables the automated assessment of the limits of detection and quantitation for each of chromatographically separated signals in a single run . Simulated background noise which consists of the stationary noise model with linear slopes is used to confirm the accuracy and reproducibility of the automated prediction . A gradient HPLC determination for cefaclor is taken as an example . The parametrization modification improves the correlation coefficient

@highlight An automated system has been proposed to obtain detection limit DL in gradient HPLC.
@highlight Quantitation limit and precision profile were also obtained by this system.
@highlight Peaks on drifted baseline noise were accurately analyzed in the gradient HPLC.
@highlight DL obtained by this system was essentially the same with that by S N and ISO 11843 7.
