 This paper is showed to explore the relationship between materials and their properties . The elements are defined by their features . It identifies the composition of the pyrolysis products obtained through pyrolysis in the structure of different designs . Two design specimens of carbon fibers structure with different directional load were fabricated solid carbon fibers and hexagonal carbon fibers structure . The deformation behavior is well known and has been analyzed . 3D finite element models were used to investigate both structures . There was some impact on the specimens used and the behavior of the strain and stress line was captured . These results show that the positive Poisson s ratio of both composites structures obtained when appropriate yarn structure in the 3D material system is adopted in both designs . The main purpose of the experiment was to define and test the structure s use in industries that require carbon fiber material that has excessively excellent mechanical and thermal properties . DMA tests have been conducted and both the thermal and mechanical properties investigated . The compositions can improve carbon vs the adhesion of the polymer matrix for carbon fibers structure which allows the use of such fibers for the reinforcement of plastics without extra processing .
