 Polyhydroxyalkanoates are considered promising green alternatives to synthetic polymers because they are bio derived biodegradable and biocompatible . The properties of bacterial PHA copolymers depend on their microstructures which can be modified with the use of different fermentation processes and feed materials . Thus it is desirable to have an improved testing method for the determination of PHA microstructures . In this work a detailed NMR analysis of poly microstructure was made . Previously only two of the hydroxyvalerate

@highlight A detailed microstructural analysis of poly 3 hydroxybutyrate co 3 hydroxyvalerate was made with solution NMR.
@highlight New
@highlight C spectral assignments at the triad level for this copolymer were made.
@highlight Quantitative
@highlight C NMR sequence data on eight copolymer samples were obtained through curve deconvolution.
@highlight The data were fitted to both one component and two component statistical models.
@highlight This improved NMR methodology should be useful in differentiating samples made with different processes.
