 In heterogeneous catalysis atomic layer deposition has been developed as a tool to stabilize and reduce carbon deposition on supported nanoparticles . Here we discuss use of high vacuum ALD to deposit alumina films on size selected sub nanometer Pt SiO

@highlight Selective nucleation of alumina ALD on sub nano Pt clusters.
@highlight One cycle deposits one monolayer on top with additional alumina around the cluster periphery.
@highlight A single ALD cycle completely blocks CO binding sites on Pt clusters.
@highlight Not possible to recover high binding energy Pt sites by heating.
