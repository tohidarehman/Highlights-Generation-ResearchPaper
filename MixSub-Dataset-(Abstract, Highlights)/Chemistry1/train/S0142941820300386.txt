 Linear low density polyethylene is the one of the most popular polymer used for rotational moulding applications such as storage tanks . But its inferior mechanical properties and thermal stability restrict the longer service . Hence this study experimentally demonstrates the effect of Halloysite Nanotube concentration on LLDPE composites for enhancing the mechanical and thermal stability . HNTs were uniformly dispersed with LLDPE matrix through ultra sonication followed by compression moulding used to prepare the nano composites plates . The prepared composites are shown 19.2 improved tensile strength for 2wt HNTs whereas 28.9 hike in flexural strength observed for 4wt HNTs composite compare to neat LLDPE . Which shows that higher concentrations of HNTs is favourable in improving the flexural strength rather than tensile properties . In addition to that higher concentrations of HNTs are also helping in improving the storage modulus of the LLDPE composites . The increase in mechanical properties mainly attributed due to effective load carriers in the composite . Besides HNTs were also contributing for improving the melting point and residual char of the composites which is indeed for storage tanks durability . The prepared composite was thermally stable at higher temperature up to 230C because of HNTs chemical structure the inner layer of HNTs constitute with Al
