 Herein we report three dimensional paper chromatography as a micro chromatographic platform . The method was based on applying the origami microfluidic device for separation coupled by colorimetric methods for simultaneous determination . The microfluidic device fabrication was a facile printing approach . Two azo food dyes Tartrazine and Indigo carmine were selected as a model analyte while carbonate bicarbonate buffer was used as the mobile phase . Our micro chromatographic device is associated with two big advantages including needing very small volume of mobile phase and ultrafast separation time . Under the optimal conditions the method provided acceptable linear ranges of 0 . 0gL

@highlight A novel analytical method based on origami paper based microfluidic device as a platform for paper chromatography.
@highlight Device fabrication processes is a simple single side printing and curing paper.
@highlight Consumption low amount of reagents solvents and cost effective analysis.
@highlight The method does not require any sample pretreatment step applying a raid analytical procedure by the green aqueous solvent
