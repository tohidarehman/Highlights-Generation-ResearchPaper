 Sulfurization has been found to enhance organic matter preservation and petroleum formation in marine sediments . However we do not yet have a comprehensive understanding of sulfurization mechanisms . In this study we investigated several possible mechanisms of dissolved organic sulfur formation in the top 4.5m of anoxic sediments of Santa Barbara Basin California Borderland . Using Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry we identified chemical formulas of potential dissolved organic matter precursors to these DOS compounds . We also examined how the formulas of abiotically formed DOS changed as a function of depth across a major redox gradient .

@highlight Abiotic sulfurization is a major pathway that forms DOS in anoxic pore waters.
@highlight Nucleophilic addition reactions are the major abiotic sulfurization pathways.
@highlight Abiotic reactions may explain the formation of oxidized DOS in anoxic pore waters.
@highlight CRAM molecules could play an important role in the formation of abiotic DOS.
