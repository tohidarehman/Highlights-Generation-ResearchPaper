 The photomultiplier tubes used to measure altitude resolved 532 nm backscatter intensity by the Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization do not recover rapidly following exposure to very high light levels . Instead they exhibit exponentially decaying noise tails that can cause substantial misestimates when determining layer base altitudes and deriving cloud extinction coefficients . Here we present a deconvolution correction algorithm to remove these noise tails in the CALIOP level 1 science data products . The corrected 532 nm attenuated backscatter profiles generated by the deconvolution algorithm are evaluated using the corresponding CALIOP observations at 1064 nm and coincident profiles measured at 532 nm by the NASA Langley airborne high spectral resolution lidar . Results indicate that our deconvolution correction algorithm effectively removes the non ideal PMT recovery effects on the CALIOP level 1 vertical profiles showing excellent performance for surface and water cloud lidar returns when the attenuated backscatter coefficients are greater than 0.01 km
