 There have been several reports investigating independent properties of large and small rubber particles . This work envisaged that when co existing they could offer exceptional viscoelastic and mechanical properties from both components . Latex samples of various mixing ratios were prepared and properties of their rubber films were investigated against those of pure LRP and SRP to find that those containing 1030 SRP were the best in mechanical strength and elasticity . This could be due to the combination of stronger phospholipid linkages in the LRP and void filling ability of the SRP . The presence of SRP was shown to enhance curability in the vulcanised samples resulting in better mechanical performance of the vulcanisates . The 70 30 blend showed the best thermal aging resistance among the vulcanisates . This suggested that the mixing ratios of the LRP and SRP contents were tunable to improve desirable properties of rubber products of interest both green and cured .

@highlight Latex films with various mixing ratios of large LRP and small rubber particles SRP are prepared.
@highlight The rubber samples with 1030 SRP show higher tensile strenght and more linear in viscoeasticity than other samples do.
@highlight Non rubber components at rubber particle boundaries can act as natural branch points for network formation of rubber chains.
@highlight The presence of SRP can improve curability of rubber sample resulting in enhancing mechanical properties of the vulcanisate.
@highlight The rubber blend of 70 30 LRP SRP shows the best thermal aging resistance.
