 An absorbing host medium and surface conductivity of a charged sphere are two emerging factors that influence electromagnetic scattering and play a role in tuning optical properties of the sphere . In this paper we study a general case of the light scattering by a charged sphere embedded in an absorbing host medium . Combining the two established Lorentz Mie theories which apply to the absorbing host medium and the charged sphere we calculate the far field extinction efficiency factor and the electric field amplitude . Our results show that amplifying effect of the increasing absorption of host medium on the interference oscillations of the extinction efficiency factor is opposite to the damping effect of the increasing surface conductivity . On the electric field amplitude the increasing absorption of the host medium enhances the backscattering field in contrast to the front scattering field . However the increasing surface conductivity induces a size parameter dependent change on the pattern of the field distribution and the magnitude of the field .

@highlight We study electromagnetic scattering by a charged sphere embedded in an absorbing medium.
@highlight Lorenz Mie coefficients are derived to include the parameters of the absorption in host medium and the surface conductivity.
@highlight The increasing absorption amplifies the interference oscillations of extinction efficiency but the increasing surface conductivity damps them.
@highlight An enhancement of backscattering electric field in contrast to front scattering electric field is induced by the increasing absorption.
@highlight The increasing surface conductivity induces a size parameter dependent change on the pattern of the field distribution and the magnitude of the field.
