 Effect directed analysis is increasingly used in environmental monitoring to detect and identify key toxicants . High performance thin layer chromatography has proven to be a very suitable fractionation technique for this purpose . However HPTLC is limited in its separation efficiency . Thus separated fractions could still contain many different components and identification of the effective substances remains difficult . Therefore in this study a workflow for selective EDA with two dimensional HPTLC in combination with high performance liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry was developed . The aim of the workflow was the stepwise reduction of the sample complexity in order to reduce the number of signals that could be responsible for the measured effects . As a consequence the identification of effective substances should be facilitated . The acetylcholinesterase inhibition assay for the detection of potential neurotoxic compounds was applied for biotesting . The transfer of effective zones from the first to the second dimension and also to the mass spectrometric measurement was enabled by extraction .
