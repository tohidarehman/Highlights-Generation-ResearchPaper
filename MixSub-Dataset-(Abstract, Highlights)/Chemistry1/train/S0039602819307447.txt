 The first direct observation of atomic exchange during the surface self diffusion of single adatoms is reported . Iridium adatoms from a source enriched to 93

@highlight adatoms on
@highlight  100 are shown for the first time by direct measurement to diffuse by an exchange mechanism.
@highlight The use of isotropically enriched sources of adatoms enables the study of exchange in surface self diffusion.
@highlight Deepened understanding of atom dynamics in homogeneous systems greatly enhances our fundamental insight into crystal growth.
