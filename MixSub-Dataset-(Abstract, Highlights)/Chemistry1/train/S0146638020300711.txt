 Different proportions of purified low maturity maceral concentrates have been artificially mixed to evaluate changes in the hydrocarbon generation characteristics as a function of maceral maceral interactions . The purified maceral concentrates detrovitrinite and resinite were obtained from an Eocene lacustrine oil shale and an Eocene coal sample from NE China . Four artificial mixtures parameters the Py GC gaseous hydrocarbon content and gasoil ratios of the maceral mixtures are consistent with the calculated values . However the Py GC hydrocarbon distribution patterns of the liquid oil C

@highlight Rock Eval and FT IR characteristics of maceral mixtures fit with calculated values.
@highlight hydrocarbons and gasoil ratios of mixtures were close to expected values.
@highlight Even a low algal organic matter content dominates the Py GC HC distribution.
@highlight A low proportion of vitrinite among the macerals yields more C
