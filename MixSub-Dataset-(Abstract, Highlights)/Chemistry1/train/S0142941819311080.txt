 This paper deals with thermal ageing of polyaniline obtained from plasma or chemical ways . FTIR analyses suggest the formation of stable carbonyl compounds in both cases . The plasma polyaniline degrades clearly faster than its chemical analog which is discussed from structural considerations . The consequences of thermal ageing on the surface properties monitored by Water Contact Angles are also considered and explained as the overlap of an oxidation component that decreases WCA and a crosslinking component responsible for the WCA increase .

@highlight Degradation study of polyaniline synthesized either by plasma or conventional methods.
@highlight Changes in chemical structure FTIR and surface properties Water Contact Angle .
@highlight Faster degradation of plasma polyaniline compared to its conventional analog.
@highlight Ageing associated to crosslinking and oxidation for plasma polyaniline and only to oxidation for the chemical polymer.
