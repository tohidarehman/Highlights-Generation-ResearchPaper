 Oil shales are an important alternative energy resource through retorting for the production of liquid hydrocarbons . A key factor in determining the value of an oil shale resource is its hydrocarbon generation potential particularly its maceral distribution . To examine this single maceral concentrates were obtained from a 1kg Eocene Huadian oil shale sample using float sink separation of chemically demineralized kerogen . Nine different density fractions were separated the

@highlight Quantitative oil shale maceral concentrates were obtained from an Eocene Huadian oil shale.
@highlight Density separated maceral groups had different petroleum generation capacities.
@highlight The properties of end member lamalginite and detrovitrinites properties were determined for maceral isolates.
@highlight Quantitative retorting behavior can be predicted using precise maceral distributions.
@highlight Lamalginite generates more hydrocarbons but with a higher activation energy.
