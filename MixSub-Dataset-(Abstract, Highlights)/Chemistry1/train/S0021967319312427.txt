 This work proposed a novel strategy based on quadruplex stable isotope derivatization for sensitive accurate speedy and green determination of panaxadiol and panaxatriol . This strategy integrated with ultrasound assisted dispersive liquid liquid microextraction microwave assisted derivatization and magnetic graphene oxide dispersive solid phase extraction as efficient sample pretreatment techniques coupling with ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry detection in multiple reaction monitoring mode for the analytical purpose of high throughput sensitivity selectivity green and accuracy . Quadruplex mass spectrometry sensitizing derivatization reagents 3

@highlight New quadruplex derivatization reagents ACCR6G were designed and synthesized.
@highlight Novel analytical method of DLLME QSID DSPE UHPLC MS MS was developed for PD and PT.
@highlight The developed method was high throughput sensitive selective accurate and green.
@highlight The method was applied to the quality control of foodstuff and medicinal materials.
