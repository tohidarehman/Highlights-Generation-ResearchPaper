 The interaction of an axicon generated vector Bessel beam with a charged sphere is investigated in the framework of generalized LorenzMie theory . The incident internal and scattered fields are expanded using vector spherical wave functions beam shape coefficients and internal and scattered coefficients . An analytical expressions of beam shape coefficients which are derived using angular spectrum decomposition method are given . The internal and scattered coefficients are derived by considering the boundary conditions . The internal and near surface electric fields of a charged sphere illuminated by AVGBBs are numerical calculated and the effects of polarization order of beam half cone angle are mainly discussed . The results are compared with that for neutral particles . The effect of the surface charge are discussed by the comparison of the results for charged spheres with that for neutral particles . Numerical results show that the internal and near surface fields are sensitive to the surface charge . The internal fields and the near surface fields can be locally enhanced . Internal and near surface fields especially its local enhancement are very sensitive to the beam parameters including polarization order half cone angle etc .
