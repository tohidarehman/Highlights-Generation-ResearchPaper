 The drift and noise of acetonitrile water gradient baselines in reversed phase liquid chromatography are recorded at a wavelength of 215 nm using 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid as the mobile phase additive a 4.6 mm 150 mm 5

@highlight Drift and noise of RPLC gradient baselines using eluent additive are recorded.
@highlight They are predicted by solving mass balances of the strong solvent and additive.
@highlight Drift reduced by proper pick of wavelength gradient steepness and additive retention.
@highlight Noise reduced by reducing pump stroke volume and increasing flow rate.
@highlight Open roads toward development of next generation pumps and mixers.
