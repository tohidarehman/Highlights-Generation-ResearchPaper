 Herein well defined ultrathin hafnium films on Si 77 were prepared by using electron beam heating in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber at a pressure below 1.110

@highlight Chemical states of well defined ultrathin hafnium film on Si 111 were evaluated by core level photoelectron spectroscopy of Si 2
@highlight and Hf 4
@highlight levels.
@highlight Surface images were taken after annealing with a scanning electron microscope.
@highlight Ultrathin Hf layers grow on clean Si 111 77 surfaces by a lever rule that the first phase is not consumed when subsequent phases form.
@highlight Small dot shaped islands of HfSi
@highlight appeared after annealing two monolayer Hf sample.
@highlight Rectangular HfSi
@highlight islands appeared after annealing six monolayer Hf sample.
