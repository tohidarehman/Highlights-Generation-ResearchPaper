 In the present study a novel strategy based on unidirectional freezing and atom transfer radical polymerization combined with activator regenerated by electron transfer was applied to synthesizing orderly macroporous monolithic column with restricted access property in a 1000L pipette tip . The RA column was composed of hydrophobic inner column poly styrene

@highlight Monolithic column with long and aligned channels prepared in pipette tip.
@highlight ARGET ATRP method under unidirectional freezing was applied.
@highlight Poly hydroxyethyl methacrylate chains grafted on the surface of monolithic column.
@highlight Monolithic tip fixed to syringe for directly extracting drugs from rat plasma.
@highlight Restricted access SPE HPLC UV for monitoring Magnolia bark phenols in rat plasma.
