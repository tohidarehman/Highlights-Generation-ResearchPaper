 Donor human milk pasteurised for safety reasons is the first alternative for feeding preterm infants when mothers own milk is unavailable . Breastmilk pasteurisation impact on lipid digestion and absorption was evaluated by a static

@highlight An updated
@highlight digestive lipolysis model was adapted to preterm infant conditions.
@highlight Lower prelipolysis but similar digestive lipolysis were obtained in pasteurised vs raw human milk.
@highlight Intracellular lipid droplets were quantified by an adapted image analysis method.
@highlight Mean lipid droplet area in Caco 2 cells was smaller with pasteurised than with raw human milk.
