 Human plasminogen Kringle 5 is known to pose a more potent anti angiogenesis effect by inducing endothelial cell apoptosis . Our previous studies have identified the peptide IGNSNTL as a binding sequence of Kringle 5 using Ph.D. 7 phage display peptide library and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay . Here eleven proteins were screened and summarized by BLAST laminin 3 chain G1 domain was considered as the most potential receptor based on E value and domain function . The specific interaction of them was directly revealed through ligand blot and a strong concentration dependent manner occurred between them K

@highlight Human laminin 3 chain G1 domain is a binding receptor of plasminogen Kringle 5 in vitro.
@highlight A rapid screening and validation strategy of researching receptor was established.
@highlight Electrostatic force and hydrogen bond are the driving forces for interaction.
@highlight Conformational change among random coils and helixes are observed for LG1 domain.
