 Fucoidans represent an intriguing class of fucose containing sulfated polysaccharides . The biological activities of these polysaccharides are related to their compositional and structural parameters whereby their degree of sulfation as well as molecular weight distribution and chain conformation play important roles . Modern NMR and mass spectrometry techniques allow elucidating details of the glycan structure but not the structure of the whole molecules in their native state . Accordingly the knowledge about the latter of the fucoidans is currently still limited . Contrary to traditional MW determination by SEC with column calibration SEC with triple detection provides not only the absolute

@highlight SEC with multiple detection is useful for structural characterization of fucoidans.
@highlight Six fucoidans were heterogeneously and complex composed.
@highlight Six fucoidans considerably differed in their molar mass and size characteristics.
@highlight Typical fucoidans consisted of expanded flexible chains with branched structure.
@highlight Molar mass and conformation of fucoidans influence their biological activities.
