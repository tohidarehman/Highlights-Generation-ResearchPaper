 Using the saturation shake flask technique the equilibrium solubility of risperidone in co solvent mixtures of methanol water ethanol water isopropanol water and

@highlight Risperidone I solubility in four aqueous alcohol mixtures was determined.
@highlight Solubility data were correlated by vant Hoff Jouyban Acree and Jouyban Acree models.
@highlight Preferential solvation of risperidone I in alcohol solutions were derived via IKBIs method.
@highlight Solvent effect was studied by using KAT LSER model.
@highlight Cavity formation energy and dipolarity polarizability of solvents mainly controlled risperidone solubility.
