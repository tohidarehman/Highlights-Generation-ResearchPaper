 Diatom highly branched isoprenoid lipids have proven extremely useful as environmental proxies . This study is the first to target the influence of nutrient limitation on HBI synthesis and to present data on the variable biosynthesis of HBIs in sea ice diatoms . In doing so we show that the cellular abundance of HBIs can vary by orders of magnitude within the sea ice habitat a topic not yet addressed in the literature which could have far reaching consequences on how variable HBI concentrations are interpreted in the wider environment .

@highlight Two species of HBI synthesising sea ice diatoms were cultured.
@highlight Nutrient depletion drives order of magnitude increase in HBI synthesis in one species.
@highlight Results may change how HBI abundance should be interpreted in the environment.
