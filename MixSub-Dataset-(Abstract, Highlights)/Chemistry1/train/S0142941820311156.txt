 Environmental and societal concerns such as pollution disposal of solid waste requirement of different conflicting properties for materials in varied applications and cost are the main reasons for the development of new materials from the existing materials . The concerns may possibly be overcome by substituting natural fibers for synthetic fibers . In this study a hybrid composite was developed by reinforcing the natural fiber cordia dichotoma and filler granite powder into polyester resin . This composite was fabricated using hand lay up method .

@highlight When granite fillers were added up to 15wt increase in the tensile flexural and impact strengths were observed.
@highlight Water and chemical absorption characteristics of the composite decreased with the addition of granite filler.
@highlight TGA of granite filled hybrid polyester composite exhibited a two stage degradation pattern with a weight loss of 10 and 55 .
@highlight FTIR graph revealed that SiO bonding is present in the granite filler fiber reinforced polymer composite.
