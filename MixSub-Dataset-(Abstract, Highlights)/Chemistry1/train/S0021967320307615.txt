 In this work an inexpensive fast and selective ionic liquid modified graphene oxide was synthesized and electrochemically deposited on the inner surface of a stainless steel tube . Then it was applied for circulated headspace in tube solid phase microextraction of naphthalene from honey samples . Next the coated tube was replaced with the sample loop of a six port injection valve for on line desorption and further HPLC UV analysis of naphthalene . The sorbent was characterized by scanning electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy . Different parameters affecting the procedure efficiency including extraction temperature extraction time salt concentration and sample volume were optimized by central composite design and response surface methodology . Under the optimum conditions the calibration curve was linear within the range of 0.3 200 ng mL

@highlight 1 methylimidazole modified grapheme oxide GO IL was synthesized as the sorbent.
@highlight GO IL was electrodeposited on the inner surface of a stainless steel tube.
@highlight The coated tube was applied in a circulated headspace in tube SPME procedure.
@highlight Desorption and liquid chromatography analysis of the extracts was performed on line.
@highlight The method was applied for determination of naphthalene in honey samples.
