 Off line two dimensional countercurrent chromatography has been widely applied to the isolation of complex samples but little research on the investigation of orthogonality in the selection of biphasic solvent systems is available . In the present work the orthogonality in the selection of a biphasic solvent system for liquid liquid chromatographic separation of aqueous extract and ether extract from the traditional Chinese medicinal plant

@highlight Orthogonality in selection of biphasic solvent systems was evaluated.
@highlight The dendrogram and colour map was used to show the dissimilarity for solvent systems.
@highlight The space occupancy rate was evaluated by convex hull method.
@highlight Efficiency of liquid liquid chromatography separation was enhanced.
@highlight Complete separation of the different extracts from
@highlight was achieved.
