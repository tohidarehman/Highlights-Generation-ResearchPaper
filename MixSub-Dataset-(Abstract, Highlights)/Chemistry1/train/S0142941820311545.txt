 We report the preparation of microporous surfaces prepared from immiscible polymer blends using the Breath Figures methodology . The selected polymer blend is formed by two biodegradable polymers i.e . poly and poly both known to be biocompatible and presenting two distinct kinetics of biodegradation . These two polymers form immiscible polymer blends upon solvent casting in low relative humidity conditions . However when quenching the melt using fast cooling processes or by evaporation in a moist atmosphere micrometer size phase separated domains have been clearly identified by Raman Confocal . This allowed us to analyze cell adhesion as well as proliferation on both planar and microporous surfaces formed from different blend compositions . Using C166 GFP and RAW264.7cell types as a model we could observe an improved adhesion of the C166 GFP on top of the microporous surfaces evidencing the role of the surface topography on the cell adhesion process . In addition preliminary results on the RAW264.7cell adhesion indicated the polarization to M2 phenotypes instead of M1 which is a pre requisite for the potential use of this material for implantology purposes .

@highlight Fabrication of porous films were obtained from biodegradable and immiscible polymer blends.
@highlight The size of the domains formed by the PCL are significantly reduced with average sizes ranging from 2 to 5m.
@highlight Water condensation direct the formation of small micrometer size domains.
@highlight These porous films presented ood behavior in terms of cells adhesion and proliferation.
@highlight Preliminary immune system response evidenced the polarization to M2 phenotype.
