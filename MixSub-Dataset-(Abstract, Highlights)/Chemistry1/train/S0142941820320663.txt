 This paper investigates the effect of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles on the cure characteristics tensile and tear strength elongation at break hardness abrasion resistance heat build up resilience glass transition temperature oil resistance alternating current conductivity and transport properties of chlorinated nitrile rubber . The maximum and minimum torque values were increased whereas the cure time values were decreased with the HA content in the Cl NBR . The uniform dispersion of HA in Cl NBR was obtained from scanning electron microscopy and X ray diffraction . Differential scanning calorimetry showed the increased glass transition temperature of Cl NBR with the addition of HA particles . Mechanical properties conductivity and oil resistance of the composites were greatly increased with the loading of hydroxyapatite . Diffusion results were explained in terms of the loading of nanoparticles and size of the penetrant molecules . Arrhenius and thermodynamic parameters for the diffusion process have been estimated and an anomalous diffusion mechanism was observed .

@highlight Novel Cl NBR hydroxyapatite nanocomposites were prepared by a simple two roll mixing.
@highlight Excellent enhancement in mechanical properties.
@highlight Cure studies confirms the improvement in characteristic properties.
@highlight AC conductivity and oil resistance of the nanocomposites increases with loading of nanoparticles.
@highlight Transport of aromatic solvents with Cl NBR hydroxyapatite nanocomposites were also evaluated.
