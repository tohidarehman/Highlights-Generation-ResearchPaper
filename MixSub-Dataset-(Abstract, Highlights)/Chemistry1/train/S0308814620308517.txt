 In this study a polyethylene film coated with chitosan and gallic acid was prepared using plasma modification technology and applied for the preservation of tilapia fillets . Based on the analysis of surface morphology and surface functional groups it was shown that plasma modification allowed CS and GA coating on PE . And GACS PE demonstrated better antioxidant ability than CS PE and GA PE individually . The results of the tilapia freshness test showed that the total plate count showed that GACS PE can inhibit 1.52 log CFU g and delay the production of volatile basic nitrogen below 15mg 100g after 14 d of storage . Moreover GA PE and GACS PE showed better thiobarbituric acid inhibitiry effect than control on day 14 . These results indicate that these packaging films are efficient in extending the shelf life of tilapia fillets .

@highlight An active packaging coated with CS and GA was developed by plasma modification.
@highlight The active packaging exhibited strong radical scavenging activity to about 90 .
@highlight Active packaging could reduce 1.52 log CFU g VBN 89.9 and TBA 33.3 .
@highlight GACS PE preserved the quality on packaged Tilapia through 14days.
