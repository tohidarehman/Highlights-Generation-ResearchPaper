 A rapid synergistic cloud point extraction for nine alkylphenols coupled with high performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection was developed . The non ionic surfactant polyethylene glycol 6000 was selected as the extractant . Acetonitrile was used as a revulsant and synergistic reagent with Na

@highlight A rapid synergistic cloud point extraction was first developed for alkylphenols.
@highlight Acetonitrile worked as a new revulsant and synergic reagent in this study.
@highlight The CPT of PEG 6000 was decreased to ambient temperature by acetonitrile and sodium sulfate.
@highlight BoxBehnken design with the desirability function was used to optimize the RS CPE condition.
@highlight All of the extraction efficiencies obtained were higher than 91.4 .
