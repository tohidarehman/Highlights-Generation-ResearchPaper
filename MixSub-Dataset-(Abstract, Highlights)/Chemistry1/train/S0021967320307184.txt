 An analytical method for the quantification of thirty three perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances in animal liver was developed applying the isotopic dilution methodology with twenty one labelled isotopologues of native compounds . The proposed protocol involved the determination of short and long aliphatic chain PFASs C

@highlight A method for 33 PFASs was developed in liver using LC Q Orbitrap.
@highlight Satisfactory performance characteristics were obtained.
@highlight LOQs were generally lower than 100 pg
@highlight Method was employed for the analysis of farm animal liver samples.
@highlight Chicken was the less contaminated species.
