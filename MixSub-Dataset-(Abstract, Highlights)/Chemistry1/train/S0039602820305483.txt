 The structure of self assembled monolayers of 1 4 benzene dithiol oligomers on Au has been investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy measurements in ultrahigh vacuum combined with density function theory calculations . The dominant adsorption geometry of 1 4 BDT oligomer chains involves an Au adatom linker forming a complex with two trans anchoring groups resulting in a zigzag structure . STM measurements show preferential growth from step edges where gold adatoms can be extracted to form the oligomers . Ladder like structures involving two parallel oligomer chains are observed at medium coverages suggesting a stabilizing interaction between neighboring chains and reduced mobility following oligomerization . At high coverages the gold surface is covered with close packed domains of oligomers . DFT STM simulations were performed using the Tersoff Hamann method in order to elucidate structures observed in STM measurements .
