 RPLC MS MS is the present workhorse for bottom up proteomics based characterization . However it suffers from limited peak capacity and challenges with respect to detection of small and hydrophilic peptides . CZE MS MS offers an orthogonal alternative to RPLC MS MS but has limited sensitivity due to low sample loading . In the present work for the first time offline coupling of an RPLCCZEMS MS has been demonstrated for peptide mapping of a monoclonal antibody based therapeutic product . The performance of this platform has been compared to the state of the art RPLC MS MS and CZE MS MS approaches . Fifteen fractions were isolated from a mAb tryptic digest using RPLC and each fraction was analyzed by CZE ESI MS MS . Results indicate that not only the RPLCCZEMS MS platform identified a larger number of distinct peptides than the RPLC MS MS and CZE MS MS platforms it also offered significantly superior sequence coverage . Also the distribution of amino acid residues with post translational modifications was 413 for RPLCCZEMS MS 150 for RPLC MS MS and 94 for CZE MS MS . In fact the RPLCCZEMS MS system performed better than the combined datasets from RPLC MS MS or CZE MS MS. Our study shows that the traditionally used one dimensional RPLC MS MS and CZE MS MS based platforms may not be enough for characterization of complex molecules such as monoclonal antibodies . The proposed approach should be an essential addition to the analytical toolkit for in depth primary structural characterization of mAbs .

@highlight A RPLCCZE MS MS platform was used for the first in depth mAb characterization.
@highlight RPLCCZEMS MS covered more sequence peptides PTMs than RPLC MS MS CZE MS MS.
@highlight It was more informative than even the combined datasets of RPLC MS MS CZE MS MS.
@highlight 1D RPLC and CZE methods are thus not enough for characterization of mAbs.
@highlight RPLCCZEMS MS should be added to the analytical toolbox for mAb characterization.
