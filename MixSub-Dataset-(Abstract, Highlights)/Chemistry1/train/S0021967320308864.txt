 A sensitive multiresidue method was developed to quantify 35 pharmaceuticals and 28 metabolites transformation products in fish liver fish fillet and fish plasma via LC MS MS . The method was designed to cover a broad range of substance polarities . This objective was realized by using non discriminating sample clean ups including separation technique based on size exclusion namely restricted access media chromatography . This universal clean up allows for an easy integration of further organic micropollutants into the analytical method . Limits of quantification ranged from 0.05 to 5.5ng mL in fish plasma from 0.1 to 19ng g d.w. in fish fillet and from 0.46 to 48ng g d.w. in fish liver . The method was applied for the analysis of fillets and livers of breams from the rivers Rhine and Saar the Teltow Canal as well as carps kept in fish monitoring ponds fed by effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants . This allowed for the first detection of 17 analytes including 10 metabolites TPs such as gabapentin lactam and norlidocaine in fish tissues . These results highlight the importance of including metabolites and transformation products of pharmaceuticals in fish monitoring campaigns and further investigating their potential effects .

@highlight A generic multi residue method was developed for fish environmental samples.
@highlight 35 pharmaceuticals and 28 metabolites TP were investigated in fish tissues.
@highlight Pharmaceuticals and their metabolites are ubiquitous in fish from German rivers.
@highlight Metabolites and TP show similar concentrations levels than their parent.
