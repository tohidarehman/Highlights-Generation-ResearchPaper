 Chitosan mats obtained by electrospinning are potentially ideal scaffolds for tissue engineering . This technique allows obtaining nanometric fibrous structures with preferred orientation which in turn enable cells to align themselves and produce extracellular matrix along desired orientations . In this study we fabricated aligned Cs electrospun nanofiber mats and investigated the role of the amino acid

@highlight Chitosan fibrous mats with preferred orientation were obtained by electrospinning.
@highlight  Arginine was used as a novel bioactive stabilizing agent of Cs nanofibers.
@highlight L Arg improved wettability mechanical properties and stability in aqueous medium.
@highlight Cell based tests showed biomimicking suitability of the nanofibers architectures.
@highlight L Arg operated as metabolic activator being potential enhancer in regenerative events.
