 Laser plasmas produced by ablation of a gold target in a vacuum are spatially and temporally characterized by optical emission spectroscopy . A Nd YAG laser 1064nm pulse width 15ns and fluences of 5.8 and 11J cm

@highlight Imaging spectroscopy of gold LPPs has been assessed.
@highlight Fundamental plasma parameters were spatially and temporally quantified.
@highlight Plasma temperature calculated comparing experimental and atomic Boltzmann LTE spectra.
@highlight Ion abundance as a function of plasma temperature has been calculated.
@highlight The dynamics of gold plasma species generated near ablation threshold is described.
