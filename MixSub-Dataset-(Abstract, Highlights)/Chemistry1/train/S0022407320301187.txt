 An improved model of the aircraft plume is proposed to analyze the effects of alumina particle clusters on ultraviolet radiation signature . In the simulation the scattering effect of particle clusters rather than individual particles on the radiation characteristics in the plume is considered . The modified diffusion limited aggregation method is used to generate the geometry of the cluster example and the scattering characteristics of the particle clusters are calculated by multi sphere T matrix method at first . Then the average optical properties of the particle clusters are calculated and applied to improved spherical harmonic discrete ordinate method together with a new source term about the chemiluminescence emission in the plume the improved radiation model is constructed carefully . The simulation results show that at a small observation angle alumina particle clusters can significantly enhance the radiance of the plume comparing to the individual particle model . Meanwhile the radiance distribution of a more realistic three dimensional plume is presented when both the radial and axial property variation of a whole plume structure are concerned in this model .
