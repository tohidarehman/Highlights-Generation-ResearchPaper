 Although around 90 years have passed since Richards and Loomis developed the first experiments in sonochemistry ultrasound is still awakening interest in the scientific community in particular in the Analytical Chemistry field as a result of the high number of benefits achieved which are also in accordance with Green Analytical Chemistry principles . In the last years and among the different reported applications an important number of works have arisen devoted to the synthesis of new materials to the development of sonoelectroanalytical sensors or to new spectroscopic approaches among others . Efforts are also being made to try to understand the real mechanism of such applications . This review article is aimed at providing a general overview of the different applications of ultrasound in Analytical Chemistry also briefly highlighting its fundamentals and traditional applications with a special emphasis on the most recent and challenging works that are still in the horizon of its near future .

@highlight The different applications of US in analytical chemistry are overviewed.
@highlight Fundamentals and more traditional applications are also presented.
@highlight US assisted synthesis of nanomaterials comprise a high number of applications.
@highlight Sonoelectroanalytical sensors and new spectroscopic approaches are also of relevance.
