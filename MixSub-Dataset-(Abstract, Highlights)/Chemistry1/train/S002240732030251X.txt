 In this paper we present results of rotational vibrational and gas temperature distribution study in the cathode sheath region of an abnormal glow discharge in hydrogen and hydrogen argon mixture . For this purpose we used Q branch of the Fulcher diagonal bands d

@highlight Emission spectra of the rotational lines for the hydrogen Fulcher system is recorded.
@highlight The boundary of the cathode sheath is determined using the polarized h line.
@highlight Rotational temperature is measured using Fulcher q 33 band.
@highlight Vibrational temperature is determined from the relative intensities of two consecutive bands.
@highlight Gas temperature is determined from the population of Q branches for the ground vibrational state.
