 The performance of columns packed with 1.7m particles for aqueous size exclusion chromatography was assessed at high pressure conditions and linked to particle and column bed integrity . Decreasing the particle size from 3.5m to 1.7m increases the resolution due to the improved mass transfer characteristics allowing to significantly speed up analysis without compromising the selectivity . A sub minute separation of intact proteins was realized on a 4.6mm i.d75mm long column packed with 1.7m SEC particles applying a flow rate of 1.8mL min corresponding to a column pressure of 530bar . Ultra high pressure operation resulted in peak deformation a shift towards earlier retention times and an alteration in selectivity . To gain insights in the mechanisms of column deterioration short 30mm long columns were operated at UHPLC conditions maximizing the pressure drop over individual particles . This resulted in the presence of fractured particles situated at the column outlet as verified by scanning electron micrographs . Mercury intrusion porosimetry and argon adsorption measurements did not reveal significant differences in intraparticle volume between particle batches sampled before and after pressure stress testing . As particles at the column outlet fracture at high pressure operation a void was formed at the column inlet . The degradation of the separation performance appeared to be the result of a decrease in interparticle pore volume .

@highlight Column bed compression due to UHPLC operating conditions affects SEC selectivity.
@highlight 1.7m particles enhances kinetic performance allowing for sub min separations.
@highlight Complementary particle analysis revealed unimodal pore characteristics.
@highlight High pressure operation results in bed compression which impairs chromatography.
