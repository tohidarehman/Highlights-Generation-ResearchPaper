 In this study ab initio calculations molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulation techniques are used to investigate the structural properties of triptycene based polymers of intrinsic microporosity consisting of polyimide branched with the side groups C

@highlight Comparison of the obtained results for the studied gases through PIM membranes indicated consistency with the experimental..
@highlight Increasing the size of the side branch in the PIMs caused narrower distribution in dihedral angle profile..
@highlight The diffusion coefficient is affected by the effective diameter of gas molecule and their interaction with the polymer matrix.
@highlight The membrane with C
@highlight as the side branch indicated the best selectivity in separation of O
@highlight  N
@highlight  .
@highlight The membrane with CF
@highlight as the side branch showed an acceptable performance in separation of H
@highlight S CH
@highlight  and CO
