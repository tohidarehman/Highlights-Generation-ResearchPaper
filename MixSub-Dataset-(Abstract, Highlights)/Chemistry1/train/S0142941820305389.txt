 Because of containing urea groups flame resistance and smoke releasing behaviors of isocyanate based polyimide foam produced using free foaming technology require further improvement . In this work silica aerogel layers were incorporated into cells of IBPIF through an

@highlight Layered silica aerogel with heat insulation and fire resistance could firmly attach to the pores and surfaces of IBPIF cells.
@highlight With increase in ratio of M SS V IBPIF silica aerogel incorporation dosage was gradually increased.
@highlight By the situ sol gel growth the cell structure of IBPIF could not be changed even when silica aerogel was added to 131.8 .
@highlight As silica aerogel dosage and thickness added IBPIF flame resistance was enhanced and smoke release behavior was inhibited.
@highlight As M SS V IBPIF was 5 15 g cm
@highlight  IBPIF LOI value was 30 smoke maximum specific optical density was reduced by 62 .
