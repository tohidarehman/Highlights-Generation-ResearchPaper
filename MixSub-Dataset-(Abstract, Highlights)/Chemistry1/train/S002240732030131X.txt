 Light transmission through Intraocular lens with glistenings and whitenings are analyzed by using T matrix theory . Visual function is decreased due to glistening and subsurface nanoglistening . Glistening means fluid filled micro sized vacuoles on the other hand whitening is nano sized vacuoles in intraocular lens which lead to light scattering and affect human s vision quality . Glistening observation and light scattering in IOL are observed from the characteristics of glistenings which are size shape refractive index and number of glistenings . When microvacuoles are densely located in IOL light scattering for single particle is not sufficient and multiple light scattering is important to be considered . Therefore the correlation between light transmission and glistening characteristics are investigated from electromagnetic scattering approach called T matrix . For this purpose light scattering simulation software CELES is applied and studied the light transmission in terms of power reflectivity and transitivity . The simulation result can show that light transmittance through IOL to retina and evaluate the quality of the vision by light scattering .
