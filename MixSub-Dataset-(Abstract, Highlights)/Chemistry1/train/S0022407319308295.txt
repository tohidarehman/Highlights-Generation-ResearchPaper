 The influence of dielectronic recombination of projectile ions on characteristics of fast heavy ion beams passing through cold plasmas is studied on the basis of fully relativistic multi configuration calculations of DR rate coefficients . Present results are compared with the first results for DR rates of 1.5 MeV u iodine ions penetrating fully ionized hydrogen plasma with the electron temperature

@highlight Dielectronic recombination influences the characteristics of fast heavy ion beams passing through cold plasmas.
@highlight Dielectronic recombination rates of projectiles are large strongly increase the total recombination rate and decrease the mean equilibrium charge of the ion beam.
@highlight A knowledge of correct dielectronic recombination rate values allows one to predict the charge state distributions of ions moving in a plasma and to find the optimal conditions beam energy plasma density and temperature to obtain ions with required charge state and density.
