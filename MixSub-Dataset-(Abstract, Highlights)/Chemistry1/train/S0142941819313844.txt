 Development of antistatic thermoplastic elastomer composites is gaining much interest in scientific and industrial aspects . In this contribution a novel type of polyester block ether copolymer PEBE with ionic liquid and quaternized PEBE were synthesized characterized and compounded with a commercial bottle grade polyester resin . It was found that the surface resistivity of the PET composite films was around 10

@highlight Novel types of polyether block esters PEBE as antistatic agents were synthesized.
@highlight The surface resistivity of PET composite film dropped to 10
@highlight  sq.
@highlight The conductivity of PET composite film improved 10
@highlight times compared to the neat PET film.
@highlight Antistatic PET composite films had good mechanical and optical properties.
@highlight The percolation threshold was 610wt PEBE based antistatic agents.
