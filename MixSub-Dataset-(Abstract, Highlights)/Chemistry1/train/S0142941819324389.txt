 Continuous carbon fiber reinforced poly ether ether ketone composites have attracted significant interests in mission critical applications for their exceptional mechanical properties and high thermal resistance . In this study we additively manufactured CCF PEEK laminates by the Laser assisted Laminated Object Manufacturing technique which was recently reported by the authors . The effects of laser power and consolidation speed on the flexural strength of the CCF PEEK composites were studied to obtain the optimal process parameters . Hot press postprocessing was performed to further improve the mechanical properties of the composites . Various fiber alignment laminates were prepared and the flexural and tensile properties were characterized . The hot press postprocessing 3D printed unidirectional CCF PEEK composites exhibited ultrahigh flexural modulus and strength of 125.7GPa and 1901.1MPa respectively . In addition the tensile modulus and strength of the composites reached 133.1GPa and 1513.8MPa . The results showed that the fabricated CCF PEEK exhibited superior mechanical performance compare to fused filament fabrication printed carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics .
