 The solubility of thiamethoxam in nine single solvents and binary mixed solvents was measured by dynamic laser method from 278.15K to 323.15K under pressure of 101.2kPa . Modified Apelblat equation

@highlight Solubility of thiamethoxam in nine pure solvents and one binary mixed solvent was measured.
@highlight Polar properties and similar phase dissolution theory were applied to explain the solubility behavior.
@highlight Solubility data was correlated by Modified Apelblat 
@highlight Wilson NRTL Wilson and Jouyban acree model.
@highlight The thermodynamic properties of dissolution in pure and mixed solvents are calculated by Wilson equation.
