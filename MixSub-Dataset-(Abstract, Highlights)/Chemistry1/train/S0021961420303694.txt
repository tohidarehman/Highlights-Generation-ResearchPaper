 Equilibrium apixaban solubility in isopropanol water ethanol water acetone water and methanol water mixtures was acquired by a shake flask method from 288.15K to 328.15K under atmospheric pressure of 101.2kPa . At a certain temperature the highest apixaban solubility in mole fraction scale was observed in neat solvents of acetone methanol for the acetone methanol water solutions while for the ethanol isopropanol water solutions the solubility data presented a maximum value with the ethanol isopropanol mass fraction of about 0.8 . The determined solubility values were treated by linear solvation energy relationships in order to explain the solvent effect and find its major descriptors . The preferential solvation was studied by the method of inverse KirkwoodBuff integrals based on some thermodynamic solution properties . In the methanol water mixture with compositions 0.31

@highlight Apixaban I solubility in four aqueous co solvent mixtures was determined.
