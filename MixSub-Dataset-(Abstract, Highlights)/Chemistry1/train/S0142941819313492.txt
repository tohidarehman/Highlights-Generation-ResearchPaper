 Hydrogel is used as an adsorbent for the removal of dyes and heavy metals in waste water . In this work different methods of synthesising novel hydrogels from liquid natural rubber were investigated . The two different methods were ultrasonic assisted polymerisation and heating under reflux . Through graft modification LNR had initially combined with maleic anhydride using benzoyl peroxide as a radical initiator . After grafting acrylic acid was crosslinked onto LNR

@highlight Different methods of synthesis novel rubber based hydrogels were investigated ultrasonic assisted and reflux.
@highlight The maximum percentage of malachite green MG dye in aqueous solution removal by this hydrogel is 94.13 .
@highlight The main mechanism for the adsorption of MG dye from solutions is ion exchange mechanism.
@highlight The adsorption model followed Freundlich isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic model.
@highlight The reusability of hydrogel up to 6 cycles.
