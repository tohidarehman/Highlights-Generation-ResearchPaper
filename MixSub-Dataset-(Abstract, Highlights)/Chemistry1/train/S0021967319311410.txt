 Steroid hormones are a type of crucial substances that mediate numerous vital physiological functions . The comprehensive detection of steroid hormones can help understand the physiopathologic mechanism of steroid hormone related diseases . It is very difficult to determine steroid hormones in biological samples due to their low endogenous concentrations and poor ionization efficiency . In this study an efficient and sensitive approach was developed for profiling steroid hormones by combining liquid liquid extraction and parallel derivatization with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry . Methoxyamine and dansyl chloride were used to derivatize steroid hormones containing carbonyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups respectively . Our established method achieved simultaneous analysis of carbonyl and phenolic hydroxyl containing steroid hormones and could cover estrogens androgens corticoids and progestogens . Twenty nine steroid hormones were detected at pg mL levels with the sensitivity enhanced by three orders of magnitude after derivatization . The linearity precision and recovery were satisfactory for quantitative analysis of steroid hormones . Finally the established method was successfully employed to the determination of steroid hormones in serum samples of healthy males and females as well as ovarian cancer patients . The results showed that this approach was suitable and reliable for routine test of steroid hormones containing carbonyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups .

@highlight A parallel derivatization strategy for steroid hormones was newly proposed.
@highlight The approach has a broad coverage of steroid hormones.
@highlight The sensitivity of the method was greatly improved by three orders of magnitude.
