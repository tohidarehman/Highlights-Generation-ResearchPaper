 In this work the blends of epoxy and polycaprolactone with a bio based curing agent viz . cashew nut shell liquid were studied for their dual responsive shape memory and self healing behaviors . The suitable EP CNSL weight ratio was observed at 70 30 . The increase of PCL content up to 20wt in EP CNSL matrix significantly enhanced the shape memory response to both thermal and chemical stimuli . All specimens showed 100 thermo responsive shape recovery and the recovery time decreased with increasing PCL content . In the case of chemo responsive shape memory the immersion times spent for 100 shape recovery in water and methanol substantially decreased when PCL was added . Moreover after thermal treatment the EP CNSL matrix with 20wt PCL showed significant self healing ability with high tensile strength recovery at 93.70 . The EP CNSL PCL copolymer could be a promising alternative bio related smart material for various applications such as dual activated sensors and coatings with self healing ability .

@highlight Epoxy polycaprolactone copolymers cured with cashew nut shell liquid were prepared.
@highlight The copolymers showed both thermo and chemo responsive shape memory effects.
@highlight PCL improved the shape memory behaviors and self healing ability of copolymers.
@highlight The tensile strength of self healed sample was significant at 93.70 of original.
