 Consumption of ciguatoxin contaminated seafood can lead to ciguatera poisoning . The diagnosis of CP in humans is based on the clinical symptoms after eating the fish from tropical or subtropical areas because no confirmatory clinical tests are available . One of the challenges for ciguatoxin analysis is their extremely low but toxicologically relevant concentration in biological samples . We previously reported a method using acetonitrile to precipitate proteins and extract the ciguatoxins simultaneously in whole blood samples from animals for toxin quantification by N2A cell based assay . However a test method for unambiguous confirmation of exposure of marine animals or humans to ciguatoxins is still needed . In the present study we adopted the acetonitrile extraction method and added sample clean up in the sample preparation for the determination of Pacific ciguatoxins CTX1B 52

@highlight Sample clean up methods for toxins from both groups of Pacific ciguatoxins.
@highlight The MS responses of the toxins varied widely with LC mobile phase conditions.
@highlight Ciguatoxin ionization profiles varied with mass spectrometers.
