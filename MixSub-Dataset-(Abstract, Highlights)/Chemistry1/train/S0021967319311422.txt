 To monitor the existing and emerging halogenated carboxylic acids in drinking water a sensitive and rapid ultra high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry method for simultaneous target quantification of 10 haloacetic acids and semi target screening of 19 HCAs was developed . After filtration drinking water samples were injected into the instrument . HCAs were separated on an HSS T3 column and detected by a type of non target scan in the electrospray ionization negative mode . For target quantification of 10 HAAs good linearity was obtained and the correlation coefficients were higher than 0.995 . The limits of detection were in the range of 0.0502.0g L. The recoveries were in the range of 89.7 108 83.4 121 77.1 116 and 80.2 104 at levels of 2.5 5.0 10 and 20g L respectively with relative standard deviations of 1.26 16.9 . For semi target screening of 19 HCAs several criteria including accurate

@highlight A rapid UPLC Q Orbitrap HRMS method for target quantification and semi target screening of HCAs was developed.
@highlight g L sensitivity was obtained when the sample was directly injected for analysis.
@highlight The semi target screening strategy was shown successfully by reference standards.
@highlight 13 suspect HCAs and 5 target HCAs were detected in drinking water which DCAA and TCAA in some samples exceeded the limits suggested by the EPA and WHO.
