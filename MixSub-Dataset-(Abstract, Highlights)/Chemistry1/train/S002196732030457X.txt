 Polyimide microspheres assembled by nanosheets were used for bar adsorptive microextraction for the first time . The PI microsphere possessed self organized hierarchical nanostructure large specific surface area 170 m

@highlight Polyimide PI microsphere assembled by nanosheets coated BAE was proposed.
@highlight PI microsphere had large specific surface area 170 m
@highlight  g and good thermostability.
@highlight Nitroaromatic explosives in water samples were quantified by BAE TD GCMS.
@highlight High enrichment factors 5281410 and low LODs 0.0050.013g L were obtained.
@highlight The reproducibility of the BAE devices was less than 13.0 RSD for peak area.
