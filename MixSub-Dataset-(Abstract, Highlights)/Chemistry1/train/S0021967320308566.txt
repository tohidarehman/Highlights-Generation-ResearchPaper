 Selective extraction is a great concern in the field of natural products . The interest is to apply specific conditions favouring the solubility of targeted secondary metabolites and avoiding the simultaneous extraction of unwanted ones . Different ways exist to reach selective extractions with suited conditions . These conditions can be determined from experimental studies through experimental design but a full experimental design takes time energy and uses plant samples . Prediction from varied solubility models can also be applied allowing a better understanding of the final selected conditions and eventually less experiments .
