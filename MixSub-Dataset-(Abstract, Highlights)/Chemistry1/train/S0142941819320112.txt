 Collagen and chitosan are widely employed as biomaterials including for 3D bioprinting . However the use of collagen and chitosan blends as bioinks is still scarce . In this work the rheology of different hydrogel precursors was analyzed through frequency and strain sweeps as well as at different shear rates . Col chi blends showed a shear thinning behavior with viscosity values at low shear rates between 0.35 and 2.80Pas . Considering the strain rate determined by the applied flow in a 3D bioprinter precursor viscosities during the extrusion were in the interval 0.50.8Pas . Printability was measured comparing images of the printed meshes and the corresponding CAD grid design using photograph analysis . Col chi 0.36 1.00 was chosen to print mono layered scaffolds for tissue engineering because of its suitable viscosity printability and polymer ratio content . Hydrogels were obtained through NaHCO
