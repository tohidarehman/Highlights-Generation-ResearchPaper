 In this paper the bending fatigue tests of honeycomb sandwich panels are carried out by using an improved three point bending test fixture and the S N curves at different stress ratios are obtained . Through the records of fatigue damage in the experiment the failure mode of the honeycomb sandwich panels and the source of fatigue damage are determined . At the same time through the calculation of the shear stress distribution on the honeycomb wall the reasons for the difference in the failure morphology of the L direction and W direction sandwich panels are clarified . Besides a life prediction method is proposed and its effectiveness in predicting the fatigue life of sandwich panels has been verified .
