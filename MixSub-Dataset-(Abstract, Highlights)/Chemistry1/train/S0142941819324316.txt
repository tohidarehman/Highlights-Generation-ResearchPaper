 In this study polyaniline was introduced for improving the self sensing capability of glass fiber reinforced polymer composites . A PANI based conductive polymer matrix was employed to develop high conductive glass fiber reinforced conductive composite . Piezoresistive characterization studies were conducted on the GFRCP specimens by subjecting to monotonic and cyclic loading . Further thermal study was performed to ratify the thermal stability of the composite . During all tests the DC resistance was measured to correlate the strain . The gauge factor of the sensor was estimated as 1.5 . Moreover stability reversibility and repeatability of the self sensing GFRCP composites are estimated . The responses of the GFRCP composite established the material has outstanding self sensing abilities to monitor the strain . This new GFRCP composite not only acts as a self sensing structural strain sensor but also its high electrical conductivity can open up new opportunities to explore its other functionality like damage detection lightning strike protection mechanical vibration sensing and self protection from an electromagnetic wave .

@highlight Polyaniline has been introduced to develop and characterize the self sensing structural strain sensor.
@highlight The working range of the sensor was estimated based on linearity thermal stability creep effect and hysteresis error.
@highlight The study also confirmed the reversibility stability and repeatability of the sensor within the working range.
