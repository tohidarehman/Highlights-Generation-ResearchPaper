 In this paper we designed and fabricated a graphene transferred to grating structure with high absorption from 4 m to 14 m. The grating structure was composed of Au SiO

@highlight A graphene transferred to Au SiO
@highlight  Au grating structure is designed and fabricated.
@highlight We have experimentally demonstrated high absorption in six sets of graphene grating devices in the infrared region.
@highlight We deeply analyzed the differences between the experimental and simulation of the dynamic control characteristics of graphene grating structures.
