 The adsorption processes of lactam antibiotics including ampicillin amoxicillin and benzylpenicillin on the vermiculite surface were investigated using density functional theory computations . The C09 vdW density functional was used to include van der Waals interactions for determination of the most stable configurations governing the interactions between AP AX and BP molecules and the vermiculite surface . Each molecule prefers to arrange horizontally on the surface to form both MgS and Mg contacts or two MgO electrostatic interactions between S atom in

@highlight A molecular level insight into adsorption of lactam antibiotics on vermiculite surface is thoroughly investigated by using DFT computations.
@highlight The adsorption process is determined as strong chemisorption and adsorptive capacity increases from amoxicillin via benzylpenicillin and then to ampicillin.
@highlight The most stable complexes are preferably formed in a horizontal arrangement and significantly stabilized by MgO S electrostatic and O
@highlight HO hydrogen bonded interactions. An important role of Mg interaction in the complexes stabilization has been observed for the first time.
