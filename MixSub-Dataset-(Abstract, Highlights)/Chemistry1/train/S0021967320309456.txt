 A rapid simple and generic analytical method has been developed for the analysis of veterinary drugs in pork by a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry . This method allows for the simultaneous identification screening and quantitation of 141 veterinary drug residues and metabolites from eighteen different classes . After extraction with acetonitrile water and clean up with C

@highlight Simultaneous screening and identification of 141 drug residues in pork by LC Q TOF MS including both authorized drugs and banned drugs.
@highlight The chromatographic optimization allowed for the separation detection of 141 compounds within 27min.
@highlight Our self created accurate mass database proved to be feasible for the practice.
@highlight The generic sample extraction and untargeted HRMS scanning enabled the detection and identification of 5 metabolites of sulfamethazine in the positive sample in the same time.
