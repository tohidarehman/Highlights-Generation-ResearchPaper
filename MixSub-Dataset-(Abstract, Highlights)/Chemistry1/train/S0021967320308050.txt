 An improved pretreatment approach of human breast tissue is demonstrated for subsequent analysis of seven parabens including methyl paraben ethyl paraben propyl paraben butyl paraben isopropyl paraben isobutyl paraben and benzyl paraben . Specifically a well designed homogenization procedure conjugated with an optimized fabric phase sorptive extraction protocol resulted in a carefully outlined sample preparation process as part of a green simple sensitive economical and fast HPLC PDA analytical method in agreement with Green Analytical Chemistry demands . Among all tested FPSE membranes the highest extraction efficiency was achieved by employing sol gel poly coating on 100 cotton cellulose fabric that represents a medium polarity microextraction device which combined the advanced material characteristics of sol gel sorbent and the rich surface chemistry of an inherent porous cellulose fabric substrate . The chromatographic separation was accomplished with a Spherisorb C
