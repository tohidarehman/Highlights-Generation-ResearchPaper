@highlight We report an experimental study of nonlinear radiation trapping in a high density rubidium vapor where the self broadening exceeded the Doppler broadening.
@highlight We observe growing of the effective radiative lifetime with increasing optical power in dense gas.
@highlight It was shown that incoherent optical saturation can be increased by the number of photon absorption reemission in the radiation transfer process.
@highlight The radiation trapping effect helped to increase the incoherent saturation.
