 Lubrication is one of the most important parameters in unplasticized polyvinyl chloride processing apart from the PVC resin and processing equipment . Lubricants are used in specific ratios to ensure effective fusion of PVC particles . The exact mechanism on how these lubricants interact is not yet fully understood . A widely accepted theory is the interaction mechanism proposed by Rabinovic et al . where lubricants are said to act as surfactants and slip agents . In this study a method for tracking lubricants by simulating the extrusion process within a single screw extruder was proposed . A three stage fusion simulation consisted of the feeding zone the compression zone and the metering zone . The association interactions between the individual components of a typical uPVC formulation were followed throughout the three stages . External polar and nonpolar lubricants in combination with an internal lubricant was studied . Lubricants were successfully tracked using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy . In conclusion it was found that the use of an internal lubricant promotes dispersion of external lubrication towards PVC . It was also found that there is a competition between the internal lubricant and polar external lubricant .
