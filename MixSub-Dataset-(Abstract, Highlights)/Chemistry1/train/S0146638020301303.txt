 The provenance of brGDGTs in marine sediments was initially thought to be from terrestrial soils and hence brGDGTs based proxies have been used for reconstructing terrestrial environments . However this notion has been challenged by the finding that the distribution of brGDGTs in marine sediments can differ from global surface soils . To constrain the sources of brGDGTs in marine sediments in the East China Sea we analyzed brGDGTs occurring as both fossil core and in living intact polar lipids . The results showed that the distribution of core brGDGTs was similar to IPL derived brGDGTs but differed clearly from those in the global soils database . In addition for both IPL derived and core brGDGTs the methylation index MBT
