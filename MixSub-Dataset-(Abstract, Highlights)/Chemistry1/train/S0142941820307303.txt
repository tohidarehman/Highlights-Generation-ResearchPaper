 Material databases of plastics are becoming more and more the focus of applied science and commercial use in industry . Material properties of material manufacturers are often provided in publicly accessible material databases which usually contain processing and mechanical properties under static loadings . Fatigue strength values are usually not accessible . The fatigue data for thermoplastics is of particular interest as these materials have a particularly high lightweight construction potential and can be processed with a high degree of automation and reproducibility .
