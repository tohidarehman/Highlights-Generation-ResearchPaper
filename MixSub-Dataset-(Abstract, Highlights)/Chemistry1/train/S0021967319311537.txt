 Recently in separation science ionic liquids have been commonly used as modifiers for buffer solutions dynamic coating solutions or coating solutions on carriers in capillary electrophoresis . However only several papers have reported the use of chiral ILs as the sole chiral selector . In this paper a chiral ionic liquid cholinium clindamycin phosphate was synthesized and employed as a sole chiral selector in capillary electrophoresis . A series of parameters affecting the separation were optimized including chiral selector concentration buffer pH proportion of organic modifier as well as the applied voltage . Under the optimal conditions compared to clindamycin phosphate the IL selector showed better enantioseparation capability and improved peak shapes for five racemic drugs . In addition Molecular docking program Autodock was employed to elucidate the chiral recognition mechanism of Ch CP the computing results conformed to the experimental results .
