 In this paper high pressure densities at six different temperatures are presented and viscosity measurements at five isotherms in the range of 313.15K to 393.15K are also reported both for two aqueous solutions of MDEA DEA with mass fractions of

@highlight Densities and viscosities of MDEA DEA water mixtures at mass fractions of amines 0.1 0.3 and 0.3 0.1 are reported.
@highlight These properties were measured from 313.15 to 393.15 K and pressures up to 100MPa for viscosity and 140MPa for density.
@highlight Densities were correlated using Tamman Tait equation and VFT was used to correlate viscosity.
@highlight These models give standard deviations in agreement with the uncertainties.
