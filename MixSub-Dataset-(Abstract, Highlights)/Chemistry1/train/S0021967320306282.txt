 In ionexchange chromatography the pH gradient mode becomes more and more popular today for the analysis of therapeutic proteins as this mode can provide higher or alternative selectivity to the commonly used salt gradient mode . Ideally a linear pH response is expected when performing linear gradients . However up to now only a very few buffer systems have been developed and are commercially available which can perform nearly linear pH responses when flowing through a given column . It is also known that a selected buffer system can work well on one column but can fail on other column . The goal of this study was to practically evaluate the effects that ionexchange columns might have on effluent pH when performing linear pH gradient separations of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies . To attain this objective the pH was monitored on line at the column outlet using a specific setup . To make comprehensive observations of the phenomenon four different mobile phase conditions and five cation exchange columns were employed . The obtained pH responses were systematically compared to responses measured in the absence of the columns .

@highlight The effect of ion exchange columns on effluent pH was studied.
@highlight Various buffer systems and state of the art columns were evaluated.
@highlight Deviations from linear pH response might strongly depend on the column.
@highlight Gradient steepness and column volume need to be considered to develop linear pH gradients.
