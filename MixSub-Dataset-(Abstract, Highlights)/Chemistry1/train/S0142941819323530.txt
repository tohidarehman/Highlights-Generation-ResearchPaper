 A series of biodegradable poly with different aromatic units content was synthesized and then melt blended by adding cellulose nanocrystals to manufacture the full organic composites . A network like structure of CNCs in PBST matrix was evaluated by rheometer . The storage modulus and complex viscosity at low frequency region were significantly enhanced with increasing CNC content . Meanwhile the decreasing

@highlight A natural organic reinforcing material was used to enhance the physical properties of PBST.
@highlight The storage modulus and complex viscosity were significantly enhanced with increasing CNC content.
@highlight The PBST CNC composites might have a potential use in biomedical applications.
