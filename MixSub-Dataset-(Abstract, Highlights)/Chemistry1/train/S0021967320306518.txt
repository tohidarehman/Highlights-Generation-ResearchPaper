 This work demonstrates the development of a compact modular cost effective separation system configured to address a specific separation problem . The principles of the separation are based on gradient capillary liquid chromatography where the system consists of precision stepper motor driven portable syringe pumps with interchangeable glass syringes . Excellent flow rate precision of

@highlight Portable and fully modular compact capillary liquid chromatography system has been developed.
@highlight Custom built syringe pumps with a wide range of capillary flow rates.
@highlight High sensitivity Z type UV absorbance detector with custom built passively cooled housing was evaluated.
@highlight High repeatability of 1.5 RSD for peak area and 0.4 RSD for retention time was achieved.
