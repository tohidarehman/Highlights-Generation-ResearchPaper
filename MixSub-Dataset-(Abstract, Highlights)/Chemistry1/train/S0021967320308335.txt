 The surface of fifteen polymethacrylate monolithic stationary phases has been modified by a post polymerization UV initiated grafting reaction with bifunctional polydimethacrylate monomers . An effect of crosslinking monomer length its concentration in the modification mixture and a time of the modification reaction have been selected to control the extent of modification by a design of experiments protocol . Hydrodynamic and kinetic properties of prepared columns were characterized by capillary liquid chromatography . Regression analysis of determined data revealed that there is only a minor effect of modification reaction on column permeability as it is rather controlled by the composition of the polymerization mixture used to prepare generic monolith . On the other hand the utilization of shorter crosslinking monomer increased the formation of small pores and minimized mass transfer resistance effect . Both column efficiency and mass transfer resistance also improved when a lower concentration of crosslinking monomer in the modification mixture was used . Photografting modification decreased a negative effect of mass transfer resistance related to a crosslink density gradient and allowed fast isocratic separations of dopamine metabolism related compounds . Developed preparation protocol might be further utilized in the preparation of monolithic stationary phases in microfluidic devices .
