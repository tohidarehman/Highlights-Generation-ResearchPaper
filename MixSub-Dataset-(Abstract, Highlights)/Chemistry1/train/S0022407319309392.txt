 Artificial skyglow is a form of light pollution with wide ranging implications on the environment . The extent intensity and color of skyglow depends on the artificial light sources and weather conditions . Skyglow can be best determined with ground based instruments . We mapped the skyglow of Berlin Germany for clear sky and overcast sky conditions inside and outside of the city limits . We conducted observations using a transect from the city center of Berlin towards a rural place more than 58km south of Berlin using all sky photometry with a calibrated commercial digital camera and a fisheye lens . From the multispectral imaging data we processed luminance and correlated color temperature maps . We extracted the night sky brightness and correlated color temperature at zenith as well as horizontal and scalar illuminance simultaneously . We calculated cloud amplification factors at each site and investigated the changes of brightness and color with distance particularly showing differences inside and outside of the city limits . We found high values for illuminance above full moon light levels and amplification factors as high as 25 in the city center and a gradient towards the city limit and outside of the city limit . We further observed that clouds decrease the correlated color temperature in almost all cases . We discuss advantages and weaknesses of our method compare the results with modeled night sky brightness data and provide recommendations for future work .

@highlight The brightness and color of skyglow was mapped inside and outside of a city for clear and overcast skies.
@highlight High luminance values and illuminance values were obtained within the city for overcast conditions.
@highlight Cloud amplification is highest in city center.
@highlight Clouds shift the color of the night sky towards the red.
