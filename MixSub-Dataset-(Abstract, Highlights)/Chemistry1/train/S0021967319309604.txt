 Analysis of acrylamide in coffee by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry is prone to interferences . According to our study unknown background ions can entail an overestimation by up to 40 in case of coelution with acrylamide . In order to develop a precise and accurate quantification method for acrylamide identification and removal of these interfering ions is requested . We thus studied potential isobaric impurities of acrylamide using liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry . An in source fragment of

@highlight  Acetyl alanine was identified as an interference of acrylamide in coffee.
@highlight An in source fragment of
@highlight  acetyl alanine is interfering with acrylamide signal.
@highlight Overestimation can reach 40 if acrylamide coelutes with
@highlight  acetyl alanine.
@highlight Mobile phases without modifier allow an interference free acrylamide analysis.
