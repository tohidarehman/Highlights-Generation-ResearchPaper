 Proton conducting and methanol barrier properties of the proton exchange membrane as well as the high cost of direct methanol fuel cell components are the key determinants of the performance and commercialization of DMFCs . Therefore this study aimed to develop cost and performance effective membranes based on sulphonated poly poly blends . Such membranes have been simply prepared by blending SPVC and PAMPS solutions followed by solvent evaporation via casting . Interaction of SPVC with PAMPS was confirmed by different characterization techniques such as Fourier Transform Infra red and Raman scattering spectroscopy in which the two characteristic absorption bands of sulfonic groups appeared at 1093 and 1219cm

@highlight Novel SPVC Poly AMPS blend based polyelectrolyte membranes for direct methanol Fuel Cells..
@highlight Develop cost and performance effective membranes based on sulphonated poly vinyl chloride SPVC poly 2 acrylamido 2 methyl 1 propane sulphonic acid PAMPS blends.
@highlight Interaction of SPVC with PAMPS was confirmed by different characterization techniques such as Fourier Transform Infra red FTIR and Raman scattering spectroscopy TGA SEM and XRD.
@highlight The results show that The IEC of the membranes was found to be 1.25 meq g and maximum water uptake of 75 . Methanol permeability value of 7.710
