 Quantitative determination of endogenous compounds in biological samples has still been challenged by the absence of authentic blank matrix . Alternative strategy of surrogate matrix for preparing reference samples are prevalent due to its low cost and high availability . However the evaluation system of surrogate matrix is not perfect . Herein a novel multifunctional isotopic standards based steroidomics strategy was developed . Isotope labeled standards were used not only as internal standards but also for the evaluation the feasibility of surrogate matrix which improved the accuracy of assessment and could provide a new prospect for the quantitative analysis of endogenous compounds . Based on this approach a detailed optimization from LC separation MS detection to extraction conditions for global steroids in the steroidogenesis was firstly carried out . Characteristics and regularities of steroids in LCMS were summarized to make references for further targeted or untargeted steroidomics study . Then eighteen steroids were quantified with high accuracy and high sensitivity in plasma from four types of cancer patients and healthy subjects using 1 BSA in PBS as surrogate matrix . And multi steroids indexes with the best discriminating ability for lung colorectal breast and gastric cancer in different genders were identified successfully with Student s
