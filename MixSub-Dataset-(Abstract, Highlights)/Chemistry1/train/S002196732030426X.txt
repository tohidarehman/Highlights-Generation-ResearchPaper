 A new class of chitosan derivatives with an isopropylthiourea at the 2 position and various carbamates at the 3 6 positions of the glucosamine skeleton was synthesized by the selective thiocarbamoylation of the 2 amino group . The chiral stationary phases were then prepared by coating the obtained chitosan 2 isopropylthiourea 3 6 dicarbamate derivatives onto silica gel . The enantioseparation property of the chitosan based CSPs was assessed with twelve racemates by high performance liquid chromatography . The CSPs displayed a characteristic enantioseparation power which seemed to be significantly affected by the 3 6 substituents of the glucosamine unit . The chitosan derivatives with the 3 6 diphenylcarbamate except for 2 methylphenylcarbamate possessed higher enantioseparation abilities than those with the 3 6 dicyclohexylcarbamate . Compared to other chitosan derivatives with 2 various substituents and commercialized Chiralcel OD the chitosan 2 isopropylthiourea derivatives revealed a relatively higher enantioselectivity for some racemic compounds .
