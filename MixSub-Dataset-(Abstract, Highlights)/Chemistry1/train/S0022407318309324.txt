 Electromagnetic radiation within the Earth atmosphere system is inherently of three dimensional nature . To quantitatively investigate the various 3D radiative effects in arbitrary spatial resolution the backward Monte Carlo approach provides an efficient and flexible technique . In this paper a new importance sampling scheme of 3D backward Monte Carlo radiative transfer is introduced as Light Estimator Including Polarization Surface Inhomogeneities and Clouds code

@highlight A new variance reduction technique of backward Monte Carlo MC radiative transfer the Separated Near Solar Local Estimation SNSLE method is proposed and implemented in the new 3D MC radiative transfer code called the Light Estimator Including Polarization Surface Inhomogeneities and Clouds LEIPSIC . The LEIPSIC code includes the abilities to handle 3D cloud fields and 2D albedo DEM maps polarized scalar scattering solar thermal radiation radiance irradiance calculation spectrum integration using the REPTRAN approach and parallel computing. The code is published as an opensource project at https gitee.com BinLeipzig LEIPSIC.
@highlight The efficiency and accuracy of the LEIPSIC code are validated against the benchmark results of spectral radiances and broadband irradiances.
@highlight Two applications of the broadband solar 0.32.5 micron cloud radiative forcing CRF is simulated for the typical Arctic scenarios. The 3D and 1D independent column approximation ICA results are compared in order to show the abilities and limits of the commonly used ICA approach.
