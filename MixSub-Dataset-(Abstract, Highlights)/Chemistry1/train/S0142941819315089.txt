 Three different solvent mixtures were used to prepare electrospun membranes based on polylactic acid polyethylene oxide and enzymatic cellulose nanofibers . The materials were characterized from a morphological spectroscopic mechanical and rheological point of view . Furthermore swelling test were performed in order to assess the water uptake of each sample .

@highlight Biodegradable polymers containing nanocellulose were electrospun into membranes.
@highlight A proper choice of solvents is crucial to gather materials with different solubility.
@highlight Three solvent mixtures were tested to allow electrospinnability and filler dispersion.
@highlight Nanocellulose enhanced mechanical properties of membranes up to 500 .
@highlight Nanocellulose increased the water uptake of such membranes up to 350 .
