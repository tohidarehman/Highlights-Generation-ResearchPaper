 As typical structured light beams Laguerre Gaussian beams Bessel beams and Airy beams have attracted great attention for their fascinating features and wide potential applications . Explicit expressions for the electromagnetic field components of these beams obtained from a vector angular spectrum analysis are of particular importance to study a variety of problems involving the propagation transmission and reflection of laser beam as well as light matter interactions . In the present work we first briefly recall the scalar expressions of typical structured light beams including the LaguerreGaussian beams Bessel beams and Airy beams . Then we present the formulae of vector angular spectrum representation under different conditions . Finally we derive in detail the analytical expressions for the electromagnetic field components of these structured light beams and provide some important integral formulae . Additionally distributions of the electromagnetic fields as well as the phase Poynting vector and energy density are displayed and analyzed for these typical structured light beams .
