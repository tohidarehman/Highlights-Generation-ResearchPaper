 Dummy molecularly imprinted microspheres were synthesized by Pickering emulsion polymerization and used as the matrix solid phase dispersion extraction sorbent for sample pre treatment of azole fungicides in fish samples . Alpha 1H imidazole 1 ethanol was used as the fragment dummy template for the imprinting of climbazole clotrimazole and miconazole . The morphology of the microspheres were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption measurements narrow diameter distribution with regular spherical shape and high surface area

@highlight Preparation and evaluation of DMIM for azole fungicides.
@highlight DMI MSPD of CBZ CMZ and MNZ from fish samples using DMIM as the sorbent.
@highlight Good recovery and reproducibility of the developed DMI MSPD HPLC method.
