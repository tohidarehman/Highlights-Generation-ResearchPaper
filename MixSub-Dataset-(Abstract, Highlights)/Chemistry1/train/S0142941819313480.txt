 Addition of carbon nanotubes to Graphene is seen to have synergistic effect as reinforcement to polymer matrix . This is possible as CNTs inhibit stacking of Gr sheets thus providing larger surface area nanophase to get bonded with polymer matrix and providing mechanical support through load sharing and crack growth inhibition . However tube like morphology and high aspect ratio of CNT often lead to entanglement which restricts their effect in exfoliating Gr . The aim of the present study is to investigate the potential of ND in improving the synergistic effect of Gr CNT hybrid as a reinforcement to epoxy matrix . This study utilizes the power of ultrasonication technique which is very simple and scalable for dispersing and incorporating nanofillers into epoxy matrix . Addition of ND to Gr CNT epoxy composite improved the tensile strength from 46 with 0.5wt to 51 with 0.8wt as compared to neat epoxy . While the fracture toughness improved from 140 with 0.5wt to 165 with 0.8wt . Fractured surfaces of composites revealed improved dispersion and strong interfacial interaction with addition of ND to Gr CNT hybrid . NDs attaches to the surface of Gr inhibit the stacking of Gr sheets by restricting stabilization . NDs also help in bridging the ends of CNTs together into long chains thereby increasing the aspect ratio of the fiber like reinforcement . This increases the total available surface area of CNTs and Gr to interact with epoxy matrix improves the overall efficiency of Gr CNT hybrid as a reinforcement resulting into improvement in mechanical properties of the composite structure .
