 The combination of synergistic agent with intumescent flame retardant systems provides a promising way to prepare high performance IFR composites . In this study the effects of the synthetic zeolite 4A in combination with the IFR system consisting of ammonium polyphosphate and tris isocynurate on thermal degradation mechanical properties flame retardancy and char formation of high density polyethylene composites were investigated by limiting oxygen index measurement cone calorimetry scanning electron microscopy and laser Raman spectroscopy . The LOI value of HD FR Z 0.5 composite with an optimum content of 0.5wt . zeolite 4A and 25wt . of total flame retardant reaches 26.3 . A low loading of zeolite 4A can improve the bench scale combustion performance as determined by cone calorimetry and promote the formation of more compact char residue with a highly graphitic structure . However a low loading of zeolite in combination with the IFR system consisting of APP and THEIC produces no significant changes in mechanical performance .
