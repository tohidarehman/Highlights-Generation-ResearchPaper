 In this work the effects of co solvent and pressure on Michaelis constants at ambient temperature were analyzed for the enzymatic peptide hydrolyses of

@highlight Solubility of
@highlight  phenylalanine 
@highlight  nitroanilide was measured in different solvents.
@highlight Pressure decreases Michaelis constant K
@highlight for hydrolyses of HPNA and SPNA.
@highlight TMAO and DMSO decrease K
@highlight of HPNA while they increase K
@highlight of SPNA.
@highlight Co solvent and pressure effects on K
@highlight were predicted correctly with PC SAFT.
@highlight Substrate co solvent molecular interactions activity coefficient determine K
