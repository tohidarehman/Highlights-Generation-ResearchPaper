 The work outlines the synthesis of a new and easy technique to develop sustainable composites of sawdusts reinforced polyester resin composites . For shaping a new approach we have found very rare approach for developing composites with sawdusts of Mahagoni wood

@highlight Sustainable composites of
@highlight reinforced polyester resin composites have been developed.
@highlight Strong and durable composites along with their biodegradability are reported.
@highlight Thermomechanical properties and correlations with material properties were elaborated.
@highlight The pattern of water uptake follows usual Fickian diffusion behavior.
@highlight Developed convincible composites indicate suitable for indoor to outdoor applications.
