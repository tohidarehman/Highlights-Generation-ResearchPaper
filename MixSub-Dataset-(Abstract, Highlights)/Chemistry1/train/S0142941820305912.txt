 Blend hydrophilic polyamide imide sulfonated poly hollow fiber membranes were fabricated for oil water emulsion separation . The structure and performance of the membranes were examined by FESEM analysis N

@highlight Blend PAI SPEEK hollow fiber membranes were fabricated via a NIPS process.
@highlight Higher hydrophilicity and pure water flux were obtained by increasing SPEEK ratio.
@highlight By increasing SPEEK mean pore size and overall porosity of the membrane improved.
@highlight Oil rejection of over 95 was obtained for the blend PAI SPEEK membranes.
@highlight Less fouling was recognized for the blend membrane with ratio of PAI SPEEK 85 15.
