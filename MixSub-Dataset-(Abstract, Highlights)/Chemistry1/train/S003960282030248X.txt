 Magnesium dichloride and titanium tetrachloride are key components of ZieglerNatta polymerization catalysts . We report a systematic computational study at M06 2X def TZVP level thus accounting for dispersion on saturation of magnesium dichloride crystallites by titanium tetrachloride . The crystallites are represented by MgCl

@highlight Saturation of MgCl
@highlight crystallites by TiCl
@highlight has been studied by DFT
@highlight  MgCl
@highlight crystallites favor shapes dominant in 104 surfaces
@highlight Adsorption of TiCl
@highlight reverses the stability order in favor of 110 surfaces
@highlight Immediate surroundings have a marked influence on the adsorption mode
@highlight Octahedral 6 coordination is achievable at all sites including corners defects
