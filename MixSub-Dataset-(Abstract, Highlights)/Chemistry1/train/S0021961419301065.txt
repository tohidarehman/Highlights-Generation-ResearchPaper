 In the context of a comprehensive campaign for the characterisation of transmutation fuels for next generation nuclear reactors the melting behaviour of mixed uranium americium dioxides has been experimentally studied for the first time by laser heating for Am concentrations up to 70mol . under different types of atmospheres . Extensive post melting material characterisations were then performed by X ray absorption spectroscopy and electron microscopy . The melting temperatures observed for the various compositions follow a markedly different trend depending on the experimental atmosphere . Uranium rich samples melt at temperatures significantly lower when they are laser heated in a strongly oxidizing atmosphere compressed air at MPa compared to the melting points registered for the same compositions in an inert environment . This behaviour has been interpreted on the basis of the strong oxidation of such samples in air leading to lower melting temperatures . Thus the melting temperature trend observed in air is characterized in the purely pseudo binary dioxide plane by an apparent maximum melting temperature around 2850K for 0.3 x AmO

@highlight The very high melting temperatures of U Am oxides T 2500K were measured.
@highlight The effect of the oxidation on the melting behaviour was studied.
@highlight Extensive post melting characterizations were performed SEM XAS .
@highlight A CALPHAD thermodynamic modeling of the liquid in the U Am O system was obtained.
