 This is the first of a two part study in which we explore the concept of batch chromatography with recycle lag concluding with the design construction and experimental validation of a prototype that embodies the physical realization of this concept . Moreover the apparatus is simple to set up in particular in view of large scale applications . Here the theory behind batch chromatography with recycle lag is revisited and extended with emphasis on the mathematical formulation and procedure for deriving the single column batch analogue of any variant of multicolumn simulated countercurrent chromatography . By resorting to selected examples namely GE Healthcare Bio sciences three column periodic countercurrent chromatography Novaseps sequential multicolumn chromatography and a few hypothetical multicolumn processes we discuss how the theory can be operationalized . Finally we conclude by describing the design of a device or apparatusan eluate recycling device to physically realize the proposed concept . The ERD implements an approximate first in first out method for organizing and manipulating the to be recycled fractions of eluate collected from the chromatography column where the oldest amount fluid or head of the fraction is the first to exit and be recycled to the column .
