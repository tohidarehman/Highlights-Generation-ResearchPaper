 Aldehydes originating from malt play an important role in beer flavour deterioration . In order to better understand the influence of malting process on beer staling it is necessary to acquire a reliable analytical methodology for determination of beer staling aldehydes in malt . Therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate extraction parameters which allow quantification of beer staling aldehydes present in pale malts . The method was validated with respect to linearity

@highlight Evaluating sample preparation for a fast quantification of aldehydes in pale malts.
@highlight Malting technology influences the content of beer staling aldehydes in pale malts.
@highlight Quantity of beer staling aldehydes introduced into the brewing could be controlled.
